3511,Origins of the 1918 Pandemic: Revisiting the Swine “Mixing Vessel” Hypothesis,2018-07-26,"How influenza A viruses host-jump from animal reservoir species to humans, which can initiate global pandemics, is a central question in pathogen evolution. The zoonotic and spatial origins of the influenza virus associated with the “Spanish flu” pandemic of 1918 have been debated for decades. Outbreaks of respiratory disease in US swine occurred concurrently with disease in humans, raising the possibility that the 1918 virus originated in pigs. Swine also were proposed as “mixing vessel” intermediary hosts between birds and humans during the 1957 Asian and 1968 Hong Kong pandemics. Swine have presented an attractive explanation for how avian viruses overcome the substantial evolutionary barriers presented by different cellular environments in humans and birds. However, key assumptions underpinning the swine mixing-vessel model of pandemic emergence have been challenged in light of new evidence. Increased surveillance in swine has revealed that human-to-swine transmission actually occurs far more frequently than the reverse, and there is no empirical evidence that swine played a role in the emergence of human influenza in 1918, 1957, or 1968. Swine-to-human transmission occurs periodically and can trigger pandemics, as in 2009. But swine are not necessary to mediate the establishment of avian viruses in humans, which invites new perspectives on the evolutionary processes underlying pandemic emergence.","Nelson, Martha I; Worobey, Michael",Am J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6269246/,253
5257,Modeling the Economic Impact of Pandemic Influenza: A Case Study in Turkey,2008-10-14,"• BACKGROUND: Different viruses have been reported to be involved in retinal diseases in animalsystems. In humans, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus have been found to cause retinal disease. Most of the studied viruses are neurotropic. In this study, the in vitro susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEC) to representative members of different groups of human pathogenic viruses was investigated. • METHODS: Early cultures of RPE C — after two or three passages — were infected with the following viruses: herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus types 1 and 7, measles virus, parainfluenza virus and coxsackie virus B3. • RESULTS: Cultures of RPE C could be infected with neurotropic viruses like HSV or measles virus as well as with typical respiratory viruses like parainfluenza or adenoviruses. Coxsackievirus, an enterovirus, replicated as well as human CMV whereas EBV and HHV-6, two lymphotropic viruses, failed to infect RPE. • CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a variety of viruses, including those causing rather common illnesses, might be capable of inducing retinal lesions under certain circumstances due to haematogenous spread during the course of viraemia.","Huemer, Hartwig P.; Larcher, Clara; Kirchebner, Werner; Klingenschmid, Josef; Göttinger, Wolfgang; Irschick, Eveline U.",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088335/,253

10877,Visiting Sub-Interships in Wake of the Covid-19 Crisis: An Opportunity for Improvement,2020-04-30,"The two-species symbiotic contact process (2SCP) is a stochastic process in which each vertex of a graph may be vacant or host at most one individual of each species. Vertices with both species have a reduced death rate, representing a symbiotic interaction, while the dynamics evolves according to the standard (single species) contact process rules otherwise. We investigate the role of dynamical correlations on the 2SCP on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks using pairwise mean-field theory. This approach is compared with the ordinary one-site theory and stochastic simulations. We show that our approach significantly outperforms the one-site theory. In particular, the stationary state of the 2SCP model on random regular networks is very accurately reproduced by the pairwise mean-field, even for relatively small values of vertex degree, where expressive deviations of the standard mean-field are observed. The pairwise approach is also able to capture the transition points accurately for heterogeneous networks and provides rich phase diagrams with transitions not predicted by the one-site method. Our theoretical results are corroborated by extensive numerical simulations.","de Oliveira, Marcelo M.; Alves, Sidiney G.; Ferreira, Silvio C.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217493/,253

12606,Offline World: the Internet as Social Infrastructure among the Unconnected in Quasi-Rural Illinois,2020-08-21,"RNA acts as an immunostimulatory molecule in the innate immune system to activate nucleic acid sensors. It functions as an intermediate, conveying genetic information to control inflammatory responses. A key mechanism for RNA sensing is discriminating self from non-self nucleic acids to initiate antiviral responses reliably, including the expression of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes. Another important aspect of the RNA-mediated inflammatory response is posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, where RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have essential roles in various RNA metabolisms, including splicing, nuclear export, modification, and translation and mRNA degradation. Recent evidence suggests that the control of mRNA stability is closely involved in signal transduction and orchestrates immune responses. In this study, we review the current understanding of how RNA is sensed by host RNA sensing machinery and discuss self/non-self-discrimination in innate immunity focusing on mammalian species. Finally, we discuss how posttranscriptional regulation by RBPs shape immune reactions.","Uehata, Takuya; Takeuchi, Osamu",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7407594/,253

17560,Implementation of Flipgrid as a Self-Reflection Tool for Student Engagement– A Pilot Study,2020-12-02,"The need for highly effective vaccines that induce robust and long-lasting immunity has never been more apparent. However, for reasons that are still poorly understood, immune responses to vaccination are highly variable between different individuals and different populations. Furthermore, vaccine immunogenicity is frequently suboptimal in the very populations who are at most risk from infectious disease, including infants, the elderly, and those living in low-income and middle-income countries. Although many factors have the potential to influence vaccine immunogenicity and therefore vaccine effectiveness, increasing evidence from clinical studies and animal models now suggests that the composition and function of the gut microbiota are crucial factors modulating immune responses to vaccination. In this Review, we synthesize this evidence, discuss the immunological mechanisms that potentially mediate these effects and consider the potential of microbiota-targeted interventions to optimize vaccine effectiveness.","Lynn, David J.; Benson, Saoirse C.; Lynn, Miriam A.; Pulendran, Bali",Nat Rev Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8127454/,253
20350,Impact of cattle on the abundance of indoor and outdoor resting malaria vectors in southern Malawi,2021-08-26,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP), upon proteolytic degradation, forms aggregates of amyloid β (Aβ) and plaques in the brain, which are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Cathepsin B is a cysteine protease enzyme that catalyzes the proteolytic degradation of APP in the brain. Thus, cathepsin B inhibition is a crucial therapeutic aspect for the discovery of new anti-Alzheimer’s drugs. In this study, we have employed mixed-feature ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) by integrating pharmacophore mapping, docking, and molecular dynamics to detect small, potent molecules that act as cathepsin B inhibitors. The LBVS model was generated by using hydrophobic (HY), hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), and hydrogen bond donor (HBD) features, using a dataset of 24 known cathepsin B inhibitors of both natural and synthetic origins. A validated eight-feature pharmacophore hypothesis (Hypo III) was utilized to screen the Maybridge chemical database. The docking score, MM-PBSA, and MM-GBSA methodology was applied to prioritize the lead compounds as virtual screening hits. These compounds share a common amide scaffold, and showed important interactions with Gln23, Cys29, His110, His111, Glu122, His199, and Trp221. The identified inhibitors were further evaluated for cathepsin-B-inhibitory activity. Our study suggests that pyridine, acetamide, and benzohydrazide compounds could be used as a starting point for the development of novel therapeutics.","Chitranshi, Nitin; Kumar, Ashutosh; Sheriff, Samran; Gupta, Veer; Godinez, Angela; Saks, Danit; Sarkar, Soumalya; Shen, Ting; Mirzaei, Mehdi; Basavarajappa, Devaraj; Abyadeh, Morteza; Singh, Sachin K.; Dua, Kamal; Zhang, Kam Y.

23365,Animal Reservoirs: Harboring the Next Pandemic,2008-09-01,"Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) define medical conditions of acute respiratory insufficiency deriving from direct and indirect damage of the alveolar parenchyma and often associated with multiorgan dysfunction (MODS). As a rule, intensive care is based on mechanical ventilation often requiring high doses of sedatives and narcotics. Despite major progress in intensive care medicine the rate of mortality is still very high. Whereas in the past the level of medical progress has been rated based on the mortality rate alone, the many negative somatic and psychological sequelae in long-term-survivors of ARDS are only now being appreciated. From a perspective of C/L psychiatry persisting cognitive dysfunctions, anxiety and mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) in their negative impact on health-related quality of life are intensively investigated. In the etiopathogenesis of PTSD associated with ALI/ARDS, many influences have to be discussed, e.g., increases in CO(2) triggering panic affects, a mismatch of norepinephric overstimulation and cortisol insufficiency, negative effects of high doses of benzodiazepines resulting in oversedation, prolonged phases of weaning and more frequent states of delirium. Consolidation and retrieval of traumatic memories of the ICU stay are influenced by complex factors. From a clinical point of view prophylactic stress doses of hydrocortisone may reduce the major risk of PTSD associated with ALI / ARDS.","Hans-Peter, Kapfhammer",Psychosom Konsiliarpsychiatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104133/,253
25363,Becoming a Successful Corporate Communication Practitioner in International Business Consultancy,2015-03-18,"Efficient translation of basic vaccine research into clinical therapies greatly depends upon the availability of appropriate animal models. Testing novel vaccine candidates in animal models is a critical step in the development of modern vaccines. Animal models are being used to assess the quality and quantity of the immune response, to identify the optimal route of delivery and formulation, to determine protection from infection and disease transmission, and to evaluate the safety and toxicity of the vaccine formulation. Animal models help to make the translation from basic research to clinical application, and they often allow prediction of the vaccine potential, which helps in predicting the financial risks for vaccine manufacturers. Choosing an appropriate animal model has become increasingly important for the field, as each model has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this review, the criteria for selecting the right animal model, the advantages and disadvantages of various animal models, as well as the future needs for animal models are being discussed.","Kiros, Tadele G.; Levast, Benoît; Auray, Gaël; Strom, Stacy; van Kessel, Jill; Gerdts, Volker",Innovation in Vaccinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121941/,253

26899,Culture and decision making,2016-09-14,"Gene therapy is the transfer of therapeutic genes, via gene transfer vectors, into patients for therapeutic purposes. Different gene therapy strategies are being pursued, including long-term gene correction of monogenetic diseases, eradication of tumor cells in cancer patients, or genetic vaccination for infectious diseases. Bispecific antibodies and gene therapy are connected in two ways. First, bispecific antibodies are tools of interest for the development of targeted gene transfer vectors. Different gene therapy strategies require different vectors, frequently replication-ablated viruses. Similar to the role of antibody engineering in antibody therapy, the engineering of gene transfer vectors has become key to the implementation of genetic therapies. Cytoablative cancer gene therapy and efficient genetic vaccination, for example, depend on vectors that are targeted to cancer cells and antigen-presenting cells, respectively, in order to avoid side effects and vector sequestration. To this end, bispecific antibodies have been engineered as adapters that link the vector to a specific molecule on the targeted cell and at the same time block the interaction with the native virus receptor. Different formats of bispecific antibodies and related molecules have been developed and succeeded in re-directing vectors to target cells in vitro and in vivo. These adapters also improved gene therapies in animal models. Second, gene transfer is a promising tool for delivery of bispecific antibodies to patients. Therefore, vectors can be injected directly into patients for antibody gene transfer, or cells isolated from patients can be genetically modified in vitro and then re-injected for in vivo antibody production. Genetic antibody delivery, compared with standard antibody injection, can be advantageous with respect to achieving persistent antibody titers or effective antibody biodistribution in patients. Initial studies have shown antibody production and therapeutic activity in animal models, setting the stage for more widespread investigations. Moreover, gene therapy can enable novel therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies by facilitating the delivery of membrane associated or intracellular antibody formats.","Nettelbeck, Dirk M.",Bispecific Antibodies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123931/,253

One of the most effective ways to protect people from being infected by these diseases is through vaccination. However, due to various resource constraints, vaccinating all the people in a community is not practical. Therefore, targeted vaccination, which vaccinates a small group of people, is an alternative approach to contain infectious diseases. Since many infectious diseases spread among people by droplet transmission within a certain range, we deploy a wireless sensor system in a high school to collect contacts happened within the disease transmission distance. Based on the collected traces, a graph is constructed to model the disease propagation, and a new metric (called connectivity centrality) is presented to find the important nodes in the constructed graph for disease containment. Connectivity centrality considers both a node’s local and global effect to measure its importance in disease propagation. Centrality based algorithms are presented and further enhanced by exploiting the information of the known infected nodes, which can be detected during targeted vaccination.

Originating in the Wuhan district of China, which has reportedly been declared free of it now, the rest of the world continues to struggle with its severity and spread. While a lot of scientific publications and clinical data are available, newer clinical investigations and experiences continue to evolve, thereby depicting the dynamic nature of the disease and the knowledge around it. Researchers and clinical professionals continue to collect scientific information, clinical data, and evidence to help build a knowledge pool and guidance for the health care professionals to manage those affected with this pandemic disease. As significant and new data emerge, a lot of already available information gets confirmed and updated, while some of it also getting rejected or disapproved. In this article, we aim to put together the scientific and clinical information that is proven so far and the areas where more data or evidence is needed before a clear understanding can be achieved and guidance can be developed.","Gandhi, Ajay; Görlinger, Klaus",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7416211/,253
38481,The effects of rejecting aid on recipients’ reputations: Evidence from natural disaster responses,2020-08-30,"INTRODUCTION: Double valve replacement (DVR) with a mechanical prosthesis is associated with a higher risk of mortality. We planned to study the survival rate, early and late mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients undergoing DVR for rheumatic heart disease, with various generations of prosthetic valves ranging from ball in cage to bileaflet prosthesis and tilting disc valves. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: We followed up 277 patients with rheumatic heart disease who underwent DVR between August 1999 and November 2009, retrospectively, at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram. Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were followed up for a minimum period of 10 years, and the follow-up period varied between 10 and 20 years. Eighteen patients were lost to follow-up after the surgery and could not be contacted. Their data was included till the time they appeared for follow-up last, for survival analysis. Survival analysis was carried out using the life table method to calculate the freedom from reoperation, survival rates and freedom from MACCE at 1 year, 5 years and 10 years post-DVR. RESULTS: The median duration of hospital stay was 8 days. The number of patients with stroke was 11 (4.26%), 21 (8.7%) and 29 (12%) at the end of 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively. A total of 5 (2%) patients underwent reoperation by the end of 10 years. Seven patients died either in hospital or in the first 30 days following operation, making the early mortality 2.5%. At the end of 1 year, a total of 16 patients (5.8%) died. The mortality at the end of 5 years was 6.8% (19 patients), and at the end of 10 years, it was 7.2% (20 patients). The survival rate of the study population was 94.9%, 93.02% and 93.02% at the completion of 1 year, 5 years and 10 years, respectively. The freedom from MACCE was 93.8%, 88.6% and 85% at 1 year, 5 years and 10 years, respectively. The freedom from re-operation was 98% at 10 years. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an overall survival time of 226.3 months in the entire study population. The mean survival time in males was 227.5 months and in females was 206.3 months, with no statistically significant difference between the two. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed an association with mortality when DVR was combined with concomitant tricuspid valve repair procedures, with an odds ratio of 4.5 (p value 0.005). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed an association with mortality when tricuspid valve procedures were combined with DVR with an odds ratio of 5.25 (p value 0.003). CONCLUSION: The operative mortality and morbidity for DVR have been significantly reduced with advancements in operative techniques, myocardial preservation and postoperative care. Patients can have an improved functional status following surgery, with good rates of freedom from re-operation and MACCE.","Pillai, Vivek Velayudhan; Sreekantan, Renjith; Nemani, Nayana; Karunakaran, Jayakumar",Indian J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7451783/,253

Toward this end, a novel outdoor disinfection system is designed for effective sanitization of long stretches of highways, market places, shopping malls, etc., where there are large traffic and high chances of spreading of the virus. The disinfection system utilizes available tractor powered road tankers of municipal houses, and it has specific features for maximum sanitization coverage. This is achieved through a distributed spraying nozzle mounted around the tank along with two extendable hand sprayers with flexible hoses. The effectiveness of the spray system is studied using an image processing technique. The spray cloud is illuminated by a double-pulsed Nd:YAG laser, and the images are captured using a Nikon D3300 DSLR camera. The average droplet size of the spray coming out from the nozzle is measured, and finally, the area of influence of the spray is obtained from a statistical analysis.","Chatterjee, Dipankar; Dutta, Samik; Mondal, Bittagopal; Hirani, Harish",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471563/,253

To counteract on this situation several approved drugs including anti-malarial (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine), and few anti-viral (remdesvir) agents are choice of treatment for COVID-19. However, these agents suffer from certain limitation in their uses and pointed that there is no specific treatment or vaccine available to counter this contagious disease. Hence, there is urgent requirement to find a specific cure for the disease. In this view, there are several ongoing clinical trials of both western and traditional medicines. In present study, phytochemicals from Camellia sinensis were retrieved from the database and identified based on their ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) against SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Camellia sinensis entails of a massive number of phytochemicals with a good source of polyphenols such as Catechin, Epicatechin, Epigallocatechin and (–)-Epigallocatechin gallate. Molecular docking was performed using the GLIDE docking module of Schrodinger Suite software. The analysis displayed docking score for the five polyphenols i.e. theaflavin (− 8.701), 1-O-caffeoylquinic acid (− 7.795), Genistein (− 7.168), Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (− 6.282) and Ethyl trans-caffeate (− 5.356). Interestingly, theaflavin and Epigallocatechin 3-gallate have not revealed any side effects. These polyphenolic compounds had a strong binding affinity with hydrogen bonds and a good drug-likeness score. Therefore, Camellia sinensis could be the beneficial option in the prophylaxis of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Kanbarkar, Nikita; Mishra, Sanjay",ADV TRADIT MED (ADTM),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7538275/,253

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore psychiatrists’ opinions about the potential impact innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice METHODS: In Spring 2019, we conducted a web-based survey of 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries worldwide. The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (“comments”) to three open-ended questions in the survey. RESULTS: Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that ‘man and machine’ would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents timely information on psychiatrists’ views about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice. Psychiatrists expressed divergent views about the value and impact of future technology with worrying omissions about practice guidelines, and ethical and regulatory issues.","Blease, C; Locher, C; Leon-Carlyle, M; Doraiswamy, M",Digit Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7597571/,253

42297,How Crisis Reveals the Structures of Practices,2020-10-25,"INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes self-management education is an essential component of type 2 diabetes care that is traditionally delivered in a face-to-face setting. In response to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, innovative solutions are urgently needed, allowing provision of self-management education that can be delivered in compliance with social distancing policies. Innovations that are self-service and can deliver education efficiently at low cost are particularly appealing to healthcare providers and commissioners. METHODS: We aimed to evaluate user uptake, dropout, acceptability, satisfaction, perceived short-term knowledge gain and health benefits/behaviour changes in relation to a free massive open online course (MOOC) in diabetes self-management education, created and delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. This course, focusing on addressing knowledge and self-management needs for people with type 2 diabetes, made use of online interactive content including expert and patient videos, quizzes, moderated discussion boards and live social media that encouraged personal reflection and goal setting. User expectations and experiences were explored via survey-based methods. Here, we present our experience of developing the course and describe users’ experiences. RESULTS: 1991 users registered interest in the course over a 2-week period, with 976 users starting the course and 640 (65.6%) users completing the course in full. Users engaged well, finding the course educational, user-friendly and motivating, demonstrating high completion rates and user satisfaction. A statistically significant (p<0.001) increase in self-reported self-management ability and health knowledge was observed among participants with type 2 diabetes. DISCUSSION: MOOCs in type 2 diabetes self-management education have great potential for delivering education efficiently at scale and low cost. Although engagement can be limited by digital literacy, benefits include flexible and remote access to up-to-date, evidence-based education delivered by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.","Mackenzie, Scott C; Cumming, Kirsten M; Garrell, David; Brodie, Doogie; Wilson, Lyn; Mehar, Salma; Cunningham, Scott G; Bickerton, Alex; Wake, Deborah J",BMJ Innov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7670558/,253

43324,Everyday Remembering During a Global Pandemic in Caring Dyads,2020-12-16,"BACKGROUND: Clinical decision-making of invasive high-intensity care for critically ill stage IV cancer patients in the emergency department (ED) is challenging. A reliable and clinically available prognostic score for advanced cancer patients with septic shock presented at ED is essential to improve the quality of intensive care unit care. This study aimed to develop a new prognostic score for advanced solid cancer patients with septic shock available early in the ED and to compare the performance to the previous severity scores. METHODS: This multi-center, prospective cohort study included consecutive adult septic shock patients with stage IV solid cancer. A new scoring system for 28-day mortality was developed and validated using the data of development (January 2016 to December 2017; n = 469) and validation sets (January 2018 to June 2019; n = 428). The developed score’s performance was compared to that of the previous severity scores. RESULTS: New scoring system for 28-day mortality was based on six variables (score range, 0–8): vital signs at ED presentation (respiratory rate, body temperature, and altered mentation), lung cancer type, and two laboratory values (lactate and albumin) in septic shock (VitaL CLASS). The C-statistic of the VitaL CLASS score was 0.808 in the development set and 0.736 in the validation set, that is superior to that of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (0.656, p = 0.01) and similar to that of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (0.682, p = 0.08). This score could identify 41% of patients with a low-risk group (observed 28-day mortality, 10.3%) and 7% of patients with a high-risk group (observed 28-day mortality, 73.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The VitaL CLASS score could be used for both risk stratification and as part of a shared clinical decision-making strategy for stage IV solid cancer patients with septic shock admitting at ED within several hours.

In this retrospective study, we investigated the microbiological characteristics and antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli clinical isolates obtained from liver cirrhosis patients suffering from nosocomial SBP. Our results showed that extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli accounted for 47% of the cases, while 62% of the isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. ESBL-producing and MDR isolates showed high incidences of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, but they displayed susceptibility to carbapenems, β-lactamase inhibitors, and aminoglycosides. Importantly, liver cirrhosis patients with MDR E. coli SBP showed a significantly higher death rate than patients with non-MDR infections (P = 0.021). The 30-day mortality of nosocomial SBP was independently correlated with female gender [odds ratio (OR) = 5.200, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.194–22.642], liver failure (OR = 9.609, 95% CI = 1.914–48.225), hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 8.176, 95% CI = 2.065–32.364), hepatic encephalopathy (OR = 8.176, 95% CI = 2.065–32.364), model of end-stage liver disease score (OR = 1.191, 95% CI = 1.053–1.346), white blood cell count (OR = 0.847, 95% CI = 0.737–0.973), and ascites polymorphonuclear (OR = 95.903, 95% CI = 3.410–2697.356). In conclusion, third-generation cephalosporins may be inappropriate for empiric treatment of nosocomial SBP caused by E. coli, due to the widespread presence of ESBLs and high incidence of MDR pathogens.","Tu, Bo; Zhang, Yuening; Bi, Jingfeng; Xu, Zhe; Shi, Lei; Zhang, Xin; Zhao, Peng; Zhang, Dawei; Yang, Guang; Qin, Enqiang",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7769054/,253

METHODS: We analyzed 259 patients admitted to our academic medical center during a three month period with confirmed COVID-19. Clinical data was extracted via chart review and lab results within the first 24 hours of admission were extracted directly from electronic medical records. Patients were divided in two groups based upon the highest level of supplemental oxygen (O2) required during hospitalization: severe COVID-19 (high flow O2, non-invasive, or invasive mechanical ventilation) and non-severe COVID-19 (low flow O2 or no supplemental O2). SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC) was used for statistical analyses. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and the Student’s t-test for continuous variables were used to compare demographics, baseline comorbidities, and clinical data between the severe and non-severe groups. Table 1: Demographics [Image: see text] RESULTS: Of 259 patients, 166 (64%) had non-severe disease, and 93 (36%) severe disease; median age [IQR] was 62 [51,73]. There were 138(53%) males and 75 (29%) Hispanics. Among non-Hispanics,124(48%) were White, 48(19%) African Americans, and 12(5%) other races. Sixty (23%) were admitted from a nursing facility and the in-hospital mortality rate was 15% (38/259). Severe COVID-19 was associated with older age (p=0.02), admission from nursing facility (p=0.009), increased BMI (p=0.03), diabetes mellitus (p=0.0002), and COPD (p=0.03). At the time of presentation, severe COVID-19 was associated with tachypnea, hypoxia, hypotension (all p< 0.0001), elevated BUN (p=0.002) and AST (p=0.001), and acute or chronic kidney injury (p=0.01).

44276,"Child Sex Trafficking: Strategies for Identification, Counseling, and Advocacy",2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID‐19) infection emerged in Wuhan, China, establishing itself as a deadly pathogen leading to an ongoing pandemic. The incidence of co-infection of COVID-19 and Influenza has not been widely reported. Both infections have been known to share similar mechanisms of transmission, however currently, there is no evidence regarding the relationship between co-infection between this viruses and worsening outcomes. Once social distancing measures are eased, and daily activities resumed, there is a possibility for a second wave of cases. Given the incidence of influenza is higher during winter, a higher co-infection rate is expected in these months. METHODS: In this study, the aim was to assess the association of influenza co-infection with outcomes in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a hospital-based case-control study in Bronx, New York. 19 patients with Influenza co-infection were found in total. 1 patient did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. Charts were reviewed from 18 confirmed cases of influenza and COVID-19 patients. Controls were selected from the remaining pool of patients with COVID-19 in the same period. Cases were matched for age, sex and underlying comorbidities (Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, HIV status, immunocompromised state other than HIV). The measured outcomes were: in-hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, need for vasopressors and need for renal replacement therapy. For each outcome, Chi Square test and Odds ratio were obtained. RESULTS: After statistical analysis, no significative difference was found in the following variables: in-hospital mortality [Odds ratio (OR) 0.769; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.185–3.191; p value= 0.717], need for mechanical ventilation (OR 1.3; 95% CI: 0.313–5.393; p value= 0.717), need for vasopressors (OR 1.923; 95% CI: 0.383–9.646; p value= 0.423), need for renal replacement therapy (OR 1.0; 95% CI: 0.208–4.814; p value= 1.0).

44906,Determinants of consumer attitudes and re-purchase intentions toward direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands,2021-01-25,"In recent years, the number of smartphone users has increased dramatically. These users download millions of apps and use them for various services. Due to the significant demand for mobile apps, developers often seek faster development methods and more effective tools and techniques to generate these apps. Many of these apps are location-based apps in which users receive services based on their geographical location. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for the automatic generation of Android location-based mobile apps. Our framework, called ALBA, consists of a domain-specific modeling language, a modeling tool, and a plugin which includes model to code transformations. The modeling tool enables a novice designer to model a location-based app. The model is validated against the predefined constraints and the editor prevents creating invalid models. The designer uses the plugin to generate the Android code of the app. The evaluation of our work is two fold. First, to evaluate the generalizability of the ALBA framework, we conducted an experiment which includes the generation of four industrial location-based apps. Second, to evaluate the usability and quality of both the framework and the generated apps, we conducted a case study consists of three experiments. The results of the evaluation are promising both in terms of the applicability of the framework and the quality of the generated apps.","Gharaat, Mohammadali; Sharbaf, Mohammadreza; Zamani, Bahman; Hamou-Lhadj, Abdelwahab",Autom Softw Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7818077/,253

Accepted fraud triangle in management and business with the corners; Negative Pressure, Unethical Rationalization, Unsufficient Control-Auditing should be redesign again as Fraud Quadrangle with a new corner named “Moral Erosion”. It’s time to talk about “Behavioral Fraud”, which is new but trending research area in academia. Accountants and auditors usually don’t like to talk about something out numbers, standards, laws like “behavioral”. And it is also completely a different specialization. Accountants, auditors adhere to laws and standards that there are no emotions and initiatives in their world however they have been talking about interdisciplinary issues such as biological risk, climate change, artificial intelligence recently. “Behavioral Fraud” is a new area that needs to be focused on and discussed by researchers in the specialization of accounting, auditing, computer science, auditing law, human resources and statistics. Behavioral Fraud will also lead new discussions on a static and dynamic approaches to leveraging biometrics for fraud detection. New Fraud Quadrangle will help us why some people like and succeed to cheat while others don’t or can’t in the same conditions.","Çalıyurt, Kıymet Tunca","Ethics and Sustainability in Accounting and Finance, Volume II",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972118/,253

The objective of this study is to maximize the oil production curve through an optimized use of the outsourced fleet. Specific features of this scenario are considered, such as technical constraints of each vessel, the availability of the vessels, materials for connection, and the end of the previous phase, called completion. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed considering several constraints that structure this complex situation, among which a relevant characteristic of the problem: the increase of the production curve using injection wells to fight the natural decline of producing wells over time. This mathematical model was tested in small computational instances, showing adequate behavior, which demonstrates that it faithfully represents the situation portrayed and can be used, combined with more advanced computational resources, to achieve better results.","Bassi, Sérgio; Ronconi, Debora Pretti",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7975420/,253

Games controlled by electroencephalography (EEG), a specific case of BCI technology, benefit from both areas, since they can be played by virtually any person regardless of physical condition, can be applied in numerous serious and entertainment contexts, and are ludic by nature. However, they also share the same challenges of design and development from both fields, especially since they demand numerous specific and specialized knowledge for their development. In this sense, this work presents a model for games using EEG-based BCI controls. The proposed model is intended to help researchers describe, compare and develop new EEG-controlled games by instantiating its abstract and functional components using concepts from the fields of BCI and games. A group of EEG-controlled games from the literature was selected to demonstrate the usefulness and representativeness of the model. The demonstration showed that an overview classification and the details of the selected games were able to be described using the model and its components.","Vasiljevic, Gabriel Alves Mendes; de Miranda, Leonardo Cunha",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978586/,253

A good educational system produces good citizens. The nations which compromise their education live far behind in the race of development. The advancement of ICT has brought drastic positive changes in the educational system and made the knowledge available and accessible from everywhere. The E-Learning system is also prevailing in most modern societies, and a lot of people who are not able to attend regular classes are getting benefit from it. However, it cannot be the supplement of traditional face-to-face learning mechanisms. The blend of the traditional educational system with E-Learning is very fruitful, and a lot of developed societies are getting its benefit. Recently, the rapid growth of COVID-19 all over the world has put the traditional education system to halt. The policy of lockdown and isolation has put billions of children away from school. Most governments have officially declared school closure to prevent the widespread of COVID-19. In such a situation, online learning is the only solution to run the vehicle of the educational system. However, the current E-Learning infrastructure was not expecting this rapid paradigm shift from the traditional educational system toward E-Learning. Therefore, a lot of issues are reported daily such as Internet connectivity, security breaches, conducting the assessment, etc. In this paper, we will provide the impact of COVID-19 on the educational system worldwide and the strategies that might be useful to fill the gap created by school closure during COVID-19.","Khalil, Muhammad Ibrahim; Humayun, Mamoona; Jhanjhi, N.

It also argues that though centralisation of power has been justified by political elites as an exception to the liberal constitutional paradigm and not as an abandoning of the same, that centralisation has become a normal and essential feature of constitutional praxis in plurinational states aimed at protecting the dominant community’s status in the state. This is in its totality shows a process whereby the constitution and laws beholden to the dominant community are instumentalised in the normalisation of what would be otherwise considered to be abnormal.","Guruparan, Kumaravadivel",Constitutionalism Under Extreme Conditions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981415/,253

Despite government efforts and policies to promote physiologic and respectful birth since 2007, the technocratic model of childbirth remains hegemonic. However, strong childbirth activists, together with groups of health professionals who seek change, are advocating for a law on respectful childbirth, directing innovative initiatives within maternities, and positioning home birth as a valid option that needs to be legalized and reimbursed by health insurance. The chapter describes and reflects on these recent changes in the landscape of childbirth in Chile, arguing they might bring winds of change and reverse the excessive medicalization of birth. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, activist and health professionals were alerted to how recent improvements in maternity care were being threatened and were pushing to accelerate a deep discussion on birth territories and alternatives to hospital. We are confident that after the passing of the pandemic, the humanistic winds of change in Chile will continue to blow with renewed momentum.","Sadler, Michelle; Leiva, Gonzalo; Gómez, Ricardo",Sustainable Birth in Disruptive Times,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982970/,253

The vehicle is a calibrated medium-scale micro-founded macroeconomic model. Departing from 2008, our simulations show that the adopted economic adjustment program (the fiscal austerity mix combined with the fiscal and monetary assistance provided by the EU, ECB and IMF), jointly with the observed deterioration in institutional quality (the degree of protection of property rights) can explain most (around 22% of GDP) of the cumulative loss in GDP in the data (around 26% of GDP) between 2008 and 2016. In particular, the economic adjustment program can explain a fall of around 12%, while the deterioration in property rights accounts for another 10%. Counterfactual simulations, on the other hand, show that this loss could have been around 9% only, if the country had followed a different fiscal policy mix; if the degree of product marker liberalization was closer to that in the core euro zone countries; and, above all, if institutional quality in Greece had simply remained at its pre-crisis level. On the other hand, in the absence of the official fiscal bailouts, the depression would be much deeper, while, the accommodative role played by the quantitative policies of the ECB has been vital to the Greek economy. These results can be useful in the face of the ongoing covid-19 crisis.

Data on clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in US population are limited. Thus, we aim to determine the clinical characteristics and risk factors for in-hospital mortality from COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Single-network hospitals in Pennsylvania state. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hospitalised from 1 March to 31 May 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were complications, such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS: Of 283 patients, 19.4% were non-survivors. The mean age of all patients was 64.1±15.9 years. 56.2% were male and 50.2% were white. Several factors were identified from our adjusted multivariate analyses to be associated with in-hospital mortality: increasing age (per 1-year increment; OR 1.07 (1.045 to 1.105)), hypoxia (oxygen saturation <95%; OR 4.630 (1.934 to 1.111)), opacity/infiltrate on imaging (OR 3.077 (1.276 to 7.407)), leucocytosis (white blood cell >10 (109/µL); OR 2.732 (1.412 to 5.263)), ferritin >336 ng/mL (OR 4.016 (1.195 to 13.514)), lactate dehydrogenase >200 U/L (OR 7.752 (1.639 to 37.037)), procalcitonin >0.25 ng/mL (OR 2.404 (1.011 to 5.714)), troponin I >0.03 ng/mL (OR 2.242 (1.080 to 4.673)), need for advanced oxygen support other than simple nasal cannula (OR 4.608–13.889 (2.053 to 31.250)), intensive care unit admission/transfer (OR 13.699 (6.135 to 30.303)), renal replacement therapy (OR 21.277 (5.025 to 90.909)), need for vasopressor (OR 22.222 (9.434 to 52.632)), ARDS (OR 23.810 (10.204 to 55.556)), respiratory acidosis (OR 7.042 (2.915 to 16.949)), and AKI (OR 3.571 (1.715 to 7.407)).

Pupils were faced with the task to organize learning and the use of learning time more independently. The children were primarily supported by parents in aspects of organization and learning content. Based on previous research on parental homework support and educational partnerships, it can be assumed that both the structuring and process-related learning support provided by parents depends on socio-demographic characteristics of the family, but is also associated with characteristics of the child (e.g., age, learning behavior) and the perceived school learning support (teacher commitment, level of requirements). These associations were investigated by regression analysis on the basis of data from a standardized online survey with N = 6685 parents of children at secondary schools in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The findings speak in favor of adaptive learning support for parents, which is less intensive for older and female students with favorable learning behavior than for younger and male students with unfavorable learning behavior. School-based learning guidance also contributes to the prediction of parental behavior, with committed teacher behavior contributing to increased support for the child, especially in families with lower school leaving certificates of (surveyed) parents.","Sander, Andreas; Schäfer, Laura; van Ophuysen, Stefanie",Z Erziehwiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8047560/,253

As a tertiary cancer centre, offering major oesophageal and hepatobiliary surgery we were concerned on how the C-19 pandemic would affect our patients. Elective operating was split between our trust and a local private provider as a “clean” site; and an official trust C-19 screening programme started on 24th April. METHODS: Retrospectively the electronic theatre record was searched for patients undergoing a non-emergency cancer operation between March & May 2020. The data was cross-referenced with investigations and mortality to ascertain swab results (pre-operatively and 30 days postoperatively) and mortality. RESULTS: During the 3 months at the height of the pandemic 596 non-emergency cancer operations took place, (compared with 986 in the same time-frame from 2019). In March 6 of 281, April 98 of 141 and May 166 of 175 patients undergoing an operation had a pre-operative swab, with only 6 screening swabs positive (5 in April, 1 in May). In total 4 patients died, only 1 had a positive C-19 test (patient had not been screened pre-operatively). CONCLUSION: Non-emergency cancer surgery was impacted but Screening was successfully implemented in April and by May 95% of patients underwent testing. Six patients were tested positive post-operatively with only one deceased which appears to show a lower mortality rate than currently quoted within the literature. This adds further evidence that with comprehensive screening, cancer surgery can safely take place during a pandemic.","Tomlinson, Ashley; Kelliher, Leigh; Jones, Chris; Tomlinson, Ashley",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030223/,253

Entry of the virus into host cells, most destructively lung cells, requires two host cell surface proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, downregulation of which is thus a potential therapeutic approach for COVID-19. Both of these cell surface proteins are steroid regulated: TMPRSS2 is a well-characterised androgen-regulated target in prostate cancer. Analysis of sequencing data shows co-expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and TMPRSS2 in key human lung cell types that are targeted by SARS- CoV-2. We show that treatment with antiandrogens such as enzalutamide (a well-tolerated drug widely used in advanced prostate cancer) significantly reduces TMPRSS2 levels in human lung cells and in vivo in mouse lung. We demonstrate that AR binding in the region of the TMPRSS2 gene differs between lung and prostate, identifying distinct regulatory regions. Together, the data and evidence presented supports clinical trials to assess the efficacy of antiandrogens as a treatment option for COVID-19.","Leach, Damien A; Andrea, Mohr; Zwacka, Ralf; Giottis, Stathis; Yates, Laura; Lloyd, Clare; Brooke, Greg N; Bevan, Charlotte Lynne",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089274/,253

This paper reports the findings of phase 1 of a study that the authors are conducting with teachers and parents to explore this issue. We found that a significant proportion of teachers were providing less science during lockdown than in the normal school week. Teachers, particularly those working in more deprived areas, reported that translating the science curriculum for home learning had been difficult, with concerns around resources, internet access and parental ability to help. Some areas of the curriculum posed particular difficulties, leading to a narrowing of topics being taught. Both teachers and parents felt that schools prioritised English and maths above science. Meanwhile some parents reported that their children had engaged in sophisticated extracurricular activities, bolstered by resources available at home and knowledgeable adult help, but others said that their children had done no science at all. Parents who had studied science at post-compulsory level were much more comfortable in helping their children with science home learning. These factors combine to create conditions which may exacerbate existing inequalities as to who can access science education and careers.","Canovan, Cherry; Fallon, Naomi",SN Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8099433/,253

This qualitative study is part of a larger project on palliative care in humanitarian contexts. Its goal was to document and deepen understanding of experiences and expectations related to end-of-life palliative care for patients infected with Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West African Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) during the 2013–2016 epidemic. It consisted of 15 in-depth semi-structured interviews with individuals impacted by EVD in a Guinean ETC: either as patients in an ETC, healthcare providers, healthcare providers who were also EVD patients at one point, family relations who visited patients who died in an ETC, or providers of spiritual support to patients and family. Analysis was team based and applied an interpretive descriptive approach. Healthcare delivery in humanitarian emergencies must remain respectful of patient preferences but also local and contextual values and norms. Of key importance in the Guinean context is the culturally valued experience of “dying in honour”. This involves accompaniment to facilitate a peaceful death, the possibility of passing on final messages to family members, prayer, and particular practices to enact respect for the bodies of the deceased. Participants emphasized several challenges to such death in Ebola treatment centres (ETCs), as well as practices they deemed helpful to alleviating dying patients’ suffering. An overarching message in participants’ accounts was that ideally more would have been done for the dying in ETCs. Building on participants’ accounts, we outline a number of considerations for optimizing end-of-life palliative care during current and future public health emergencies, including for COVID-19.","Nouvet, Elysée; Bezanson, Kevin; Hunt, Matthew; Kouyaté, Sekou; Schwartz, Lisa; Diallo, Fatoumata Binta; de Laat, Sonya; Bah-Sow, Oumou Younoussa; Diallo, Alpha Ahmadou; Diallo, Pathé",Int J Humanitarian Action,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8105689/,253

(Family: Spongiidae) is a coastal sponge that possesses a broad variety of natural-products. However, the exact chemical constituents and cytotoxic activity of the extract are still undefinable. METHODOLOGY: In the present study, the metabolomic profiling of Coscinoderma sp. dereplicated 20 compounds, utilizing liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRESIMS). Coscinoderma-derived crude extract, before and after encapsulation within nanosized liposomes, was in vitro screened against hepatic, breast, and colorectal carcinoma human cell lines (HepG2, MCF-7, and Caco-2, respectively). RESULTS: The identified metabolites were fit to diverse chemical classes, covering diterpenes, an indole alkaloid, sesterterpenoid, sterol, and methylherbipoline salt. Comprehensive in silico experiments predicted several compounds in the sponge-derived extract (eg, compounds 1–15) to have an anticancer potential via targeting multiple targets. The crude extract showed moderate antiproliferative activities towards studied cell lines with IC(50) values range from 10.7 to 12.4 µg/mL. The formulated extract-containing liposomes (size 141±12.3nm, PDI 0.222, zeta potential 20.8 ± 2.3), significantly enhanced the in vitro anticancer activity of the entrapped extract (IC(50) values ranged from 1.7 to 4.1 µg/mL). DISCUSSION: Encapsulation of both the hydrophilic and the lipophilic components of the extract within the lipid-based nanovesicles enhanced the cellular uptake and accessibility of the entrapped cargo.

54150,Editorial: Social and Psychological Determinants of Value Co-creation in the Digital Era,2021-05-28,"OBJECTIVES: Falls are a leading cause of injury, death, functional impairment, and a driver of health costs and utilization in older adults. However, falls among older adults are mostly preventable and therefore fall risk reduction is a high value target for intervention. Poor nutritional status is a risk factor for falls and impedes recovery from falls. Understanding the role of rurality and seasonality in the relationship between falls, nutrition, and access to and use of community nutrition programs is imperative to planning future interventions to decrease fall risk. This pilot study will evaluate these relationships over time in a cohort of older Vermonters within the context of rurality and seasonality. METHODS: Using an observational, analytic study design, we will collect data at two points: baseline (fall 2020) and 6 months later (spring 2021) via an online survey. Adults, 60 and older and residing in Vermont year round were eligible to participate. We collected demographic and community program utilization data as well as responses to three validated questionnaires: CDC STEADI fall risk checklist, Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition, Version III, and the 2-item Food Insecurity screen. We used descriptive statistics to analyze demographic data and chi square analyses to identify associations between food insecurity, nutrition risk, fall risk and falls. RESULTS: At baseline, 53% of the 708 respondents had an elevated fall risk, 42% had a fall in the past six months, 11% were experiencing food insecurity, and 55% were at a nutrition risk. Additionally, 72% of respondents self-identified as living in a rural setting. Overall, community resource utilization was low: 2% of respondents reported using Meals on Wheels, 7% SNAP, and 8% food banks. We found a significant association (P < 0.001) between fall risk and food insecurity, fall risk and nutrition risk, and food insecurity and nutrition risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our baseline data provides evidence for a significant relationship between nutrition, food insecurity, and fall risk in community-dwelling older adults. Follow-up data will provide important information for understanding these relationships over time and within the context of rurality and seasons, particularly as this data was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Chinese version of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) score index was used to measure the anxiety level of HCV-positive patients. BAI score index of different demographic factors such as gender, age, occupation, and education of all the sampled population was calculated. RESULTS: The highest BAI score was recorded in people in the age group of 25–45 years (54.5%). Respondents from public sector employees, own businesses, and postgraduates were highly anxious. A significant difference in BAI score was also recorded between male and female respondents as 33.77% of females were at a severe level of anxiety compared to 17.07% of males. Furthermore, quarantined hepatitis C patients had a significantly higher BAI score (39.5) as compared to non-quarantined patients (27.12), and respondents with HCV infection also had a high BAI score of 37.25 compared to healthy individuals (4.1). Most of the respondents were willing to adopt protective measures against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that people with infectious diseases like hepatitis C had high anxiety levels and mental stress in the COVID-19 pandemic and needed psychological aids for better mental health to handle pandemic conditions.","Rafique, Sadia; Khan, Muhammad Saleem; Unar, Rabia; Wajid, Muhammad; Waheed, Ahmad; Umar, Ali",Egypt Liver Journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8197598/,253

55048,Changes in Anatomy Lecture and Laboratory Instruction During Covid‐19,2021-05-14,"Background: Non-specific neck pain (NNP) affects 30–50% of the general population, and it often leads to severe disability. Several manual therapy techniques are available to reduce pain and disability and to improve cervical range of motion and functional activities. Muscle Energy Technique (MET) showed more evidence for treating such a disorder. The aim of this current scientific literature analysis was to compare the clinical effects of MET with the other manual or rehabilitative treatments for non-specific acute and chronic neck pain. Methods: The literature search was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Medline, PEDro, Cochrane Database, and Google Scholar from 2010 to January 2020. Clinical trials about MET were included. The quality of the trials was assessed according to the PEDro scale. Results: Twenty-one papers according to inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected: 15 studies about non-specific acute neck pain and 6 studies about non-specific chronic neck pain. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that the MET approach has a good clinical effect on reducing neck pain in patients with acute neck pain and improves cervical range of motion in patients with chronic neck pain, and is better if combined with a traditional rehabilitative approach. This review’s findings should be considered with caution for physiotherapy practice because of the studies’ methodologic limitations. On the basis of the current available and limited evidence, clinicians could combine MET with traditional physiotherapy and other manual techniques when treating people with non-specific neck pain.","Sbardella, Silvia; La Russa, Chiara; Bernetti, Andrea; Mangone, Massimiliano; Guarnera, Andrea; Pezzi, Letizia; Paoloni, Marco; Agostini, Francesco; Santilli, Valter; Saggini, Raoul; Paolucci, Teresa",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8234422/,253
55090,The pandemic crisis as a crisis of the symbolic order and psychoanalytic work regarding imaginary objects,2021-05-26,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. ABSTRACT: Infective endocarditis (IE) is described as an uncommon and challenging infective disease, due to its presentation variability. Its mortality remains high besides the better disease knowledge and therapeutic progress. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features and the incidence of IE. Furthermore, we try to identify the risk factors associated with early mortality. A retrospective study was conducted and all patients diagnosed with definite or possible IE between January 2015 and June 2020, according to the modified Duke criteria, were included. Patient selection and information collection were obtained through medical records. Outcomes were in-hospital and 3 months after discharge mortality. Group comparisons and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. A p-value less than 0.05 is statistically significant. We analysed 51 patients, which 41 were admitted between 2015 and 2019 with a mean incidence of 8.2 cases per year. In 2020, 10 cases were diagnosed, corresponding to a percentual increase of 143.9%. Of the 51 patients, 70.6% were male. The mean age was 65 years. Fever was the main presentation feature at admission. We counted 33.3% prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and 5.9% IE device-related. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus gallolyticus (13.7%) and Streptococcus oralis (13.7%). 35 patients (68.6%) had local complications and 26 patients (51%) had systemic complications. One-third of the patients was referenced to surgical treatment. Overall in-hospital mortality was 19.6% and early mortality at 3 months was 27.5%. In the univariate analysis, early mortality was higher in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients (p < 0.01) and in those who developed sepsis during hospitalization (p = 0.04). In multivariate logistic regression, only DM (OR = 15.8, 95% CI [3.2, 79.0]) was shown to be an independent factor of mortality. The incidence of IE increased during the first semester of 2020, possibly due to the increased attention given to patients with fever. Diabetes mellitus was found to be the only independent predictor of mortality. More national multicentre studies are needed.","Cabral, M; Fernandes, S; Santos, LG; Carvalho, R; Sa, FM; Martins, H; Pernencar, S; Ruivo, C; Santos, B; Morais, J",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8227352/,253
55195,Civic and Political Engagement during the Multifaceted COVID‐19 Crisis,2021-05-10,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Covid‐19 created challenges to anatomy education, particularly gross anatomy given the traditional in‐person format of lectures and lab. The objective of this study was to assess the changes in lecture methods and lab materials used in anatomy courses that ran between May‐August (T1) and August‐December (T2) 2020 responding to Covid‐19 restrictions. MATERIALS/METHODS: A survey was distributed to anatomy educators through professional associations from June‐November 2020. Respondents indicated (1) their institution; (2) programs taught (professional health (PH), medicine (MED), or undergraduate (UG)); (3) course type (integrated or stand‐alone); (4) percentage of lab time before and during Covid‐19 that utilized cadaveric, plastic, and/or other teaching materials; and (5) lecture format. Institutions were classified as public or private via institution websites. Mann‐Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed‐rank tests with Bonferroni correction compared responses before and during Covid‐19 across programs, course type, and institution. Data are presented as percent increase (+value) or decrease (‐value). Alpha<5%. RESULTS: T1 and T2 received 67 and 191 responses, respectively. During T1 and T2, cadaver use decreased in PH (‐58% & ‐28%), MED (‐55% & ‐34%), and UG (‐57% & ‐55%) programs (P≤0.045); stand‐alone (‐58% & ‐33%,P<0.001) and integrated (‐48% & ‐28%, P≤0.004) courses; and private (‐49% & ‐25%, P<0.001) and public (‐65% & ‐34%, P<0.001) institutions. During T1 and T2, plastic use did not change for programs, institutions, or courses (P>0.05), except UG decreased plastic usage during T2 (‐20%; P=0.033). During T1 and T2, use of other teaching materials increased in PH (+1180% & +278%), MED (+385% & +1000%), and UG (+285% & +246%) (P≤0.015); stand‐alone (+920% & +540%, P<0.001) and integrated (+330% & +500%, P≤0.002) courses; and private (+1233% & +667%, P<0.001) and public (+415% & +400%, P<0.001) institutions. For T1 and T2, in‐person lecture decreased (‐89% & ‐72%, P≤0.001), while remote lecture increased (+509% & +533%, P≤0.001) during Covid‐19. CONCLUSION: Reduction in cadaver use and in‐person lecture were most pronounced in T1, but remained diminished through both time points, suggesting a shift from the initial pandemic response to teaching to more complex hybrid programs as regulations permitted. SIGNIFICANCE/IMPLICATION: This study provides evidence to better understand how anatomy educators adapted their gross anatomy teaching due to Covid‐19 across programs. In addition, this study provides first of its kind insight into how anatomy was taught across programs prior to Covid‐19. Future studies need to determine whether the findings characterized here were pandemic‐based or if they represent long‐term changes for anatomy education.","Harmon, Derek; Attardi, Stefanie; Barremkala, Malli; Bentley, Danielle; Brown, Kirsten; Dennis, Jennifer; Goldman, Haviva; Harrell, Kelly; Klein, Barbie; Ramnanan, Christopher; Richtsmeier, Joan; Farkas, Gary",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239555/,253

Aim: To study and analyze the application of positive-pressure connector in invasive blood pressure monitoring in coronary interventional therapy. Methods: From October 2017 to October 2019, a total of 120 patients admitted to Cangzhou Central Hospital, Cangzhou, Hebei, China, for coronary interventional therapy with invasive blood pressure monitoring were selected and divided into a control group and an experimental group by drawing lots with 60 patients in each group. Positive-pressure connector was used for invasive blood pressure detection in the experimental group, and heparin cap connector was used for invasive blood pressure detection in the control group. The effectiveness and safety of blood pressure monitoring in the two groups were compared, and the influence of different joints on invasive blood pressure monitoring was analyzed. Results: The influencing factors of puncture efficiency in the experimental group (6.67%) were significantly lower than those in the control group (30.00%) (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in catheter bending between the experimental group and the control group (P > 0.05). The experimental group exhibited a remarkably higher puncture safety rate (93%) compared to the control group (67%) (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in arterial blood pressure between the two groups with different indwelling time (P > 0.05). The frequency of extubation and reinsertion in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Factors influencing puncture safety in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The use of positive-pressure connector for invasive blood pressure monitoring in patients with coronary artery interventional therapy can greatly improve the safety of blood pressure monitoring and reduce the suffering of patients. Therefore, the application of positive-pressure connector in invasive blood pressure monitoring is worthy of promotion and application in clinical practice.","Wang, Aili; Liu, Junying; Peng, Wanzhong; Jiang, Yang; Guo, Lina; Xu, Zesheng",Front Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242173/,253

The outcomes associated with diabetes may be a consequence of an impaired immune response, presence of composite comorbidities or the multi‐organ infectivity of SARS‐CoV‐2 affecting the pancreas. Emerging evidence suggests that both acute and chronic hyperglycaemia can exacerbate the clinical consequences of COVID‐19. Thus, the role of health care professionals in the observation and management of glucose control is increasingly recognised in people with diabetes in both the acute and chronic setting.

55579,From wartime loudspeakers to digital networks: communist persuasion and pandemic politics in Vietnam,2020-11-11,"The qualification of a preschool teacher is one of the important factors that determine the quality of preschool education. To increase the quality in education, teachers should be equipped with the necessary knowledge starting from pre-service training, and in-service training should support the upgrading of their knowledge. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an e-Mentoring-Based Education Program (e-MENTE:PT) for preschool teachers and to test its effectiveness on their professional development during the in-service support period. The study used a design-based research approach. First, focus group interviews were conducted with one-hundred-and-five preschool teachers to find out their needs. Then, an e-MENTE:PT Program was developed based on these needs and devised to be used on the Canvas learning management system (LMS), which involves all opportunities of e-learning and allows one-to-one e-mentoring. The e-MENTE:PT Program involved twelve modules related to the pedagogical content knowledge of the preschool education program. Each module included contents, goals, module materials, e-books, videos, pre- and post-module evaluation questions, discussion questions, live lessons and e-portfolios, all of which were integrated in the LMS. Next, eighteen full-time and nine substitute voluntary teachers from five different provinces were selected as mentees by means of criterion sampling. Nine academicians working in these provinces acted as mentors and implemented the application, each working with two mentees for two months. Qualitative data were analysed by means of descriptive analysis and quantitative data were analysed by means of the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The research concluded that the e-MENTE:PT program supported preschool teachers’ professional knowledge, learning environments and classroom applications, and an e-mentoring based teaching management system was effective on professional development.","Erdoğan, Serap; Haktanır, Gelengül; Kuru, Nalan; Parpucu, Nurbanu; Tüylü, Demet Koç",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8254052/,253

Higher education is one of the critical resources that will help unlock Africa's potential. China has been a significant partner in the continent's growth. African Heads of State have lauded China's development model and have developed policies to emulate what they consider the most suitable model for a developing nation. Twenty years since the birth of the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), the value of higher education cooperation between Africa and China remains untapped by the private and public sectors. Under FOCAC, China has made provisions to support Africa in human development through various programs, including education. China has invited African scholars to Chinese universities to earn higher education degrees, as well as learn the Chinese language and study China's programs for alleviating poverty. After graduation, students are required to return to their home countries and contribute to the development of their national economies. This paper reviews the usefulness of international education cooperation for human capital development in the Africa–China context. The study examines China's experience with haigui and identifies lessons for Africa. The paper argues that a more intentional, incentive-driven, and standalone action plan for higher education could help both sides with national branding and enhance future policy and industry development.

56808,Trends in the Global Market for Freight Aircraft,2021-08-16,"BACKGROUND: Communities are environments which can protect and promote or, conversely, can endanger the health of their members. Community health promotion takes place in and with a community. Implementing programs and measures in a community mainly focus on individuals and reducing endpoints such as morbidity and mortality, as well as increasing the quality of life. Extending this individual-focused approach, health promotion with a community aims at developing a “healthy community”. OBJECTIVES: What does health promotion with the community aim at? When is a community “healthy”? Beyond a reduction of endpoints such as the incidence and prevalence of nonommunicable diseases, what is the goal of programs, measures, and activities to motivate and support residents to adopt health-promoting behaviors? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Against the backdrop of “grand societal challenges” and drawing on socioecological approaches, the paper discusses what constitutes a “healthy community” and what health promotion with the community aims to achieve. RESULTS: A “healthy community” develops through cooperation of multiple stakeholders from different sectors such as politics, administration, civil society, and residents. The “healthy community” is designed as a fair environment. It opens up possibilities for the individual to act and provides opportunities for them to pursue personally important goals. CONCLUSIONS: The socioecological perspective sharpens the view for the dynamic interaction of environmental and individual factors. Fairness, spaces of opportunity, and realization chances are three criteria that are suitable as indicators for a “healthy community”.","Schlicht, Wolfgang; Bucksch, Jens; Kohlmann, Carl-Walter; Renner, Britta; Steinacker, Jürgen; Walling, Fabian",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8353934/,253

As such, it has been crucial to the success of vaccines. Yet, the recent pandemic has illuminated key gaps in our knowledge related to the factors influencing effective memory formation and the inability to predict the longevity of immune protection. In recent decades, researchers have acquired a number of novel and powerful tools with which to study the factors underpinning humoral memory. These tools have been used to study the B-cell fate decisions that occur within the germinal centre, a site where responding B-cells undergo affinity maturation and is one of the major routes for memory B-cell and high-affinity long-lived plasma cell formation. The advent of single-cell sequencing technology has provided an enhanced resolution for studying fate decisions within the germinal centre and cutting-edge techniques have enabled researchers to model this reaction with more accuracy both in vitro and in silico. Moreover, modern approaches to studying memory B-cells have allowed us to gain a better appreciation for the heterogeneity and adaptability of this vital class of B-cells. Together, these studies have facilitated important breakthroughs in our understanding of how these systems operate to ensure a successful immune response. In this review, we describe recent advances in the field of germinal centre and memory B-cell biology in order to provide insight into how humoral memory is formed, as well as the potential for generating lasting immunity to novel pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2.","Kealy, Liam; Good-Jacobson, Kim L",Oxf Open Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499879/,253

Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (family: Saururaceae) (H. cordata), as has been reported, is a Chinese herbal medicine commonly used to treat upper respiratory tract infection and bronchitis. Our previous study has proven that sodium houttuyfonate (an additional compound from sodium bisulfite and houttuynin) had beneficial effects in the prevention of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) induced by bleomycin (BLM) in mice. In the present study, network pharmacology was used to investigate the efficiency and potential mechanisms of H. cordata in PF treatment. Upon manual collection from the literature and databases such as TCMSP and TCM-ID, 10 known representative ingredients of H. cordata species were screened. Then, the prediction of the potential active ingredients, action targets, and signaling pathways were conducted through the Gene Ontology (GO), protein–protein interaction (PPI),and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. The results of network pharmacology prediction suggested that H. cordata may act through multiple signaling pathways to alleviate PF, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathways, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways, and interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathways. Molecular docking experiments showed that the chemical constituents of H. cordata had good affinity with TNF, MAPK1, and AKT1, and using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced A549 cells, a model was established to verify the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects and related mechanisms of H. cordata–relevant constituents. Finally, these evidences collectively suggest H. cordata may alleviate PF progression via PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and TNF signaling pathways and provide novel insights to verify the mechanism of H. cordata in the treatment of PF.","Zhu, De-Wei; Yu, Qun; Sun, Ji-Jia; Shen, Yun-Hui",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514782/,253

MATERIALS AND METHODS In total, 5545 patients enrolled in 34 prospective clinical studies were evaluated in an integrated analysis of safety. Of all enrolled patients, 4549 received gadobutrol at a dose of ≤ 0.09 mmol/kg body weight to a maximum of 0.51 mmol/kg body weight, with most patients (53.5%) receiving the recommended dose of >0.09 to 0.11 mmol/kg body weight. Data include comparisons with other extracellular contrast agents and subgroup analyses in pediatric patients, and patients with allergic disposition, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, or cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, worldwide postmarketing safety surveillance results, including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis reports, based on more than 5.7 million estimated applications are described. RESULTS One or more adverse events (AEs) assessed as related to the administration of gadobutrol were reported by 182 (4.0%) of the 4549 patients who participated in clinical trials. This is comparable to the incidence observed with the comparator contrast agents (74/1844 patients, 4.0%). The most common AEs, independent of drug relationship, were headache, nausea, feeling hot, and dysgeusia. The favorable safety profile of gadobutrol was also demonstrated in the following specific subpopulations in whom similar incidence rates were seen: pediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years (8/138 patients, 5.8%), patients with severe or moderate renal impairment (9/366 patients, 2.5%), patients with severe or moderate hepatic impairment (9/214 patients, 4.2%), and patients with cardiovascular disorders (42/1506 patients, 2.8%). Having been established in controlled clinical trials, this safety profile was also confirmed by postmarketing surveillance data. With more than 5.7 million estimated administrations of gadobutrol, a total of 1175 (0.02%) suspected adverse drug reactions have been reported. The most serious adverse reactions seen in postmarketing surveillance included rare reports of cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, anaphylactoid shock, and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Incidence and type of AEs from postmarketing surveillance were consistent with the established safety profile. CONCLUSION The comprehensive analysis of safety data obtained from 34 clinical studies demonstrates that gadobutrol has an excellent safety profile and a positive benefit risk profile when used in patients in need of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Gadobutrol was well tolerated by adults, by children, by patients with impaired liver or kidney function, and by patients with cardiovascular disease. The favorable safety profile is confirmed by the available postmarketing surveillance data and is compared with that of other gadolinium-based contrast agents.","Voth, Matthias; Rosenberg, Martin; Breuer, Josy",Investigative radiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0b013e3182218dc3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21623211/,253

However, the exploration of highly effective and safe visible-light-driven (VLD) photocatalysts remains an important step toward accessing this new technology. Herein, an eco-friendly photocatalyst, namely Indium Sulfide (In2S3), was fabricated through a facile hydrothermal method for VLD photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria. The energy band gap of the as-prepared In2S3 was measured as 2.25 eV. As expected, the obtained In2S3 photocatalyst showed remarkable inactivation efficiency toward E. coli under fluorescent tubes irradiation. The photocatalytic inactivation kinetic was perfectly fitted by a mathematical model for bacteria inactivation. In addition, In2S3 exhibited high stability and could be reused. The leakage of In3+ was not significant and showed no toxic effect to the bacteria. Based on the results of scavenger study and ESR technology, the dominant reactive species causing In2S3 VLD photocatalytic bacterial inactivation were proposed as O2-, h+, H2O2 and e-, rather than OH. The SEM study suggested that the damages to the intracellular components occurred prior to the destruction of cell wall. This study provides novel application of In2S3 for VLD photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria as well as comprehensive insight into the inactivation mechanism.","Qiu, Haibo; Fang, Shengqiong; Huang, Guocheng; Bi, Jinhong",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810495/,253

We describe the third reported case of systemic contact dermatitis due to the nickel component of the device, with a resolution of symptoms following surgical removal of the inserts. Despite these cases, we believe that extremely rare complications such as this should not dissuade patients from choosing this safe, effective method of sterilization.","Lane, Andrew; Tyson, Adam; Thurston, Erin",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2015.07.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26260300/,253
61152,Care homes: averting market failure in a post-covid-19 world.,2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Neutrophil overactivation is crucial in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Bletinib (3,3'-dihydroxy-2',6'-bis(p-hydroxybenzyl)-5-methoxybibenzyl), a natural bibenzyl first extracted from Bletilla striata in 1983, has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antimitotic potential. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of Bletinib in human neutrophilic inflammation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated ALI. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We assessed integrin expression, superoxide anion production, degranulation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and adhesion in activated human neutrophils through flow cytometry, spectrophotometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Moreover, phosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFKs) and downstream proteins was evaluated through immunoblotting. Finally, a murine LPS-induced ALI model was used to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of Bletinib treatment. KEY RESULTS In activated human neutrophils, Bletinib reduced degranulation, respiratory burst, NET formation, adhesion, migration, and integrin expression; suppressed the enzymatic activity of SFKs, including Src, Lyn, Fgr, and Hck; and inhibited the phosphorylation of SFKs as well as Vav and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). In our mice with ALI, the pulmonary sections demonstrated considerable amelioration of prominent inflammatory changes, such as haemorrhage, pulmonary oedema, and neutrophil infiltration, after Bletinib treatment. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS This is the first study to provide evidence that Bletinib regulates neutrophilic inflammation by inhibiting the SFKs-Btk-Vav pathway and that Bletinib ameliorates LPS-induced ALI in mice. Further biochemical optimisation of Bletinib may be a promising strategy for the development of novel therapeutics for inflammatory diseases.","Kao, Ting-I; Chen, Po-Jen; Wang, Yi-Hsuan; Tseng, Hsin-Hui; Chang, Shih-Hsin; Wu, Tian-Shung; Yang, Sien-Hung; Lee, Yen-Tung; Hwang, Tsong-Long",British journal of pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131920/,253
62290,"COVID-19, Black Lives Matter and making a difference.",2020-08-01,"The efficacy, safety and positioning of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is much debated, since it can result in clear clinical benefits in some patients (""friend"") but can be ineffective or even associated with undesired side effects, e.g. pneumonia, in others (""foe""). After critically reviewing the evidence for and against ICS treatment in patients with COPD, we propose that: 1) ICS should not be used as a single, stand-alone therapy in COPD; 2) patients most likely to benefit from the addition of ICS to long-acting bronchodilators include those with history of multiple or severe exacerbations despite appropriate maintenance bronchodilator use, particularly if blood eosinophils are >300 cells·µL-1, and those with a history of and/or concomitant asthma; and 3) the risk of pneumonia in COPD patients using ICS is higher in those with older age, lower body mass index (BMI), greater overall fragility, receiving higher ICS doses and those with blood eosinophils <100 cells·µL-1 All these factors must be carefully considered and balanced in any individual COPD patient before adding ICS to her/his maintenance bronchodilator treatment. Further research is needed to clarify some of these issues and firmly establish these recommendations.","Agusti, Alvar; Fabbri, Leonardo M; Singh, Dave; Vestbo, Jørgen; Celli, Bartolome; Franssen, Frits M E; Rabe, Klaus F; Papi, Alberto",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01219-2018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30190269/,253

METHODS A total of 171 participants with severe obesity (mean age = 43.07 ± 11.21) completed computerized cognitive testing. A subset of participants underwent bariatric surgery as part of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery project. MCI was operationalized using commonly used criteria to establish prevalence in the overall sample and to examine possible changes after bariatric surgery. RESULTS More than half of the overall sample met criteria for MCI at baseline (53.8%), and MCI was prevalent even in young and middle-aged adults with severe obesity. Within the subset of participants who underwent bariatric surgery, the prevalence of MCI was reduced by 48.9% at 12-month follow-up (from 53.4% to 27.3%). CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that many individuals with severe obesity meet criteria for MCI and that prevalence rates decline after bariatric surgery. A better understanding of the mechanisms linking severe obesity to adverse neurological outcomes is much needed.","Rochette, Amber D; Spitznagel, Mary Beth; Strain, Gladys; Devlin, Michael; Crosby, Ross D; Mitchell, James E; Courcoulas, Anita; Gunstad, John",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.21514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27227797/,253
63997,The UK's PPE procurement scandal reminds us why we need ways to hold ministers to account.,2021-03-08,"Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in which local inflammation and hyperactivity of the complement pathway have been implicated in its pathophysiology. This study explores whether any surrogate biomarkers are specifically associated with GA. Plasma from subjects with GA, intermediate dry AMD and non-AMD control were evaluated in 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 was assayed in a 320-analyte Luminex library. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric and parametric methods (Kruskal-Wallis, principal component analysis, partial least squares and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and univariate ANCOVAs). Bioinformatic analysis was conducted and identified connections to the amyloid pathway. Statistically significant biomarkers identified in Cohort 1 were then re-evaluated in Cohort 2 using individual ELISA and multiplexing. Of 320 analytes in Cohort 1, 273 were rendered measurable, of which 56 were identified as changing. Among these markers, 40 were identified in univariate ANCOVAs. Serum amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) was analyzed by a separate ELISA and included in further analyses. The 40 biomarkers, sAPP and amyloid-β (Aβ) (1-42) (included for comparison) were evaluated in Cohort 2. This resulted in 11 statistically significant biomarkers, including sAPP and Aβ(1-40), but not Aβ(1-42). Other biomarkers identified included serum proteases- tissue plasminogen activator, tumor-associated trypsinogen inhibitor, matrix metalloproteinases 7 and 9, and non-proteases- insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6, AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, omentin, pentraxin-3 and osteopontin. Findings suggest that there is a preferential processing of APP to Aβ(1-40) over Aβ(1-42), and a potential role for the carboxylase activity of the γ-secretase protein, which preferentially splices sAPPβ to Aβ(1-40). Other markers are associated with the breakdown and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and loss of homeostasis, possibly within the photoreceptor-retinal pigment epithelium-choriocapillaris complex. These data suggest novel disease pathways associated with GA pathogenesis and could provide potential novel targets for treatment of GA.","Lashkari, Kameran; Teague, Gianna C; Beattie, Ursula; Betts, Joanna; Kumar, Sanjay; McLaughlin, Megan M; López, Francisco J",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764794/,253

DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 48 client-owned dogs that underwent laparoscopic (n = 23) or open (25) adrenalectomy for noninvasive tumors (ie, tumors that did not invade the vena cava or other surrounding organs). Procedures-Medical records were reviewed. History, clinical signs, physical examination findings, clinicopathologic findings, imaging results, and surgical variables were recorded. A 3- or 4-port approach was used for laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Surgical time, perioperative complications, postoperative and overall hospitalization times, and perioperative deaths were recorded and compared between groups. RESULTS The surgical method for 1 dog was converted from a laparoscopic to an open approach. Perioperative death occurred in no dogs in the laparoscopic group and 2 dogs in the open adrenalectomy group. Surgical time was shorter for laparoscopic (median, 90 minutes; range, 40 to 150 minutes) than for open (median, 120 minutes; range, 75 to 195 minutes) adrenalectomy. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was associated with shorter hospitalization time and more rapid discharge from the hospital after surgery, compared with the open procedure. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE With careful patient selection, laparoscopic adrenalectomy was associated with a low complication rate and low conversion rate for resection of adrenocortical masses as well as shorter surgical and hospitalization times, compared with open adrenalectomy.","Mayhew, Philipp D; Culp, William T N; Hunt, Geraldine B; Steffey, Michele A; Mayhew, Kelli N; Fuller, Mark; Della-Maggiore, Ann; Nelson, Richard W",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.245.9.1028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313814/,253

Termed by some as the twenty-first century's first pandemic, SARS originated in China and alerted the country to the importance of public health and epidemic response. After SARS, China improved its health infrastructure and reformed its political and legal health governance system. The emergence of COVID-19 from Wuhan in late 2019 put those reforms to the test. This paper analyses China's public health and epidemic response policies from a historical perspective, tracing the evolution of Chinese public health policies after the SARS outbreak in 2003. This paper assesses China's response to COVID-19 and how post-SARS policy reforms, particularly in epidemic response, played out on the ground in Wuhan. What policies worked well? What were the challenges faced? Based on the policy analysis, this paper presents recommendations for how China can improve its epidemic response through strengthened infectious disease surveillance, more transparent political coordination, and expanded public health infrastructure.","Li, Melissa",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1919735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33891518/,253
66563,How does social distancing during COVID-19 affect negative moods and memory?,2020-12-15,"A key immunomodulatory cytokine, IL-10 (interleukin-10), has been shown to be dysregulated in preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific hypertensive disorder, further characterized by multi-system involvement. However, studies have reported inconsistent findings about circulating IL-10 levels in preeclamptic versus normotensive pregnancies. The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess circulating IL-10 levels in preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies at 2 time points: before, and at the time of preeclampsia diagnosis. PubMED, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched to include all published studies examining circulating IL-10 levels in preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies. Differences in IL-10 levels were evaluated by standardized mean differences. Of 876 abstracts screened, 56 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Circulating IL-10 levels were not different before the time of active disease (standardized mean differences, -0.01 [95% CI, -0.11 to 0.08]; P=0.76). At the time of active disease, women with preeclampsia (n=1599) had significantly lower IL-10 levels compared with normotensive controls (n=1998; standardized mean differences, -0.79 [95% CI, -1.22 to -0.35]; P=0.0004). IL-10 levels were lower in both early/severe and late/mild forms of preeclampsia. Subgroup analysis revealed that IL-10 measurement methodology (ELISA or multiplex bead array) and the sample type (plasma or serum) significantly influenced the observed differences, with the use of sera paired with ELISA technology providing the best distinction in IL-10 levels between preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies. These findings support the role of decreased IL-10 levels in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Future studies should address the therapeutic potential of IL-10 in preeclampsia.","Nath, Meryl C; Cubro, Hajrunisa; McCormick, Daniel J; Milic, Natasa M; Garovic, Vesna D",Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.120.15870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100048/,253

In this study, we examined suicide rates among welfare support workers and compared them to other occupations in Australia. METHODS We used data from the National Coroners Information System to obtain suicide deaths between the years 2001 and 2016. Using the Australian standard population from 2001 and Census data from 2006, 2011 and 2016, we calculated age-standardised suicide rates and rate ratios to compare suicide rates across different occupational groups. RESULTS Overall, the age-standardised suicide rate of welfare support workers was 8.6 per 100 000 people. The gender-stratified results show that male welfare support workers have a high suicide rate (23.8 per 100 000 people) which is similar to male social workers and nurses (25.4 per 100 000). After adjusting for age and year of death, both males (rate ratio 1.48, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.78) and female welfare support workers (rate ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.86) have higher suicide rate ratios compared with the reference group (excluding occupations from the comparison groups). CONCLUSION The age-standardised suicide rates of male welfare support workers are comparable to occupations which have been identified as high-risk occupations for suicide. Both female and male welfare support workers are at elevated risk of suicide compared with other occupations. Further research is required to understand the drivers of the elevated risk in this group.","Maheen, Humaira; Dimov, Stefanie; Spittal, Matthew J; King, Tania L",Occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2020-106757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33574066/,253

The patient was referred from a hospital to regular care with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. The initial clinical symptoms consisted of dysuria and fever. A bilateral infiltrate was seen in the chest x-ray. In the CT thorax, advanced COVID-19 typical changes were found on both sides. The COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from the nasopharynx smear. In the case of progressive ARDS with respiratory exhaustion, the patient was intubated and invasively ventilated. When a bacterial superinfection was suspected, we initiated empirical antibiotic therapy. In addition, a therapy with dexamethasone was applied. Therapy with ASA and weight-adapted semi-therapeutic low molecular weight heparin was also carried out. During the intensive care treatment the patient developed a fulminant septic shock with consecutive severe thrombocytopenia. A dilated tracheotomy was performed. The weaning progress was hampered by recurrent septic attacks. Necrosis in the area of ​​the right foot was identified as the cause of the septic relapses.

Four Decades of Empirical Research Published in JADD Since the DSM-III.,2021-05-11,"Background Segmentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lesions is a difficult task due to high uncertainty in the shape, size and location of the lesions. CT scan image is an important means of diagnosing COVID-19, but it requires doctors to observe a large number of scan images repeatedly to determine the patient's condition. Moreover, the low contrast of CT scan and the presence of tissues such as blood vessels in the background increase the difficulty of diagnosis. To solve this problem, we proposed an improved segmentation model called the residual attention U-shaped network (ResAU-Net). Methods A novel method to detect and segment coronavirus pneumonia was established based on the deep-learning algorithm. Firstly, the CT scan image was input, and lung segmentation was then realized by U-net. Then, the region of interest was selected by the minimum circumscribed rectangle clipping method. Finally, the proposed ResAU-Net, which includes attention module (AMB), residual module (RBM) and sub-pixel convolution module (SPCBM), was used to segment the infected area and generate the segmentation results. Results We evaluated our model using cross-validation on 100 chest CT scans test images. The experimental results showed that our method achieved start-of-the-art performance on the pneumonia dataset. The mIoU and Dice cofficients of Lesion segmentation were 73.40%±2.24% and 84.5%±2.46%, and realize fast real-time processing. Conclusions Our model can effectively solve the problems of poor segmentation accuracy in the segmentation of COVID-19 lesions, and the segmentation result image can effectively assist medical staff in the diagnosis and quantitative analysis of infection degree, and improve the screening and diagnosis efficiency of pneumonia.","Zhang, Zhiliang; Ni, Xinye; Huo, Guanying; Li, Qingwu; Qi, Fei",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-21-1156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350249/,253

This study describes the frequency and cost of acute care hospitalization with dehydration and/or malnutrition of Medicare beneficiaries receiving EN, focusing on those receiving home EN. METHODS Medicare 5% Standard Analytic Files were used to determine Medicare spending for EN supplies and the proportion and cost of beneficiaries receiving EN, specifically home EN, admitted to the hospital with dehydration and/or malnutrition. RESULTS In 2013, Medicare paid $370,549,760 to provide EN supplies for 125,440 beneficiaries, 55% of whom were also eligible for Medicaid. Acute care hospitalization with dehydration and/or malnutrition occurred in 43,180 beneficiaries receiving EN. The most common principal diagnoses were septicemia (21%), aspiration pneumonitis (9%), and pneumonia (5%). In beneficiaries receiving EN at home, >one-third (37%) were admitted with dehydration and/or malnutrition during a mean observation interval of 231 ± 187 days. Admitted patients were usually hospitalized more than once with dehydration and/or malnutrition (1.73 ± 1.30 admissions) costing $23,579 ± 24,966 per admitted patient, totaling >$129,685,622 during a mean observation interval of 276 ± 187 days.

Bevezetés: Az Egészségügyi Világszervezet adatai alapján 2020 őszére a világ minden régióját elérte az új koronavírus (SARS-CoV-2) okozta fertőzés. Magyarországon 2020 márciusában az első esetek - több más betegjogi kérdés mellett - ráirányították a figyelmet a betegtájékoztatás kiemelt fontosságára, annak jogszabály szerinti betartására, valamint az alkalmazás során fellépő nehézségekre. Tekintve, hogy az együttszülés lehetősége az utóbbi évtizedekben egyre népszerűbb a családtervezés és a közös életkezdés folyamatában, az apák felkészítése a szülésre - a járványhelyzet miatt megváltozott tájékoztatási szigorítások összehangolásával - a szülészeti osztályok jelentős feladata lett. A betegtájékoztatás teljes körű alkalmazása során számos szempontot kellett figyelembe venni ahhoz, hogy a szülés az anya és az apa számára pozitív emlék maradjon, még olyan helyzetben is, mint a COVID-19-járvány. Célkitűzés: Elemezni kívántuk, hogy a magyarországi szülészeti osztályokon hogyan lehetett a világjárvány idején is betartani a hatályos jogszabályokat és eljárásrendeket, milyen intézkedések váltak szükségessé az együttszülés gyakorlatának fenntartásához, és egyidejűleg biztosítani, hogy a szülőnőnek és férfi partnerének a tájékoztatáshoz való jogai ne sérüljenek. Módszer: Online 14 feleletválogatós kérdőívet küldtünk valamennyi magyarországi, állami fenntartású kórház és klinika szülészeti osztálya vezetőjének. A beérkezett kérdőívek adatait összevetettük az intézmények honlapján az együttszüléssel kapcsolatos információkkal is. Eredmények: A 2020. március 20. és szeptember 20. közötti fél évben a várandós párok tájékoztatása során a szolgáltatók minden esetben a hatályos eljárásrendeket követték, ez azonban több esetben többlet anyagi ráfordítást és szervezést jelentett számukra. Következtetés: Adataink rámutatnak arra, hogy az együttszüléssel kapcsolatosan a szülésre érkezők igyekeznek a lehető legjobban tájékozódni, és ugyanolyan elvárásaik vannak a szülés körülményeit illetően, mint a járványmentes időszakban. Amennyiben a tájékoztatás kielégítő és részletes számukra, az esetleges hátrányos változtatásokat is jobban tolerálják.

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION According to data collected by the World Health Organization, by the autumn of 2020, all regions of the world were affected by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. In Hungary, the first cases were detected in March 2020, and the epidemic, among several other patient rights issues, drew attention to the paramount importance of patient information, its compliance with the law, and the difficulties encountered in its application. During the last decades, the possibility of male partner involvement in birth has become increasingly popular in the process of family planning and starting a life together. Preparing fathers for childbirth and coordinating information restrictions that have changed due to the epidemic is a priority for obstetric departments. The full application of patient information requires a number of considerations to ensure that childbirth remains a positive memory for mother and father, even in a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE We wanted to analyze how the obstetric wards in Hungary were able to comply with the laws and procedures in force at the time of the pandemic, what measures became necessary for creating male partner involvement in births, and at the same time to ensure that the rights of the mother and the father are not violated. METHOD We sent an online questionnaire to the head of the obstetrics department of all Hungarian state hospitals and clinics, using 14 multiple-choice questions. The data of the received questionnaires were also compared with the information related to male partner involvement in births published on the websites of the institutions. RESULTS In the period from 20 March to 20 September 2020, in terms of informing pregnant couples, the service providers always followed the procedures in force, but in several cases this meant more financial expenditure and organization for them. CONCLUSION Our data showed that those who give birth insist on the best possible information about conditions of male partner involvement in births, have the same expectations about the conditions of childbirth as during the epidemic-free period. If the information is satisfactory and detailed for them, they are more tolerant of adverse changes. In view of the epidemic, the possibility of father involvement in birth remained in all departments available, while maintaining appropriate epidemiological measures.

Measures to contain the pandemic are currently taking effect and societies in general and health care systems in particular are considering how to return to normalcy. This opens-up the discussion when and how clinical trials should be restarted while the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet resolved, and what should happen in case of a resurgence of the virus in the coming months. This article uses the Four Ethical Principles framework as a structured approach to come to a set of practical, ethically grounded guidelines for halting and relaunching clinical trials during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The framework applied provides a structured approach for all clinical trials stakeholders and thereby prevents unclear reasoning in a complex situation.

78682,Burnout among medical and health sciences information professionals who support systematic reviews: an exploratory study.,2020-01-01,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the most frequently performed bariatric procedures. Hemorrhagic complications (HC) after surgery are common and require surgical revision. Accurate estimation of the risk of postoperative HC can improve surgical decision-making process and minimize the risk of reoperation. The aim of the present study was to develop a predictive model for HC after LSG. MATERIAL AND METHODS The retrospective analysis of 522 patients after primary LSG was performed. Patients underwent surgery from January 2013 to February 2015. The primary outcome was defined as a surgical revision due to hemorrhagic complications. Multiple regression analysis was performed. RESULTS The rate of hemorrhagic complications was 4 %. The mean age of patients was 41.0 (±11.6) years and mean BMI was 47.3 (±7.3) kg/m2. Of the 12 examined variables, four were associated with risk of HC. Protective factors for HC were no history of obstructive sleep apnea (odds ratio [OR] 0.22; 95 % CI 0.05-0.94) and no history of hypertension (OR 0.38; 95 % CI 0.14-1.05). The low level of expertise in bariatric surgery (OR 2.85; 95 % CI 1.08-7.53) and no staple line reinforcement (OR 3.34; 95 % CI 1.21-9.21) were associated with higher risk of HC. CONCLUSIONS The result revealed the association between hemorrhagic complications and the following factors: obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, level of expertise in bariatric surgery, and reinforcement of the staple line. The risk assessment model for hemorrhagic complications after LSG can contribute to surgical decision-making process.","Janik, Michal R; Walędziak, Maciej; Brągoszewski, Jakub; Kwiatkowski, Andrzej; Paśnik, Krzysztof",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2417-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27730461/,253

An international effort led by EN industry leaders has developed a small-bore enteral connector (ENFit) that in theory will reduce the frequency of misconnections. Despite the potential benefit of preventing misconnections, the full impact of adoption of the ENFit connector is unknown. To assess the impact of transitioning to ENFit on our home EN (HEN) patients, the current study evaluated gravity feeding comparing 2 proposed small-bore connectors to the legacy (current connector) using various commercial formulas. METHODS Six commonly used enteral formulas in our facility with varying density and viscosity were tested in triplicate. Forty milliliters of formula was poured into a syringe connected to an ENFit or legacy (current) feeding connector attached to varying French size tubes. The time it took formula to flow through the connectors was recorded, and the test was repeated in triplicate. RESULTS All formulas took significantly longer to flow through the first ENFit connector compared with the legacy connector ( P < .05). The second ENFit connector demonstrated similar flow dynamics to the legacy connector. CONCLUSIONS There is wide variability in the flow dynamics in ENFit connectors with significant potential impact on many facets of HEN, including medicine delivery, blenderized feeds, venting, and compliance with EN due to increased time to administer feeds. We highly recommend additional testing of flow dynamics, including gravity flow, as ENFit tubes are being developed and adopted.","Hurt, Ryan T; Epp, Lisa M; Pattinson, Adele K; Duellman, Wanda M; Corner, Stephen M; Mundi, Manpreet S",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1177/0884533616679141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913774/,253

The relative importance of HBoV in viral respiratory tract illnesses is not yet well known. OBJECTIVE In this study, we looked for HBoV in pediatric patients to determine the incidence of HBoV as single infection and compared it with other commonly found respiratory viruses to describe the clinical differences associated with HBoV infections in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective study was conducted on children less than 14 years old, admitted with respiratory infection from September 2005 to August 2007 to the Pediatrics Department of the Severo Ochoa Hospital, Madrid, Spain. We studied the frequency of HBoV and 15 other respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates and compared the clinical course of the infections caused by HBoV with those caused by other common respiratory viruses. RESULTS Positive results were confirmed in 435 (61.2%) of the 710 children studied. A single virus was detected in 308 patients. HBoV was found in 99 (13.9%) samples, but it was recovered as a single virus in only 35. Most of patients with HBoV infection (75%) were aged < or =26 months. The most common clinical diagnosis was recurrent wheezing (53%), followed by bronchiolitis (32%). Clinical differences were observed between HBoV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections (children were older and bronchiolitis less frequent), adenovirus (fever less frequent in HBoV group), and rhinovirus-associated infections (less hypoxia in HBoV group). CONCLUSIONS HBoV was the fourth most frequent single virus after RSV, rhinovirus, and adenovirus in children hospitalized because of respiratory infection. It was associated with recurrent wheezing and bronchiolitis showing a different clinical course from other virus in terms of diagnosis, fever, and age.","Calvo, Cristina; García-García, Maria Luz; Pozo, Francisco; Carvajal, Olga; Pérez-Breña, Pilar; Casas, Inmaculada",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31816be052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18574440/,253

87333,Trends in Lung Transplantation Practices Across the US During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-10-30,"The modulatory effects of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are highly variable between subjects. This variability may be due to uncontrolled caffeine consumption and circadian rhythms. Therefore, here we studied if caffeine consumption, systemically available caffeine measured in saliva, and daytime have effects on the excitability and plasticity of the motor cortex. Since both, time of the day and caffeine may mediate their effects via cortisol, we also quantified corticosteroids in saliva. Experiment 1 was performed in caffeine-naïve participants (n = 30) and compared the effects of PAS or tACS with different stimulation intensities on the motor cortex with or without caffeine 200 mg administered in a double-blind fashion. Experiment 2 was performed in regular caffeine consumers (n = 30) and compared the influence of time of day on the effects of tACS (true or sham) on the motor cortex also with or without caffeine administered in a double-blind fashion. Caffeine increased the saliva corticosteroid concentrations in both experimental groups, and corticosteroid concentrations were higher in the morning in caffeine consumers. Gender also affected corticosteroid concentrations. There was a positive correlation between caffeine concentrations and baseline cortical excitability in caffeine-adapted participants, and a negative correlation between poststimulation caffeine concentrations and motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes after sham stimulation in caffeine-naïve subjects. No correlations were found between poststimulation caffeine or corticosteroid concentrations, and plasticity aftereffects. PAS and tACS did not elicit changes in the corticosteroid concentrations. We conclude that moderate caffeine consumption alters cortical excitability but not plasticity aftereffects.

92182,Community psychology and the crisis of care.,2020-08-12,"In today's medical ecosystem, it is vital to measure the outcomes that are most important to the patients. As such, Patient-Reported Outcome Measurements (PROMS) can be an essential metric to deliver high-quality cardiovascular care, particularly in the subset of patients who remain disappointed with their outcomes. PROMS should be a reproducible and reflective report of what is fundamental to a patient over time and across treatments with proper standards in the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of the collected data. These reports can also be sensitive to changes, whether improvements or deteriorations in the quality of care and medical attitude, but a lack of standardization makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions and compare findings across treatments. As a research tool, PROMS can have a significant prognostic prominence, offering a powerful instrument of comparison between different treatment modalities. With the information technology (IT) abilities of today, we can leverage mobile tools and powerful computer systems to perform sophisticated data analysis using patient-derived data and randomization. This may eliminate guess work and generate impactful metrics to better inform the decision-making process. PROMS analyzed by proper standardized algorithms can avoid physician bias, and be integrated in the hospital team work. Therefore, there is a strong need for integration of PROMS into the evaluation of cardiovascular interventions and procedures; and also, establish international standards in the analyses of Patient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life Data to address this need and develop therapeutic recommendations.","Kornowski, Ran",European heart journal.

93719,Teaching Instructional Technological Change to Medical School Faculty: A COVID-19 Case Study.,2020,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Arteriviridae Synthesis of the viral RNA is directed by replication/transcription complexes (RTC) that are mainly composed of a network of PRRSV nonstructural proteins (nsps) and likely cellular proteins. Here, we mapped the interaction network among PRRSV nsps by using yeast two-hybrid screening in conjunction with coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and cotransfection assays. We identified a total of 24 novel interactions and found that the interactions were centered on open reading frame 1b (ORF1b)-encoded nsps that were mainly connected by the transmembrane proteins nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5. Interestingly, the interactions of the core enzymes nsp9 and nsp10 with transmembrane proteins did not occur in a straightforward manner, as they worked in the co-IP assay but were poorly capable of finding each other within intact mammalian cells. Further proof that they can interact within cells required the engineering of N-terminal truncations of both nsp9 and nsp10. However, despite the poor colocalization relationship in cotransfected cells, both nsp9 and nsp10 came together with membrane proteins (e.g., nsp2) at the viral replication and transcription complexes (RTC) in PRRSV-infected cells. Thus, our results indicate the existence of a complex interaction network among PRRSV nsps and raise the possibility that the recruitment of key replicase proteins to membrane-associated nsps may involve some regulatory mechanisms during infection.IMPORTANCE Synthesis of PRRSV RNAs within host cells depends on the efficient and correct assembly of RTC that takes places on modified intracellular membranes. As an important step toward dissecting this poorly understood event, we investigated the interaction network among PRRSV nsps. Our studies established a comprehensive interaction map for PRRSV nsps and revealed important players within the network. The results also highlight the likely existence of a regulated recruitment of the PRRSV core enzymes nsp9 and nsp10 to viral membrane nsps during PRRSV RTC assembly.","Song, Jiangwei; Liu, Yuanyuan; Gao, Peng; Hu, Yunhao; Chai, Yue; Zhou, Shaochuan; Kong, Can; Zhou, Lei; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Han, Jun; Yang, Hanchun",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01112-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30282705/,253

After identification of the entity, imaging must be performed to identify the etiology. Distinguishing external compression of the vertebral artery from intrinsic vascular disease due to atherosclerosis or dissection is critical to aid the clinician in the therapeutic decision tree. Patients with an external compression due to an osteophyte may benefit from definitive surgical decompression and excision of the bony structure. Patients with extracranial disease of the vertebral artery who have failed maximal medical therapy may benefit from angioplasty and stenting which appears to carry a low morbidity. Extracranial vertebral artery dissections can be treated with medical therapy using anti-platelet agents or on occasion anti-coagulation. Rarely, endovascular options are required if a patient is having hemodynamic stroke or TIAs due to flow failure. In such circumstances, stenting and angioplasty may be considered. Intracranial atherosclerosis is best managed with maximal medical therapy due to the high rate of complications attributable to stenting and angioplasty.","Stayman, Aaron; Nogueira, Raul G; Gupta, Rishi",Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11936-013-0228-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23378181/,253

The purpose of this study was to explore the value of CT in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia, especially for patients who have negative initial results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from January 19, 2020, to February 20, 2020, were included. All patients underwent chest CT and swab RT-PCR tests within 3 days. Patients were divided into groups with negative (seven patients) and positive (14 patients) initial RT-PCR results. The imaging findings in both groups were recorded and compared. RESULTS. Twenty-one patients with symptoms (nine men, 12 women; age range, 26-90 years) were evaluated. Most of the COVID-19 lesions were located in multiple lobes (67%) in both lungs (72%) in our study. The main CT features were ground-glass opacity (95%) and consolidation (72%) with a subpleural distribution (100%). Otherwise, 33% of patients had other lesions around the bronchovascular bundle. The other CT features included air bronchogram (57%), vascular enlargement (67%), interlobular septal thickening (62%), and pleural effusions (19%). Compared with that in the group with positive initial RT-PCR results, CT of the group with negative initial RT-PCR results was less likely to show pulmonary consolidation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION. The less pulmonary consolidation found at CT, the greater is the possibility of negative initial RT-PCR results. Chest CT is important in the screening of patients in whom disease is clinically suspected, especially those who have negative initial RT-PCR results.","Chen, Dandan; Jiang, Xinqing; Hong, Yong; Wen, Zhihui; Wei, Shuquan; Peng, Guangming; Wei, Xinhua",AJR.

100893,Is a lecture-free curriculum ideal?,2020-08-27,"BACKGROUND Surgical training in virtual, animal and cadaver models is essential for minimally invasive surgery. Thiel cadavers are suitable for laparoscopy, but there are few data about the use of embalmed (Tutsch method) and slightly embalmed (Thiel method) cadavers in procedures of Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), which are usually developed and learned on swine models and fresh frozen cadavers. The aim of this study was thus to assess the use of these cadavers for NOTES approaches. METHODS The following surgical procedures were evaluated: transanal total mesorectal excision (four cadavers: one Tutsch, two Thiel, one fresh frozen), transanal ileorectal bypass (five cadavers: one Tutsch, three Thiel, one fresh frozen), and transvaginal appendectomy (two Tutsch cadaver). RESULTS The Thiel method ensured tissue flexibility and consistency suitable for performing the above surgical procedures with good results and without complications, with only a small increase in rigidity with respect to fresh specimens. Cadavers embalmed with higher formalin concentrations (Tutsch method) were more difficult to use, due to high tissue rigidity and resistance of the abdominal wall to pneumoperitoneum, although NOTES accesses were possible. CONCLUSIONS Thiel cadavers are suitable for transanal/transrectal and transvaginal NOTES approaches, for training surgical residents/specialists and also for surgical research. In minimally invasive surgery (and particularly in NOTES), integration between cadaver (fresh frozen and/or Thiel) and animal models would represent the gold standard, allowing guaranteed knowledge of and respect for human surgical anatomy and correct management of surgery on living subjects. NOTES approaches to human cadavers may also be proposed for the anatomical education of medical students.","Porzionato, Andrea; Polese, Lino; Lezoche, Emanuele; Macchi, Veronica; Lezoche, Giovanni; Da Dalt, Gianfranco; Stecco, Carla; Norberto, Lorenzo; Merigliano, Stefano; De Caro, Raffaele",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3734-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060684/,253

102187,Using social and behavioural science to support COVID-19 pandemic response.,2020-04-30,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) realities have demanded that educators move swiftly to adopt new ways of teaching, advising, and mentoring. We suggest the centering of a trauma-informed approach to education and academic administration during the COVID-19 pandemic using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) guidance on trauma-informed approaches to care. In our model for trauma-informed education and administration (M-TIEA), SAMHSA's four key organizational assumptions are foundational, including a realization about trauma and its wide-ranging effects; a recognition of the basic signs and symptoms of trauma; a response that involves fully integrating knowledge into programs, policies, and practices; and an active process for resisting retraumatization. Since educators during the pandemic must follow new restrictions regarding how they teach, we have expanded the practice of teaching in M-TIEA to include both academic administrators' decision making about teaching, and educators' planning and implementation of teaching. In M-TIEA, SAMHSA's six guiding principles for a trauma-informed approach are infused into these two interrelated teaching processes, and include the following: safety; trustworthiness and transparency; peer support; collaboration and mutuality; empowerment, voice, and choice; and cultural, historical, and gender issues. M-TIEA's organizational assumptions, processes, and principles are situated within an outer context that acknowledges the potential influences of four types of intersectional traumas and stressors that may occur at multiple socioecological levels: pandemic-related trauma and stressors; other forms of individual, group, community, or mass trauma and stressors; historical trauma; and current general life stressors. This acknowledges that all trauma-informed work is dynamic and may be influenced by contextual factors.","Harper, Gary W; Neubauer, Leah C",Pedagogy in health promotion,https://doi.org/10.1177/2373379920965596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614921/,253

Among those who tested positive and responded to symptom questions (431 incarcerated persons, 3 staff), 81.2% and 33.3% were asymptomatic, respectively. Most incarcerated persons (58.0%) reported wearing cloth face coverings 8 hours or less per day, and 63.3% reported close contact with someone other than their bunkmate.Conclusions. If testing remained limited to symptomatic individuals, fewer cases would have been detected or detection would have been delayed, allowing transmission to continue. Rapid implementation of mass testing and strict enforcement of infection prevention and control measures may be needed to mitigate spread of SARS-CoV-2 in this setting. (Am J Public Health.

A pandemic at the large-scale like COVID-19 places extraordinary demands on the world's health systems, dramatically devastates vulnerable populations, and critically threatens the global communities in an unprecedented way. While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention. The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis. The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases. Finally, further challenges and opportunities for future directions of development are highlighted.","Ding, Xiao-Rong; Clifton, David; Ji, Nan; Lovell, Nigel Hamilton; Bonato, Paolo; Chen, Wei; Yu, Xinge; Xue, Zhong; Xiang, Ting; Long, Xi; Xu, Ke; Jiang, Xinyu; Wang, Qi; Yin, Bin; Feng, Guodong; Zhang, Yuanting",IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/rbme.2020.2992838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396101/,253

METHODS The randomized controlled trial was conducted in 40 county-level hospitals in 2 provinces of China between October 2008 and February 2010. Forty-four service providers were randomly selected from each hospital, yielding a total of 1760 study participants. We randomized the hospitals to either an intervention condition or a control condition. In the intervention hospitals, about 15% of the popular opinion leaders were identified and trained to disseminate stigma reduction messages. RESULTS We observed significant improvements for the intervention group in reducing prejudicial attitudes (P < .001), reducing avoidance intent towards people living with HIV (P < .001), and increasing institutional support in the hospitals (P = .003) at 6 months after controlling for service providers' background factors and clinic-level characteristics. The intervention effects were sustained and strengthened at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS The intervention reduced stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors among service providers. It has the potential to be integrated into the health care systems in China and other countries.","Li, Li; Wu, Zunyou; Liang, Li-Jung; Lin, Chunqing; Guan, Jihui; Jia, Manhong; Rou, Keming; Yan, Zhihua",American journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2012.300854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23237175/,253
110149,The FPM International Awards for Medical Writing in Social Media: a step in the right direction.,2020-04-02,"In the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic, no patients under 24 years of age died, while mortality was greater than 50% in those over 65 years. Greater than 90% of all deaths from influenza A virus (IAV) occur in the elderly (>65 years of age). To address this age-related susceptibility to SARS-CoV and IAV, we infected C57BL/6 (B6) mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) or IAV (PR8), both of which cause severe disease in aged mice. Intranasal pretreatment of aged mice with poly(I·C) (a TLR3 agonist) and, to a lesser extent, CpG, R848, or lipopolysaccharide (TLR9, TLR7/8, or TLR4 agonists), provided a high level of protection [90% to 100% survival rate after poly(I·C) treatment] against lethal MA15 or IAV challenge and reduced pathological changes and virus loads in the lungs at early times after infection. Poly(I·C) pretreatment upregulated beta interferon (IFN-β), IFN-γ, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene expression in the lungs. Intranasal pretreatment with IFN-β or IFN-γ but not IL-1β or TNF also protected aged mice, consistent with the notion that poly(I·C) pretreatment functioned, at least in part, by inducing IFN-β and IFN-γ. We also identified a potential cellular target for poly(I·C) by showing that treatment inhibited virus replication in primary human airway epithelial cells. These results suggest that intranasal poly(I·C) should be evaluated as a prophylactic agent in aged individuals at high risk for contracting SARS-CoV or IAV infections.","Zhao, Jincun; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine; Zhao, Jingxian; Fleming, Erica; Lane, Thomas E; McCray, Paul B; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01410-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22915814/,253
110203,Digital and informatics competencies: Requirements for nursing leaders in Canada.,2021-05-21,"BACKGROUND Preformed nasal endotracheal tubes (NETs) come with a predefined insertion depth due to their curved design. While size indication refers to internal diameter, there is a considerable variability in the corresponding lengths and proportions of same-sized tubes of different manufacturers which is probably based on the lack of data of nasolaryngeal distances (NLDs) in the adult population. Choosing the best-fitting NET is therefore difficult and carries the risk of endobronchial intubation or, on the contrary, cuff inflation at the vocal cord level. The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model for NLD and a selection guide to choose the appropriate NET based on a radiographic description of NLD in comparison to the measurements of available NETs of several manufacturers. METHODS After institutional ethics board review, 388 computed tomography (CT) scan images of head, neck, and upper thorax in a heterogeneous adult cohort were included. Mean distances from the nares to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage were measured. NETs from different manufacturers were measured and compared to the NLD derived from the radiographic analysis. The patients' sex, body height, and weight were considered as possible covariates in quantile regression models for predicting the NLD. RESULTS Data from 200 patients were analyzed. NLD was associated with sex, body height, and weight. A simple quantile regression model using the body height as the only covariate sufficed to achieve accurate predictions of NLD. Validation on independent test data showed that 92.8% of the NLD predictions were closer than ±20 mm to the observed NLD values. Measurements of equal-sized NETs varied considerably in outer diameter, proportion, the nasopharyngeal part, and guide marks. Length differences of the bend-to-cuff distance, containing the anatomically NLD, ranged between 218 and 270 mm at same sizes. CONCLUSIONS A reliable prediction of NLD can be obtained simply by body height, using the formula NLD (mm) = -13.2 + 1.1 × body height (cm). As manufacturers' tube lengths vary substantially, additional information about the bend-to-cuff distance as corresponding tube section would allow for more accurate tube selection.","Massoth, Christina; Schülke, Christoph; Köppe, Jeanette; Weiss, Raphael; Pöpping, Daniel; Dahrmann, Michael; Zarbock, Alexander; Wenk, Manuel",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162158/,253

111350,Reviewing retrieved references for inclusion in systematic reviews using EndNote.,2017,"BACKGROUND Left to right (L-R) shunting through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) can reduce systemic and cerebral blood flow in preterm infants. To minimize this, the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is often raised to increase pulmonary vascular resistance and reduce L-R shunting. The effects of this maneuver on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation are not well documented. OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of different PEEP on the left ventricular output (LVO), superior vena cava (SVC) flow, LVO/SVC flow ratio, cerebral oxygenation (CrSO2) and gas exchange in mechanically ventilated preterm infants with PDA. METHODS Sixteen mechanically ventilated infants of 23-30 weeks' gestational age with L-R shunting through the PDA were studied. Ultrasound measurements of LVO and SVC flow, CrSO2, arterial oxygen saturation and transcutaneous CO2 tension (TcPCO2) obtained at PEEP of 2 and 8 cm H2O were compared with baseline values at 5 cm H2O. RESULTS There was a small but significant reduction in LVO and the LVO/SVC flow ratio at PEEP of 8 compared to 5 cm H2O. SVC flow and CrSO2 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS Increasing PEEP to 8 cm H2O in ventilated preterm infants with a PDA produced a modest decrease in L-R ductal shunting as indicated by a lower LVO/SVC flow ratio. The higher PEEP did not have a significant effect on cerebral perfusion or oxygenation.","Fajardo, Maria Florencia; Claure, Nelson; Swaminathan, Sethuraman; Sattar, Sumbal; Vasquez, Amelia; D'Ugard, Carmen; Bancalari, Eduardo",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000355146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24193163/,253
116287,DAISY: Affirmation of Gratitude in Times of Pandemic.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Adenovirus infection manifests in many ways, with respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms predominating. METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review on children evaluated at our center who had a nasal wash culture positive for adenovirus. Archived nasal washes were retrieved. Polymerase chain reaction for 15 respiratory viruses was performed on these samples. Patients who were coinfected with another virus were excluded. Adenovirus typing was performed using polymerase chain reaction primers directed at the conserved hexon gene. Bead proteomics was used to measure concentrations of inflammatory mediators. RESULTS Seventy-eight patients were infected only with adenovirus. The clinical diagnosis was upper respiratory infection in 60%, pneumonia in 18%, febrile seizure in 8%, and bronchiolitis in 6%. Subgroup-C and B1 infections were most common. Seventy percent of patients with upper respiratory infection and all 5 patients with bronchiolitis had a subgroup-C infection; pneumonia was caused by subgroup-B1 and C viruses. Compared with asymptomatic control patients, adenovirus infected patients had higher nasal wash concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, inducible protein-10, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, monokine induced by gamma interferon, and interferon-alpha (P < 0.05). In addition, we found that IL-8 and IL-1alpha (P < 0.05) were higher in the nasal washes obtained from hospitalized patients than in nonhospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS Adenovirus infection causes an array of clinical disease and is associated with local production of several proinflammatory cytokines. The observation that nasal wash IL-8 and IL-1alpha concentrations were higher in patients requiring hospitalization suggests that these mediators contribute to disease severity.","Moro, Maria R; Bonville, Cynthia A; Suryadevara, Manika; Cummings, Erin; Faddoul, Diala; Kobayaa, Hazar; Branigan, Patrick J; Domachowske, Joseph B",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31819075a6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19319023/,253
116330,Shifting traditional healthcare paradoxes-The case for true system transformation.,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Recent randomized trials have proven the benefit of intra-arterial treatment (IAT) with retrievable stents in acute ischemic stroke. Patients with poor or absent collaterals (preexistent anastomoses to maintain blood flow in case of a primary vessel occlusion) may gain less clinical benefit from IAT. In this post hoc analysis, we aimed to assess whether the effect of IAT was modified by collateral status on baseline computed tomographic angiography in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN). METHODS MR CLEAN was a multicenter, randomized trial of IAT versus no IAT. Primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. The primary effect parameter was the adjusted common odds ratio for a shift in direction of a better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale. Collaterals were graded from 0 (absent) to 3 (good). We used multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis with interaction terms to estimate treatment effect modification by collateral status. RESULTS We found a significant modification of treatment effect by collaterals (P=0.038). The strongest benefit (adjusted common odds ratio 3.2 [95% confidence intervals 1.7-6.2]) was found in patients with good collaterals (grade 3). The adjusted common odds ratio was 1.6 [95% confidence intervals 1.0-2.7] for moderate collaterals (grade 2), 1.2 [95% confidence intervals 0.7-2.3] for poor collaterals (grade 1), and 1.0 [95% confidence intervals 0.1-8.7] for patients with absent collaterals (grade 0). CONCLUSIONS In MR CLEAN, baseline computed tomographic angiography collateral status modified the treatment effect. The benefit of IAT was greatest in patients with good collaterals on baseline computed tomographic angiography. Treatment benefit appeared less and may be absent in patients with absent or poor collaterals. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.trialregister.nl and http://www.controlled-trials.com.

In SARS CoV-2 infection, the immune response is thought to contribute both to the pathogenesis of the disease and to protection during its resolution. While mild cases develop an immune response that contributes to host protection, immunity of severely infected patients is a balance between harmful and protective immune responses. The severity of the disease has raised many questions about the kinetic, amplitude and the quality of adaptive immunity to the virus and its generation during the early phases of infection in severe, mild and asymptomatic patients. The role of antibody and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses have been studied and the development of an adaptive immunity seems to correlate with convalescence. The bioinformatics study of the T and B epitopes of coronaviruses has raised the question of the existence of cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.

119198,Response to: Is a lecture free curriculum ideal?,2020-12-11,"Background: Since its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, which has affected millions of lives. Unlike the disease in adults, the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are largely spared from severe respiratory disease. However, there are children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to that seen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Objective: The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions. Results: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response. Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C. Conclusion: COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality. It has become apparent that children are infected as easily as adults but are more often asymptomatic and have milder disease because of their immature immune systems. Although children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C similar to KD.","Frenkel, Lawrence D; Gomez, Fernando; Bellanti, Joseph A",Allergy and asthma proceedings,https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2021.42.200104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33404385/,253

DESIGN A cross-sectional study involving analysis of baseline data, collected as part of a clinical trial. MEASUREMENTS Two hundred and three participants (mean age = 60.4 [6.5] years, 69.0% female) with mild memory complaints were asked to rate their sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and their memory performance using the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ), which measures self-awareness of memory ability. Neurocognitive performance was evaluated using the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Trail Making Test, Buschke Selective Reminding Test, and the Brief Visuospatial Test - Revised (BVMT-R). RESULTS Total PSQI scores were significantly associated with objective measures of sustained attention (CPT hit reaction time by block and standard error by block) and subjective memory loss (MFQ frequency and seriousness of forgetting). The PSQI components of (poorer) sleep quality and (greater) sleep disturbance were related to (worse) sustained attention scores while increased sleep latency and daytime sleepiness were associated with greater frequency and seriousness of forgetting. CONCLUSIONS Sleep quality is related to both objective measures of sustained attention and self-awareness of memory decline. These findings suggest that interventions for improving sleep quality may contribute not only to improving the ability to focus on a particular task but also in reducing memory complaints in middle-aged and older adults.","Siddarth, Prabha; Thana-Udom, Kitikan; Ojha, Rashi; Merrill, David; Dzierzewski, Joseph M; Miller, Karen; Small, Gary W; Ercoli, Linda",International psychogeriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1041610220003324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985406/,253

123449,Teachers' risk perception and needs in addressing infectious disease outbreak.,2010,"INTRODUCTION The use of biologic mesh where native tissue deficiencies limit reconstructive options has been well documented in the adult population, with increasing use to address the special requirements of complex abdominal wall reconstruction. There is, however, little documented evidence as to the safety and efficacy of these products in the pediatric population. METHODS This retrospective case series details 5 pediatric cases of complicated abdominal hernia repair with Strattice®, a non-crosslinked porcine acellular dermal matrix. Outcomes measured include recurrence, infection, seroma formation, symptomatic bulging, and need for mesh removal. Defect size, mesh size, and history of prior abdominal operations and infection were also recorded. RESULTS Patients received Strattice® with an average area of 132.2 (24-250)cm2 and primary closure was achieved over a mesh underlay in three (60%) patients, while the remaining required a bridging approach secondary to lateral defects. Complications included suture extrusion, requiring suture removal, hernia recurrence without bulge, noted incidentally, and seroma formation, requiring placement of drains. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the use of porcine ADM in pediatric patients appears to be potentially safe and efficacious in the context of complex abdominal wall defects, including those with substantial contamination. Our small series builds on previous reports in this difficult patient population. Although additional study, with larger subject pools, would assist in solidifying the observations seen in this and other series, initial findings suggest that porcine ADM is a valuable tool in the treatment of these complex patients.

128112,"Hindsight Is 2020, or Maybe 2021-It's Still Too Soon to Tell.",2021,"A distinguishing feature of high-grade gliomas is the infiltration of neoplastic cells into adjacent brain tissues that mark most of these tumors surgically incurable. To study the factors associated with tumor invasion, we established a new murine brain tumor model, ALTS1C1 derived from SV40 large T antigen-transfected astrocytes. This new brain tumor model recapitulates several histopathological features of human high-grade glioma including increased cellularity, prominent cellular pleomorphism, geographic necrosis, active mitosis, and extensive invasion of tumor cells into adjacent brain tissues. More importantly, ALTS1C1 expressed a relatively high level of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) in vitro and in vivo and higher microvascular density (MVD) in vivo. To define the roles of SDF-1 in this tumor model, the expression of SDF-1 in ALTS1C1 cells was inhibited by specific siRNA. SDF-knockdown ALTS1C1 (SDF(kd)) cells took longer than parental ALTS1C1 cells to form tumors and in contrast to the wild-type tumors they had well-defined regular borders and lacked infiltration tracts. The SDF(kd) tumors were also associated with a lower MVD and more hypoxic areas. In contrast to parental tumors, the density of F4/80-positive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in SDF(kd) tumor was higher in non-hypoxic than in hypoxic regions. SDF-1 production by tumor cells therefore seems critical for the aggregation of TAMs into areas of hypoxia and tumor invasiveness. This study not only provides new insight into the role of SDF-1 in brain tumor invasion and the relationship between TAMs and hypoxia, but also provides a new preclinical brain tumor model for designing new treatment options for invasive cases.","Wang, Shu-Chi; Hong, Ji-Hong; Hsueh, Chuen; Chiang, Chi-Shiun",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,https://doi.org/10.1038/labinvest.2011.128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21894147/,253
128406,School Nurses on the Front Lines of Healthcare: Infectious Diseases Popularized in the News.,2020-06-03,"Proteolytic processing of viral membrane proteins is common among enveloped viruses and facilitates virus entry. The Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) occlusion-derived virus (ODV) protein P74 is part of a complex of essential peroral infectivity factors (PIFs). Here we report that P74 is efficiently cleaved into two fragments of about equal size by an occlusion body (OB) endogenous alkaline protease during ODV release when AcMNPV OBs are derived from larvae. The cleavage is specific for P74, since the other known peroral infectivity factors in the same complex (PIF1, PIF2, and PIF3) were not cleaved under the same conditions. P74 cleavage was not observed in OBs produced in three different insect cell lines, suggesting a larval host origin of the responsible protease. P74 in OBs produced in larvae of two different host species was cleaved into fragments with the same apparent molecular mass, indicating that the virus incorporates a similar alkaline protease from different hosts. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the two P74 subunit fragments remain associated with the recently discovered PIF complex.

The present study investigated the effect of feeding a trehalose-supplemented diet on the growth performance, as well as the oxidative status and the intestinal innate immunity of juvenile chicks. A total of 16 d-old male broiler chicks were used in this study: two groups of 8 birds were fed on a 0% (control) or 0.5% trehalose-supplemented diet for 18 d. The mean body weight of the trehalose group was significantly greater than that of the control group, but feed efficiency was not altered by feeding the trehalose-supplemented diet. No differences in the levels of lipid peroxidation in skeletal muscle, liver and plasma were observed between the control and trehalose-supplemented groups. The mRNA levels of interferon-γ, tumour necrosis factor-like ligand 1A, interleukin-10, NADPH oxidase 4 and inducible NO synthase were significantly reduced by the trehalose supplementation. Our results suggest that dietary supplementation with trehalose after hatching may have beneficial effects on the growth performance of juvenile chicks, probably by improving their intestinal innate immunity.","Kikusato, M; Nanto, F; Mukai, K; Toyomizu, M",British poultry science,https://doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2016.1166475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26986698/,253

Psychological interventions are often recommended as adjuncts to medical treatment for women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP). This is as women with CPP experience higher rates of mental health concerns and difficulties coping with their pain.. However, recent systematic reviews have highlighted that the efficacy of psychological interventions is not conclusive in this population. This review aimed to identify predictors of mental health outcomes and effective psychological techniques and interventions in women with CPP to inform the development of future psychological therapies. Methods Scoping review using the method outlined by Arskey & O'Malley (2005). Relevant databases, reference lists and grey literature were searched to identify effective mental health interventions and predictors of psychological outcomes for women with CPP. Results Methodological concerns made identifying predictors of mental health outcomes and effective psychological interventions difficult. However, ﻿cognitive ﻿behavioural ﻿therapy and Mensendieck therapy emerged as therapeutic interventions with the best evidence for women with CPP. A number of useful predictors of mental health outcomes and techniques included in effective interventions were identified.

The authors analyzed outcomes and complications following use of a synthetic or biological mesh for abdominal reinforcement following initial harvest or secondary repair of a bulge or hernia. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of all patients (n = 818) who had abdominal flap-based breast reconstruction between 1995 and 2011. Ninety-seven patients met inclusion criteria; 61 had synthetic mesh and 36 had biological mesh (porcine acellular dermal matrix). Complications and outcomes were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed to determine contributing factors and differences between cohorts. RESULTS Overall complication rates for the synthetic and biological cohorts were 6.5 and 5.5 percent (p = 0.61), respectively, with slightly higher bulge rates in patients with synthetic compared with biological mesh (18 percent versus 8.3 percent; p = 0.25). Complication rates in primary and secondary placement of synthetic mesh were 5 and 7.3 percent, respectively; bulge rates were 15 and 19.5 percent, respectively. Complication rates in primary and secondary placement of biological mesh were 6.3 and 0 percent, respectively; bulge rates were 9.4 and 0 percent, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Synthetic and biological mesh reconstruction for primary abdominal repair and secondary contouring have similar, low complication rates. Postoperative abdominal wall laxity and bulge occurred in an equal distribution following unilateral or bilateral flap reconstruction. Early investigation demonstrates that porcine acellular dermal matrix is as effective as synthetic mesh for abdominal wall reinforcement and repair, with limited morbidity associated with each.

Village doctors receive a modest subsidy for providing public health services associated with the package. Their beliefs about this subsidy and providing public health services could influence the quality and effectiveness of preventive health services and disease surveillance. APPROACH To understand village doctors' perspectives on the subsidy and their experiences of delivering public health services, we performed 10 focus group discussions with village doctors, 12 in-depth interviews with directors of township health centres and 4 in-depth interviews with directors of county-level Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. LOCAL SETTING The study was conducted in four counties in central China, two in Hubei province and two in Jiangxi province. RELEVANT CHANGES Village doctors prioritize medical services but they do their best to manage their time to include public health services. The willingness of township health centre directors and village doctors to provide public health services has improved since the introduction of the package and a minimum subsidy, but village doctors do not find the subsidy to be sufficient remuneration for their efforts. LESSONS LEARNT Improving the delivery of public health services by village doctors is likely to require an increase in the subsidy, improvement in the supervisory relationship between village clinics and township health centres and the creation of a government pension for village doctors.","Ding, Yan; Smith, Helen J; Fei, Yang; Xu, Biao; Nie, Shaofa; Yan, Weirong; Diwan, Vinod K; Sauerborn, Rainer; Dong, Hengjin",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.12.109447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23397352/,253

We reviewed research priority setting in the field and the involvement of consumers in this priority setting. METHOD A systematic review following the PRSIMA statement was conducted and eight studies were identified for inclusion; four included substantial input from consumers, and four were researcher led. Similarities and differences across the types of studies were examined. RESULTS Research priorities informed by consumers were primarily concerned with producing better interventions and outcomes. A large degree of overlap with researcher-led priorities was present. The former studies had a greater focus on early intervention, bridging the research-practice gap, and recovery, while the latter were more likely to address diagnosis, genetic factors, brain circuitry, and pharmacotherapy. Priorities endorsed across more than one consumer-informed study included: the role of self-harm, working with health care professionals to increase early detection, supporting transition between services, and six issues about improved treatments. CONCLUSIONS The ED field needs to engage in more meaningful involvement of co-design across consumers, clinicians and researchers along the entire research journey, not just research priority setting.

We investigated the contribution of protein denaturation to the effect of surfactants on barrier function. METHODS The Transmission Index method, which evaluates the actual effect of surfactants on barrier function, was combined with a microplate assay measuring protein denaturation activity. The correlation between the TI value and the reciprocal of the median effect concentration (1/EC50) was analyzed for 19 surfactants. The contribution of protein denaturation to the effect of surfactants was discussed based on the 1/EC50 per TI value. RESULTS A few surfactants showed high TI value. Nonionic surfactants had no effect. The EC50 varied without certain trend. For amino acid-based surfactants, there was a gradual inverse correlation between the TI value and the 1/EC50. CONCLUSION The difference in the alkyl structure and the ion source affected the skin barrier function. Protein denaturing activity of the surfactant was not a critical factor. This suggests that the effect on intercellular lipids was the major factor. However, the magnitude of the contribution of protein denaturation activity varied depending on the surfactant, suggesting that each surfactant has a different mechanism of influence on skin barrier function.","Kubota, Koji; Okasaka, Mana; Kano, Asami; Takata, Sadaki",Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1111/srt.12939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33189099/,253

Here, progerin microaggregate inclusions in the lamina are shown to lead to cellular and multicellular dysfunction. We show with Comsol simulations that stiffened inclusions causes redistribution of normally homogeneous forces, and this redistribution is dependent on the stiffness difference and relatively independent of inclusion size. We also show mechanotransmission changes associated with progerin expression in cells under confinement and cells under external forces. Endothelial cells expressing progerin do not align properly with patterning. Fibroblasts expressing progerin do not align properly to applied cyclic force.

This had led to the development of many bariatric procedures. Nevertheless, the primary surgery could fails due to several conditions. There is no standard re-operative procedure of revision for primary bariatric failure. Re-operate in the place of the primary surgery imply high rate of risks. We have developed a new procedure for revision surgery working only on not previously operated tissue. METHODS We measure the common channel from gastro- jejunal anastomosis until the ileocecal valve. Depending on the measure, we decide the length of intestine to be excluded (biliopancreatic limb and common channel). We interrupt the afferent loop before gastro-jejunostomy and the efferent loop 20 cm below the gastro-jejunostomy. For restoring the gastro-intestinal transit, we anastomose the upper part of the afferent and efferent loop side-to-side and the efferent loop segment to the upper part of the new common channel. DISCUSSION There is no standard procedure for revision of primary surgery. Even, the gold standard surgery Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is one of the most failed procedure (≤ 35%). We have developed the revision for One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (BAGUA) working always in healthy tissue not previously used. CONCLUSIONS A few number of patients with tailored BAGUA for morbid obesity will require a surgical rescue procedure due to excess or insufficient weight loss or weight regain. This new procedure has been proven to be easy and safe, avoiding the surgical difficulties of the classical revision through the scar tissue.","Garciacaballero, Manuel; Reyes-Ortiz, Alexander; Martínez-Moreno, Manuel; Mínguez-Mañanes, Alfredo; Toval-Mata, José Antonio; Osorio-Fernández, Diego; Mata-Martín, José María",Nutricion hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.3305/nh.2014.30.6.8121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25433102/,253

Nurses are found to be vulnerable to burnout, but emergency nurses are even more so, since emergency nursing is characterized by unpredictability, overcrowding and continuous confrontation with a broad range of diseases, injuries and traumatic events. OBJECTIVES This systematic review aims (1) to explore the prevalence of burnout in emergency nurses and (2) to identify specific (individual and work related) determinants of burnout in this population. METHOD A systematic review of empirical quantitative studies on burnout in emergency nurses, published in English between 1989 and 2014. DATA SOURCES The databases NCBI PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge, Informa HealthCare, Picarta, Cinahl and Scielo were searched. RESULTS Seventeen studies were included in this review. On average 26% of the emergency nurses suffered from burnout. Individual factors such as demographic variables, personality characteristics and coping strategies were predictive of burnout. Work related factors such as exposure to traumatic events, job characteristics and organizational variables were also found to be determinants of burnout in this population. CONCLUSIONS Burnout rates in emergency nurses are high. Job demands, job control, social support and exposure to traumatic events are determinants of burnout, as well as several organizational variables. As a consequence specific action targets for hospital management are formulated to prevent turnover and burnout in emergency nurses.","Adriaenssens, Jef; De Gucht, Véronique; Maes, Stan",International journal of nursing studies,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2014.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25468279/,253

The number of new cases reported nationally increased from 897 in the previous fortnight (22 June to 5 July) to 3,791 (6 to 19 July). The large increase in cases is due to multiple epidemiologically-linked outbreaks across a range of settings and locations in Victoria (94%; 3,575 cases), with very few cases reported by other jurisdictions (216) in this reporting period. Of the 3,575 cases reported in Victoria, all except one were reported as locally acquired. The majority of these cases were linked to several outbreaks.

Importantly, the encounter should be family-centred, and the physician should be highly attentive to family needs. The following roles should be applied based on family needs and should not be sequential as numbered. The first and basic role is to inform the family at the earliest possible time and as often as possible. The second goal of the physician is to convey to the family that their relative received the needed therapy during his hospitalisation or in the community. The third goal of the physician is to help the family reach acceptance of the death of their relative and leave the hospital having moved beyond anger and bargaining. The fourth goal of the physician during the encounters is to reduce or alleviate guilt by stating that nothing could have changed the course of the disease and that all efforts were made to save the patient. The fifth role of the physician is to try and help the family as a single entity and maintain their unity during this stressful situation.

Control of thermal spread from the forceps tips into surrounding neural tissues is a persistent concern, as neural tissues are especially vulnerable to heat injury. The purpose of our investigation was to compare the efficacy of cooling mechanisms for four different bipolar forceps and to understand thermal spread when coagulating vessels on the spinal cord. METHODS Immediately following euthanasia, the dura mater of an ex vivo porcine model was opened to expose vessels on the spinal cord for coagulation. Temperature profiles were measured at generator power of 25 W and at fixed 5-second activation times. The bipolar forceps used in this study included regular stainless steel, titanium, heat-pipe embedded, and SILVERGlide forceps. Temperature was measured by micro-thermistor at the midpoint between the bipolar tips, and 1 and 2 mm away from the midpoint along the centerline. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate temperature differences. RESULTS Temperature profiles indicated that heat-pipe embedded forceps create the least amount of temperature increase and the highest normalized temperature decreasing slope after activation. The decreasing slope of SILVERGlide forceps is slightly higher than that of regular stainless steel forceps. CONCLUSIONS Bipolar forceps incorporating either heat-pipe embedded technology or SILVERGlide coating can effectively limit excessive thermal spread, thus decreasing potential injury to adjacent tissues when compared with standard stainless steel and titanium bipolar forceps. Of the two, heat-pipe embedded technology appeared safest, having better cooling efficiency at higher temperature.","Chen, Roland K; Than, Khoi D; Wang, Anthony C; Park, Paul; Shih, Albert J",Surgical neurology international,https://doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.117709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083049/,253

Very recently, it has been demonstrated that their photothermal conversion can be boosted by appending rather long alkyl chains. Despite this behavior being tentatively associated with the population of a nonradiative twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state driven by an intramolecular motion, the precise mechanisms and the role played by the environment, and most notably aggregation, still remain elusive. In this context, we carried out a series of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to achieve a realistic description of the isolated and aggregated systems. Our theoretical models unambiguously evidence that the population of CT states is very unlikely in both cases, whereas the light-triggered heat dissipation can be ascribed to the activation of specific vibrational degrees of freedom related to the relative motion of the peripheral chains. Overall, our results clearly corroborate the active role played by the alkyl substituents in the photothermal conversion through vibrational motion, while breaking from the conventional picture, which invokes the formation of dark TICT states in loosely packed aggregates.","Diez-Cabanes, Valentin; Monari, Antonio; Pastore, Mariachiara",The journal of physical chemistry.

148605,More than a teachable moment: Black lives matter.,2020-06-24,"PURPOSE Since oncological outcomes of transanal colorectal tube (TCT) placement, an endoscopic treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) with acute colorectal obstruction (ACO), remain unknown, this study analyzed long-term outcomes of TCT placement for stage II/III CRC with ACO. Materials and Methods Data were retrospectively reviewed from consecutive patients with distal stage II/III CRC who underwent surgery between January 2007 and December 2011 at two Japanese hospitals. One hospital conducted emergency surgery and the other performed TCT placement as the standard treatment for all CRCs with ACO. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to adjust baseline characteristics between two groups. RESULTS Among 754 patients with distal stage II/III CRC, 680 did not have ACO (non-ACO group) and 74 had ACO (ACO group). The PS matching between both hospitals identified 234 pairs in the non-ACO group and 23 pairs in the ACO group. In the non-ACO group, the surgical quality was equivalent between the two institutions, with no significant differences in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). In the ACO group, the rate of primary resection/anastomosis was higher in the TCT group than in the surgery group (87.0% vs. 26.1%, p < 0.001). No significant differences were noted between the surgery and the TCT groups in OS (5-year OS, 61.9% vs. 51.5%; p=0.490) and DFS (5-year DFS, 45.9% vs. 38.3%; p=0.658). CONCLUSION TCT placement can achieve similar long-term outcomes to emergency surgery, with a high rate of primary resection/anastomosis for distal stage II/III colon cancer with ACO.","Okuda, Yusuke; Yamada, Tomonori; Hirata, Yoshikazu; Shimura, Takaya; Yamaguchi, Ryuzo; Sakamoto, Eiji; Sobue, Satoshi; Nakazawa, Takahiro; Kataoka, Hiromi; Joh, Takashi",Cancer research and treatment : official journal of Korean Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.4143/crt.2018.059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879759/,253
149857,Covid-19: French sidelining of patient associations is a global trend.,2020-10-27,"Applying artificial intelligence techniques for diagnosing diseases in hospitals often provides advanced medical services to patients such as the diagnosis of leukemia. On the other hand, surgery and bone marrow sampling, especially in the diagnosis of childhood leukemia, are even more complex and difficult, resulting in increased human error and procedure time decreased patient satisfaction and increased costs. This study investigates the use of neuro-fuzzy and group method of data handling, for the diagnosis of acute leukemia in children based on the complete blood count test. Furthermore, a principal component analysis is applied to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis. The results show that distinguishing between patient and non-patient individuals can easily be done with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, whereas for classifying between the types of diseases themselves, more pre-processing operations such as reduction of features may be needed. The proposed approach may help to distinguish between two types of leukemia including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Based on the sensitivity of the diagnosis, experts can use the proposed algorithm to help identify the disease earlier and lessen the cost.","Fathi, Ehsan; Rezaee, Mustafa Jahangoshai; Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Reza; Alizadeh, Azra; Montazer, Aynaz","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

In this cross-sectional case-control study, 30 patients diagnosed with tubal ectopic pregnancy in the gynecology clinic of a tertiary hospital constituted the study group. A healthy pregnant control group (n = 30) was formed of age, body mass index (BMI), and gestational week-matched subjects, and a healthy non-pregnant control group (n = 30) was formed of age and BMI-matched women. The groups were compared in terms of demographic characteristics and laboratory parameters including serum zinc (Zn) level, serum copper (Cu) level, serum malondialdehyde (MDA) level, serum catalase (CAT) activity, serum glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, and serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The groups were similar in respect of demographic characteristics. In the ectopic pregnancy group, serum GPX activity and Cu level were significantly lower, and serum SOD and CAT activity and Zn and MDA levels were higher compared with those of the healthy pregnant and healthy non-pregnant groups. The Cu/Zn ratio showed a significant, positive correlation with the serum GPX activity and serum progesterone level and a negative correlation with serum SOD and CAT activity. When 1.14 was taken as the cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity of the Cu/Zn ratio to determine ectopic pregnancy were 73.3% and 80.0%, respectively. Comparing the area under curve (AUC) in the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis, the Cu/Zn ratio was determined to be more valuable than the Cu or Zn values alone in predicting ectopic pregnancy. In correlation analysis, serum beta hCG level showed a negative correlation with SOD and CAT activities and Zn levels. Serum progesterone level showed a negative correlation with serum CAT and SOD activities and MDA and zinc levels and a positive correlation with serum GPX activity and serum copper level (p < 0.05 for all). The current study can be considered of value as the first study in literature to show a significantly lower serum Zn level and higher serum Cu level in ectopic pregnancy cases compared with healthy pregnant control cases. This is also the first study to have revealed an association between the serum Cu/Zn ratio, oxidative status, and ectopic pregnancy. Furthermore, the serum Cu/Zn ratio was found to be useful in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy cases.","Tok, Abdullah; Özer, Alev; Baylan, Filiz Alkan; Kurutaş, Ergül Bilge",Biological trace element research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02327-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803526/,253

The Council of Experts of Neurologists and Rehabilitation Therapists gathered to develop unified approaches to manage stroke patients based on a discussion of practical experience and, taking into account the scientific information on COVID-19 that was available by the time of the meeting. Stroke is a serious disabling condition that requires maximum rehabilitation efforts at all stages of medical care. In the context of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus epidemic, the process of medical rehabilitation and the routing of patients with stroke is undergoing major changes. Combining COVID-19 and stroke requires new approaches to rehabilitation and patient management. During the meeting, a resolution was developed in which the experts formulated the tactics of medical rehabilitation of patients with stroke and COVID-19 at the first and second stages. The arguments of the importance and practicability of carrying out measures of medical rehabilitation at the third stage is given and the need to continue consultations on the indicated topic is revealed.","Ivanova, G E; Melnikova, E V; Levin, O S; Khatkova, S E; Khasanova, D R; Yanishevsky, S N; Daminov, V D; Vasenina, E E; Gurkina, M V",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

The aetiologic agent of COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The 2019 coronavirus is different from SARS-CoV, but it has the same host receptor: human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 was first discovered in 2019 in Wuhan, China, unfortunately spreading globally, resulting in the 2019-2020 pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO).

161448,Chronic Living in a Communicable World.,2020-05-15,"UNLABELLED Breast cancer (BC) consists of multiple subtypes defined by various molecular characteristics, for instance, estrogen receptor (ER) expression. Methods for visualizing BC include mammography, MR imaging, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine-based methods such as (99m)Tc-sestamibi and (18)F-FDG PET, unfortunately all lacking specificity. Peptide receptor scintigraphy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are successfully applied for imaging and therapy of somatostatin receptor-expressing neuroendocrine tumors using somatostatin receptor radioligands. On the basis of a similar rationale, radioligands targeting the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) might offer a specific method for imaging and therapy of BC. The aim of this study was to explore the application of GRP-R radioligands for imaging and therapy of BC by introducing valid preclinical in vitro and in vivo models. METHODS GRP-R expression of 50 clinical BC specimens and the correlation with ER expression was studied by in vitro autoradiography with the GRP-R agonist (111)In-AMBA. GRP-R expression was also analyzed in 9 BC cell lines applying (111)In-AMBA internalization assays and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In vitro cytotoxicity of (177)Lu-AMBA was determined on the GRP-R-expressing BC cell line T47D. SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution were studied in mice with subcutaneous and orthotopic ER-positive T47D and MCF7 xenografts after injection of the GRP-R antagonist (111)In-JMV4168. RESULTS Most of the human BC specimens (96%) and BC cell lines (6/9) were found to express GRP-R. GRP-R tumor expression was positively (P = 0.026, χ(2)(4) = 12,911) correlated with ER expression in the human BC specimens. Treatment of T47D cells with 10(-7) M/50 MBq of (177)Lu-AMBA resulted in 80% reduction of cells in vitro. Furthermore, subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors from both BC cell lines were successfully visualized in vivo by SPECT/CT using (111)In-JMV4168; T47D tumors exhibited a higher uptake than MCF7 xenografts. CONCLUSION Targeting GRP-R-expressing BC tumors using GRP-R radioligands is promising for nuclear imaging and therapy, especially in ER-positive BC patients.","Dalm, Simone U; Martens, John W M; Sieuwerts, Anieta M; van Deurzen, Carolien H M; Koelewijn, Stuart J; de Blois, Erik; Maina, Theodosia; Nock, Berthold A; Brunel, Luc; Fehrentz, Jean-Alain; Martinez, Jean; de Jong, Marion; Melis, Marleen","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.114.153023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25791989/,253

METHODS We searched Medline, Cochrane, and Scopus from 2010 until August 7th, 2020 for articles on remote SDM in the care of any patient using any technology. We also conducted a search for telemedicine articles citing key reports on SDM outcome measures. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, reviewed full text eligible studies, and synthesized their content using thematic analysis. RESULTS Of the 12 eligible articles, most were European with patients with chronic disease or mental and behavioral health. 8 articles used synchronous remote SDM and 1 used asynchronous remote SDM. Themes related to interactional workability of both telemedicine technologies and SDM emerged, namely access to broadband, digital literacy, and satisfaction with the convenience of remote visits. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine technologies may foster virtual interactions that support remote SDM, which, in turn, may promote productive patient-clinician interactions and patient-centered care. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Digitally-mediated consultations surged amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which SDM frameworks developed for in-person use need any adaptation for remote SDM remains unclear. Investment in innovation, design, implementation, and effectiveness research to advance remote SDM are needed.","Hartasanchez, Sandra A; Heen, Anja Fog; Kunneman, Marleen; García-Bautista, Andrea; Hargraves, Ian G; Prokop, Larry J; May, Carl R; Montori, Victor M",Patient education and counseling,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2021.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34147314/,253
162233,Risk Management of COVID-19 by Universities in China,2020,"OBJECTIVES Nasal bone fractures are a common presentation to the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon. Simple, closed fractures are assessed and considered for closed manipulation under anesthesia (MUA #nasal bones). Most departments perform this under general anesthesia (GA). Our protocol changed in the face of COVID-19, where procedures were alternatively performed under local anesthesia (LA) in the clinic, to cope with lack of elective theater capacity during the pandemic, while still allowing a nasal fracture service to take place. We present postoperative patient outcomes on breathing and shape, comparing GA versus LA. METHODS Patient records retrospectively analyzed (January 2020-August 2020), and patients undergoing MUA #nasal bones interviewed by telephone after one month. Exclusion criteria were open injuries or depressed nasal bones requiring elevation. Breathing and shape scores were evaluated subjectively using a Likert scale (1 = very unsatisfied, 5 = very satisfied). RESULTS Two hundred five nasal injury referrals were made (21 MUA #nasal bones under GA and 27 under LA). Manipulation under anesthesia #nasal bones significantly improved both breathing satisfaction scores (GA; 2.88 ± 0.24 to 4.06 ± 0.23, P < 0.05; LA; 2.86 ± 0.22 to 3.77 ± 0.27, P < 0.05) and aesthetic scores (GA; 2.00 ± 0.21 to 3.94 ± 0.23, P < 0.05; LA; 1.64 ± 0.19 to 3.59 ± 0.28, P < 0.05) in both GA and LA groups. There was no statistically significant difference between LA and GA in postoperative outcomes. There was a trend toward greater satisfaction for GA, though this was not statistically significant and may be impacted by the rate of cartilaginous deformity in the LA group. Both techniques were well tolerated and most patients would repeat the procedure in hindsight. CONCLUSIONS Local anesthesia could provide a safer, cheaper, and satisfactory alternative for performing MUA #nasal bones in the clinic for selected patients, particularly with reduction of elective theater capacity in the event of further COVID-19 surges. We recommend training junior ENT surgeons to perform this procedure under supervision with adequate protective measures.","Bastianpillai, Johan; Khan, Shaharyar; Acharya, Vikas; Tanna, Ravina; Pal, Surojit","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561320981439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302744/,253

Sanger sequencing remains the most common and cost-effective option even if the analysis of samples where multiple field and vaccine strain populations coexist can lead to partial or misleading results.The present study aimed to evaluate the different diagnostic outcomes of three commonly used RT-PCR methods targeting two regions of the S1 gene. A possible bias in IBV detection and characterization was investigated in relation to the adopted method, the strain concentration as well as their ratio in mixed samples. Thirty samples were prepared by artificially mixing two vaccine strains, combined at different ratios and selected among four different IBV lineages, i.e. GI-1 (Mass), GI-13 (793/B), GI-19 (QX), GI-23 (Israeli Variant 2).Sequence analysis was conducted both manually and with bioinformatic methods. The result agreement among methods, replicates and analysis approaches was statistically evaluated. Consistent results emerged among the three assays, with few discrepancies likely caused by primer affinity and target amount. This study confirms the complexity of IBV strain identification and highlights the importance of evaluating and updating the available diagnostic assays for a reliable detection of all circulating IBV strains.","Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Franzo, Giovanni; Legnardi, Matteo; Fortin, Andrea; Valastro, Viviana; Lazzaro, Elena; Terregino, Calogero; Cecchinato, Mattia",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2021.1959897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313501/,253

Underwater EMR (U-EMR) has emerged as an alternate technique for en-bloc resection of larger lesions. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing efficacy and safety of the 2 techniques. METHODS Multiple databases were searched through June 2020 for studies that compared outcomes of U-EMR and C-EMR for colorectal lesions. Meta-analysis was performed to determine pooled odds ratios of successful R0, en-bloc and piecemeal resection of colorectal lesions. We compared the rates of polyp recurrence at follow-up, diagnostic accuracy for colorectal cancer (CRC) and adverse events with the 2 techniques. RESULTS Eleven studies, including 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1851 patients were included in the final analysis. A total of 1071 lesions were removed using U-EMR, and 1049 lesions were removed using C-EMR. Although U-EMR had an overall superior en-bloc resection rate compared with C-EMR (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1-3.5; p=0.04), both techniques were comparable in terms of polyps >20 mm in size (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.3-2.1; p=0.75), R0 resection (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 0.74-12.6; p=0.14), piecemeal resection (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 0.74-12.6; p=0.13) and diagnostic accuracy for CRC (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.6-1.8; p=0.82). There were lower rates of polyp recurrence (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8; p=0.01) and incomplete resection (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.5; p=0.001) with U-EMR. Both techniques have comparable resection times and safety profile. CONCLUSIONS Our results support the use of U-EMR over C-EMR for successful resection of colorectal lesions. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of U-EMR for resecting polyps >20 mm in size.","Chandan, Saurabh; Khan, Shahab R; Kumar, Anand; Mohan, Babu P; Ramai, Daryl; Kassab, Lena L; Draganov, Peter V; Othman, Mohamed O; Kochhar, Gursimran S",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.12.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385463/,253

Hence, it is mandatory to explore novel therapeutic approaches. Methods: A single-centred retrospective study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of once daily IDegAsp plus Empagliflozin-Linagliptin FDC ± Metformin in T2DM patients who were non-compliant to BBT after being discharged from hospital post dexamethasone therapy. Results: A retrospective chart analysis performed between 01 June 2020 and 31st December 2020 yielded a record of 67 patients (33 Female and 34 Male) meeting the eligibility criterion. Mean age of patients is 59.63 ± 9.89 years. Of the 67 patients, 59 (88.05%) were non-compliant with 3 bolus doses, 43 (64.18%) with 2 bolus doses and 21 (31.34%) with one bolus dose. The compliance was highest with once daily basal insulin in 64 (94.02%) of patients. It was further observed that the basal dose was sub-optimally up titrated to achieve fasting plasma glucose target and hence 100% failed to achieve their glycemic goals 14 days post discharge. The patients non-compliant with BBT regime and failing to achieve glycemic target post discharge, were switched to once daily IDegAsp along with Empa-Lina 25/5 FDC ± 1 gram of metformin. At the end of 13 weeks, the HbA1c reduced from 10.67±2.1% to 6.85±0.54% (p<0.001) with FPG and PPG both declining from 212.72±52.01 to 118.68±15.54 mg/dL (p<0.001) and 318.22±108.47 to 154.72±27.05 mg/dL (p<0.001) respectively.

Viruses, especially those belonging to a large family of +ssRNA viruses, have a high possibility of mutating by inserting, deleting, or substituting one or multiple genome segments. It is of great importance for human health worldwide to predict the possible virus mutations, which can effectively avoid the potential second outbreak. In this work, we develop a GAN-based multi-class protein sequence generative model, named ProteinSeqGAN. Given the viral species, the generator is modeled on RNNs to predict the corresponding antigen epitope sequences synthesized by viral genomes. Additionally, a Graphical Protein Autoencoder (GProAE) built upon VAE is proposed to featurize proteins bioinformatically. GProAE, as a multi-class discriminator, also learns to evaluate the goodness of protein sequences and predict the corresponding viral species. Further experiments show that our ProteinSeqGAN model can generate valid antigen protein sequences from both bioinformatics and statistics perspectives, which can be promising predictions of virus mutations.","Wang, Yuyang; Yadav, Prakarsh; Magar, Rishikesh; Farimani, Amir Barati",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.11.146167,253

The disease quickly spread throughout China to Europe, the United States, Southeast Asia and Africa. Covid-19 is spread through droplets (particles) that come out through the human mouth when talking to others. This virus can infect everyone if the person is in contact with a covid-19 positive sufferer. So much for the ability of this virus to infect and spread is proven by the record that so far there are still many people infected with Covid-19 with increasing numbers.Method: This research method is a juridical-normative legal analysis. Legal research is based on the legal concept used. Results: The key to limiting the Covid-19 virus is that after knowing that something has been confirmed positive, tracing is immediately done to anyone who comes into contact with the patient. After all tracing is found, then a new examination is carried out whether they are also infected or not. Conclusion: There are several laws and regulations governing the opening of Patient Medical Rahasi, namely Law No. 36 of 2009 on Health and Regulation of the Minister of Health No. 269 of 2008 on Medical Records, which explicitly explains that related to the Covid-19 Pandemic is allowed to be opened Medical Secrets of patients concerning the interests and safety of thepublic.","Wiryani, F.; Setiawan, Y.

These new locations, heterotopic, do not always adequately respond to user needs. This paper explores the relationship between the domestic built environment and certain elements that shape it, the perception, emotional state and productivity of the users. A pilot case study was carried out with 11 volunteers who evaluated their home offices for seven work days using physical environment tools, two tests-fixed data and daily evaluation-. Also, environmental parameters of the territory were monitored. Among the main findings, we observed that the perception of size does not relate to actual size;a balcony is associated with happiness and calm. We have verified how biophilic elements promote well-being. Happiness and calm are related to hight and low levels of lux. There is a tendency of happiness associated with collaborative tasks, and calm with individual ones.

The research was conducted on a sample of 500 adults purchasing PLs using quota selection and the CAWI method. We formulated four research questions related to factors of PL choice, the relationship between frequency of PL purchases, consumers’ age and income, perceived changes in PLs, and evaluation of PL products including sustainability. The latter research question referred to such product characteristics as local and environmentally friendly production, organic production, and production according to traditional technologies using only natural ingredients. For a detailed analysis of consumer behavior, we used Pearson’s chi-square test, the rho-Spearman correlation coefficient, and cluster analysis. The most important factors for purchasing PL products were lower prices compared to leading brands, attachment to a given chain, and the feeling of safety and trust in PL products. The frequency of purchase of PL food products, except for alcohol, significantly negatively correlates with age, which means that the purchase of PLs from the analyzed product categories decreases with age. The increased availability and improved image and quality of PLs were identified as the most important changes in PLs. PL food products were rated by consumers as fresh, minimally processed and with quality certificates.

The interaction of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) with its main host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has emerged as a critical focal point for the development of anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. Utilizing our recently developed NanoBiT technology-based biosensor, we selectively identify and characterize the impact of mutating certain amino acid residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and in ACE2. Specifically, we examine the mutational effects on RBD-ACE2 binding ability, before and after the addition of competitive inhibitors, as well as neutralizing antibody activity. These critical determinants of virus-host interactions may provide more effective targets for ongoing vaccines, drug development, and potentially pave the way for determining the genetic variation underlying disease severity.","Brown, Emily E.

This has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We developed and validated tests to assess the risk of any cancer for 2WW patients. The tests use routine blood measurements (FBC, U&E, LFTs, tumour markers), combining them using machine learning and statistical modelling. Algorithms were developed and validated for nine 2WW pathways using retrospective data from 371,799 referrals to Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust (development set 2011-16, validation set 2017-19). A minimum set of blood measurements were required for inclusion, and missing data were modelled internally by the algorithms. Findings: We present results for two clinical use-cases. In use-case 1, the algorithms correctly identify 20% of patients who do not have cancer and may not need an urgent 2WW referral. In use-case 2, they identify 90% of cancer cases with a high probability of cancer that could be prioritised for review. Interpretation: Combining a panel of widely available blood markers produces effective blood tests for cancer for NHS 2WW patients. The tests are cost-effective, can be deployed rapidly to any NHS pathology laboratory with no additional hardware requirements, and are of particular value during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Savage, R.

To balance between growth and stress response, plants are equipped with efficient means to switch off the activated stress responses when stresses diminish. We previously revealed such an off-switch mechanism conferred by Arabidopsis PQT3, knockout of which significantly enhances resistance to abiotic stresses. To explore whether the rice homolog OsPQT3 is functionally conserved, we generated three knockout mutants with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The OsPQT3 knockout mutants (ospqt3) display enhanced resistance to oxidative and salt stress with elevated expression of OsGPX1, OsAPX1, and OsSOD1. More importantly, the ospqt3 mutants show significantly enhanced agronomic performance with higher yield compared with the wild type under salt stress in greenhouse as well as in field conditions. We further showed that OsPQT3 was rapidly down regulated in response to oxidative and other abiotic stresses as AtPQT3. Taken together, these results support our previous findings that AtPQT3 acts as an off-switch in stress response, which is well conserved in rice. Therefore, PQT3 locus provides a promising candidate for crop improvement with enhanced stress resistance by gene editing technology.","Alfatih, Alamin; Wu, Jiu; Jan, Sami Ullah; Zhang, Zi-Sheng; Xia, Jing-Qiu; Xiang, Cheng-Bin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.961151,253

165697,Creativity and opportunity: how COVID-19 fosters digital dance education,2021,"Chronic stress can lead to many systemic complications and low-grade systemic inflammation including increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is a marker of systemic inflammation and is associated with depression and perceived stress. Elevations can result in weakened immune responses, thereby increasing the risk of complications and mortality from infections. Recent evidence suggests that uncontrolled inflammatory responses associated with COVID-19 are a major determinant of disease severity. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of chronic stress, measured by CRP, on the severity and the length of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective study used medical records from patients admitted to the University Medical Center, El Paso, TX with COVID-19 (n=436 (272M/164F);age 57.3 ± 0.8 years;BMI 29.42 ± 0.3 Kg/m2). Chronic stress was measured by blood CRP level. Severity of COVID-19 infection was determined by the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) measured during the time of hospitalization. Length of hospitalization was determined by the number of days spent in the hospital. Patients were categorized into low CRP (< 3mg/L) vs. high CRP (> 3mg/L) groups and were compared using unpaired t-test. Results: Patients with high CRP level had greater COVID-19 severity, measured by SpO2 (Low CRP: 94.2% ± 0.4 vs. high CRP: 91.9% ± 0.4;p<0.01), and greater length of hospital stay (low CRP: 6.5 ± 1.3 days vs. high CRP 8.8 ±0.5 days;p<0.05). CRP level was also negatively associated with SpO2 (r= -0.16, p<0.001) and positively associated with the length of hospitalization (r= 0.23, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Higher levels of CRP are associated with worsened severity and increased length of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. CRP levels should be considered in laboratory workup for COVID-19 patients and treatment should focus on reducing inflammatory damage.","Kreit, Helen Cherukuri Sundar V.; Mandania, Roshni A.; Deoker, Abhizith Gupte Akshay A.; Mossayebi, Ali Concha Jeannie B.; Jung, Hyejin Wagler Amy E.; Bajpeyi, Sudip",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-885-p,253

NMDAr hypofunction affects normal oscillatory dynamics and synaptic plasticity in key brain regions related with schizophrenia, particularly in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, long-term potentiation (LTP) induction is known to increase glutamatergic transmission. Thus, we hypothesized that LTP could mitigate the electrophysiological changes promoted by KET. We recorded HPC-PFC local field potentials and evoked responses in urethane anesthetized rats, before and after KET administration, preceded or not by LTP induction. Our results show that KET promotes an aberrant delta-high-gamma crossfrequency coupling in the PFC and an enhancement in HPC-PFC evoked responses. LTP induction prior to KET attenuates changes in synaptic efficiency and prevents the increase in cortical gamma amplitude comodulation. These findings are consistent with evidence that increased efficiency of glutamatergic receptors attenuates cognitive impairment in animal models of psychosis. Therefore, high-frequency stimulation in HPC may be a useful tool to better understand how to prevent NMDAr hypofunction effects on synaptic plasticity and oscillatory coordination in cortico-limbic circuits.","Lopes-Aguiar, Cleiton; Ruggiero, Rafael N.; Rossignoli, Matheus T.; de Miranda Esteves, Ingrid; Santos, José Eduardo Peixoto; Romcy-Pereira, Rodrigo N.; Leite, João P.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/763540,253

We find that the rates of mortgage forbearance in the COVID-19 period are similar to those in the natural disaster sample but are much higher than in the baseline sample. In all three periods, we find higher forbearance rates are associated with lower FICO scores, higher DTI ratios, and higher LTV ratios. In addition, higher levels of the cumulative cases of COVID-19 are associated with higher forbearance rates. We also examine the payment behavior of borrowers who entered forbearance during the COVID-19 crisis. We show that most mortgages in forbearance missed at least one payment within the first three months or were delinquent when entering forbearance. However, by the seventh month after entry into forbearance, about half of the mortgages are current, whereas about 40.7% are at least 90 days delinquent. TOPICS: MBS and residential mortgage loans, financial crises and financial market history, legal/regulatory/public policy Key Findings ▪ Mortgage forbearance rates in the COVID-19 crisis are similar to historic rates in natural disaster areas but are much higher than in the months just prior to the crisis. ▪ Higher forbearance rates are associated with lower FICO scores, higher DTI ratios, higher LTV ratios, higher cumulative COVID-19 rates, larger mortgage payments, two- to four-unit and investor properties, single borrowers, and refinances. ▪ By the seventh month in forbearance, about half of the loans have transitioned to current status, but a similar share of loans remains delinquent.","McManus, Douglas Yannopoulos Elias",Journal of Structured Finance,https://doi.org/10.3905/jsf.2021.1.120,253

However, due to COVID-19, people came to realize the importance of such systems that their widespread usage increased drastically. With the growing number of users of video conferencing systems, it is essential to be able to manage the system better. Even though Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has helped in handling the dynamic nature of video conferencing systems by providing the ability to deploy and/or remove virtual instances, being able to manage the virtual instances efficiently and optimally is a necessity. One of the main problems to be solved to achieve this goal is the auto-scaling problem. In this problem, an auto-scaling agent has to decide whether the number of a virtual instance type has to be increased, decreased, or maintained. In this paper, we designed and experimented a new auto-scaling algorithm by using Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. The experiment was done in both emulated and simulated environments. We then evaluated our proposed approach by comparing it with a threshold-based auto-scaler, the baseline algorithm. The results showed that the DQN-based auto-scaler performed better than the baseline algorithm, using fewer virtual instances with a better quality of service overall, as well as being more robust to shifting data distribution. Overall, the applications of DQN on auto-scaling algorithms for cost-effective and high-performance video conferencing systems are promising. © 2021 IEEE.","Gabriela, P.; Lee, D.; Tu, N. V.; Hong, J.

167105,Synthesis and Research of Nanocompositions of Oxide Materials Based on Titanium Dioxide for use as Contrast Agents in Optical Coherence Tomography,2021,"COVID-19 has spread rapidly around the globe. While there has been a slow down of the spread in some countries, e.g., in China, the African continent is still at the beginning of a potentially wide spread of the virus. Owing to its economic strength and imbalances, South Africa is of particular relevance with regard to the drastic measures to prevent the spread of this novel coronavirus. In March 2020, South Africa imposed one of the most severe lockdowns worldwide and subsequently faced the number of infections slowing down considerably. In May 2020, this lockdown was partially relaxed and further easing of restrictions was envisaged. In July and August 2020, daily new infections peaked and declined subsequently. Lockdown measures were further relaxed. This study aims to assess the recent and upcoming measures from an epidemiological perspective. Agent-based epidemic simulations are used to depict the effects of policy measures on the further course of this epidemic. The results indicate that measures that are either lifted too early or are too lenient have no sufficient mitigating effects on infection rates. Consequently, continuous exponential infection growth rates or a second significant peak of infected people occur. These outcomes are likely to cause higher mortality rates once healthcare capacities are occupied and no longer capable to treat all severely and critically infected COVID-19 patients. In contrast, strict measures appear to be a suitable way to contain the virus. The simulations imply that the initial lockdown of 27 March 2020 was probably sufficient to slow the growth in the number of infections, but relaxing countermeasures might allow for a second severe outbreak of COVID-19 in our investigated simulation region of Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality.","Kersting, Moritz Bossert Andreas Sörensen Leif Wacker Benjamin Schlüter Jan Chr",Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00830-w,253

Memory B cells encompass multiple subsets, heterogeneous in terms of phenotypes, origins and precursors, anatomical localization, and functional responses. B-cell responses are conditioned by micro-environmental signals, including cytokines. Here, we analyzed in vitro the effects of two cytokines implicated in B-cell differentiation, interferon-alpha (IFN-α) and interleukin (IL)-21, on the early functional response of four different mature B-cell subsets (IgD- CD27- naive, IgD+ CD27+ unswitched, IgD- CD27+ switched and double-negative B cells). The dual response of naive and memory B cells to IL-21 allowed us to uncover a unique IgD+ CD27- CD10- B-cell population (referred to as NARB+) characterized by the expression of marginal zone B-cell markers CD45RB and CD1c. Similar to memory B cells, NARB+ cells were in a pre-activated state, allowing them to rapidly differentiate into plasmablasts upon innate signals while maintaining their susceptibility to IL-21 activation-induced apoptosis as observed for the naive compartment. Both in-depth phenotypic analysis of circulating B cells, and identification of these cells in spleen, tonsil and gut-associated lymphoid tissues, supported that NARB+ are uncommitted precursors of human marginal zone B cells.","Boudigou, Marina; Michée-Cospolite, Magalie; Hémon, Patrice; Grasseau, Alexis; Dantec, Christelle Le; Porchet, Emmanuelle; Jamin, Christophe; Devauchelle, Valérie; Mignen, Olivier; Cornec, Divi; Pers, Jacques-Olivier; Pottier, Laëtitia Le; Hillion, Sophie",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.31.437810,253

167583,How the COVID 19 pandemic would change the future of architectural design,2021,"Introduction: While most patients (pts) with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) have an indolent course, survival for stages ≥IIB is usually less than 5 years (Kim YH et al, Arch Dermatol 2003). When an aggressive approach of combination cytotoxic therapies and radiation in CTCL was compared to conservative sequential therapies in newly diagnosed pts, the increase in response rate with combination therapy was offset by toxicities, and no benefit in disease-free or overall survival was seen (Kaye FS et al, NEJM, 1989). Since then several novel agents have been approved in CTCL, including the CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin (BV) [in relapsed primary cutaneous ALCL and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF)], and HDAC inhibitors (HDACi). However, response rates of single agents are modest. Tolerable and more efficacious therapies are needed, including rational combinations of active biological agents. Evidence suggests that HDAC inhibition may upregulate CD30 expression (Hasanali ZS et al, Sci Transl Med 2015), supporting the combination of the HDACi romidepsin (R) with Brentuximab vedotin (BV) in pts with CTCL. Methods: In this multicenter phase I clinical trial, pts age ≥18 with stage ≥IB CTCL, good organ function, ECOG PS≤2, <G2 neuropathy, who require systemic treatment, are enrolled, irrespective of CD30 expression. A traditional “3+3” design with 4 dose levels (DL -2, -1, 0, and 1) was used to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Prior HDACi or BV use is allowed. Enrollment started at dose level (DL) 0, where R is given at 10mg/m2 on days (D) 1, 8 & 15, with BV at 1.2mg/kg (max. 120mg) on D1 & 15 of a 28 day cycle for up to 16 cycles. Dose level 1 dosing is R 14mg/m2 and BV 1.2mg/kg, both on D1 & 15. Dosing in the de-escalation cohorts -1 and -2 is as follows: R 10mg/m2 and BV 1.2mg/kg D1 & D15 (DL-1) or R 10mg/m2 D1, 8 & 15 with BV 0.9mg/kg D1&15 (DL-2). Once the MTD had been established, 9-12 additional pts are being enrolled in an expansion cohort to better define toxicities and efficacy. Response is measured during treatment using the mSWAT for skin assessment with every cycle, and flow cytometry and CT imaging after every 3rd cycle for extracutaneous sites. The Global Response Score is used for response assessment. There is a “run-in” phase of treatment with R alone given 14 days prior to D1 (D-14). Skin biopsies are taken at baseline and prior to D1 of cycle 1 to assess changes in CD30 expression after a single dose of R. The trial is registered in clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02616965. Results: At the time of abstract submission, 7 pts have been enrolled (DL0: n=3;DL1: n=3;expansion cohort: n=1). No pt experienced a cycle 1 DLT and DL1 was deemed the MTD. No pts were enrolled in the de-escalation cohorts. Enrollment in the expansion cohort is ongoing. Median age of pts was 64 years (range 51-79);72% (n=5) were male;median ECOG PS 1 (0-2);median prior lines of systemic therapy were 4 (0-4), including 1 pt with prior HDACi, and 1 pt with prior BV and R exposure. All pts had MF. Stage at enrollment was stage IIB in 5 (72%), IB and IVA2 in 1 each (14% each). No pts have experienced G4 or 5 adverse events (AE). The only G3 AEs observed during treatment were transaminitis and fever (n=1 each), both resolved spontaneously. The most common AEs were nausea (71%), vomiting (43%), gastro-esophageal reflux, constipation, peripheral sensory neuropathy, anorexia, fatigue, and thrombophlebitis (29% each;see Table 1). Response assessment is available for 5 of 7 pts. The overall response rate was 80% (4/5), all of which partial responses, including 1 pt who had received both prior R and BV. The median change in mSWAT was a decrease of 59% from baseline (range -19.5 to -81.8%). After a median follow up of 6.1 months, median estimated progression-free survival was 12 months (PFS probability 0.42;95%CI 0.1-1.0). Four pts came off treatment: 2 due to progression, 1 due to non-adherence related to COVID-19 concerns, 1 because of recurrent thrombophlebitis;3 pts remain on treatmen . Conclusion: Preliminary findings from this phase I study exploring the combination of R+BV indicate that R+BV is well tolerated at a dose of R 14mg/m2 and BV 1.2mg/kg given every 2 weeks and appears efficacious in CTCL. Updated results will be presented at the time of the meeting. Enrollment in the expansion cohort and correlative studies, including analysis of changes in CD30 expression after 1 dose of R, and association of response with CD30 expression, are ongoing.

However, at present, very few, if any, empirical examinations of this impact exist. This exploratory study examined peritraumatic distress among a sample of social workers (N?=?3920) in one southeastern state in the United States.FindingsAnalysis suggests that distress is impacted by several variables. In general, participants identifying as male, married, reporting good physical and mental health, working in microcontexts, and who were finically secure tended to experience less COVID-19 associated distress. In addition, social workers identifying as LGBTQ* and who had been working mostly remotely experienced higher levels of distress.ApplicationsOverall, findings indicate the need to provide adept support to social workers practicing during the pandemic. Data suggest the need for targeted support initiatives, typically for those who are from underrepresented groups (e.g., LGBTQ*) or experiencing financial or mental/physical health issues. Certainly, researchers should continue to examine the impact of COVID-19 on social work practitioners and service delivery.","Miller, J.

Additional to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family and a nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain featured in coronaviral RdRp, nsp12 possesses a newly identified β-hairpin domain at its N-terminal. Key residues for viral replication and transcription are observed. A comparative analysis to show how remdesivir binds to this polymerase is also provided.

168077,Self-Isolated but Not Alone: Community Management Work in the Time of a Pandemic,2020,"Wet markets are important for food security in many regions worldwide but have come under scrutiny due to their potential role in the emergence of infectious diseases. The sale of live wildlife has been highlighted as a particular risk, and the World Health Organisation has called for the banning of live, wild-caught mammalian species in markets unless risk assessment and effective regulations are in place. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a global scoping review of peer-reviewed information about the sale of live, terrestrial wildlife in markets that are likely to sell fresh food, and collated data about the characteristics of such markets, activities involving live wildlife, the species sold, their purpose, and animal, human, and environmental health risks that were identified. Of the 59 peer-reviewed records within scope, only 25% (n = 14) focussed on disease risks; the rest focused on the impact of wildlife sale on conservation. Although there were some global patterns (for example, the types of markets and purpose of sale of wildlife), there was wide diversity and huge epistemic uncertainty in all aspects associated with live, terrestrial wildlife sale in markets such that the feasibility of accurate assessment of the risk of emerging infectious disease associated with live wildlife trade in markets is limited. Given the value of both wet markets and wildlife trade and the need to support food affordability and accessibility, conservation, public health, and the social and economic aspects of livelihoods of often vulnerable people, there are major information gaps that need to be addressed to develop evidence-based policy in this environment. This review identifies these gaps and provides a foundation from which information for risk assessments can be collected.","Brookes, V. J.; Wismandanu, O.; Sudarnika, E.; Roby, J.

Design/methodology/approach - General PubMed and Google searches were used to review human rights violations both historically and during the current coronavirus pandemic. Special attention was paid to publications produced by groups dedicated to monitoring human rights abuses. Findings - During the coronavirus pandemic, many governments have used the guise of controlling the virus to silence critics and stifle the press. Though these restrictions were supposedly orchestrated to fight the virus, they have done just the opposite: suppression of expression and press has hindered public health efforts and exacerbated the spread of the virus. By reducing case reporting, allowing for the spread of misinformation and blocking productive debate, violations of human rights to free expression and press have worsened the coronavirus outbreak.

However, neither the catalytic function of selenok’s selenocysteine (Sec), which, curiously, resides in an intrinsically disordered protein segment nor selenok’s specific role in these pathways are known to date. This report casts these questions in a new light as it describes that selenok is able -both in vitro and in vivo- to cleave some of its own peptide bonds. The cleavages not only release selenok segments that contain its reactive Sec, but as the specific cleavage sites were identified, they proved to cluster tightly near sites through which selenok interacts with protein partners. Furthermore, it is shown that selenok’s cleavage activity is neither restricted to itself nor promiscuous but selectively extends to at least one of its protein partners. Together, selenok’s cleavage ability and its features have all hallmarks of a regulatory mechanism that could play a central role in selenok’s associations with other proteins and its cellular functions overall.","Cheng, Rujin; Liu, Jun; Forstner, Martin B.; Woodward, George; Heppard, Elmer; Hoffmann, Peter R.; Rozovsky, Sharon",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.15.444318,253

FYN is a kinase that stabilizes IFITM3 on the membrane, primes APP for amyloidogenic γs processing and mediates tau oligomerization. The purpose of this study is to explore the role of FYN and IFITM3 in AD and COVID-19, expanding on previous research from our group. Methods A 520 gene signature containing FYN and IFITM3 (termed Ia) was extracted from a previously published meta-analysis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) bulk- and single nuclei sequencing data. Exploratory analyses involved meta-analysis of bulk and single cell RNA data for IFITM3 and FYN differential expression per CNS site and cellular type. Confirmatory analyses, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on Ia was performed to detect overlapping enriched biological networks between COVID-19 with AD. Results Bulk RNA data analysis revealed that IFITM3 and FYN were overexpressed in two CNS regions in AD vs. Controls: the temporal cortex Wilcoxon p-value=1.3e-6) and the parahippocampal cortex Wilcoxon p-value=0.012). Correspondingly, single cell RNA analysis of IFITM3 and FYN revealed that it was differentially expressed in neurons, glial and endothelial cells donated b AD patients, when compared to controls. Discussion IFITM3 and FYN were found as interactors within biological networks overlapping between AD and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within the context of SARS-CoV-2 induced tau aggregation and interactions between tau and Ab1-42, the FYN – IFITM3 regulome may outline an important innate immunity element responsive to viral infection and IFN-I signalling in both AD and COVID-19.","Vavougios, George D.; Breza, Marianthi Mavridis Theodore Krogfelt Karen Angeliki",Brain Disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dscb.2021.100022,253
169011,Staring Death in the Face: The Financial Impact of Corporate Exposure to Prior Disasters,2021,"Diabetes, adjudged a risk factor for coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), can be managed through consumption of plantain and its associated products. Plantain is usually processed into flour and other storable/value-added products due to its very short shelf-life. To process unripe plantain pulps into flour, there is a need for size reduction after drying. This paper presents the development and performance evaluation of a size reduction unit for pulverizing, sieving and conveying material to the next processing stage in a plantain flour process plant. Its model was developed using solidworks application software. After design analysis, the model was simulated to establish its suitability/adequacy for fabrication. The pulverizer was fabricated using locally available materials. Its performance evaluation gave 400kg/h throughput, 96% crushing efficiency and 96% efficiency based on the required particle size. The average particle size of flour obtained was 236 mu m using 500 mu m screen. Effect of cyclone control-valve on the pulverizer's overall efficiency was also investigated by allowing it to operate when the valve was completely closed, partially closed and fully opened. It was observed that the control-valve's positions significantly influenced the machine's performance/efficiency. It can thus be inferred that the position of cyclone control-valve has significant effect on a pulverizer's efficiency/performance.

169256,Principles of frugal innovation and its application by social entrepreneurs in times of adversity: an inductive single-case approach,2021,"The viral lineages reflecting variants of concern have emerged worldwide and among them B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants are the most significant ones and merit close monitoring. In Pakistan, very limited information is available on the circulation of these variants and only the alpha variant has been reported as the main circulating lineage. The objective of this study was to detect and explore the genomic diversity of B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 during the third wave in the indigenous population. During the current study, a total of 2274 samples were tested on real-time PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from May 14 to May 31, 2021, and among these, 17% were spike positive, whereas 83% of samples had the spike gene target failure (SGTF). From these spike positive samples, 22 samples were processed for whole-genome sequencing. Among VOCs, 45.5% (n=10) belonged to B.1.351 followed by B.1.617.2, 36% (n=8). The delta variant cases were reported mostly from Islamabad (n = 5; 63%) followed by Peshawar and Azad Kashmir (n = 1; 13% each). Beta variant cases originated from Islamabad (n=5; 56%), Peshawar (n=2; 22%), Azad Kashmir and Rawalpindi (n=1; 11% each). The mutation profile of delta variant isolates reported significant mutations, L452R, T478K, P681R, and D950N. The beta variant isolates reported characteristic mutations, D215G, K417N, E484K, N501Y, and A701V. Notably, a characteristic mutation, E484Q was also found in delta variant, B.1.617.2. Our current findings suggest detection of these VOCs from the local population and warrants large-scale genomic surveillance in the country. In addition, it provides timely information to the health authorities to take appropriate actions.","Umair, M.; Ikram, A.; Salman, M.; Badar, N.; Haider, S. A.; Rehman, Z.; Ammar, M.; Rana, M.

169292,Developing VAT treaties: International tax cooperation in times of global recovery,2021,"Intracellular bacterial pathogens have evolved sophisticated infection strategies, including the release and secretion of virulence factors to interfere with host cell functions and to perturb immune responses. For Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), the type III secretion systems encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI) 1 and 2 mediates invasion of the bacterium into innate immune cells and regulates bacterial replication and survival within the hostile environment of the host, respectively. Here, we explore the temporal and strain-specific dual perspective response of both the host and pathogen during cellular infection via quantitative proteomics. We report time- and pathogenicity island-specific expression and secretion of infection-associated proteins (i.e., SL1344_1263, SL1344_3112, SL1344_1563, and YnhG) and regulated immune response proteins in macrophage, including Cd86, Cd40, Casp4, C3, IL-1α, and Cd69). Through intracellular macrophage and in vivo murine models of infection, we reveal a role in virulence for three of the bacterial proteins (SL1344_1263, SL1344_1563, and YnhG), defining their importance as novel T3SS effectors. We characterize the temporal intra- and extracellular production of the effectors and identify their interaction networks in host cells, representing inhibitory and stimulatory pathways mounted by invading bacterial pathogens. Author Summary The relationship between a host and pathogen is intricate, and regulation of the host immune response correlates with the progressive timing of infection and tailored responses to the pathogen. Relying on detection and quantification of protein-level changes using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we explore the production of known and novel effectors by Salmonella during intracellular survival within macrophage. Our results portray a role for these effectors in bacterial virulence using an in vivo murine model of infection, and we define a dynamic network of interaction between the effectors and host proteins. These interactions reveal opportunity for drug design to disrupt modulation of the host by the invading bacterium as a new strategy for combatting infection. Our approach is dynamic and universal, with the power to alter therapeutic discovery against infectious diseases.","Geddes-McAlister, J.; Sukumaran, A.; Vogt, S.L.; Rowland, J.L.; Woodward, S.E.; Muselius, B.; Gee, L.; Roach, E.J.; Khursigara, C.M.; Raupach, B.; Finlay, B.B.; Meissner, F.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.01.458519,253

The main purpose of this paper is to identify the key directions for the development of the agricultural sector, taking into account the situation of Covid for the period up to 2030. Agriculture of the Republic of Bashkortostan is one of the leading in the Russian Federation with 3.4%. For the main types of food: milk, meat, potatoes, vegetable oil and sugar, the region is completely independent. Despite the situation with Covid, in 2020 the region increased its agricultural production by 5%. the average monthly wage of agricultural producers is about 30% less than the wages of workers in processing industries. In turn, the level of remuneration of workers in the agricultural sector is on average 56-58% of the average for the region, in food processing industries - about 79%. It is quite obvious that an insufficiently high level of attractiveness of work in the agro-industrial complex leads to an outflow of qualified personnel to other industries. But to 2025-2030 the Republic of Bashkortostan needs an increase in the production of vegetables - not less than 30%, fish - 77%, fruits, berries - in 3-4 times.","Kuznetsova, A.","Hradec Economic Days, Vol 11(1)",https://doi.org/10.36689/uhk/hed/2021-01-050,253

Authorities first identified the virus in Wuhan, China. More than 82542 case of Corona virus in China at 31 March 2020. Health authorities have identified many other people with COVID-19 around the world. On 31 March 2020, the virus spread more than 750890 People in the World. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency relating to COVID-19. Since then, this strain has been diagnosed in several residents of world. The CDC have advised that it is likely to spread to more people. COVID-19 has affected at least 213 countries or territories or areas. The first people with COVID-19 had links to an animal and seafood market. This fact suggested that animals initially transmitted the virus to humans. However, people with a more recent diagnosis had no connections with or exposure to the market, confirming that humans can pass the virus to each other. Corona viruses will infect most people at some time during their lifetime. Corona viruses can mutate effectively, which makes them so contagious. Information on the virus is scarce at present. In the past, respiratory conditions that develop from corona viruses, such as SARS and MERS, have spread through close contacts. On 17 February 2020, the Director-General of the WHO presented at a media briefing the following updates on how often the symptoms of COVID-19. However, while some viruses are highly contagious, it is less clear how rapidly corona viruses will spread. Symptoms vary from person-to-person with COVID-19. It may produce few or no symptoms.

170750,Latin American Labor Studies: National Contexts and Lived Realities,2021,"Purpose: This study aims to focus on implementing frugal innovation and its principles by social entrepreneurs to face the challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research paper discusses the case of an Indian social entrepreneur who works for menstrual health and hygiene of unprivileged and rural women in India. The social entrepreneur’s constant endeavor is to create an ecosystem to ensure rural women’s economic and social upliftment through financial inclusion and livelihood training. When faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, the social entrepreneur re-purposed the manufacturing process to produce masks that were the need of the hour. Design/methodology/approach: The research paper is qualitative and follows an inductive case study approach. The underlying principles of frugal innovation are established through content analysis of the social entrepreneur’s interviews and her team members. Findings: The study discusses how adversity can be an opportunity for social entrepreneurs by implementing frugal innovation principles, i.e. re-use, re-purpose, re-combine and rapidity, in times of crisis. Research limitations/implications: One of the major limitations of this study is that it is based on a single case study, as, in the current scenario, this case appeared to be the most suitable one. There is no way to generalize the assumptions of this model. Researchers will have to study the phenomena of frugal innovation in adversity across multiple cases in the future. Also, the study is based on a single emerging economy, i.e. India. Further research may be carried out with such cases from other countries. Practical implications: The proposition of this research paper will help new and established social entrepreneurs understand that the four principles of frugal innovation and their practical application by a social entrepreneur. This will act as a guiding light for the present and future entrepreneurs regarding how one can respond to a crisis. This will also help advance our understanding of the distinct ways in which social entrepreneurs’ activities can help society in times of crisis. The findings of this research paper provide timely implications for social entrepreneurs. To respond efficiently to various crises, it is important to consider its effect on social entrepreneurship. Social implications: The research paper shows that the social enterprise has implemented frugal innovation principles to manufacture the COVID-19 protection items supplied through existing supply chain networks. Also, a social entrepreneur is not intimidated by the sudden changes in the business environment;instead, they look at the situation as an opportunity to do something new. They are always willing to take the risk to innovate a solution that will address people’s problems. frugal innovation, due to its highly collaborative nature and its ability to make the most from limited resources, is the only way social entrepreneurs can create an inclusive, secure and sustainable future. Originality/value: There are several challenges in social entrepreneurship, especially in emerging economies like India. During the pandemic, availability of resources was the major challenge, due to which social entrepreneurs had to find solutions through frugal innovation. This paper provides the practical application of the four principles of frugal innovation implemented by a social enterprise to manufacture and supply Covid protection items. It also presents the practical and managerial implications of the principles of frugal innovation by social entrepreneurs in low resource settings. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Mishra, O.",Journal of Entrepreneurship in Emerging Economies,https://doi.org/10.1108/jeee-07-2020-0247,253

Methods The clinical data of 20 children who were diagnosed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 20 to March 4, 2020 were analyzed. Results Among the 20 children, there were 7 boys (35%) and 13 girls (65%), aged 8 months to 14 years (mean 8±5 years). All these children had no clinical manifestations and attended the hospital for an epidemiological history of SARS-CoV-2. Nineteen children were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nasopharyngeal swabs were PCRpositive for SARS-CoV-2 in all 20 children. There were 4 children (20%) of mild type, 16 children (80%) of common type, and no children of severe type or critical type. The mean peripheral blood leukocyte count was (6.8±3.5)×109/L, and 7 children had an abnormal peripheral blood leukocyte count, with an increase in 5 children and a reduction in 2 children. One child had a decreased absolute value of lymphocytes (0.87×109/L), 3 children had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20-42 mm/h), 7 children had an increased lactate dehydrogenase level (>400 U/L), and 4 children had an increased blood lactate level (>1.6 mmol/L). Chest CT showed single or multiple small nodule shadows, patchy shadows, and ground-glass shadows in the middle or lateral lobe of lungs or under the pleura in 13 children. Conclusions Pediatric cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly occur with family aggregation.

The purpose of this system is the monitoring, detection, and early diagnosis of the COVID-19 disease in a population settling in a target area (city, region, country, etc.). This is done using an electronic device worn by each person (such as a bracelet or a chest strap). In fact, the designed device collects, in real-time, all the necessary biomedical measurements of a person, including their location, freeing them from any hospitalization or use of complex and expensive equipment. These informations are then transmitted, via a wireless connection, to the supervision center which takes care of its storage in a specialized database. This center processes the collected data for each person by running a decision-making algorithm using artificial intelligence and a fuzzy inference engine to detect accurately each possible abnormal change in the supervised quantities reflecting risk factors or indicating the appearance of symptoms characterizing COVID-19 disease. In this case, the control system triggers a warning alarm concerning this infected person and requests the intervention of the competent authorities to take the necessary measures and actions.

Tools to help guide patients during this susceptible time are needed. Methods: To determine whether a smartphone application (app) deployed following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can safely improve the transition to ambulatory care, we customized content on a digital health platform for hospitalized patients receiving PCI which included education, tracking, reminders and live health coaches. We conducted a single-arm open-label pilot study of the app at two academic medical centers in a single health system, with subjects enrolled 02/2018-05/2019 and 1:3 propensity-matched historical controls from 01/2015-12/2017. To evaluate feasibility and efficacy, we assessed 30-day hospital readmission (primary), outpatient cardiovascular follow-up, and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) enrollment as recorded in the health system. Outcomes were assessed by Cox Proportional Hazards model. Results: 1676 patients were excluded due to pre-specified criteria including medical complexity, language barrier, and elderly age. 118 of 324 eligible (36.4%) 21-85 year-old patients who underwent PCI for either symptomatic CAD or acute coronary syndrome and who owned a smartphone or tablet enrolled. Mean age was 62.5 (9.7) years, 87 (73.7%) were male, 40 of 118 (33.9%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus, 68 (57.6%) enrolled underwent PCI for MI and 59 (50.0%) had previously known CAD; demographics were similar among matched historical controls. No significant difference existed in all-cause readmission within 30 days (8.5% app vs 9.6% control, p=0.699) or 90 days (16.1% app vs 19.5% control, p=0.394). Rates of both 90-day CR enrollment (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.30-3.06) and 1-month cardiovascular follow up (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.43-2.34) were increased. Weekly engagement at 30- and 90-days, as measured by percentage of weeks with at least one day of completion of tasks, was mean (SD) 73.5% (33.9%) and 63.5% (40.3%). Spearman correlation analyses indicated similar engagement across age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions: A post-PCI smartphone app with live health coaches yielded similarly high engagement across demographics and safely increased attendance in cardiac rehabilitation. Larger prospective randomized controlled trials are necessary to test whether this app improves cardiovascular outcomes following PCI.","Paruchuri, K.; Finneran, P.; Marston, N. A.; Healy, E.

171700,Virtual onboarding: lessons from the pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective intervention in major depressive disorder (MDD) but requires daily travel to a treatment clinic over several weeks. Shorter rTMS courses retaining similar effectiveness would thus increase the practicality and scalability of the technique, and therefore its accessibility. OBJECTIVE We assessed the feasibility of a novel 5 day accelerated 1 Hz rTMS protocol. We hypothesized that this novel rTMS protocol would be safe and well-tolerated while shortening the overall treatment course. METHODS We conducted a prospective, single-arm, open-label feasibility study. Thirty (30) participants received a one-week (5 days) accelerated (8 sessions per day, 40 sessions total) course of 1 Hz rTMS (600 pulses per session, 50-minute intersession interval) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R-DLPFC) using a figure-of-eight coil at 120% of the resting motor threshold (rMT). Depression severity was assessed on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17). RESULTS Response and remission rates 1 week after treatment were 33.3% and 13.3% respectively and increased to 43.3% and 30.0% at 4 weeks after treatment. No serious adverse events occurred. All participants reported manageable pain levels. CONCLUSION 1 Hz rTMS administered 8 times daily for 5 days is safe and well-tolerated. Efficacy at the end of the course was similar to a standard daily course of 1 Hz rTMS, and there appears to be an additional delayed effect.

In this context, engagement, a mental state to enhance the learning process, has been brought into the limelight. However, the existing engagement datasets are of a small scale and not suitable for education time-series research. We proposed an estimation method on time-series face and body features captured by built-in PC cameras to improve the engagement estimation on small and irregularly wild datasets. We designed upper body features using the facial and body key points extracted from OpenPose. To reduce the influence of the extracted noises from OpenPose, the moving average, the average value of a fixed period in the videos, is used to process the training data. Then, we compose a time-series dataset of online tasks with 19 participants. In the composed dataset, there remained self-reports of participants’ mental state and external observation to confirm the different engagement levels in the answering process. The combined self-reports and external observation results were used as the engagement label. Finally, the transfer learning was used to solve the insufficient data issue. We pre-trained a long short-term memory (LSTM) sequence deep learning model on a big dataset and transferred the trained model to share learned feature extraction and retrain our dataset.

171907,Changes in Stroke Patient's Health-Seeking Behavior by Covid-19 Epidemic Regions: Data From Korean Stroke Registry,2021,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammation consisted of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. IBD is a global disease with heavy economic burden. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disease which spread rapidly and becomes a pandemic. This pandemic situation affects the management of IBD. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 as the etiology of COVID-19 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) as its receptor. ACE2 is found to be abundant in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the small intestine and colon. This causes the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 and interacts with gastrointestinal diseases including IBD. The diagnosis of IBD in patients with COVID-19 is similar with general population with precautions regarding endoscopic procedure. IBD does not increase the risk for contracting COVID-19 nor worsen the outcome of COVID-19. The first step in managing patients with IBD during pandemic is by implicating strict health protocol. There is still a controversy regarding surgery for IBD during pandemic. Medications for IBD are safe during pandemic except systemic corticosteroids. IBD patients without COVID-19 should continue their medications until the goal of disease remission is achieved. If asymptomatic COVID-19 is present, corticosteroid dose should be lowered, tapered, and stopped if available. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) administration should be postponed for 2 weeks.

172156,Detecting Financial Contagion Bubbles in Futures Markets: an Empirical Evidence from Right-tailed Unit Root Test Approach 1,2021,"In traditional classroom education the teacher can easily perceive or obtain the engagements of the students by observing them. Distance education is affected by the absence of such a feedback coming from expressions and behaviours of the students attending the lesson. Aiming at reducing the gap between these two learning modalities, the proposed system analyses student videos recorded by the cameras available on the laptops by which they are attending the lecture. This approach provides aggregated information on didactic efficacy to the teacher, avoiding the need of sharing student video recordings during the lecture. The teacher is therefore supported during the oral exposition of the lecture. The approach proposed in this study has been conceived as a software architecture running on background and locally on students’ personal computers. No sensitive data are shared over the network. It has been evaluated in two experimental sessions dedicated to a sensitivity preliminary evaluation of the proposed instrument and to the assessment of its didactic usefulness by volunteers, students and industrial employees. User evaluation reports, both on student and teacher side, a positive feedback. The discussion can bring to insights and new considerations about learning in general, which is nowadays so significantly forced to change due to COVID-19 pandemic and it could be intended to change even more in the direction of distance learning in the future.","Abate, Andrea F.; Cascone, Lucia Nappi Michele Narducci Fabio Passero Ignazio",Future Generation Computer Systems,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2021.07.026,253

Policy Reform and the Lack of Programmatic Commitment in Peru,2021,"This study aims to explore the process of tourism recovery in the post-COVID-19 period and the role of stakeholders in promoting such a process. Using evolutionary game theory, this study analyzes the behavior interactions and game equilibrium of stakeholders in the development of tourism by constructing an evolutionary game model amongst governments, tourists and tourism enterprises. Then, the influences of different evolution paths and major parameters affecting stakeholders’ strategy selection are discussed. With the aim of illustrating the role of the stakeholders in the tourism sector’s economic recovery under the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the numerical experiment was conducted using the MATLAB 2016 software. The results show that the development and change of the emergent public health events affect tourism stakeholders’ behavior strategy. Moreover, the strategic choices of each player, including governments, tourism enterprises and tourists, are also constantly evolving at different stages of the pandemic.","Yan, Hui Wei Haixiang Wei Min",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169162,253
172306,School Psychologists as Agents of Change: Implementing MTSS in a Rural School District,2021,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global threat and has affected physical as well as mental health adversely. There had been an exponential rise in COVID-19 cases in India from May to October 2020. Isolation, hospitalization, and stigmatization were significant issues in COVID-19 crisis. The literature is sparse on the mental health effects on hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to describe the psychological consequences and coping strategies of COVID-19 patients admitted to tertiary health-care hospital. The objectives were (1) to assess the psychological consequences in COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital, (2) to assess the coping strategies in these COVID-19 patients, and (3) to find correlations of sociodemographic characteristics, psychological consequences, and coping strategies of these COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional qualitative study, 100 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection participated. In-depth interviews were conducted using semi-structured questionnaire. The narratives were coded into themes and correlations of variables generated were done using Chi-square test. Results: The most common themes about the psychological state of patients were loneliness and isolation (56%), adjustment issues in the hospital (54%), and concerns about family members (32%). Patients who had family members also suffering from COVID-19 illness (24%) had more concerns about their health (Chi-square 25.209, P = 0.00) and had worries of their future (Chi-square 7.023, P = 0.008). Females had more worries about family members (Chi-square 16.295, P = 0.00) and had more concerns about their own health (Chi-square 5.71, P = 0.01). The most common coping strategies used by patients were digital communication with family members (82%), distraction (58%), and communicating with other co-patients (30%) to deal with their psychological distress. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection leads to psychological distress due to multiple factors. Timely interventions with support for effective coping mechanisms can help in alleviating the distress. © 2021 Medknow.

A retrospect of a one year pilot,2021,"This paper investigates the impact of the domestic and global outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the trading size of the Malaysian stock (MS) market The theoretical model posits that stock markets arc affected by their response to disasters and events that arise in the international or local environments, as well as to several financial factors such as stock volatility and spread bid-ask prices. Using daily time-series data from 27 January to 12 May 2020, this paper utilizes the traditional Augmented Dickey and Fuller (ADF) technique and Zivot and Andrews with structural break' procedures for a stationarity test analysis, while the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method is applied according to the trading size of the MS market model. The analysis considered ahnost all 789 listed companies investing in the main stock market of Malaysia. The results confirmed our hypotheses that both the daily growth in the active domestic and global cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) has significant negative effects on the daily trading size of the stock market in Malaysia. Although the COVID-19 has a negative effect on the Malaysian stock market, the findings of this study suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may have an asymmetric effect on the market.","Gamal, A. A.

172579,Temporal Variation in Cultural Seismic Noise and Noise Correlation Functions during COVID-19 Lockdown in Canada,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate relationship of social media exposure with prevalence of depression and anxiety among general public in Lahore, Pakistan during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted via Google forms in June-July 2020 among Pakistani citizens aged 18 years. Purposive convenient sampling was done. The questionnaire constituted socio-demographic data, information regarding social media exposure, and scales to assess depression and anxiety. Social media exposure was measured by a questionnaire based on previous literature while depression and anxiety were measured by WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale respectively. Differences in depression and anxiety between groups and their associations with their social media use were examined through Chi-square test. RESULTS: Out of 516 participants who completed the questionnaire, 447 (86.6%) had frequent exposure to social media. Facebook (n=345;66.9%) and WhatsApp (n=224;43.4%) were the most used platforms to obtain COVID-19 related news. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and combined depression and anxiety in the sample was 46.3% (n=239), 45.5% (n=235), and 29.7% (n=153) respectively. Statistically significant association was observed between depression and social media exposure (p < 0.001) and the combination of depression and anxiety and social media exposure (p < 0.05), but not with anxiety. About 56.0% (n=289) participants believed that publishing more COVID-19 related news leads to fear and panic. CONCLUSION: People with frequent social media exposure during COVID-19 experienced detrimental effects on mental health. The awareness about limiting social media exposure during the pandemic and psychological support is required to safeguard their well-being.","Ayesha, Sarwar Sumbul Liaqat Masood H. M.

172897,Crisis Management in Public Institutions - Croatian Financial System and the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"Purpose: This paper aims to draw on Seamon’s(2012a, 2012b, 2014, 2015, 2018) theories on the “processes of place attachment” to understand the influence of place attachment on community leadership and the management of four towns in the Barossa region of South Australia. Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology combines photo-elicitation, participant observation and in-depth interviews with 12 community leaders across four town groups. Scannell and Gifford’s(2010) tripartite model for place attachment is used to segment qualitative interview data to understand the nature of place attachment of community leaders. This was followed by thematic analysis using Seamon’s(2012a, 2014, 2018) six processes of place attachment to understand how the dynamics of place attachment as a series of processes interact to influence community leadership and place-based action. Findings: The research revealed that community leaders in the Barossa region regularly confront a tension between the “Being” and “Becoming” of Place. It also suggests that place attachment for new residents is accelerated by engaging multiple place attachment processes;these can be measured using the research methodology in this study. The result is a tipping point where place leadership from new residents can accelerate towards the “Being of Place” showing a tendency towards protectionist behaviour commonly seen amongst long-term residents. Research limitations/implications: Testing the findings in this paper in other rural regions and other cultural contexts will add further insight and validation of these findings. It is recommended that future research could further develop this approach through engaging multiple place-based community groups in the same town and across different locations to understand the pattern language of communities with more accuracy. Practical implications: This study has enabled a deeper understanding of place-based community groups and their motivations to protect the status quo or promote change in the development and management of the place. Each community requires a tailored approach to place management and development to activate community resources and partnerships successfully. This research also provides knowledge on how to accelerate place attachment for new residents to improve their sense of belonging, value and purpose by engaging programs that engage all six place attachment processes. Social implications: The research reveals that place relations are dynamic, complex and often political. Rural towns display a pattern language for how they engage networks and resources that government needs to understand to engage community stewardship of place – its social, environmental and economic setting. This research offers a method to better understand the pattern language of place attachment that drives community leadership and place management to help communities sustain themselves and adapt to change. Originality/value: The research explores the inter-relationship between the place attachment of community leaders and their response to change from different types of community impacts such as bushfires or the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding these processes is valuable in informing place management partnerships between community, business and government. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Grocke, C.

The Development and Validation of Online COPUS",2021-07-23,"The global pandemic due to COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) has brought significant disruption to society and the environment. In this study, evidence from newspapers, social media, remote sensing and organisational data were used to assess the impact of national lockdown on forest and wildlife conservation, including the forest-dependent people in Bangladesh. The nationwide lockdown worsened the non-forest income-generating activities of the forest-dependent communities leading to increased pressure on neighbouring forests. Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) data reveal spurred deforestation alerts in May 2020, and about 222 ha forest area had been cleared during January to October 2020, which is 8% more than the whole year of 2019. Despite some positive information about free movement of wildlife in the forest, a total of 112 animals were killed, which is 28 times more than that of the same period in 2019. At the same time, wildlife rescuing plummeted by more than 40%. Complete banning of tourism activities brought a significant reduction in income and employment, leading to collapse of the tourism industry. Lack of tourists, on the other hand, brought a blessing to the wildlife, allowing them to roam freely. Both air and water quality were improved in Dhaka city, and increased aquatic wildlife activities were recorded in some major rivers. The forest department's revenue shrank substantially during the lockdown period than that of the previous year. This study highlighted a substantial impact on all aspects of forest and wildlife conservation and on the forest-dependent people, which might be a pitfall for attaining the achievements of national and international conservation goals and treaties. Furthermore, the research highlighted policy implications that would be effective in minimizing pandemic-wrought threats and maintain and foster conservation activities in different forests in Bangladesh.","Rahman, M.

A two-stage research method design is adopted, with an exploratory netnography stage followed by 13 semi-structured interviews to gain a deeper insight. Five themes emerge that are either direct substitutions for the physical closing of the pub venues (online social drinking and pub-dating alternatives), or they were indirect effects of the substituting venues (in-the-home drinking, different drinks in the home and no work-related substitutions). The findings show that drinking in pubs is a functional as well as a symbolic act. Key stakeholders are recommended to remain in contact with customers through blended online and offline activities to help keep the pubs relevant to them. This will benefit the pub sector long after the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.","Gordon-Wilson, S.",International Journal of Hospitality Management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2021.102998,253

Leveraging the trip data of the Divvy bike sharing system in Chicago, this study sets to explore the change of ridership that COVID-19 has brought and the built environment factors that influence the spatial variation of ridership under the pandemic. Results show that the ridership declines by xx% in total. To account for the spatially heterogeneous relationship between the built environment and the ridership, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and the semi-parametric GWR (S-GWR) model are constructed. By comparing the model results, we find that the S-GWR model outperforms the GWR and the multiple linear regression model. The results of the S-GWR model indicates that education employment density, distance to subway, COVID-19 cases and ridership before COVID-19 are global variables. The ridership between residential density, office employment density and the ridership vary across space. The results of this study could provide useful reference to transportation planners and bike sharing operators to determine the high bike sharing demand area under the pandemic and to make adjustment on the locations and capacity of the stations and the rebalancing schemes accordingly.

It will suggest that themes of disease, destruction and death resonate throughout her writing to a much greater extent than has been previously acknowledged.","Blowfield, C.",Bronte Studies,https://doi.org/10.1080/14748932.2021.1875627,253
175537,The Emergence of Covid-19 and Capital Market Reaction: an Emerging Market Scenario Analysis,2021,"Early vaccination of the general population is a very crucial aspect in the successful mitigation of highly infectious diseases, as it is the case of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The perception of possible side-effects from early batches of vaccines, presumably under-tested, is often a hindering factor for people not in high-risk categories to opt-in for early vaccination. In this work, early vaccination is formulated under a game-theoretic view with preference ranking and expectation maximization, in order to explore the constraints and conditions under which individuals are keen to opt-in for getting vaccinated. Although simple preference ranking leads to purely non-cooperative / non-altruistic Nash equilibrium, stable cooperative strategies can emerge under simple constraints on the payoffs, specifically the individual cost from possible side-effects versus the collective gain for the community (`herd') when endorsing vaccination by default.","Georgiou, H.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.25.20238725v1?rss=1,253
175632,Effect of the surgical mask on the inhaled CO2concentration: A high school lab experiment,2021,"The pandemic of Covid-19 detected for the first time in early March in Indonesia has been making people stay at home. It affects almost every sector, including higher education. Lecturer, staff, and students have been pushed to work and study from home. There are many approaches from the government, and the ultimate method is a full and partial lockdown. During March to May, with these techniques, it is not only can be temporary slow-down the case but also improved the quality of air. We have two fixed stations at Telkom University (-6.970, 107.629), with an altitude of around 650 and 670 m above sea level, respectively. Those locations were influenced by residential and industrial pollution under not so much open green spaces. Low-cost PM2.5 and CO2 sensors were deployed as well as monitoring meteorological parameters through cheap detectors. The system was equipped by an Internet of Things (IoT)-based modem for data transferring via the internet every 2-min. Results showed that PM2.5 mass concentrations were lower than usual cased in that location. Meanwhile, no significant evidence that the level concentration of CO2 is decreased. The decreasing mobility of people working and studying from home have been making less dirty air. It means that fewer aerosols can be identified in the air. The complex behavior between those polluted air and meteorological conditions have been tried to analyze, but no direct evidence that better air quality makes the outbreak is slowing down.","Chandra, I.; Hidayat, D.

175637,Pharmacy Impact on Covid-19 Vaccination Progress Using Machine Learning Approach,2021,"Introduction: Trigger finger is a common and functionally limiting disorder. Finger immobilization using an orthotic device is one of the conservative treatment options for treating this condition. The most common orthosis previously described for trigger finger is metacarpophalangeal joint immobilization. There are limited studies describing the effectiveness of proximal interphalangeal joint orthosis for treatment of trigger finger. Methods: This study was a single group pretest-posttest design. Adult patients with single digit idiopathic trigger finger were recruited and asked to wear a full-time orthoses for 6 weeks. The pre- and post-outcome measures included Quick-DASH score, the Stages of Stenosing Tenosynovitis (SST), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, the number of triggering events in ten active fists, and participant satisfaction with symptom improvement. Orthotic devices were made with thermoplastic material fabricated with adjustable Velcro tape at the dorsal side. All participants were given written handouts on this disease, orthotic care and gliding exercises. Paired t-tests were used to determine changes in outcome measures before and after wearing the orthosis. Results: There were 30 participants included in this study. Evaluation after the use of PIP joint orthosis at 6 weeks revealed that there were statistically significant improvements in Quick-DASH score from enrolment (mean difference −29.0 (95%CI −34.5 to −23.4);p < 0.001), SST (mean difference −1.4 (95%CI −1.8 to −1.0);p < 0.001) and VAS (mean difference −3.4 (95%CI −4.3 to −2.5);p < 0.001). There were no serious adverse events and patient satisfaction with the treatment was high. Conclusions: Despite our small study size, the use of proximal interphalangeal joint orthosis for 6 weeks resulted in statistically significant improvements in function, pain and triggering, and also high rates of acceptance in patients with isolated idiopathic trigger finger.","Pataradool, K.; Lertmahandpueti, C.",Hand Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1177/17589983211018717,253

176108,Perilaku orangtua dalam upaya pencegahan COVID-19 pada anak,2021,"During a disease outbreak, healthcare workers (HCWs) are essential to treat infected individuals. However, these HCWs are themselves susceptible to contracting the disease. As more HCWs get infected, fewer are available to provide care for others, and the overall quality of care available to infected individuals declines. This depletion of HCWs may contribute to the epidemic's severity. To examine this issue, we explicitly model declining quality of care in four differential equation-based SIR-type models with vaccination. We assume that vaccination, recovery, and survival rates are affected by quality of care delivered. We show that explicitly modelling healthcare workers and accounting for declining quality of care significantly alters model-predicted disease outcomes, specifically case counts and mortality. Models neglecting the decline of quality of care resulting from infection of HCWs may significantly under-estimate cases and mortality. These models may be useful to inform health policy that may differ for healthcare workers and the general population. Models accounting for declining quality of care may therefore improve the management interventions considered to mitigate the effects of a future outbreak.","Phadke, I.; McKee, A.; Conway, J.

176165,Compounding hazards and intersecting vulnerabilities: experiences and responses to extreme heat during COVID-19,2021,"Background: COVID-19 has been shown to significantly affect the vulnerable population [1,2]. Among them, patients suffering from inflammatory rheumatic diseases, and especially the immunosuppressed [3]. Objectives: to assess the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the course and the treatment of rheumatic inflammatory diseases. Methods: from February to December 2020, 46 patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases were included (32 female) that got infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Mean age was 65 years old, 17 were smokers, 12 had arterial hypertension, 8 diabetes mellitus, and 3 hypothyroidism. Most of them had their comorbidities well-controlled and their rheumatic disease was in remission. More specifically, 24 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, 13 psoriatic arthritis, and 9 ankylosing spondylitis. All patients were under treatment with conventional synthetic (cs) and/or biological (b) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), while 7 of them were also on treatment with glucocorticoids (GC) (<5mg/day). Twenty-eight patients were on tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors (19 as monotherapy), 4 on anti-interleukin (IL)-6 monotherapy, 3 on Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors plus on low dose methotrexate (MTX), and the rest (11 patients) were on a csDMARD with or without GCs. Results: positive patients with the SARS-CoV-2, instructed to discontinue their immunosuppressive treatment, except GCs that were adjusted for their disease. Most patients (37 out of 46) had a mild disease course and their symptomatology was nothing more than a simple flu-like syndrome. Furthermore, on 9 of them olfactory dysfunction and gastrointestinal manifestations as well as low grade fever were noted but without the need of a hospital admission. On the other hand, only 5 patients needed hospitalization (2 on MTX monotherapy and 3 on combination therapy) due to dyspnea with low oxygen saturation (hypoxemia) and high fever. From those 5, 3 had a short in-hospital stay, while 2 developed pneumonia and a longer in-hospital stay was required in order to get the appropriate treatment. None of the patients did not require an intensive care unit admission. Finally, in 14 patients that got infected from February to May 2020, viral antibodies had been measured. All patients had high titres of IgG antibodies in their serum for as long as six months after their infection. Of note, none of the infected patients were smokers. Conclusion: patients with rheumatic diseases that are in remission using low doses of GCs and DMARDs, have almost the same chances with the general population to have a serious course of their infection with the SARS-Cov-2. In addition, in these patients, the immune response appears to be adequate, both in the production and maintenance of antibodies, which appear to be maintained for at least 6 months after infection.","Pelechas, E.; Kaltsonoudis, E.; Migos, M.; Karagianni, P.; Kavvadias, A.; Voulgari, P.; Drosos, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1691,253

(Special Issue: COVID-19 as a catalyst for a sustainability transition.),2020,"COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the lives of the citizens worldwide. Epidemiologists, policy makers and clinicians need to understand public concerns and sentiment to make informed decisions and adopt preventive and corrective measures to avoid critical situations. In the last few years, social media become a tool for spreading the news, discussing ideas and comments on world events. In this context, social media plays a key role since represents one of the main source to extract insight into public opinion and sentiment. In particular, Twitter has been already recognized as an important source of health-related information, given the amount of news, opinions and information that is shared by both citizens and official sources. However, it is a challenging issue identifying interesting and useful content from large and noisy text-streams. The study proposed in the paper aims to extract insight from Twitter by detecting the most discussed topics regarding COVID-19. The proposed approach combines peak detection and clustering techniques. Tweets features are first modeled as time series. After that, peaks are detected from the time series, and peaks of textual features are clustered based on the co-occurrence in the tweets. Results, performed over real-world datasets of tweets related to COVID-19 in US, show that the proposed approach is able to accurately detect several relevant topics of interest, spanning from health status and symptoms, to government policy, economic crisis, COVID-19-related updates, prevention, vaccines and treatments. © 2021 ACM.","Comito, C.","25th International Database Applications and Engineering Symposium, IDEAS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3472163.3472169,253

In patients treated with clozapine, COVID-19 infection may result in complications including an increased risk of pneumonia, clozapine toxicity, and disruption to clozapine treatment by COVID-19 induced lymphopenia.ObjectivesWe report 5 cases of elevated clozapine levels occurring in patients with COVID-19 infection who had been previously managed for several years on stable doses.MethodsSubjects: 48 admitted patients to a long-stay psychiatric unit. COVID-19 infection confirmed by positive nasopharyngeal swab for viral ribonucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2. Hematological controls between March and April 2020.Results16 patients (33%) treated with clozapine.18 patients (37’5%) had COVID-19 infection, of which 5 (10’4%) were treated with clozapine. Results are presented in table 1. Increases in plasma clozapine levels were observed in all cases (49’38 to 307.5%). We don’t have the clozapine levels of a patient who presented a pneumonia requiring admission and treatment in the general hospital. Two cases of neutropenia were observed, of which one had to discontinue treatment with clozapine. In the other three patients the dose of clozapine was reduced and they did not present haematological or intoxication complications that required further adjustments.ConclusionsCovid-19 infection is associated with increased serum clozapine levels by probably multifactorial mechanisms (systemic infection, reduced smoking). Importance of full clinical assessment of suspected COVID-19 infection in clozapine treated patients, including assessment clozapine level, and full blood count. The general recommendation is to reduce the dose of clozapine in this patients.","Marti Bonany, J.; Pérez Sánchez, E.; Pérez Carre, M.; Martínez Casamitjana, M. I.; Fortuny Olive, J.

Methods A multi-centered facility based study was conducted among 1440 participants aged 40+ years attending chronic outpatient medical care. Two complimentary methods (interview and review of medical records) were employed to collect the data on socio-demographic, behavioral and disease related characteristics. The data were analyzed by STATA V.16 and R Software V.4.1.0. We run descriptive statistics and fitted logistic regression and latent class analyses (LCA) models to determine associated factors and patterns of multimorbidity. Statistical significance was considered at p-value ,<=0.05. Results The magnitude of individual chronic conditions ranged from 1.4% to 37.9%, and multimorbidity was identified in 54.8% (95% CI=52.2%-57.4%) of the sample. The likelihood of developing multimorbidity was higher among participants aged from 45-54 years (AOR: 1.5, 95%CI= 1.1, 2.1), 55-64 years (AOR: 2.5, 95%CI=1.7, 3.5) and 65 years or more (AOR: 2.4, 95%CI=1.7, 3.5), among individuals classified as overweight (AOR: 1.6, 95%CI=1.2, 2.1) or obese (AOR: 1.9, 95%CI=1.3, 3.0) and among those individuals who believe in external locus of control (AOR: 1.8, 95%CI=1.3, 2.5). Four patterns of multimorbidity were identified, the cardiovascular category being the largest class (50.2%), followed by the metabolic group (32.6%). Advanced age, overweight and obesity predicted latent class membership, adjusting for relevant confounding factors. Conclusion The magnitude of multimorbidity in this study was high. The most frequently diagnosed chronic conditions shaped the patterns of multimorbidity. Advanced age, overweight and obesity were the factors profoundly associated with multimorbidity. Health service organization and provision in the study area need to be oriented by the realities in disease burden and pattern of multimorbidity. Further research is required to better understand the impact of multimorbidity on individuals well-being, survival and health service delivery.","Eyowas, F. A.; Schneider, M.; Balcha, S.

We trained a decision-making model based on the convolutional neural networks and bi-directional long short term memory networks, and based on this model, we progressively aligned the input sequences by calculating different posterior probability matrixes. To test the accuracy of this approach, we have implemented a multiple sequence alignment tool called DLPAlign and compared its performance with eleven leading alignment methods on three empirical alignment benchmarks (BAliBASE, OXBench and SABMark). Our results show that DLPAlign can get the best total-column scores on the three benchmarks. When evaluated against the 711 low similarity families with average PID ≤ 30%, DLPAlign improved about 2.8% over the second-best MSA software. Besides, we also compared the performance of DLPAlign and other alignment tools on a real-life application, namely protein secondary structure prediction on four protein sequences related to SARS-COV-2, and DLPAlign provides the best result in all cases.","Kuang, Mengmeng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.16.207951,253

178560,Impact of COVID-19 on Urban Energy Consumption of Commercial Tourism City,2021,"Out of nowhere the COVID-19 pandemic has turned people's everyday lives upside down. Public places in urban areas were closed. However, leaving the house for recreational and leisure purposes in nature was still allowed in Germany - even during lockdown in March and April of 2020. As a result, urban forests have gained unprecedented importance - not only for recreational activities, but also for maintaining social contacts and coping with psychological stress. With these diverse requirements, many people have appropriated urban forests in new and changed ways. Using the example of the forests around the southern German city of Freiburg, a team of researchers from the Department of Societal Change at the Forest Research Institute Baden-Wurttemberg (FVA) carried out a mixed-method study to investigate how these appropriation practices are working and to shed some light on the relevance of forests for city residents in these circumstances. In addition to the statistical analysis of an online questionnaire, ethnographic observation data and Instagram posts were analyzed. This methodological triangulation was carried out in order to purposefully combine the strengths of each method while at the same time reducing the intrinsic biases and blind spots. This resulted in a better understanding of the importance of urban forest during this extraordinary period of time. Our results show that urban forests became critically important during the lockdown. Many visitors appropriated the forest with very different motives and for different purposes. For many visitors, the forest provided the same functions during this extraordinary period that public spaces otherwise do. The forest was not only consumed as a natural space, but also constructed by visitors as a social space. We can illustrate how this social meaning was both negotiated and reproduced. To provide an abstraction of our results, we refer to the theory of spatial appropriation as well as to new approaches in sociology of space that conceptualize space as a network of social relations. These results give rise to broader questions for future research projects, recreational forest research, forest and health, and forest planning.","Weinbrenner, H.; Breithut, J.; Hebermehl, W.; Kaufmann, A.; Klinger, T.; Palm, T.; Wirth, K.",Frontiers in Forests and Global Change,https://doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2021.672909,253

178814,Macroeconomic Effects of Trade Tariffs: A Case Study of the U.S.-China Trade War Effects on the Economy of the United States,2020,"Background: Heart failure (HF) is a complex syndrome associated with significant morbidity and healthcare costs. Electronic health records (EHRs) are widely used to identify patients with HF and other phenotypes. Despite widespread use of EHRs for phenotype algorithm development, it is unclear if the characteristics of identified populations mirror those of clinically observed patients and reflect the known spectrum of HF phenotypes. Methods: We performed a subanalysis within a larger systematic evidence review to assess the different methods used for HF algorithm development and their application to research and clinical care. We queried PubMed for articles published up to November 2020. Out of 318 studies screened, 25 articles were included for primary analysis and 15 studies using only International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes were evaluated for secondary analysis. Results are reported descriptively. Results: HF algorithms were most often developed at academic medical centers and the V.A. One health system was responsible for 8 of 10 HF algorithm studies. HF and congestive HF were the most frequent phenotypes observed and less frequently, specific HF subtypes and acute HF. Diagnoses were the most common data type used to identify HF patients and echocardiography was the second most frequent. The majority of studies used rule-based methods to develop their algorithm. Few studies used regression or machine learning methods to identify HF patients. Validation of algorithms varied considerably: only 52.9% of HF and 44.4% of HF subtype algorithms were validated, but 75% of acute HF algorithms were. Demographics of any study population were reported in 68% of algorithm studies and 53% of ICD-only studies. Fewer than half reported demographics of their HF algorithm-identified population. Of those reporting, most identified majority male (>50%) populations, including both algorithms for HF with preserved ejection fraction. Conclusion: There is significant heterogeneity in phenotyping methodologies used to develop HF algorithms using EHRs. Validation of algorithms is inconsistent but largely relies on manual review of patient records. The concentration of algorithm development at one or two sites may reduce potential generalizability of these algorithms to identify HF patients at non-academic medical centers and in populations from underrepresented regions. Differences between the reported demographics of algorithm-identified HF populations those expected based on HF epidemiology suggest that current algorithms do not reflect the full spectrum of HF patient populations.","Levinson, R.

Design/methodology/approach: Using sentiment analysis, the impact of COVID-19 on CSR actions is analysed through reactions to the news published on Twitter by a sample of Italian news agencies. Findings: The analysis indicates that the actions most appreciated are those that are more radical, e.g. where the company has converted part of its production to make goods that are useful in dealing with the COVID-19 emergency. The study identifies a new category of actions definable as “crisis-shaped CSR.” Practical implications: This is one of the first studies concerning the effects of the pandemic on both CSR actions and organizational legitimacy.

178844,Pandemic Crisis Malaysian Takaful Market,2021,"Transposons are parasitic genetic elements that frequently hijack key cellular processes of the host. HMGXB4 is a Wnt signalling-associated HMG-box protein, previously identified as a transcriptional regulating host factor of Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposition. Here, we establish that HMGXB4 is highly expressed from the zygote stage, and declines after transcriptional genome activation. Nevertheless, HMGXB4 is activated by its own promoter at 4-cell stage, responding to the parental-to-zygotic transition, marks stemness, and maintains its expression during germ cell specification. The HMGXB4 promoter is located at an active chromatin domain boundary. As a vertebrate-specific modulator of SETD1A and NuRF complexes, HMGXB4 links histone H3K4 methyltransferase- and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling activities. The expression of HMGXB4 is regulated by the KRAB-ZNF/TRIM28 epigenetic repression machinery. A post-transcriptional modification by SUMOylation diminishes its transcriptional activator function and regulates its nucleolar trafficking. Collectively, HMGXB4 positions SB transposition into an elaborate stem cell-specific transcriptional regulatory mechanism that is active during early embryogenesis and germline development, thereby potentiating heritable transposon insertions in the germline.","Devaraj, Anantharam; Singh, Manvendra; Narayanavari, Suneel; Yong, Guo; Wang, Jiaxuan; Wang, Jichang; Becker, Mareike; Walisko, Oliver; Schorn, Andrea; Cseresznyés, Zoltán; Grzela, Dawid; Raskó, Tamás; Selbach, Matthias; Ivics, Zoltán; Izsvák, Zsuzsanna",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.145656,253

We conducted a study to determine independent risk factors for CAM. Methods: We performed a retrospective case control study in a tertiary care private hospital in Pune, India. Fifty-two cases of CAM were compared with 166 concurrent controls randomly selected from the COVID-19 admissions during the same time period. Association of demographic factors, comorbidities, cumulative steroid dose used (calculated as dexamethasone equivalent), maximum respiratory support required, use of injectable/oral anticoagulation, and use of aspirin with CAM was assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 218 subjects (52 cases; 166 controls) were studied. Any diabetes (pre-existing diabetes and new onset diabetes during COVID-19) was noted in a significantly higher proportion of cases (73.1%, 45.8% P<0.001) and cumulative dexamethasone dose used in cases was significantly greater (97.72 mg vs 60 mg; P=0.016). In a multivariate regression analysis cumulate dexamethasone dose >120 mg (OR 9.03, confidence interval 1.75-46.59, P=0.009) and any diabetes (OR 4.78, confidence interval 1.46-15.65, P=0.01) were found to be risk factors for CAM. While use of anticoagulation (OR 0.01, confidence interval 0.00-0.09, P<0.001) and use of aspirin (OR 0.02, confidence interval 0.01-0.07, P<0.001) were found to be protective against CAM. Conclusion: Diabetes mellitus and cumulative dose of dexamethasone greater than 120 mg (or equivalent dose of other corticosteroid) were associated with an increased risk of CAM while use of aspirin and anticoagulation were associated with a lower risk.","Gupta, D.; Kulkarni, R.; Pujari, S.; Mulay, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.16.21262109v1?rss=1,253
178898,Application of Plasma Gasification Technology in Handling Medical Waste as an Approach to Handle the Waste Generated by COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The Nigeria oil and gas industry is a highly capital intensive market. with possibility of high profit or great losses. Oil price trends over the last 3 decades shows cyclical and relatively high volatility. This is due to geopolitical and economic factors including dollar value, governments and organizations (like OPEC's actions), that influence global supply and demand. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 crises, public health became a key factor influencing oil price (due to its severe adverse impact on demand). Studies have shown that even an increase in production volumes will not be able to bring about profitability in the industry. Clearly, management of costs including a lean supply chain that ensures that material/services for production are available at the right price and time is critical for the profitability of future oil and gas supply. Oil producing firms require an optimum supply level of material and services to competitively deliver its end-product. This paper discusses the effect of LEAN supply chain management on the profitability of oil & gas firms in Nigeria. It also appraises the relationship between lean processes and operational efficiency of oil and gas producing companies. Using quantitative and descriptive research design methods, an online survey has been used to gather information from respondents from different oil and gas companies. Secondary data was also obtained from annual reports of relevant companies to show their crude oil production levels vis-à-vis profitability over a five-year period. Based on analysis of information received from the research conducted, it has been recommended that better supply related collaboration between the organizations in the industry is necessary for sustained profitability. Companies need to link upstream and downstream flows of products, services and information to help reduce costs, wastages and ensure profitability. In, line with this, steps have been proferred to establish lean processes for organization. The researcher concludes that established industry-wide lean supply chain management processes and practices and collaboration e critical to competiveness and sustainable profitability in the oil and gas industry. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers","Ugolo, O.

We provide evidence of a slight gender bias in debt financing, with creditors favouring female entrepreneurs when dealing with cash flow problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find no evidence of gender bias in equity financing. The results are robust after controlling for a larger number of firm-specific characteristics and selection bias. We challenge the assumption of “gender-based discrimination” in the debt market, speculating that in the context of high uncertainty, prototypical forms of femininity may be advantageous as financial institutions seek to hedge their risk by favouring more conservative borrowers.","Wellalage, Nirosha Hewa Boubaker Sabri Hunjra Ahmed Imran Verhoeven Peter",Finance Research Letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102329,253

Here, we probe the crucial role of presence of membrane lipid packing defects, depending on the membrane composition, in allowing the viral peptide belonging to C-terminal Hepatitis A Virus-2B (HAV-2B) to detect, attach and subsequently partition into the host cell membrane mimics. We conclusively show that the hydrophobic residues in the viral peptide detect the transiently present lipid packing defects, insert themselves into such defects, form anchor points and facilitate the partitioning of the peptide. We also show that the presence of cholesterol significantly alters such lipid packing defects, both in size and in number, thus mitigating the partitioning of the membrane active viral peptide into cholesterol-rich membranes. These results show differential ways in which presence and absence of cholesterol can alter the permeability of the host membranes to the membrane active viral peptide component of HAV-2B virus, via lipid packing defects, and can possibly be a part of general membrane detection mechanism for the viroporin class of viruses.","Sikdar, Samapan; Banerjee, Manidipa; Vemparala, Satyavani",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.28.424541,253

We analysed 745 larvae of S. arcticum cytogenetically from nine of the 11 sites where it occurred;five sites had small sample sizes. For the collections with large sample sizes, the distribution of S. arcticum may have a geographic pattern. Larvae in western tributaries of the Columbia River have the sex-linked IIL-2 inversion and heterozygotes for the IS-1 autosomal polymorphism in abundance but lack the IIL-21 sex-linked inversion, whereas larvae in eastern tributaries of the Columbia River possess the IIL-21 inversion but lack IIL-2 and the IS-1 inversions. A cytotype new to science, S. arcticum IIL-81, occurs in some larvae at the Methow River in the eastern Cascades region. All females, regardless of location, possess enhanced (Ce Ce) centromere bands in their IIL-chromosomes, whereas all males possess the enhanced, thin (Ce Ct) centromere band dimorphism.

Lejos de contribuir a un mejor entendimiento de la pandemia y de las medidas más eficaces para contrarrestarla, el volumen y tipo de información que ha circulado en torno de este virus ha generado respuestas y disposiciones sociales perniciosas. Si anteriormente muchas de las disposiciones y prejuicios colectivos en contra de la ciencia y las políticas en materia de salud pública podían atribuirse a la falta de información suficiente, o del acceso a ésta, hoy parecería que ocurre lo contrario: hay un exceso de todo tipo de información que circula en un mismo plano. A esto se añade aquella información intencionalmente diseñada para distorsionar y confundir, producto de intereses políticos, noticiosos o aun comerciales (las noticias falsas o falseadas, i.e., fake news). El resultado es que paralelamente a la pandemia médica estamos sumergidos en una pandemia social de carácter informativo, que la oms ha denominado infodemia e irtfoxicación (intoxicación informativa) que se suma a la gradual pero constante desconfianza y pérdida de credibilidad social en las instituciones médicas, gubernamentales e incluso informativas, con consecuencias potencialmente graves para la vida colectiva.Alternate abstract:Aside from the biological pathogen, the sars CoV-2 outbreak brought along another virus: that of technologically replicable viral information on an unprecedented social scale. Far from contributing to a better understanding of the pandemic and the most efficient means for countering it, the amount and kind of information that has been circulating around this virus has given rise to pernicious social dispositions and responses. Although many previous collective prejudices and dispositions against science and public health policies can be attributed to the lack of sufficient information or access to it, today the opposite seems to be the case: there is too much information available, of all sorts, on the same plane. Additionally, some of it-fake news-is intentionally designed to be misleading (following political, media о commercial interests). The result is that together with the medical pandemic, we are in the midst of an informational pandemic, an issue the who has dubbed as infodemic and infoxicationy added to the gradual yet constant mistrust and lack of social credibility that medical, governmental and information institutions are suffering, with potentially serious consequences for collective life.","Venerom, Felipe López",Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales,https://doi.org/10.22201/fcpys.2448492xe.2021.242.79330,253
181422,"Hotels, prices and risk premium in exceptional times: The case of Milan hotels during the first COVID-19 outbreak",2021,"Study Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented psychological burden on emergency medicine (EM) providers who have experienced anxiety, depression, isolation, burnout, and poor self-care. ACEP along with 44 medical organizations issued a statement in support of clinician health in the post-pandemic period calling for the removal of barriers to mental health care and using non-clinical mental health support, specifically peer support, to foster resilience and recovery. While physicians prefer to seek support from colleagues, formal peer support interventions are not well studied. The objectives of the study were to determine feasibility, receptivity, and effect of physician peer support groups on symptoms of acute distress, anxiety, depression, and burnout. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used to determine pre-post intervention changes in anxiety and depression (primary outcomes) using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4);provider burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory;and distress symptoms (fatigue, trouble sleeping, nervousness, feeling down, anger, helplessness, guilt, difficulty concentrating) using the SPADE Symptom Screener and PROMIS measure. The Participant-rated Global Impression of Change was used to monitor whether feeling better at the end of each session compared to the beginning. Receptivity was assessed using a net promoter score question. The study population was emergency physicians serving 10 academic and community hospitals who self-identified as having any mental health challenge during the pandemic. Three groups of 8 providers were recruited via departmental email listservs to participate in eight 1-hour virtual, peer support group sessions via Zoom Health. The visit structure was based on the National Alliance of Mental Illness (NAMI) peer support model and adapted for use in the clinician population. Three physicians were trained to cofacilitate with a NAMI support group leader. Data were collected using the Zoom polling function. Change analysis was conducted using dependent t-tests in SPSS. A sample size of 16 clinicians was needed to provide 80% power for two-sided tests at an alpha of 0.05 to detect a large effect size of 1.0 (3-point absolute change) for the PHQ-4. Results: Of the 24 participating physicians, the majority were faculty physicians, white, female, and in practice 5 years or less. Average attendance was 6.5 sessions with 83% of physicians reaching the attendance goal of 6 out of 8 sessions. On average, participants reported feeling better at the end compared to the beginning of each session. Eighty six percent of physicians reported they would recommend peer support groups to a friend or colleague. Positive effect sizes showed improvement in 8 of 11 distress symptoms, and marginal significance (p<.10) for guilt and anxiety. Conclusions: High levels of attendance, feeling better at the end of sessions, and willingness to recommend peer support groups to friends or colleagues demonstrate high physician receptivity to peer support and feasibility of implementation. Positive effect sizes show promising signs of improvement in the majority of anxiety, depression, distress, and burn out symptoms in this pilot study. Attention is needed to tailor strategies to male providers who may be hesitant to participate. Further research of this model with a larger samples and more robust design is planned.

181465,We Call to #ProtectLibraryWorkers: A Rallying Cry for Library Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Autologous vascular grafts are widely used in revascularization surgeries for small caliber targets. However, the availability of autologous conduits might be limited due to prior surgeries or the quality of vessels. Xenogeneic decellularized vascular grafts from animals potentially substitute for autologous vascular grafts. Decellularization with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is reported to highly preserve extracellular matrix (ECM) which would be feasible for recellularization and vascular remodeling after implantation. In the present study, we conducted xenogeneic implantation of HHP-decellularized bovine vascular grafts from dorsalis pedis arteries to porcine carotid arteries then evaluated graft patency, ECM preservation and recellularization. Surgical procedure not to damage luminal surface of the grafts from drying significantly increased the graft patency at 4 weeks after implantation (P = 0.0079). After the technical improvement, all grafts (N = 5) were patent with mild stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia at 4 weeks after implantation. Neither aneurysmal change nor massive thrombosis was observed even without administration of anticoagulants nor anti-platelet agents. Elastica van Gieson and Sirius-red stainings revealed fair preservation of ECM proteins including elastin and collagen after implantation. Luminal surface of grafts was thoroughly covered with von Willebrand factor-positive endothelium. Scanning electron microscopy on luminal surface of implanted grafts exhibited cobblestone-like endothelial cell layer which is similar to native vascular endothelium. Recellularization of tunica media with alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive smooth muscle cells was partly observed. Thus, we confirmed that HHP-decellularized grafts are feasible for xenogeneic implantation accompanied by recellularization by recipient cells.","Kurokawa, Shunji; Hashimoto, Yoshihide; Funamoto, Seiichi; Yamashita, Akitatsu; Yamazaki, Kazuhiro; Ikeda, Tadashi; Minatoya, Kenji; Kishida, Akio; Masumoto, Hidetoshi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.29.123018,253

Ever since its emergence, various guidelines and protocols have been proposed to curb its spread and increase the awareness among people. As the bulk of hospital and health care resources have been diverted to manage this pandemic outbreak, elective procedures like Orthognathic surgeries have been halted. In South India, as the cases were on gradual raise post the first wave of COVID-19, immediate lock downs were announced by the Government to prevent full blown second wave of COVID-192. As the strict lock downs were prevalent and number of COVID-19 cases increased, the hospital management of our Tertiary Reference Centre decided to reduce the number of reviews and Out-Patient cases. With the majority of the areas given red alert and marked as containment zones, the number of patients reporting for follow up reduced drastically. Telemedicine has gained popularity and practice among the various aspects of Medicine especially during this pandemic due to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness3. Hence, we decided to follow up the patients who underwent orthognathic surgery and could not report for review physically, via telemedicine (Phone/video calls) with the aid of contact numbers from the hospital registry.","Poorna, T.

181565,Strategic Dialogic Communication Through Digital Media During COVID-19 Crisis,2021,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is one of the prioritized diseases of World Health Organization, considering its potential to create a public health emergency and more importantly, the absence of efficacious drugs and/or vaccines regarding treatment. The highly lethal nature characteristic to CCHFV restricts research to BSL-4 laboratories, which complicates effective research and developmental strategies. In consideration of antiviral therapies, RNA interference can be used to suppress viral replication by targeting viral genes. RNA interference uses small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to silence genes. The aim of our study was to design siRNAs that inhibit CCHFV replication and can serve as a basis for further antiviral therapies. A549 cells were infected with CCHFV after transfection with the siRNAs. Following 72 hours, nucleic acid from the supernatant was extracted for Droplet Digital PCR analysis. Among the investigated siRNAs we identified four effective candidates against all three segments of CCHF genome: one for the S and M segments, whilst two for the L segment. Consequently, blocking any segment of CCHFV leads to changes in the virus copy number that indicates an antiviral effect of the siRNAs in vitro. The most active siRNAs were demonstrated a specific inhibitory effect against CCHFV in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrated the ability of specific siRNAs to inhibit CCHFV replication in vitro. This promising result can be used in future anti-CCHFV therapy developments.","Földes, Fanni; Madai, Mónika; Papp, Henrietta; Kemenesi, Gábor; Zana, Brigitta; Geiger, Lili; Gombos, Katalin; Somogyi, Balázs; Bock-Marquette, Ildikó; Jakab, Ferenc",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.093047,253

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed many challenges for the present day healthcare system related to the quality of care of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, healthcare professionals must recognize dangers and adequately respond to them in time. This paper represents a first effort in identifying the psychological characteristics of attitudes towards dangers among healthcare professionals working and not working with COVID-19 patients. Methods. A sample of 246 respondents varying in gender and age took part in this study, including 106 healthcare professionals from the city of Cherepovets (Vologda Region) and the city of Ivanovo (Ivanovo Region). The types of attitudes towards dangers, the need for experiencing a sense of danger, and the need for safety were identified using original questionnaires developed by the authors. The φ* criterion – Fisher’s angular transformation (Fisher’s criterion) was used for data processing. Results. Gender-related differences in the level of threat sensitivity and in the types of responding to dangers were found in groups of healthcare and non-healthcare professionals. Among healthcare professionals, the number of those exaggerating the importance of threats decreased significantly (from 30 % to 14.15 %) and the number of those with an ambiguous type of responding increased (from 17.14 % to 30.19 %). Compared to healthcare professionals not working with COVID-19 patients, those treating and caring for COVID-19 patients showed a decrease in threat sensitivity (from 57.69 % to 27.78 %) and an increase in the need for safety (from 28.85 % to 64.81 %) and in the need for ensuring safety (from 57.69 % to 79.63 %). The differences were significant. Discussion. The results can be readily used in the process of selecting physicians and nurses for working under conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and under other epidemiological conditions. © Maralov V.

In addition, tracking of pathogen concentrations over time could potentially provide a measure of the effectiveness of public health control measures and the impact of the gradual relaxation of these controls. Analysis of wastewater using quantitative molecular methods offers a real-time measure of infections in the community, and thus is expected to provide a more sensitive and rapid indication of changes in infection rates before such effects become detectable by clinical health surveillance. Models may help to back-calculate wastewater prevalence to population prevalence or to correct pathogen counts for wastewater catchment-specific and temporal effects. They may also help to design the wastewater sampling strategy.

185498,Medical students' perceptions of an undergraduate research elective.,2004,"Emerging infectious and formidable epidemic diseases are a cause for concern and a serious threat to the global health. At the time of writing a number of these diseases have no cure. States in their domestic legislation applicable to matters of public health have come up with approaches to deal with such diseases. Zimbabwe has enacted primary legislation and regulations dealing with public health in an effort to suppress and prevent these diseases. The Zimbabwean Public Health Act, for example, authorises the notification of infectious and formidable epidemic diseases and the inspection of infected premises. The Act further empowers the Minister of Health and Child Care to enact regulations. Through the Public Health Regulations, the government of Zimbabwe declared COVID-19 a formidable epidemic disease. Warranted by the Health Act, the Minister of Health and Child Care made treatment, testing, detention and isolation compulsory during the period in which COVID-19 is declared a formidable epidemic disease. This article seeks to provide a critical analysis of these measures as provided in the Public Health Act and health regulations in light of the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of privacy, freedom of security, liberty and freedom of movement. The question sought to be answered by the author is whether these measures justifiably trumps the rights of individuals. © 2021, Pretoria University Law Press. All rights reserved.","Makwaiba, B.

Herein we aim to analyze the effects of the Spanish two-month lockdown on a methodology that counts on a substantial amount of hands-on activities. We inquired how the lack of teamwork and hands-on activities might influence students' motivation and long-term learning. We compared the data from several outcomes collected in two consecutive academic years to accomplish our goal. The first year was a regular pre-COVID-19 course, and the subsequent one included the burst of COVID-19. The results suggest a correlation between the lack of hands-on activities and a less effective knowledge acquisition. The limitations to create tangible products and the lack of proper teamwork also diminished students' attendance and participation in a virtual environment. We were able to propose some potential solutions to keep going on the hands-on projects under another lockdown. These solutions mainly rely on managing role assignments, distributing materials, using remote teamwork tools, short instructional videos, and synchronous online teaching in an attractive lecturing environment. © 2021 IEEE.","Pernia-Espinoza, A.; Sanz-Garcia, A.; Martinez-De-Pison-Ascacibar, F.

188209,Improving patient flow through the emergency department.,2012,"Aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) is a 150 kDa membrane-bound ubiquitously expressed protease with a broad functional repertoire. It hydrolyzes small peptide mediators, modulates cell motility and adhesion to extracellular matrix and also acts as a viral receptor. In order to dissect the function of enzymatically active and inactive APN/CD13, substitutions of different enzymatic active amino acid residues were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and stably transfected into human embryonic kidney cells. All APN variants analyzed exhibited a complete loss of enzymatic activity, whereas wild type APN transfectants exerted a strong aminopeptidase-specific activity. Furthermore, wild type APN expression was associated with a significant decrease in proliferation, migration and also reduced anchorage-independent growth when compared to enzymatically inactive APN variants and controls. This appeared to be due to a downregulated mRNA and protein expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and an inhibition of the stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha/CXCL12-mediated migration. Thus, high APN enzyme activity may antagonize the cellular properties regulated by the CXCR4/SDF-1alpha system in embryonic kidney cells.","Wulfaenger, Jens; Niedling, Susanna; Riemann, Dagmar; Seliger, Barbara",Molecular membrane biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18097955/,253

Their pathogenicity in neonates is not wellknown. POPULATION AND METHODS Eighty five samples of tracheal or nasopharyngeal secretions were obtained from January to October 1991 from 53 children (29 less than 1 month of age; 19 from 1 month to 1 year; five older than 1 year). They were examined for respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, myxovirus influenza and parainfluenza and coronavirus by immunofluorescence (IF). RESULTS Nineteen samples from nine newborns and three infants were positive for coronavirus. The mean birth weight of the nine neonates was 2100 +/- 840 g; their mean gestational age was 34 +/- 5 weeks and their mean age at diagnosis was 21 +/- 9 days. Apnea and bradycardia were the main symptoms in this group. Blood C-reactive protein was not elevated and blood cultures were sterile. One infant was admitted for near-miss; the two others were admitted at birth because they suffered from chronic lung disease (pulmonary hypoplasia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia). An acute episode of pulmonary deterioration occurred at the time of coronavirus infection. Both died one at 4 months and the other at 10 months. CONCLUSION Coronaviruses seem to be responsible for respiratory tract infections in hospitalized neonates and chronically ventilated infants.","Sizun, J; Soupre, D; Legrand, M C; Giroux, J D; Rubio, S; Chastel, C; Alix, D; de Parscau, L",Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7951832/,253

Evaluating risk and benefit information in consumer health materials.,2004,"BACKGROUND Although, laparoscopic incisional hernia repair (LIHR) provides an alternative method for managing incisional hernias, the ideal procedure for reducing the incidence of postoperative complications remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS We have developed a new method of LIHR that involves a double transfascial suture and does not require the use of spiral tackers. We performed this procedure consecutively in five patients (four males and one female with a mean age of 65.6 years). We describe our new method of LIHR, and present preliminary clinical results. RESULTS The mean defect size was 26.2 ± 15.8 cm(2), and the mesh size that was used was 121.7 cm(2) in all cases. An occult hernia was found in one patient during laparoscopic observation. The mean operative time was 198.4 ± 49.3 minutes with a blood loss of 12.2 ± 24.6 mL. Postoperative courses were uneventful with a median postoperative hospitalization period of 8 days. No patient required mesh removal and none developed a recurrent hernia during the median follow-up period of 13 months. CONCLUSION Although, larger number of patients and longer follow-up will be required to prove the operative adequacy of our new procedure, it appears to represent a feasible option for LIHR.","Matsui, Hideo; Okamoto, Yuichi; Nabeshima, Kazuhito; Ishii, Akiko; Ishizu, Kazuhiro; Kondoh, Yasumasa; Ogoshi, Kyoji; Makuuchi, Hiroyasu",The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21318989/,253

Atypical males differed from all other gender-by-type groups, while no other differences emerged. LCU correlated with melancholic indices but did not correlate with anxiety or functioning. The results suggest that subgroups of depressive patients are characterized by the presence of stressful life events. Male atypical patients reported the highest load of life events. The question that arises is whether this finding is valid or whether these patients (who have higher personality psychopathology and interpersonal rejection sensitivity) tend to over-report life events.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Iacovides, Apostolos; Kaprinis, Stergios; Kaprinis, George",Psychiatry research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16814398/,253

A preintervention, postintervention, nonequivalent group design was used to evaluate an educational program on alarm management in a convenience sample of MICU nurses. A 15-minute session was provided in a 1-week period. The outcome variable (number of alarms for low oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry [SpO2]) was determined from monitor log files adjusted by patient census. Data were collected for 15 days before and after the intervention. χ2 analysis was used, with P less than .05 considered significant. After 1 week of education, low SpO2 alarms decreased from 502 to 306 alarms per patient monitored per day, a 39% reduction (P < .001).

The da Vinci dual console (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, California) allows a surgical mentor to teach with both the mentor and the trainee working at a surgeon console simultaneously. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the dual console versus the single console for teaching medical students robotic tasks. METHODS Forty novice medical students were randomized to either the da Vinci single-console or dual-console group and were taught 4 knot-tying techniques by a surgical mentor. The students were timed while performing the tasks. RESULTS No statistically significant differences in mean task times were observed between the single- and dual-console groups: interrupted stitch with a 2-handed knot (300 seconds for single vs 294 seconds for dual, P=.59), interrupted stitch with a 1-handed knot (198 seconds for single vs 212 seconds for dual, P=.88), figure-of-8 stitch with a 2-handed knot (261 seconds for single vs 219 seconds for dual, P=.20), and figure-of-8 stitch with a 1-handed knot (200 seconds for single vs 199 seconds for dual, P=.53). CONCLUSION No significant difference was observed in performance time when teaching knot-tying techniques to medical students using the da Vinci dual console compared with the single console.

This article reviews and describes the challenges faced in providing critical care and respiratory support in an austere environment and during medical transport. The primary focus to be discussed is mechanical ventilation. RECENT FINDINGS The United States Air Force has developed a programme called the Critical Care Aeromedical Transport Teams. These teams provide dynamic and sophisticated critical care in austere environments, including during medical transport. The Critical Care Aeromedical Transport Teams programme provides a framework for the discussion of supporting respiratory failure in these settings. We will discuss the team concept of operations, the equipment assemblage, methods and techniques of intensive care unit patient care in this setting, and caveats and pitfalls as they pertain to respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, and respiratory monitoring. SUMMARY The support of respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation during a disaster is complex and challenging. The key to success is pre-planning, flexibility, and portability. Programmes such as the Critical Care Aeromedical Transport Teams can be a useful model for the development of appropriate civil response capabilities in critical care for use during a disaster.","Kashani, Kianoush B; Farmer, J Christopher",Current opinion in critical care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16394783/,253

DESIGN Quantitative systematic review of randomised placebo controlled trials. DATA SOURCES Nine trials (8 published, 1 unpublished) retrieved from a systematic search (electronic databases, contact with authors, contact with drug manufacturers, reference lists); no restriction on language. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportion of subjects with productive cough at follow up (7-11 days after consultation with general practitioner); proportion of subjects who had not improved clinically at follow up; proportion of subjects who reported side effects from taking antibiotic or placebo. RESULTS Eight trials contributed to the meta-analysis. Resolution of cough was not affected by antibiotic treatment (relative risk 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.00)), neither was clinical improvement at re-examination (relative risk 0.62 (0.36 to 1.09)). The side effects of antibiotic were more common in the antibiotic group when compared to placebo (relative risk 1.51 (0.86 to 2.64)). CONCLUSIONS Treatment with antibiotic does not affect the resolution of cough or alter the course of illness. The benefits of antibiotic treatment are marginal for most patients with acute cough and may be outweighed by the side effects of treatment.","Fahey, T; Stocks, N; Thomas, T",BMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9552842/,253
196826,COVID-19 and Family Law Decision-Making.,2020-08-01,"In densely populated urban environments, the distribution of microbes and the drivers of microbial community assemblages are not well understood. In sprawling metropolitan habitats, the ""urban microbiome"" may represent a mix of human-associated and environmental taxa. Here we carried out a baseline study of automated teller machine (ATM) keypads in New York City (NYC). Our goal was to describe the biodiversity and biogeography of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in an urban setting while assessing the potential source of microbial assemblages on ATM keypads. Microbial swab samples were collected from three boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn) during June and July 2014, followed by generation of Illumina MiSeq datasets for bacterial (16S rRNA) and eukaryotic (18S rRNA) marker genes. Downstream analysis was carried out in the QIIME pipeline, in conjunction with neighborhood metadata (ethnicity, population, age groups) from the NYC Open Data portal. Neither the 16S nor 18S rRNA datasets showed any clustering patterns related to geography or neighborhood demographics. Bacterial assemblages on ATM keypads were dominated by taxonomic groups known to be associated with human skin communities (Actinobacteria, Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria), although SourceTracker analysis was unable to identify the source habitat for the majority of taxa. Eukaryotic assemblages were dominated by fungal taxa as well as by a low-diversity protist community containing both free-living and potentially pathogenic taxa (Toxoplasma, Trichomonas). Our results suggest that ATM keypads amalgamate microbial assemblages from different sources, including the human microbiome, eukaryotic food species, and potentially novel extremophilic taxa adapted to air or surfaces in the built environment. DNA obtained from ATM keypads may thus provide a record of both human behavior and environmental sources of microbes. IMPORTANCE Automated teller machine (ATM) keypads represent a specific and unexplored microhabitat for microbial communities. Although the number of built environment and urban microbial ecology studies has expanded greatly in recent years, the majority of research to date has focused on mass transit systems, city soils, and plumbing and ventilation systems in buildings. ATM surfaces, potentially retaining microbial signatures of human inhabitants, including both commensal taxa and pathogens, are interesting from both a biodiversity perspective and a public health perspective. By focusing on ATM keypads in different geographic areas of New York City with distinct population demographics, we aimed to characterize the diversity and distribution of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, thus making a unique contribution to the growing body of work focused on the ""urban microbiome."" In New York City, the surface area of urban surfaces in Manhattan far exceeds the geographic area of the island itself. We have only just begun to describe the vast array of microbial taxa that are likely to be present across diverse types of urban habitats.","Bik, Holly M; Maritz, Julia M; Luong, Albert; Shin, Hakdong; Dominguez-Bello, Maria Gloria; Carlton, Jane M",mSphere,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27904880/,253

196949,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) prevention in Taiwan.,2004,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a worldwide epidemic in late 2002/early 2003 and a second outbreak in the winter of 2003/2004 by an independent animal-to-human transmission. The GD03 strain, which was isolated from an index patient of the second outbreak, was reported to resist neutralization by the human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) 80R and S3.1, which can potently neutralize isolates from the first outbreak. Here we report that two hmAbs, m396 and S230.15, potently neutralized GD03 and representative isolates from the first SARS outbreak (Urbani, Tor2) and from palm civets (SZ3, SZ16). These antibodies also protected mice challenged with the Urbani or recombinant viruses bearing the GD03 and SZ16 spike (S) glycoproteins. Both antibodies competed with the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2, for binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD), suggesting a mechanism of neutralization that involves interference with the SARS-CoV-ACE2 interaction. Two putative hot-spot residues in the RBD (Ile-489 and Tyr-491) were identified within the SARS-CoV spike that likely contribute to most of the m396-binding energy. Residues Ile-489 and Tyr-491 are highly conserved within the SARS-CoV spike, indicating a possible mechanism of the m396 cross-reactivity. Sequence analysis and mutagenesis data show that m396 might neutralize all zoonotic and epidemic SARS-CoV isolates with known sequences, except strains derived from bats. These antibodies exhibit cross-reactivity against isolates from the two SARS outbreaks and palm civets and could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of SARS-CoV infections.","Zhu, Zhongyu; Chakraborti, Samitabh; He, Yuxian; Roberts, Anjeanette; Sheahan, Tim; Xiao, Xiaodong; Hensley, Lisa E; Prabakaran, Ponraj; Rockx, Barry; Sidorov, Igor A; Corti, Davide; Vogel, Leatrice; Feng, Yang; Kim, Jae-Ouk; Wang, Lin-Fa; Baric, Ralph; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Curtis, Kristopher M; Nabel, Gary J; Subbarao, Kanta; Jiang, Shibo; Dimitrov, Dimiter S",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17620608/,253

Coronaviruses can cause a common cold or more serious diseases such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndromes (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). They can cause respiratory, lung and gastrointestinal infections with a mild to severe course, sometimes causing the death of the infected person.

Evidence presented demonstrates that the IBV sequence from nucleotide 1 to 1904 directs very inefficient synthesis of a product of approximately 43 kDa. Deletion of either the first 362 bp or the whole part of the 5'-UTR, however, dramatically increased the expression of the 43 kDa protein species. The mechanisms involved were investigated by two different approaches. Firstly, translation of the same construct in the presence of [3H]-leucine ruled out the possibility that initiation of small reading frames from non-AUG codons located in the 5'-UTR may compete with the authentic AUG initiation codon, and therefore inhibit the expression of ORF 1a. Secondly, expression and deletion analyses of a dicistronic construct showed that translation of the 43 kDa protein was initiated by ribosome internal entry mechanism. These studies suggest that a 'weak' ribosome internal entry signal is located in the 5'-UTR and is involved in the regulation of mRNA1 expression.","Liu, D X; Xu, H Y; Lim, K P",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782297/,253

We used primary murine tracheal epithelial cell (mTEC) cultures to investigate antiviral and cytokine responses to influenza A virus infection, focusing on the contribution of the RNA binding domain of the NS1 protein. rWSN NS1 R38A replication is attenuated in mTEC cultures; however, viral antigen is detected predominantly in ciliated cells, similar to wild-type virus. NS1 and NS1 R38A proteins display a primarily cytoplasmic localization in infected mTEC cultures. Increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and beta interferon is observed during rWSN NS1 R38A infection, and cytokines are secreted in a directional manner. Cytokine pretreatment of mTEC cultures and Vero cells suggest that rWSN NS1 R38A is more sensitive to the presence of antiviral/inflammatory cytokines than wild-type virus.

A study of COVID-19-induced lockdown,2021,"The tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is an RNA-containing enveloped virus, which poses a major threat to the well-being and health of humans. In this study, we describe an approach to the inactivation of TBEV, which involves the degradation of viral RNA by artificial ribonucleases (aRNases, small organic compounds that exhibit ribonuclease activity in vitro). We demonstrate that the incubation of TBEV with aRNases lead to the total inactivation of the virus as indicated by the plaque formation assay data, but retain the viral immunogenic properties, as shown by the ELISA data. We propose that a possible mechanism of TBEV inactivation with aRNase, which includes: i) formation of local breaks in the lipid membrane of the virus caused by aRNase, ii) penetration of aRNase into the viral capsid, iii) degradation of genomic RNA by aRNase. These data suggest that the proposed approach can be used in the production of killed-virus vaccine.","Goncharova, Elena P; Koroleva, Ludmila S; Silnikov, Vladimir N; Ternovoy, Vladimir A; Vlassov, Valentin V; Zenkova, Marina A",Journal of molecular and genetic medicine : an international journal of biomedical research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22872801/,253
202207,Loss of mu and delta opioid receptors on neurons expressing dopamine receptor D1 has no effect on reward sensitivity,2020,"BACKGROUND: Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen which can invade different mammalian cells and reach to the central nervous system (CNS), leading to meningoencephalitis and brain abscesses. In the diagnosis of L. monocytogenes meningoencephalitis (LMM), the traditional test often reports negative owing to the antibiotic treatment or a low number of bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid. To date, timely diagnosis and accurate treatment remains a challenge for patients with listeria infections. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 66-year-old woman whose clinical manifestations were suspected as tuberculous meningoencephalitis, but the case was finally properly diagnosed as LMM by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The patient was successfully treated using a combined antibacterial therapy, comprising ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: To improve the sensitivity of LMM diagnosis, we used NGS for the detection of L. monocytogenes. Hence, the clinical utility of this approach can be very helpful since it provides quickly and trust results.","Lan, Zi-Wei; Xiao, Min-Jia; Guan, Yuan-Lin; Zhan, Ya-Jing; Tang, Xiang-Qi",BMC Infect Dis,,253

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two orthopaedic medical staff from the orthopaedic center of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University were included in this retrospective investigation. A total of 43 surgeons and 69 nurses provided medical support in the treatment of COVID-19 patients from 1 January 2020 to 8 April 2020 in four different hospitals in Wuhan. We collected data on the age, gender, and body temperature of orthopaedic medical staff, as well as the results for their chest CT scans, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, SARS-CoV-2 IgM and SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests, and training and examinations on COVID-19 knowledge. We also collected data on the time span of work, the number of infected staff during the support period, the number of COVID-19 patients the surgeons treated and the cure rate, the performance of the surgeons as assessed by the specialists and patients, and the number of infected staff during the pandemic. RESULTS: Among the 49 surgeons and 73 nurses, 43 surgeons and 69 nurses provided support against COVID-19. A total of 12 surgeons and 11 nurses provided support in the fields of respiration, intensive care, and emergency. A total of 34 surgeons and 58 nurses worked in the designated wards restructured for COVID-19 in the orthopaedic building. The average time span of work for the surgeons and nurses was 14.78 ± 3.64 days and 24.77 ± 7.58 days, respectively. No staff were infected during the support period. Over 1000 patients were received in the fever clinic by orthopaedic surgeons. The overall number of the treated hospitalized patients was 622. Among these patients, 226 cases were mild, 318 were mild to moderate, and 58 were severe or critical. The cure rate was 96.01%, 99.37%, and 52.00% respectively. The performance of the surgeons was scored 87.02 ± 3.17 and 90.69 ± 3.58 by the specialists and the patients, respectively. During the whole pandemic, 3 surgeons and 3 nurses who did not participate in the support work were infected in the early stages. The morbidity of all the orthopaedic staff was 4.92% during the whole pandemic, while no one was infected during the support work. CONCLUSION: Our investigation indicated that although they worked outside their specialty, it was safe and effective for the orthopaedic staff to provide medical support in the work against COVID-19 with adequate precautions and proper training.","Wen, Yin-Xian; Wang, Hua; Tie, Kai; Ni, Qu-Bo; Qin, Jun; Tan, Yang; Pan, Zheng-Qi; Chen, Biao; He, Hang-Yuan; Chen, Liao-Bin",Orthopaedic surgery (Online),,253

This virus is the causative agent for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and spreads primarily through human-to-human transmission via infected droplets and aerosols generated by infected persons. While COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, the potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via food is considered theoretically possible and remains a concern for Canadian consumers. We have conducted an exposure assessment of the likelihood of exposure of SARS-CoV-2 in Canadian food sources at the time of consumption. This article describes the exposure routes considered most relevant in the context of food contamination with SARS-CoV-2, including contaminated food of animal origin, other contaminated fresh foods, fomites and SARS-CoV-2 contaminated feces. The likelihood of foodborne infection of SARS-CoV-2 via the human digestive tract was also considered. Our analysis indicates that there is no evidence that foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred and we consider the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 via food and food packaging in Canada as low to remote.

Emerging in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the virus has spread rapidly around the world. Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The most prominent symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are respiratory. However, accumulating evidence highlights involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). This includes headache, anosmia, meningoencephalitis, acute ischemic stroke, and several presumably post/para-infectious syndromes and altered mental status not explained by respiratory etiologies. Interestingly, previous studies in animal models emphasized the neurotropism of coronaviruses; thus, these CNS manifestations of COVID-19 are not surprising. This minireview scans the literature regarding the involvement of the CNS in coronavirus infections in general, and in regard to the recent SARS-CoV-2, specifically.","Khateb, Mohamed; Bosak, Noam; Muqary, Maryam",Front.

In our in silico molecular docking study, a total of 173 compounds, including FDA-approved antiviral drugs, with good ADME descriptors, and some other nucleotide analogues were screened. The results show that these compounds demonstrate strong binding affinity for the residues at the active sites of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) modelled structures and Chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) of the HCoV proteins. Free energies (&#916;G's) of binding for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RdRp range from - 5.4 to - 8.8 kcal/mol and - 4.9 to - 8.7 kcal/mol, respectively. Also, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 3CLpro gave &#916;G values ranging from - 5.1 to - 8.4 kcal/mol and - 5.5 to - 8.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Interesting results are obtained for ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent with broad spectrum activity, which gave the highest binding energy value (- 8.8 kcal/mol) against the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and RdRps of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The reason for such high binding energy values is probably due to the presence of hydroxy, methoxy and sugar moieties in its structure. The stability of the protein-ligand complexes of polymerase inhibitors considered in this investigation, such as Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Tenofovir, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, 5c3, 5h1 and 7a1, show strong to moderate hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (&#960;-&#960; stacked, &#960;-&#960; T-shaped, &#960;-sigma and &#960;-alkyl). The stability provided from such interactions translate into greater antiviral activity or inhibitory effect of the ligands. Assessment of the average free energies of binding of the FDA approved drugs are highly comparable for conformers of a particular inhibitor, indicating similar modes of binding within the pockets.

204111,The Right of Citizens Abroad to Return During a Pandemic (preprint),2020,"Glioblastoma is a kind of malignant tumour and originates from the central nervous system. In the last century, some researchers and clinician have noticed that the psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning of patients with malignant gliomas can be impaired. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that part of patients, adults or children, diagnosed with glioblastoma will suffer from cognitive deficiency during their clinical course, especially in long-term survivors. Many nanoparticles (NPs) can inhibit the biological functions of tumours by modulating tumour-associated inflammation, which provokes angiogenesis and tumour growth. As one of the best antiviral nanoparticles (AVNPs), AVNP2 is the 2nd generation of AVNP2 that have been conjugated to graphite-graphene for improving physiochemical performance and reducing toxicity. AVNP2 inactivates viruses, such as the H1N1 and H5N1influenza viruses and even the SARS coronavirus, while it inhibits bacteria, such as MRSA and E. coli. As antimicrobials, nanoparticles are considered to be one of the vectors for the administration of therapeutic compounds. Yet, little is known about their potential functionalities and toxicities to the neurotoxic effects of cancer. Herein, we explored the functionality of AVNP2 on inhibiting C6 in glioma-bearing rats. The novel object-recognition test and open-field test showed that AVNP2 significantly improved the neuro-behaviour affected by C6 glioma. AVNP2 also alleviated the decline of long-term potentiation (LTP) and the decreased density of dendritic spines in the CA1 region induced by C6. Western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining showed that the expressions of synaptic-related proteins (PSD-95 and SYP) were increased, and these findings were in accordance with the results mentioned above. It revealed that the sizes of tumours in C6 glioma-bearing rats were smaller after treatment with AVNP2. The decreased expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1ß, IL-6 and TNF-&#945;) by Western blotting assay and ELISA, angiogenesis protein (VEGF) by Western blotting assay and other related proteins (BDNF, NF-Ä¸B, iNOS and COX-2) by Western blotting assay in peri-tumour tissue indicated that AVNP2 could control tumour-associated inflammation, thus efficiently ameliorating the local inflammatory condition and, to some extent, inhibiting angiogenesis in C6-bearing rats. In conclusion, our results suggested that AVNP2 could have an effect on the peri-tumor environment, obviously restraining the growth progress of gliomas, and eventually improving cognitive levels in C6-bearing rats.","Li, Junyang; Liu, Meicen; Gao, Jin; Jiang, Yu; Wu, Limin; Cheong, Yuen-Ki; Ren, Guogang; Yang, Zhuo",Brain Behav Immun,,253

First, we formulate and solve an inverse problem focusing mainly on the identification of the values $A_{0}$ and $ I_{0}$ of the undetected asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, at a time $t_{0}$, by available measurements of the isolated and recovered individuals at two succeeding times, $ t_{0}$ and $ T>t_{0}.$ Simultaneously, we identify the rate standing for the average number of individuals infected in unit time by an infective symptomatic individual. Then, we propose a control problem aiming at controlling the infected classes by improving the actions in view of isolating as much as possible the populations $ A$ and $ I$ in the class $ L$. These objectives are formulated as minimization problems, the second one including a state constraint, which are treated by an optimal control technique. The existence of optimal controllers is proved and the first order necessary conditions of optimality are determined. For the second problem, they are deduced by passing to the limit in the conditions of optimality calculated for an appropriately defined approximating problem. In this case, the dual system is singular and has a component in the space of measures. The discussion of the asymptotic stability of the system done for the case when life immunity is gained reveals an asymptotic extinction of the disease, with a well determined reproduction number.","Marinoschi, Gabriela",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13470v1.pdf,253

205079,Policy Contagion During A Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in Japan in January 2020 and has spread throughout the country. Previous studies have reported that viral interference among influenza virus, rhinovirus, and other respiratory viruses can affect viral infections at the host and population level. METHODS: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on influenza and other respiratory virus infections, we analyzed clinical specimens collected from 2244 patients in Japan with respiratory diseases between January 2018 and September 2020. RESULTS: The frequency of influenza and other respiratory viruses (coxsackievirus A and B; echovirus; enterovirus; human coronavirus 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43; human metapneumovirus; human parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4; human parechovirus; human respiratory syncytial virus; human adenovirus; human bocavirus; human parvovirus B19; herpes simplex virus type 1; and varicella-zoster virus) was appreciably reduced among all patients during the COVID-19 pandemic except for that of rhinovirus in children younger than 10 years, which was appreciably increased. COVID-19 has not spread among this age group, suggesting an increased risk of rhinovirus infection in children. CONCLUSIONS: Rhinovirus infections should be continuously monitored to understand their increased risk during the COVID-19 pandemic and viral interference with SARS-CoV-2.","Takashita, Emi; Kawakami, Chiharu; Momoki, Tomoko; Saikusa, Miwako; Shimizu, Kouhei; Ozawa, Hiroki; Kumazaki, Makoto; Usuku, Shuzo; Tanaka, Nobuko; Okubo, Ichiro; Morita, Hiroko; Nagata, Shiho; Watanabe, Shinji; Hasegawa, Hideki; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro",Influenza other respir. viruses,,253

Reportes internacionales han sugerido que dichas medidas determinaron secundariamente una desatención en otras patologías, principalmente cardiovasculares, y eventual aumento de paros cardíacos extrahospitalarios (PCEH). Objetivo: determinar la frecuencia de consultas en emergencia por dolor precordial a nivel nacional y de PCEH asistidos por los principales servicios de emergencia prehospitalaria (SEP) de Montevideo, durante la pandemia. Método: se solicitó información del número de consultas por dolor precordial y de consultas totales, a las instituciones médicas de Montevideo y del interior del país, realizadas en el período comprendido entre el 13 de marzo y el 30 de abril de los años 2018, 2019 y 2020. Se solicitó a los SEP información sobre la frecuencia de PCEH en Montevideo durante los mismos períodos. Los datos se expresan como frecuencia absoluta y tasa de incidencia (por 100.000 afiliados) con su intervalo de confianza estimado mediante Fisher. Resultados: el número de consultas por dolor precordial fue estable durante el período 2018-2019. Durante 2020, dichas consultas disminuyeron, representando entre 11,3% y 21,7% del total de consultas. Se evidenció un aumento no significativo en la tasa de PCEH en el 2020 (9,05, IC95%: 7,15-11,30) comparado con el 2019 (7,94, IC95%: 6,19-10,04) y 2018 (7,43, IC95%: 5,75-9,45). Conclusiones: los datos crudos presentados muestran que desde el 13 de marzo hasta el 30 de abril de 2020 hubo una disminución en las consultas en emergencia por dolor precordial, aumentando de forma no significativa el número de PCEH durante el mes de abril, respecto al mismo período de los dos años anteriores.","Dayan, Víctor; Perna, Abayubá; Piñeiro, Natalia; Niggemeyer, Álvaro",Rev. urug. cardiol,,253

207807,European cooperation in health technology assessment implementation: the perspective of Central and Eastern European countries,2020,"IntroductionThe SARS-CoV-2 secondary attack rate (SAR) in schools is low when mitigation measures are adopted, Data on the relative impact of such strategies are limited. We evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 SAR in Massachusetts schools during 2020-21 and factors associated with transmission risk. MethodsIn a convenience sample of 25 Massachusetts public K-12 school districts, de-identified information about SARS-CoV-2 cases and their school-based contacts was reported using a standardized contact-tracing tool. Index cases were included if they were in school while infectious. SAR was defined as the proportion of in-school contacts acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and designated as possible or probable in-school transmission by school-based teams. We compared exposure-specific SAR using unadjusted risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); p-values were calculated using Fishers exact tests. ResultsEight districts (70 schools with >33,000 enrolled students) participated. There were 435 index cases and 1,771 school-based contacts (Table 1). Most contacts (1327/1771 [75%]) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and 39/1327 (2.9%) contacts tested positive. Of 39 positive contacts, 10 (25.6%) had clear out-of-school exposures and were deemed not in-school transmissions, so were excluded from further calculations. Twenty-nine (74.4%) contacts were deemed possible or probable in-school transmissions, resulting in an in-school SAR of 2.2%. Of the 29 in-school transmissions, 6 (20.7%) were staff-to-staff, 7 (24.1%) were staff-to-student, 3 (10.3%) were student-to-staff, and 13 (44.8%) were student-to-student; 6 (20.7%) occurred from index cases attending work/school while symptomatic. The unadjusted SAR (Table 2) was significantly higher if the index case was a staff member versus a student (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.06-4.49; p=0.030), if the index case was identified via in-school contact tracing versus via school-based asymptomatic testing (RR 8.44, 95% CI 1.98-36.06; p=0.001), if the exposure occurred at lunch versus elsewhere (RR 5.74, 95% CI 2.11-15.63; p<0.001; all lunch transmissions were staff-to-staff), and if both parties were unmasked versus both masked (RR 6.98, 95% CI 3.09-15.77; p<0.001).

A Qualitative Research Protocol,2021,"Call back as a procedure to report post donation symptoms or illness by donors has been established since 2009 in Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO). During the first phase of COVID-19 outbreak, all blood donors were requested to report any respiratory infection symptoms after donation. The study investigated the callback data of COVID-19 in Tehran Blood Center during the first 3 months of the outbreak in Iran. The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency of post donation COVID-19 related call back reports and determine its implications for blood donors and patients. A telephone interview was conducted with donors who had reported COVID-19 symptoms. Some questions were asked to evaluate donor's health at the time of blood donation. The donors categorized into three groups: laboratory-confirmed, suspected, and COVID-19 irrelevant based on their answers. In cases that the blood component obtained from a laboratory-confirmed donor had been released, the hospital was notified and asked to follow up the recipient for COVID-19. The results showed 30 donors (0.08 %) had callback related to COVID-19 and 76.63 % of the obtained component was disposed. The results also showed that only one donor had a laboratory-confirmed result with the RBC unit processed from her whole blood released for transfusion. The RBC unit recipient did not show any signs or symptoms of infection during a 46-day follow-up. Concluded that callback system was effective to remove most of the components obtained from the donors who reported to be COVID-19 suspected or confirmed. Moreover, the result did not support virus transmission through blood transfusion.","Balagholi, Sahar; Maghsudlu, Mahtab; Amini-Kafiabad, Sedigheh; Nazemi, Amir Masoud; Sotoudeh Anvari, Maryam",Transfus Apher Sci,,253
210180,Contemporary Tax Issues Related to Farmers and Ranchers,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is sufficient epidemiological and biological evidence of increased human susceptibility to viral pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and influenza virus, in cold weather. The pattern of outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China during the flu season is further proof that meteorological conditions may potentially influence the susceptibility of human populations to coronaviruses, a situation that may become increasingly evident as the current global pandemic of COVID-19 unfolds. MAIN BODY: A very rapid spread and high mortality rates have characterized the COVID-19 pandemic in countries north of the equator where air temperatures have been seasonally low. It is unclear if the currently high rates of COVID-19 infections in countries of the northern hemisphere will wane during the summer months, or if fewer people overall will become infected with COVID-19 in countries south of the equator where warmer weather conditions prevail through most of the year. However, apart from the influence of seasons, evidence based on the structural biology and biochemical properties of many enveloped viruses similar to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 (aetiology of COVID-19), support the higher likelihood of the latter of the two outcomes. Other factors that may potentially impact the rate of virus spread include the effectiveness of infection control practices, individual and herd immunity, and emergency preparedness levels of countries. CONCLUSION: This report highlights the potential influence of weather conditions, seasons and non-climatological factors on the geographical spread of cases of COVID-19 across the globe.","Adedokun, Kamoru A; Olarinmoye, Ayodeji O; Mustapha, Jelili O; Kamorudeen, Ramat T",Infect Dis Poverty,,253

210506,Building global competence and language proficiency through virtual exchange,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (COVID-19) was introduced into society in late 2019 and has now reached over 88 million cases and 1.9 million deaths. The Middle East has a death toll of ~80,000 and over 35000 of these are in Iran, which has over 1.2 million confirmed cases. We expect that Iranian cases caused outbreaks in the neighbouring countries and that variant mapping and phylogenetic analysis can be used to prove this. We also aim to analyse the variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS -CoV-2) to characterise the common genome variants and provide useful data in the global effort to prevent further spread of COVID-19. METHODS: The approach uses bioinformatics approaches including multiple sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation and phylogenetic analysis to identify the genomic variants found in the region. The approach uses 122 samples from the 13 countries of the Middle East sourced from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). FINDINGS: We identified 2200 distinct genome variants including 129 downstream gene variants, 298 frame shift variants, 789 missense variants, 1 start lost, 13 start gained, 1 stop lost, 249 synonymous variants and 720 upstream gene variants. The most common, high impact variants were 10818delTinsG, 2772delCinsC, 14159delCinsC and 2789delAinsA. These high impact variant ultimately results in 36 number of mutations on spike glycoprotein. Variant alignment and phylogenetic tree generation indicates that samples from Iran likely introduced COVID-19 to the rest of the Middle East. INTERPRETATION: The phylogenetic and variant analysis provides unique insight into mutation types in genomes. Initial introduction of COVID-19 was most likely due to Iranian transmission. Some countries show evidence of novel mutations and unique strains. Increased time in small populations is likely to contribute to more unique genomes. This study provides more in depth analysis of the variants affecting in the region than any other study.","Bindayna, Khalid Mubarak; Crinion, Shane",Microb Pathog,,253

CONCLUSIONS: The CE-IVD GPS&#8482; CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test, available worldwide with full analytical and diagnostic validation, is the more exclusive for SARS-CoV-2 by far. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Considering the CoVID-19 pandemic status, the exclusivity of RT-qPCR tests is crucial to avoid false positives due to related coronaviruses. This work provides of a highly specific and validated RT-qPCR method for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which represents a case of efficient transfer of technology successfully used since the pandemic was declared.","Martínez-Murcia, A; Bru, G; Navarro, A; Ros-Tárraga, P; García-Sirera, A; Pérez, L",J Appl Microbiol,,253

To address this, we analyzed seropositivity in 9089 adults in the United States who had not been diagnosed previously with COVID-19. Individuals with characteristics that reflected the U.S. population (n = 27,716) were selected by quota sampling from 462,949 volunteers. Enrolled participants (n = 11,382) provided medical, geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic information and dried blood samples. Survey questions coincident with the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey, a large probability-based national survey, were used to adjust for selection bias. Most blood samples (88.7%) were collected between 10 May and 31 July 2020 and were processed using ELISA to measure seropositivity (IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the spike protein receptor binding domain). The overall weighted undiagnosed seropositivity estimate was 4.6% (95% CI, 2.6 to 6.5%), with race, age, sex, ethnicity, and urban/rural subgroup estimates ranging from 1.1% to 14.2%. The highest seropositivity estimates were in African American participants; younger, female, and Hispanic participants; and residents of urban centers. These data indicate that there were 4.8 undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections for every diagnosed case of COVID-19, and an estimated 16.8 million infections were undiagnosed by mid-July 2020 in the United States.","Kalish, Heather; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; Hunsberger, Sally; Baus, Holly Ann; Fay, Michael P; Siripong, Nalyn; Wang, Jing; Hicks, Jennifer; Mehalko, Jennifer; Travers, Jameson; Drew, Matthew; Pauly, Kyle; Spathies, Jacquelyn; Ngo, Tran; Adusei, Kenneth M; Karkanitsa, Maria; Croker, Jennifer A; Li, Yan; Graubard, Barry I; Czajkowski, Lindsay; Belliveau, Olivia; Chairez, Cheryl; Snead, Kelly R; Frank, Peter; Shunmugavel, Anandakumar; Han, Alison; Giurgea, Luca T; Rosas, Luz Angela; Bean, Rachel; Athota, Rani; Cervantes-Medina, Adriana; Gouzoulis, Monica; Heffelfinger, Brittany; Valenti, Shannon; Caldararo, Rocco; Kolberg, Michelle M; Kelly, Andrew; Simon, Reid; Shafiq, Saifullah; Wall, Vanessa; Reed, Susan; Ford, Eric W; Lokwani, Ravi; Denson, John-Paul; Messing, Simon; Michael, Sam G; Gillette, William; Kimberly, Robert P; Reis, Steven E; Hall, Matthew D",Sci. transl. med,,253

Indeed, despite many past efforts, we still lack definitive models to account for experimental quantities like protein melting temperature or complex binding affinity. Here, we investigate and compare chemical and physical features on a dataset of protein with known melting temperature as well as a large dataset of protein-protein complexes with reliable experimental binding affinity. In particular, we probed the aminoacid composition and the organization of the network of intramolecular and intermolecular interaction energies among residues. We found that hydrophobic residues present on the protein surfaces are preferentially located in the binding regions, while charged residues behave oppositely. In addition, the abundance of polar amino acid like Serine and Proline correlates with the binding affinity of the complexes. Analysing the interaction energies we found that distant Coulombic interactions are responsible for thermal stability while the total inter-molecular van der Waals energy correlates with protein-protein binding affinity.","Desantis, Fausta; Miotto, Mattia; Rienzo, Lorenzo Di; Milanetti, Edoardo; Ruocco, Giancarlo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08099v1.pdf,253

However, the relevance of these investigations with respect to understanding MCAs' chemistry appears often vague. Here, we discuss how insights into the electronic structure obtained from negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) combined with theoretical calculations and collision-induced dissociation can provide a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic chemical reactivity of MCAs and their fragments. This is exemplified in our studies on polyhedral closo-borate dianions [BnXn]2- (n = 6, 10, 11, 12; X = H, F-I, CN) and their fragment ions. For example, the rational design of closo-borate dianions with specific electronic properties is described, which leads to generating highly reactive fragments. Depending on the dianionic precursor, these fragments are tuned to either bind noble gases effectively or activate small molecules like CO and N2. The intrinsic electronic properties of closo-borate dianions are further compared to their electrochemistry in solutions, revealing solvent effects on the redox potentials. Neutral host molecules such as cyclodextrins are found to bind strongly to [BnXn]2-, and gas phase NIPES provides insights into the intrinsic host-guest interactions. Finally, outlooks including the direct NIPES of molecular fragment ions that cannot be generated in the condensed phase and their utilization in preparative mass spectrometry are discussed.","Warneke, Jonas; Wang, Xue-Bin",J. phys. chem.

Methods: The Ethic Committee of our institution approved the protocol of this study and waived the requirement for patient informed consent. Two hundreds and ninety-five patients were enrolled in this study (healthy person: 149; COVID-19 patients: 146), which were divided into three separate non-overlapping cohorts (training set, n=135, healthy person, n=69, patients, n=66; validation set, n=20, healthy person, n=10, patients, n=10; test set, n=140, healthy person, n=70, patients, n=70). The DenseNet was trained and tested to classify the images as having manifestation of COVID-19 or as healthy. A radiologist also blindly evaluated all the test images and rechecked the misdiagnosed cases by DenseNet. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and areas under the curve (AUCs) were used to assess the model performance. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of DenseNet model and radiologist were also calculated. Results: The DenseNet algorithm model yielded an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.958-1.0) in the validation set and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.972-0.995) in the test set. The threshold value was selected as 0.8, while for validation and test sets, the accuracies were 95% and 92%, the sensitivities were 100% and 97%, the specificities were 90% and 87%, and the F1 values were 95% and 93%, respectively. The sensitivity of radiologist was 94%, the specificity was 96%, while the accuracy was 95%. Conclusions: Deep learning (DL) with DenseNet can accurately classify COVID-19 on HRCT with an AUC of 0.98, which can reduce the miss diagnosis rate (combined with radiologists' evaluation) and radiologists' workload.","Yang, Shuyi; Jiang, Longquan; Cao, Zhuoqun; Wang, Liya; Cao, Jiawang; Feng, Rui; Zhang, Zhiyong; Xue, Xiangyang; Shi, Yuxin; Shan, Fei",Ann.

215945,Care for laboratory animals during COVID-19 crisis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness, and smoking adversely impacts the respiratory and immune systems; this confluence may therefore incentivize smokers to quit. The present study, conducted in four high-income countries during the first global wave of COVID-19, examined the association between COVID-19 and: (1) thoughts about quitting smoking; (2) changes in smoking (quit attempt, reduced or increased smoking, or no change); and (3) factors related to a positive change (making a quit attempt or reducing smoking) based on an adapted framework of the Health Belief Model. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 6870 adult smokers participating in the Wave 3 (2020) ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey conducted in Australia, Canada, England, and United States (US). These four countries had varying responses to the pandemic by governments and public health, ranging from advising voluntary social distancing to implementing national and subnational staged lockdowns. Considering these varying responses, and the differences in the number of confirmed cases and deaths (greatest in England and the US and lowest in Australia), smoking behaviours related to COVID-19 may have differed between countries. Other factors that may be related to changes in smoking because of COVID-19 were also explored (e.g., sociodemographics, nicotine dependence, perceptions about personal and general risks of smoking on COVID-19). Regression analyses were conducted on weighted data. RESULTS: Overall, 46.7% of smokers reported thinking about quitting because of COVID-19, which differed by country (p<0.001): England highest (50.9%) and Australia lowest (37.6%). Thinking about quitting smoking because of COVID-19 was more frequent among: females, ethnic minorities, those with financial stress, current vapers, less dependent smokers (non-daily and fewer cigarettes smoked/day), those with greater concern about personal susceptibility of infection, and those who believe COVID-19 is more severe for smokers. Smoking behaviour changes due to COVID-19 were: 1.1% attempted to quit, 14.2% reduced smoking, and 14.6% increased smoking (70.2% reported no change). Positive behaviour change (tried to quit/reduced smoking) was reported by 15.5% of smokers, which differed by country (p = 0.02), where Australia had significantly lower rates than the other three countries. A positive behavioural smoking change was more likely among smokers with: lower dependence, greater concern about personal susceptibility to infection, and believing that COVID-19 is more severe for smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Though nearly half of smokers reported thinking about quitting because of COVID-19, the vast majority did not change their smoking behaviour. Smokers were more likely to try and quit or reduce their smoking if they had greater concern about susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 related to smoking. Smokers in Australia were least likely to reduce or try to quit smoking, which could be related to the significantly lower impact of COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic relative to the other countries.","Gravely, Shannon; Craig, Lorraine V; Cummings, K Michael; Ouimet, Janine; Loewen, Ruth; Martin, Nadia; Chung-Hall, Janet; Driezen, Pete; Hitchman, Sara C; McNeill, Ann; Hyland, Andrew; Quah, Anne C K; O039,; Connor, Richard J; Borland, Ron; Thompson, Mary E; Boudreau, Christian; Fong, Geoffrey T",PLoS One,,253

This may place anesthetists at higher risk of infection due to their frequent involvement in aerosol-generating airway interventions. Many anesthethetic COVID-19 guidelines have emerged, whose underlying management principles include minimizing aerosol contamination and protecting healthcare workers. These guidelines originate from Australia and New Zealand, Canada, China, India, Italy, Korea, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients may require airway interventions, and difficult tracheal intubation secondary to laryngeal edema has been reported. Pre-pandemic difficult airway guidelines include those from Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Scandinavia, the United States and the United Kingdom. These difficult airway guidelines require modifications in order to align with the principles of the anesthetic COVID-19 guidelines. In turn, most of the anesthetic COVID-19 guidelines do not, or only briefly, discuss an airway strategy after failed tracheal intubation. Our article identifies and compares pre-pandemic difficult airway guidelines with the recent anesthetic COVID-19 guidelines. We combine the principles from both sets of guidelines and explain the necessary modifications to the airway guidelines, to form a failed tracheal intubation airway strategy in the COVID-19 patient.

This study screened for clinical symptoms and evaluated the efficacy of a brief, online social-contact-based video intervention in increasing treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. We hypothesized that the video-based intervention would increase treatment-seeking intentions more than written vignette and control conditions. METHODS: One hundred seventy-two veterans were randomized to either a (a) brief video-based intervention; (b) written vignette intervention, or (c) nonintervention control group. In the 3-min video, a veteran previously diagnosed with PTSD described his symptom reactivation by Covid-19, his barriers to care, and how therapy helped him to cope. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention, and at 14- and 30-day follow-ups. RESULTS: A total of 91 (53%) veterans reported high levels of clinical symptoms, especially those self-reporting Covid-19 exposure. The brief video-based intervention yielded greater increase in treatment-seeking intentions among veterans. Within the video group, women showed an increase in treatment-seeking intentions from baseline to postintervention only, whereas men showed a more sustained effect, from baseline to Day 14. CONCLUSIONS: Surveyed veterans reported high symptoms levels. A brief video intervention increased treatment-seeking intention, likely through identification and emotional engagement with the video protagonist. This easily disseminable video-based intervention has the potential to increase likelihood of seeking care. Future research should examine longer term sustainability and changes in help-seeking behavior.","Amsalem, Doron; Lazarov, Amit; Markowitz, John C; Gorman, Daniel; Dixon, Lisa B; Neria, Yuval",Depress Anxiety,,253

218460,Looking at the ‘field’ through a Zoom lens: Methodological reflections on conducting online research during a global pandemic,2021,"Obesity and diabetes are established comorbidities for COVID-19. Adipose tissue demonstrates high expression of ACE2 which SARS- CoV-2 exploits to enter host cells. This makes adipose tissue a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 viruses and thus increases the integral viral load. Acute viral infection results in ACE2 downregulation. This relative deficiency can lead to disturbances in other systems controlled by ACE2, including the renin-angiotensin system. This will be further increased in the case of pre-conditions with already compromised functioning of these systems, such as in patients with obesity and diabetes. Here, we propose that interactions of virally-induced ACE2 deficiency with obesity and/or diabetes leads to a synergistic further impairment of endothelial and gut barrier function. The appearance of bacteria and/or their products in the lungs of obese and diabetic patients promotes interactions between viral and bacterial pathogens, resulting in a more severe lung injury in COVID-19.","Kruglikov, Ilja L; Shah, Manasi; Scherer, Philipp E",eLife (Cambridge),,253

DESIGN: This was a descriptive study detailing the process and findings from implementation of a COVID-19 universal preprocedural screening program. SETTING: An adult academic tertiary center in Indiana. PATIENTS: Patients were included in the analysis if they were screened 96 hours prior to or within 24 hours after undergoing a procedure in the operating room, cardiac catheterization lab, or endoscopy. METHODS: A report was generated from the electronic health record of patients undergoing procedures from a six week period of time (May 4th-June 14th, 2020). Health records for positive screens were reviewed and classified as symptomatic if they met either criteria: (1) screen performed due to presence of COVID-19 symptoms; (2) documentation of symptoms at the time of the screen. Patients with a positive screen that did not meet symptomatic criteria were classified as asymptomatic. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate frequencies and percentages for the included sample. RESULTS: The initial sample included 2,194 patients, comprised of 46 positive and 2,148 negative screens. Out of the 46 patients who had a positive test, 17 were asymptomatic, resulting in an asymptomatic rate of 0.79% (17/2165). CONCLUSION: Findings validated the value of the program through identification of a low rate of asymptomatic positive screens and procedural team adoption and sustainment. Findings may help inform decision making of like organizations attempting to enhance safety while resuming elective procedures.","Dbeibo, Lana; Kuebler, Kari; Keen, Alyson; George, Annie; Kelley, Kristen; Sadowski, Josh; Basham, Laura; Beeson, Terrie; Schmidt, C Max; Beeler, Cole; Webb, Douglas",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,253

Patients with severe COVID-19 may develop acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require mechanical ventilation. Key features of SARS-CoV-2 induced pulmonary complications include an overexpression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that contribute to a 'cytokine storm.' In the current study an inflammatory state in Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells was characterized in which significantly elevated transcripts of the immunostimulatory chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were present. Additionally, an increase in gene expression of the cytokines IL-6, TNF&#945;, and IFN-Î³ was observed. The transcription of CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-6, and IFN-Î³ was also induced in the lungs of human transgenic angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. To elucidate cell signaling pathways responsible for chemokine upregulation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, small molecule inhibitors targeting key signaling kinases were used. The induction of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 gene expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection was markedly reduced by treatment with the AKT inhibitor GSK690693. Samples from COVID-19 positive individuals also displayed marked increases in CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 transcripts as well as transcripts in the AKT pathway. The current study elucidates potential pathway specific targets for reducing the induction of chemokines that may be contributing to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis via hyperinflammation.","Callahan, Victoria; Hawks, Seth; Crawford, Matthew A; Lehman, Caitlin W; Morrison, Holly A; Ivester, Hannah M; Akhrymuk, Ivan; Boghdeh, Niloufar; Flor, Rafaela; Finkielstein, Carla V; Allen, Irving Coy; Weger-Lucarelli, James; Duggal, Nisha; Hughes, Molly A; Kehn-Hall, Kylene",Viruses,,253

Piacenza is one of the most affected cities in Italy. Many infections occurred in the hospital due to the high frequency of patients and healthcare professionals interaction. The aim of the work is to evaluate advantages of universal screening for Sars-Cov-2 in pregnant women admitted to a hospital setting and calculate frequency of infection in an obstetrical population. Methods: all pregnant women attending Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital in Piacenza from 22nd April to 18th June 2020 were screened for Sars-Cov-2 using a nasopharyngeal swab. Results: 240 pregnant women were tested upon admission: all twelve (5%) testing positive were asymptomatic. None of the positive asymptomatic women developed COVID-19 symptoms or adverse perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: the diagnosis of asymptomatic pregnant women through universal screening provides the opportunity to protect mothers, babies and heath care workers. In accordance with other studies, our findings add to the growing body of evidence showing high rates of asymptomatic infection in the healthcare setting and highlight a critical need for universal screening of pregnant women.","Grossi, Elena; Agnoli, Benedetta; Baldini, Monica; Illari, Simona; Bonini, Renza; Scagnelli, Giuseppe",Acta Biomed,,253

To address this pressing issue, we developed the MyREADY TransitionTM BBD App, a patient-facing e-health intervention. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to determine whether the App will result in greater transition readiness compared with usual care for youth with BBD. Secondary aims included exploring the contextual experiences of youth using the App, as well as the interactive processes of youth, their parents/caregivers and healthcare providers around use of the intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aimed to randomise 264 youth with BBD between 15 and 17 years of age, to receive existing services/usual care (control group) or to receive usual care along with the App (intervention group). Our recruitment strategy includes remote and virtual options in response to the current requirements for physical distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will use an embedded experimental model design which involves embedding a qualitative study within a RCT. The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire will be administered as the primary outcome measure. Analysis of covariance will be used to compare change in the two groups on the primary outcome measure; analysis will be intention-to-treat. Interviews will be conducted with subsets of youth in the intervention group, as well as parents/caregivers and healthcare providers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the research ethics board of each participating site in four different regions in Canada. We will leverage our patient and family partnerships to find novel dissemination strategies.

221604,Citizens’ food habit behavior and food waste consequences during the first covid‐19 lockdown in Spain,2021,"BACKGROUND: Antibody tests are essential tools to investigate humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. While first-generation antibody tests have primarily provided qualitative results, accurate seroprevalence studies and tracking of antibody levels over time require highly specific, sensitive and quantitative test setups. METHODS: We have developed two quantitative, easy-to-implement SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, based on the spike receptor binding domain and the nucleocapsid protein. Comprehensive evaluation of antigens from several biotechnological platforms enabled the identification of superior antigen designs for reliable serodiagnostic. Cut-off modelling based on unprecedented large and heterogeneous multicentric validation cohorts allowed us to define optimal thresholds for the tests' broad applications in different aspects of clinical use, such as seroprevalence studies and convalescent plasma donor qualification. FINDINGS: Both developed serotests individually performed similarly-well as fully-automated CE-marked test systems. Our described sensitivity-improved orthogonal test approach assures highest specificity (99.8%); thereby enabling robust serodiagnosis in low-prevalence settings with simple test formats. The inclusion of a calibrator permits accurate quantitative monitoring of antibody concentrations in samples collected at different time points during the acute and convalescent phase of COVID-19 and disclosed antibody level thresholds that correlate well with robust neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate that antigen source and purity strongly impact serotest performance. Comprehensive biotechnology-assisted selection of antigens and in-depth characterisation of the assays allowed us to overcome limitations of simple ELISA-based antibody test formats based on chromometric reporters, to yield comparable assay performance as fully-automated platforms.

221659,Cataloguing Education in the midst of the Coronavirus (COVID-19): The authors perspectives,2020,"PURPOSE: In Dec 2019, COVID-19 was first recognized and led to a worldwide pandemic. The German government implemented a shutdown in Mar 2020, affecting outpatient and hospital care. The aim of the present article was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on patient volumes and surgical procedures of a Level I trauma center in Germany. METHODS: All emergency patients were recorded retrospectively during the shutdown and compared to a calendar-matched control period (CTRL). Total emergency patient contacts including trauma mechanisms, injury patterns and operation numbers were recorded including absolute numbers, incidence proportions and risk ratios. RESULTS: During the shutdown period, we observed a decrease of emergency patient cases (417) compared to CTRL (575), a decrease of elective cases (42 vs. 13) and of the total number of operations (397 vs. 325). Incidence proportions of emergency operations increased from 8.2 to 12.2% (shutdown) and elective surgical cases decreased (11.1 vs. 4.3%). As we observed a decrease for most trauma mechanisms and injury patterns, we found an increasing incidence proportion for severe open fractures. Household-related injuries were reported with an increasing incidence proportion from 26.8 to 47.5% (shutdown). We found an increasing tendency of trauma and injuries related to psychological disorders. CONCLUSION: This analysis shows a decrease of total patient numbers in an emergency department of a Level I trauma center and a decrease of the total number of operations during the shutdown period. Concurrently, we observed an increase of severe open fractures and emergency operations. Furthermore, trauma mechanism changed with less traffic, work and sports-related accidents.","Kreis, Carolin A; Ortmann, Birte; Freistuehler, Moritz; Hartensuer, René; Van Aken, Hugo; Raschke, Michael J; Schliemann, Benedikt",Eur. j. trauma emerg. surg,,253

The objectives of this study were (1) to propose the model for predicting COVID-19 using exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), neural network, and fuzzy time series and (2) to compare the performance for each model by using RMSE as evaluation tool. In this study, the splitting data is implemented by 3:1 ratio on train and test data set. The results show that the neural network has the smallest error, 772.46 for RMSE. It means that neural network perform better than other forecasting model. Once, the characteristic data had big impact to building forecasting model whether in classical or modern model.","Septiarini, T. W.; Taufik, M. R.; Prasetya, T. A.

221690,A Vision-based Social Distancing and Critical Density Detection System for COVID-19,2020-07-07,"BACKGROUND: Hypertensive patients, often characterized by chronic inflammation, are susceptible to diabetes. Evidence suggests that the positive association between serum ferritin (SF) and diabetes was affected by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), an inflammation marker. We investigate whether there was an interaction between SF and hs-CRP on diabetes in hypertensive patients. METHODS: We analysed data of 1,735 hypertensive people in this cross-sectional study. Diabetes was diagnosed when fasting blood glucose &#8805; 7.0 mmol/L and/or a previous clinical diagnosis of diabetes. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of the SF and hs-CRP with diabetes. Multiplicative interaction was evaluated by incorporating a cross-product term for SF and hs-CRP to the logistic regression model. Additive interaction was assessed by calculating the relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) and attributed proportion due to interaction (AP). RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, SF (highest vs lowest tertile: odds ratio [OR], 1.61; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.16) was positively associated with diabetes. There was no multiplicative interaction between SF and hs-CRP, but evidence of additive interaction in regard to diabetes (RERI: 0.86; 95 % CI: 0.06-1.67). Compared to the patients with low SF (lower two thirds) and low hs-CRP (&#8804; 2 mg/L), those with high SF (upper one third) and high hs-CRP (> 2 mg/L) had increased OR for diabetes (adjusted OR: 2.33 [1.65-3.30]), with 37.0 % of the effects attributed to the additive interaction (AP: 0.37; 95 % CI: 0.09-0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Within a cross-sectional study consisting of hypertensive patients, co-exposure to high SF and high hs-CRP was synergistically associated with diabetes. Dietary intervention or pharmacological treatment to lowering SF concentration may help to reduce diabetes morbidity in hypertensive patient with chronic inflammation.","Zhou, Juan; Wang, Ning; Wang, Dongxia; Zhao, Rui; Zhao, Dan; Ouyang, Binfa; Peng, Xiaolin; Hao, Liping",J Trace Elem Med Biol,,253
222101,Post-COVID Australian universities The need for a new teaching and research vision,2020,"AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer in the UK. Following National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance for faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) (DG30), we introduced a service for the measurement of faecal haemoglobin (fHb) in symptomatic patients in line with the 2017 update of the NG12 guidance. The purpose of this study was to audit the use of FIT, focussing on the indication for request and referral for diagnostic tests as recommended in NICE guidance. METHODS: Testing was rolled out after careful introduction with extensive education led by the local Cancer Alliance and reinforced by the laboratory. After 6 months, the outcomes of all patients tested were reviewed. RESULTS: 1203 samples were received, of which 894 (74.3%) were suitable for analysis. Of these, 482 (53.9%) actually met the criteria for FIT analysis stipulated in our patient pathway. Eight patients were diagnosed with CRC; fHb was detectable in all and was &#8805;200 µg/g in seven and <10 µg/g in one. 217 patients underwent gastrointestinal investigations, and the sensitivity and specificity of FIT for CRC were found to be 87.5% (95% CI 46.6% to 99.7%) and 52.6% (95% CI 45.6% to 59.6%), respectively. Patients with anaemia were more likely to have fHb &#8805;10 µg/g. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest benefits from the introduction of FIT in terms of more efficient use of diagnostic investigations, while revealing initial problems relating to familiarity with a new test. This merits further intervention with education and awareness programmes for Primary Care and further audit.","Ayling, Ruth M; Machesney, Michael",J. clin. pathol,,253
222283,Pivoting authentic assessment to an accounting podcast during COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Compared with the general population, people living with dementia have been unequivocally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a paucity of knowledge on the COVID-19 impact on people with dementia and their care partners. The objective of this scoping review was to synthesize the existing literature on the COVID-19 experiences of people with dementia and their care partners. METHODS: Following Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, we searched five electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science) and an online search engine (Google Scholar). Inclusion criteria consisted of English-language articles focusing on the COVID-19 experiences of people with dementia and their care partners. SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one articles met our inclusion criteria: six letters to the editor, seven commentaries, and eight original research studies. In the literature, five main themes were identified: (i) care partner fatigue and burnout; (ii) lack of access to services and supports; (iii) worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive function; (iv) coping with COVID-19; and (v) the need for more evidence-informed research. Factors such as living alone, having advanced dementia, and the length of confinement were found to exacerbate the impact of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Urgent action is needed to support people living with dementia and their care partners in the pandemic. With little access to supports and services, people with dementia and their care partners are currently at a point of crisis. Collaboration and more evidence-informed research are critical to reducing mortality and supporting people with dementia during the pandemic.","Bacsu, Juanita-Dawne R; O039,; Connell, Megan E; Webster, Claire; Poole, Lisa; Wighton, Mary Beth; Sivananthan, Saskia",Can J Public Health,,253
222550,Strengthening For Entrepreneurship Program Of Sorghum Base As Food Alternative During The Pandemic Recovery COVID-19,2020,"In this coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) era, when pneumonitis occurs in patients with lung cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a major challenge is to make a rapid and correct differential diagnosis among drug-induced pulmonary toxicity, tumour progression, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced pneumonitis. While waiting for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing results, an accurate evaluation of the symptoms and serologic features can help us make a first diagnostic hypothesis and quickly start correct treatment. Physicians need a collaborative effort to develop and share a common database reporting clinical (anosmia, dysgeusia), serologic, and radiologic data in ICI-treated patients with lung cancer developing interstitial disease to create an evidence-based clinical diagnostic algorithm. This tool will continue to be helpful when we emerge from the pandemic crisis into a world in which COVID-19 may not have been eradicated to better select the target population requiring the most resource-consuming PCR tests.","Catania, Chiara; Stati, Valeria; Spitaleri, Gianluca",Tumori,,253
222652,Changing Dynamics of Regional Trade and Cooperation: A Case of Japan and South Korea,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has completely changed our daily clinical practice as well as our social relations. Many organs and biological systems are involved in SARS-Cov-2 infection, either due to direct virus-induced damage or to indirect effects that can have systemic consequences. Endocrine system is not only an exception but its involvement in COVID-19 is so relevant that an ""endocrine phenotype"" of COVID-19 has progressively acquired clinical relevance. AIM: We have been appointed by the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) to update with the current statement ESE members and the whole endocrine community on the emerging endocrine phenotype of COVID-19 and its implication for the prevention and management of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes has a major role in this phenotype since it is one of the most frequent comorbidities associated with severity and mortality of COVID-19. Careful management including treatment modifications may be required for protecting our patients rather with known diabetes from the most dangerous consequences of COVID-19 or hospitalized with COVID-19, but also in patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced newly onset diabetes. Obesity increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and the risk for COVID-19 adverse outcome. Adequate nutritional management needs to be granted to patients with obesity or undernourishment in order to limit their increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection. Lack of vitamin D, hypocalcemia and vertebral fractures have also emerged as frequent findings in the hospitalized COVID-19 population and may negatively impact on the outcome of such patients. Also, in patients with adrenal insufficiency prompt adaptation of glucocorticoid doses may be needed. Moreover, in this updated statement role of sex hormones as well as peculiar pituitary and thyroid aspects of COVID-19 have been included. Finally, in view of the mass vaccination, potential implications for endocrine patients should be considered.","Puig-Domingo, M; Marazuela, M; Yildiz, B O; Giustina, A",Endocrine,,253

Healthcare workers in Singapore working in high-risk areas were mandated to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 face mask and protective eyewear while attending to patients. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the risk factors associated with the development of de novo PPE-associated headaches as well as the perceived impact of these headaches on their personal health and work performance. The impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing headache disorders was also investigated. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study among healthcare workers at our tertiary institution who were working in high-risk hospital areas during COVID-19. All respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 158 healthcare workers participated in the study. Majority [126/158 (77.8%)] were aged 21-35 years. Participants included nurses [102/158 (64.6%)], doctors [51/158 (32.3%)], and paramedical staff [5/158 (3.2%)]. Pre-existing primary headache diagnosis was present in about a third [46/158 (29.1%)] of respondents. Those based at the emergency department had higher average daily duration of combined PPE exposure compared to those working in isolation wards [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 5.2 (SD 2.4) hours, P < .0001] or medical ICU [7.0 (SD 2.2) vs 2.2 (SD 0.41) hours, P < .0001]. Out of 158 respondents, 128 (81.0%) respondents developed de novo PPE-associated headaches. A pre-existing primary headache diagnosis (OR = 4.20, 95% CI 1.48-15.40; P = .030) and combined PPE usage for >4 hours per day (OR 3.91, 95% CI 1.35-11.31; P = .012) were independently associated with de novo PPE-associated headaches. Since COVID-19 outbreak, 42/46 (91.3%) of respondents with pre-existing headache diagnosis either ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that the increased PPE usage had affected the control of their background headaches, which affected their level of work performance. CONCLUSION: Most healthcare workers develop de novo PPE-associated headaches or exacerbation of their pre-existing headache disorders.","Ong, Jonathan J Y; Bharatendu, Chandra; Goh, Yihui; Tang, Jonathan Z Y; Sooi, Kenneth W X; Tan, Yi Lin; Tan, Benjamin Y Q; Teoh, Hock-Luen; Ong, Shi T; Allen, David M; Sharma, Vijay K",Headache,,253
223207,Exercise Anatomy: A Flexible Approach,2021,"This study aimed to compare efficacy and safety of HepaSpheres and CalliSpheres in unresectable large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. One hundred and twenty-seven unresectable large HCC patients receiving drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) treatment with CalliSpheres or HepaSpheres microspheres were analyzed. Treatment response, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score, adverse events, main liver function indexes, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Objective response rate (82.7% vs. 63.8%, p=.030) and disease control rate (100.0% vs. 91.5%, p=.030) were increased in CalliSpheres group compared to HepaSpheres group at 1 month after treatment, while no difference was found between the two groups regarding treatment response at 3 or 6 months post treatment (all p>.05). The KPS score at 1, 3, and 6 months was similar between the two groups (all p>.05). As for the liver function, the ALT, AST, ALB, and TBIL levels at 7 and 30 days were of no difference between the two groups (all p>.05). In addition, the adverse events including nausea/vomiting, pain, fever, myelosuppression, biloma, and abscess were of no difference between the two groups, either (all p>.05). In terms of survival profile, there was no difference regarding TTP (6.3 months (95%CI: 5.9-6.6 months) vs. 6.0 months (95%CI: 5.6-6.4 months), p=.082) or OS (23.0 months (95%CI: 20.1-25.9 months) vs. 22.0 months (95%CI: 20.2-23.8 months), p=.571) between the two groups. In conclusion, CalliSpheres seems to be superior in short-term efficacy and equal in long-term efficacy as well as safety compared to HepaSpheres for DEB-TACE treatment in unresectable large HCC patients.","Zhao, Guangsheng; Liu, Song; Chen, Songbai; Ren, Zhizhong; Li, Chuang; Bian, Jie; Wu, Jianlin; Zhou, Jun; Zhang, Yuewei",Drug Deliv,,253

Cough detection is important to prevent, assess and control epidemic, such as COVID-19. This paper proposes a model to detect cough events from cough audio signals. The models are trained by the dataset combined ESC-50 dataset with self-recorded cough recordings. The test dataset contains inpatient cough recordings collected from inpatients of the respiratory disease department in Ruijin Hospital. We totally build 15 cough detection models based on different feature numbers selected by Random Frog, Uninformative Variable Elimination (UVE), and Variable influence on projection (VIP) algorithms respectively. The optimal model is based on 20 features selected from Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features by UVE algorithm and classified with Support Vector Machine (SVM) linear two-class classifier. The best cough detection model realizes the accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score with 94.9%, 97.1%, 93.1% and 0.95 respectively. Its excellent performance with fewer dimensionality of the feature vector shows the potential of being applied to mobile devices, such as smartphones, thus making cough detection remote and non-contact.","Chen, Xinru; Hu, Menghan; Zhai, Guangtao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03538v1.pdf,253

224640,Un-Used Bank Capital Buffers and Credit Supply Shocks at SMEs During the Pandemic (preprint),2021,"The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is the molecular target for many vaccines and antibody-based prophylactics aimed at bringing COVID-19 under control. Such a narrow molecular focus raises the specter of viral immune evasion as a potential failure mode for these biomedical interventions. With the emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 with altered transmissibility and immune evasion potential, a critical question is this: how easily can the virus escape neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the spike RBD? To answer this question, we combined an analysis of the RBD structure-function with an evolutionary modeling framework. Our structure-function analysis revealed that epitopes for RBD-targeting nAbs overlap one another substantially and can be evaded by escape mutants with ACE2 affinities comparable to the wild type, that are observed in sequence surveillance data and infect cells in vitro. This suggests that the fitness cost of nAb-evading mutations is low. We then used evolutionary modeling to predict the frequency of immune escape before and after the widespread presence of nAbs due to vaccines, passive immunization or natural immunity. Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and consequently resistance to vaccines or other prophylactics that rely on one or two antibodies for protection can develop quickly -and repeatedly- under positive selection. Predicted resistance timelines are comparable to those of the decay kinetics of nAbs raised against vaccinal or natural antigens, raising a second potential mechanism for loss of immunity in the population. Strategies for viral elimination should therefore be diversified across molecular targets and therapeutic modalities.","Van Egeren, Debra; Novokhodko, Alexander; Stoddard, Madison; Tran, Uyen; Zetter, Bruce; Rogers, Michael; Pentelute, Bradley L; Carlson, Jonathan M; Hixon, Mark; Joseph-McCarthy, Diane; Chakravarty, Arijit",PLoS One,,253

Addressing the demand-supply gap in a post-COVID-19 era, in which resources are further constrained, will require a major 'reset' of the health system.

225140,THE ROLES of ECONOMIC POLICY UNCERTAINTY and the COVID-19 PANDEMIC in the CORRELATION between CRYPTOCURRENCY and STOCK MARKETS,2021,"PURPOSE: Hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 infection increases the risk of respiratory failure and one of the cogent reasons of mortality associated with COVID-19. Baricitinib, a janus kinases inhibitor, can potentially suppress inflammatory cascades in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of high dose of baricitinib with its usual dose in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This prospective cohort study was conducted on 238 adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eight milligram and 4 mg of baricitinib was given orally to 122 patients in the high dose (HD) group and 116 patients the usual dose (UD) group, respectively daily for 14 days, and clinical outcomes were compared among the groups. RESULTS: Blood oxygen saturation level was stabilized (&#8805;94% on room air) earlier in the HD group compared to the UD group [5 (IQR: 4-5)/8 (IQR: 6-9), P < 0.05]. Patients in the HD group required intensive care unit (ICU) and intubation supports more in the UD group than that in patients of the HD group [17.2%/9%, P < 0.05; 11.2%/4.1%, P > 0.05; N = 116/122, respectively]. The 30-day mortality and 60-day rehospitalization rate were higher in the UD group than the HD group [6%/3.3%, P < 0.01; 11.9%/7.6%, P > 0.05; N = 116/122, respectively]. CONCLUSION: The daily high dose of baricitinib in severe COVID-19 results in early stabilization of the respiratory functions, declined requirements of critical care supports, reduced rehospitalization with mortality rate compared to its daily usual dose.","Hasan, Md Jahidul; Rabbani, Raihan; Anam, Ahmad Mursel; Huq, Shihan Mahmud Redwanul; Polash, Mohammad Mufizul Islam; Nessa, Shahzadi Sayeeda Tun; Bachar, Sitesh C",BMC Infect Dis,,253

METHODS: In a prospective study encompassing 4 winter-seasons, we collected throat gargles (TG) at random time points from allo-SCT recipients (patients) and controls and followed them up for at least 3 weeks including repetitive sampling and documentation of symptoms. A Multiplex-PCR system to identify 20 CARV and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was used to detect CARV. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-four patients with 426 TG and 273 controls with 549 TG were included. There were more patients with a positive test result (25% vs 11% in the controls), and the patients had a higher number of positive TG (70 = 16%) compared to controls (32 = 6%) (P < .001). Altogether, 115 viruses were detected. Multiple viruses in one TG (11/48, 34%) and prolonged shedding were only observed in patients (13/48, 27%). Patients had more RSV (18/83, 26%) and adenovirus (15/83, 21%) than controls (both viruses 2/32, 6%). Independent risk factors for the detection of CARV included age >40 years (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.8-6.4, P < .001) and presence of URTI-symptoms (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.9-5.5, P < .001).

226395,The protracted exodus of migrants from Hyderabad in the time of COVID-19,2021,"The coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic created an extraordinary demand for N95 and similarly rated filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) that remains unmet due to limited stock, production constraints, and logistics. Interest in decontamination and reuse of FFR, a product class designed for single use in healthcare settings, has undergone a parallel surge due to shortages. A worthwhile decontamination method must provide effective inactivation of the targeted pathogen(s), and preserve particle filtration, mask fit, and safety for a subsequent user. This discussion reviews the background of the current shortage, classification, structure and functional aspects of FFR, and potentially effective decontamination methods along with reference websites for those seeking updated information and guidance. The most promising techniques utilize heat, hydrogen peroxide, microwave generated steam, or ultraviolet light. Many require special or repurposed equipment, and a detailed operational roadmap specific to each setting. While limited, research is growing. There is significant variation between models with regard to the ability to withstand decontamination yet remain protective. The number of times an individual respirator can be reused is often limited by its ability to maintain a tight fit after multiple uses rather than by the decontamination method itself. There is no single solution for all settings; each individual or institution must choose according to their need, capability, and available resources. As the current pandemic is expected to continue for months to years, and the possibility of future airborne biologic threats persists, the need for plentiful, effective respiratory protection is stimulating research and innovation.","Cassorla, Lydia",,,253
226531,Olfactory acuity test while pre-symptomatic for COVID-19,2020,"Past: In the early twentieth century, forestry was one of the most important sectors in Norway and an agitated discussion about the perceived decline of forest resources due to over-exploitation was ongoing. To base the discussion on facts, the young state of Norway established Landsskogtakseringen - the world's first National Forest Inventory (NFI). Field work started in 1919 and was carried out by county. Trees were recorded on 10 m wide strips with 1-5 km interspaces. Site quality and land cover categories were recorded along each strip. Results for the first county were published in 1920, and by 1930 most forests below the coniferous tree line were inventoried. The 2nd to 5th inventories followed in the years 1937-1986. As of 1954, temporary sample plot clusters on a 3 km × 3 km grid were used as sampling units. Present: The current NFI grid was implemented in the 6th NFI from 1986 to 1993, when permanent plots on a 3 km × 3 km grid were established below the coniferous tree line. As of the 7th inventory in 1994, the NFI is continuous, and 1/5 of the plots are measured annually. All trees with a diameter &#8805; 5 cm are recorded on circular, 250 m2 plots. The NFI grid was expanded in 2005 to cover alpine regions with 3 km × 9 km and 9 km × 9 km grids. In 2012, the NFI grid within forest reserves was doubled along the cardinal directions. Clustered temporary plots are used periodically to facilitate county-level estimates. As of today, more than 120 variables are recorded in the NFI including bilberry cover, drainage status, deadwood, and forest health. Land-use changes are monitored and trees outside forests are recorded. Future: Considerable research efforts towards the integration of remote sensing technologies enable the publication of the Norwegian Forest Resource Map since 2015, which is also used for small area estimation at the municipality level. On the analysis side, capacity and software for long term growth and yield prognosis are being developed.

226610,Why is it important to report early possible COVID-19 PET/CT findings in cancer patients? Explaining with a case series,2021,"World Health Organization has declared coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. Although there are studies about this novel virus, our knowledge is still limited. There is limited information about its diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. We aimed to investigate the effect of methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin levels on the prognosis of COVID-19. In this observational study, patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during March 1-April 31, 2020 in a secondary-level state hospital in Turkey were included in the study. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method, with nasal, oral or sputum specimens. During the period this study was performed, 3075 patients were tested for COVID-19 and 573 of them were hospitalized. Among the hospitalised patients, 23.2% (133) of them had a positive polymerase chain reaction result for COVID-19. A total of 125 patients, 66 (52.8%) males and 59 (47.2%) females, with an average age of 50.2 ± 19.8 years, were included in the study. The most common findings in chest radiogram were ground-glass areas and consolidations, while one-third of the patients had a normal chest radiogram. Computed thorax tomography was performed for 77.6% (97/125) of the patients. The 24.7% of computed tomographies (24/97) did not reveal any pathological findings, and the most common findings were ground-glass appearance and consolidation. Those who needed intensive care had statistically significantly lower platelet count (P = 0.011) and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (P < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was found in carboxyhemoglobin (P = 0.395) and methemoglobin (P = 1.000) levels. We found that carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin levels had no effect on COVID-19 prognosis, but low platelet level played a role in predicting COVID-19 prognosis. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Harran University Faculty of Medicine on May 11, 2020 with approval No. 09.","Oktem, Begüm; Üzer, Fatih; Kukul Güven, Fatma Mutlu; Kirhan, Idris; Topal, Mehmet",Med Gas Res,,253
226807,“Amazing opportunity”: reflecting on online communication in Israeli schools during the pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: With the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), clinicians have used personal protective equipment to avoid transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However, they still face occupational risk of infection, when treating COVID-19 patients. This may be highest during invasive diagnostic procedures releasing aerosols and droplets. Thereby, the use of diagnostic procedures for Covid-19 associated aspergillosis may be delayed or impeded, as use of bronchoscopy has been discouraged. This leads to avoidance of a crucial procedure for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis. We intent to visualise aerosol and droplet spread and surface contamination during bronchoscopy and address which measures can avoid exposure of health-care workers. METHODS: We created a simulation model to visualise aerosol and droplet generation as well as surface contamination by nebulising fluorescent solution detected by using ultraviolet light- and slow-motion capture. We repurposed covers for ultrasound transducers or endoscopic cameras to prevent surface and ambient air contamination. RESULTS: In our bronchoscopy simulation model, we noticed extensive aerosol generation, droplet spread and surface contamination. Exposure of health-care workers and contamination of surfaces can be efficiently reduced by repurposing covers for ultrasound transducers or endoscopic cameras to seal the tube opening during bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated patients. CONCLUSION: Adequate personal protective equipment and safety strategies allow to minimise contamination during bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients.","Koehler, Philipp; Cornely, Oliver A; Kochanek, Matthias",Mycoses,,253

Infodemiology is now acknowledged by public health organizations and the WHO as an important emerging scientific field and critical area of practice during a pandemic. From the perspective of being the first ""infodemiologist"" who originally coined the term almost two decades ago, I am positing four pillars of infodemic management: (1) information monitoring (infoveillance); (2) building eHealth Literacy and science literacy capacity; (3) encouraging knowledge refinement and quality improvement processes such as fact checking and peer-review; and (4) accurate and timely knowledge translation, minimizing distorting factors such as political or commercial influences. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations has advocated that facts and science should be promoted and that these constitute the antidote to the current infodemic. This is in stark contrast to the realities of infodemic mismanagement and misguided upstream filtering, where social media platforms such as Twitter have advertising policies that sideline science organizations and science publishers, treating peer-reviewed science as ""inappropriate content.""","Eysenbach, Gunther",J Med Internet Res,,253

We also investigated whether the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) could increase vaccine efficacy. Immunization with N and RBD-P2 (RBDP2/N) + alum increased T cell responses in mice and neutralizing antibody levels in rats compared with those obtained using RBD-P2 + alum. Furthermore, in NHPs, RBD-P2/N + alum induced slightly faster SARS-CoV-2 clearance than that induced by RBD-P2 + alum, albeit without statistical significance. Our study supports further development of RBD-P2 as a vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2. Also, it provides insights regarding the use of N in protein-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","Hong, So-Hee; Oh, Hanseul; Park, Yong Wook; Kwak, Hye Won; Oh, Eun Young; Park, Hyo-Jung; Kang, Kyung Won; Kim, Green; Koo, Bon-Sang; Hwang, Eun-Ha; Baek, Seung Ho; Park, Hyeong-Jun; Lee, Yu-Sun; Bang, Yoo-Jin; Kim, Jae-Yong; Bae, Seo-Hyeon; Lee, Su Jeen; Seo, Ki-Weon; Kim, Hak; Kwon, Taewoo; Kim, Ji-Hwan; Lee, Seonghwan; Kim, Eunsom; Kim, Yeonhwa; Park, Jae-Hak; Park, Sang-In; Gonçalves, Marta; Weon, Byung Mook; Jeong, Haengdueng; Nam, Ki Taek; Hwang, Kyung-Ah; Kim, Jihye; Kim, Hun; Lee, Sang-Myeong; Hong, Jung Joo; Nam, Jae-Hwan",Sci.

The aim of this study was the synthesis and evaluation of in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity for phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin 3-5 as well as an in silico study of new compounds as potential ligands of the C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid-spacer peptide 1 (CA-CTD-SP1) as a molecular target of HIV-1 maturation inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that 28-diethoxyphosphoryl-3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)betulin (compound 3), the phosphate analog of bevirimat (betulinic acid derivative, HIV-1 maturation inhibitor), has IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) equal to 0.02 µM. Compound 3 inhibits viral replication at a level comparable to bevirimat and is also more selective (selectivity indices = 1250 and 967, respectively). Molecular docking was used to examine the probable interaction between the phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin and C-terminal domain (CTD) of the HIV-1 capsid (CA)-spacer peptide 1 (SP1) fragment of Gag protein, designated as CTD-SP1. Compared with interactions between bevirimat (BVM) and the protein, an increased number of strong interactions between ligand 3 and the protein, generated by the phosphate group, were observed. These compounds might have the potential to also inhibit SARS-CoV2 proteins, in as far as the intrinsically imprecise docking scores suggest.","Marciniec, Krzysztof; Chrobak, Elwira; Dabrowska, Aleksandra; Bebenek, Ewa; Kadela-Tomanek, Monika; Pecak, Pawel; Boryczka, Stanislaw",Biomolecules,,253

Presented herein are the results of ongoing research to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosol in different hospital facilities (indoor environments) and public spaces (outdoor environments) of a metropolitan center in Brazil. From May to August 2020, 62 samples were collected using active sampling method (air samplers with filters) and passive method (petri dishes) in two hospitals, with different occupancies and infrastructure for contamination control. Outdoor public spaces such as sidewalks and a bus station were also investigated. Five air samples from four facilities in a hospital tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in suspended and sedimentable particles. SARS-CoV-2 was found in aerosols inside the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), in the protective apparel removal room, in the room containing patient mobile toilets and used clothes (room with natural ventilation) and in an external corridor adjacent to the ICU, probably coming from infected patients and/or from aerosolization of virus-laden particles on material/equipment.

The resulting discontinuous advection speed represents the key challenge for the stability analysis. We follow a perturbative approach, where the shape of the cellular profile is clearly separated from its global motion, allowing us to circumvent the discontinuity issue. Further, the homogeneity of the problem leads to two conservation laws, which express themselves in differently weighted functional spaces. This discrepancy between the weights represents another key methodological challenge. We derive an improved Poincar\'e inequality that allows to transfer the information encoded in the conservation laws to the appropriately weighted spaces. As a result, we obtain exponential relaxation to equilibrium with an explicit rate.

Throughout two past months, governments around the world have implemented massive travel restrictions and border control to mitigate the outbreak of this global pandemic. However, the precise effects of travel restrictions on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 remain unknown. Here we combine a global network mobility model with a local epidemiology model to simulate and predict the outbreak dynamics and outbreak control of COVID-19 across Europe. We correlate our mobility model to passenger air travel statistics and calibrate our epidemiology model using the number of reported COVID-19 cases for each country. Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak. Our results suggest that an unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID-19, especially in Central Europe, Spain, and France. Ultimately, our network epidemiology model can inform political decision making and help identify exit strategies from current travel restrictions and total lockdown.","Linka, Kevin; Peirlinck, Mathias; Sahli Costabal, Francisco; Kuhl, Ellen",Comput Methods Biomech Biomed Engin,,253

Here, we characterize rMVAs expressing the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Modifications of full-length S individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin recognition site, and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and soluble hACE2 receptor. Intramuscular injection of mice with the rMVAs induced antibodies, which neutralized a pseudovirus in vitro and, upon passive transfer, protected hACE2 transgenic mice from lethal infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as S-specific CD3+CD8+IFNÎ³+ T cells. Antibody boosting occurred following a second rMVA or adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Immunity conferred by a single vaccination of hACE2 mice prevented morbidity and weight loss upon intranasal infection with SARS-CoV-2 3 wk or 7 wk later. One or two rMVA vaccinations also prevented detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and subgenomic viral mRNAs in the lungs and greatly reduced induction of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs. A low amount of virus was found in the nasal turbinates of only one of eight rMVA-vaccinated mice on day 2 and none later. Detection of low levels of subgenomic mRNAs in turbinates indicated that replication was aborted in immunized animals.","Liu, Ruikang; Americo, Jeffrey L; Cotter, Catherine A; Earl, Patricia L; Erez, Noam; Peng, Chen; Moss, Bernard",Proc.

Identification of the major challenges,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is limited data on outcomes of moderate to severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone in a real-world setting. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of standard of care (SOC) alone vs SOC plus remdesivir and dexamethasone. METHODS: Two population-based nationwide cohorts of individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 during February through December 2020. Death within 30 days and need of mechanical ventilation (MV) were compared by inverse probability of treatment weighted (ITPW) logistic regression analysis and shown as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The 30-d mortality rate of 1694 individuals treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone in addition to SOC was 12.6% compared to 19.7% for 1053 individuals receiving SOC alone. This corresponded to a weighted OR of 30-day mortality of 0.47 (95% CI, 0.38-0.57) for patients treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone compared to patients receiving SOC alone. Similarly, progression to MV was reduced (OR 0.36 (95% CI, 0.29-0.46)). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 during June through December that included remdesivir and dexamethasone was associated with reduced 30-day mortality and need of MV compared to treatment in February through May.","Benfield, Thomas; Bodilsen, Jacob; Brieghel, Christian; Harboe, Zitta Barrella; Helleberg, Marie; Holm, Claire; Israelsen, Simone Bastrup; Jensen, Janne; Jensen, Tomas Østergaard; Johansen, Isik Somuncu; Johnsen, Stine; Madsen, Birgitte Lindegaard; Lundgren, Jens; Meyer, Christian Niels; Mohey, Rajesh; Pedersen, Lars Møller; Nielsen, Henrik; Nielsen, Stig Lønberg; Obel, Niels; Omland, Lars Haukali; Podlekareva, Daria; Poulsen, Birgitte Klindt; Ravn, Pernille; Sandholdt, Haakon; Starling, Jonathan; Storgaard, Merete; Søborg, Christian; Søgaard, Ole Schmeltz; Tranborg, Torben; Wiese, Lothar; Christensen, Hanne Rolighed",Clin. infect. dis,,253

The transient was observed to reach a peak luminosity of $\sim10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 0.3--10 keV X-ray band, which was $\sim20$ times more than the peak optical/UV luminosity. Optical, UV, and X-ray lightcurves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Swift show a decline in flux from the source consistent with $t^{-5/3}$, and observations with NuSTAR and Chandra show a soft X-ray spectrum with photon index $\Gamma=2.9\pm0.1$. The X-ray/UV properties are inconsistent with well known AGN properties and have more in common with known X-ray tidal disruption events (TDE), leading us to conclude that it was likely a TDE. The broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) can be described well by a disk blackbody model with an inner disk temperature of $7.3^{+0.3}_{-0.8}\times10^{5}$ K, with a large fraction ($>40$%) of the disk emission up-scattered into the X-ray band. An optical spectrum taken with Keck/LRIS after the X-ray detection reveals LINER line ratios in the host galaxy, suggesting low-level accretion on to the supermassive black hole prior to the event, but no broad lines or other indications of a TDE were seen. The stellar velocity dispersion implies the mass of the supermassive black hole powering the event is log($M_{\rm BH}$/$M_{\odot}$)$=7.41\pm0.41$, and we estimate that at peak the Eddington fraction of this event was $\sim$50%. This likely TDE was not identified by wide-field optical surveys, nor optical spectroscopy, indicating that more events like this would be missed without wide-field UV or X-ray surveys.","Brightman, Murray; Ward, Charlotte; Stern, Daniel; Mooley, Kunal; De, Kishalay; Gezari, Suvi; Velzen, Sjoert Van; Andreoni, Igor; Graham, Matthew; Masci, Frank J.; Riddle, Reed; Zolkower, Jeffry",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12587v1.pdf,253

234688,Impacts of policy changes on Care-Leaving Workers in a time of coronavirus: Comparative analysis of discretion and constraints,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies that evaluated cardiovascular risk factors considered age as a potential confounder. We aimed to investigate the impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors on fatal outcomes according to age in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed on data collected from PubMed and Embase databases up to 11 June 2020. All observational studies (case series or cohort studies) that assessed in-hospital patients were included, except those involving the paediatric population. Prevalence rates of comorbid diseases and clinical outcomes were stratified by mean patient age in each study (ranges: <50 years, 50-60 years and &#8805;60 years). The primary outcome measure was a composite fatal outcome of severe COVID-19 or death. RESULTS: We included 51 studies with a total of 48 317 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Overall, the relative risk of developing severe COVID-19 or death was significantly higher in patients with risk factors for CVD (hypertension: OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.90; diabetes: 2.25, 95% CI 1.89 to 2.69) and CVD (3.11, 95% 2.55 to 3.79). Younger patients had a lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and CVD compared with older patients; however, the relative risk of fatal outcomes was higher among the former. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the meta-analysis suggest that CVD and its risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) were closely related to fatal outcomes in COVID-19 for patients across all ages. Although young patients had lower prevalence rates of cardiovascular comorbidities than elderly patients, relative risk of fatal outcome in young patients with hypertension, diabetes and CVD was higher than in elderly patients.

237031,Inferior Education or Killing Grandma: The Dilemma Facing the Public School Systems in the United States,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has turned out as one of the worst medical and economic misfortunes across the globe. The etiological agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the Coronaviridae family and represents a disease manifestation from asymptomatic to severe respiratory damage. High transmissibility and contagious nature of the virus helps it to flourish in a large population. The immune system aids to retain the virus, but with accelerated cytokine secretion, it could transform into double edge sword resulting in unrestrained systemic inflammation which might become life-threatening. SARS-CoV-2 sets substantial impact on T-lymphocytes during its course of infection. The number of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and Treg cells tend to decrease profoundly in case of severe illness. Besides, the virus modulates the CD4+ T/ CD8+ T and Treg/Th17 cells ratio and induces the functional exhaustion of T cells to make them inefficient. T cells define the pathogenesis of severe cases and provide major contributions in antiviral defense. Therefore, the apprehension of T-lymphocytes in SARS-CoV-2 infection would implicate in developing antivirals, disease control, and would broaden the way for vaccine formulation. Thus, the review depicts the significance of T-lymphocytes interaction with SARS-CoV-2.

We here tested infectivity and neutralization efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoviruses bearing particular mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) derived either from the Wuhan strains (referred to as D614G or with other sites) or the B.1.351 lineage (referred to as N501Y, K417N, and E484K). The three different pseudoviruses B.1.351 lineage related significantly increased infectivity compared with other mutants that indicated Wuhan strains. Interestingly, K417N and E484K mutations dramatically enhanced cell-cell fusion than N501Y even though their infectivity were similar, suggesting that K417N and E484K mutations harboring SARS-CoV-2 variant might be more transmissible than N501Y mutation containing SARS-CoV-2 variant. We also investigated the efficacy of two different monoclonal antibodies, Casirivimab and Imdevimab that neutralized SARS-CoV-2, against several kinds of pseudoviruses which indicated Wuhan or B.1.351 lineage. Remarkably, Imdevimab effectively neutralized B.1.351 lineage pseudoviruses containing N501Y, K417N, and E484K mutations, while Casirivimab partially affected them. Overall, our results underscore the importance of B.1.351 lineage SARS-CoV-2 in the viral spread and its implication for antibody efficacy.","Kim, Y. J.; Jang, U. S.; Soh, S. M.; Lee, J. Y.; Lee, H.

Thus, it is essential to determine how we can reuse respirators and other personal protective equipment in these urgent times. We investigated multiple commonly used disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%. Heating was recently found to inactivate the virus in solution within 5 min at 70 °C and is among the most scalable, user-friendly methods for viral disinfection. We found that heat (&#8804;85 °C) under various humidities (&#8804;100% relative humidity, RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators. At 85 °C, 30% RH, we were able to perform 50 cycles of heat treatment without significant changes in the filtration efficiency. At low humidity or dry conditions, temperatures up to 100 °C were not found to alter the filtration efficiency significantly within 20 cycles of treatment. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice, which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can potentially impact the material strength and subsequent sealing of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach all may lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.","Liao, Lei; Xiao, Wang; Zhao, Mervin; Yu, Xuanze; Wang, Haotian; Wang, Qiqi; Chu, Steven; Cui, Yi",ACS Nano,,253

241067,Distribution of services within the call center and covid 19 – a case study,2020,"This paper draws upon the concept of recreancy to examine the mental well-being of university students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Briefly, recreancy is loss of societal trust that results when institutional actors can no longer be counted on to perform their responsibilities. Our study of mental well-being and recreancy focuses on the role of universities and government regulators within the education sector. We surveyed 600 UK students attending 161 different public higher education providers in October 2020 during a time when many UK students were isolated in their residences and engaged in online learning. We assessed student well-being using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (scored 7-35) and found the mean score to be 19.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.6, 20.2]. This level of well-being indicates that a significant proportion of UK students face low levels of mental well-being. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicates that high recreancy-measured as a low trust in universities and the government-is associated with low levels of mental well-being across the student sample. While these findings are suggestive, they are also important and we suggest that government and university leaders should not only work to increase food and housing security during the Covid-19 pandemic, but also consider how to combat various sector trends that might intensify recreancy.","Defeyter, Margaret Anne; Stretesky, Paul B; Long, Michael A; Furey, Sinéad; Reynolds, Christian; Porteous, Debbie; Dodd, Alyson; Mann, Emily; Kemp, Anna; Fox, James; McAnallen, Andrew; Gonçalves, Lara",Front Public Health,,253

Residing in a macroeconomic region with GDP > 100% decreased adherence to the Prohealthy (aOR 0.73) but increased adherence to the Unhealthy pattern (aOR 1.47). Adults over 40 years old, those living with children, unemployed, those living in a region with a higher GDP, and those not consuming homemade meals could be more exposed to unhealthy behaviors. From a public health perspective, enhancing the message ""to be active"" during the compulsory isolation period should be prioritized.","Górnicka, Magdalena; Drywien, Malgorzata Ewa; Zielinska, Monika A; Hamulka, Jadwiga",Nutrients,,253
241638,A novel approach to clinical simulation in removable partial denture treatment,2020,"Our evolutionary and structural analyses revealed that the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike gene is a complex mosaic resulting from several recombination events. Additionally, the fixation of variants has mainly been driven by purifying selection, suggesting the presence of conserved structural features. Our dynamic simulations identified two main long-range covariant dynamic movements of the novel glycoprotein, and showed that, as a result of the evolutionary duality, they are preserved. The first movement involves the receptor binding domain with the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain 2 and is maintained across human, bat and pangolin coronaviruses. The second is a complex network of long-range dynamics specific to SARS-CoV-2 involving the novel PRRA and the conserved KR*SF cleavage sites, as well as conserved segments in C-terminal domain 3. These movements, essential for host cell binding, are maintained by hinges conserved across human, bat, and pangolin coronaviruses glycoproteins. The hinges, located around Threonine 333 and Proline 527 within the N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain 2, represent candidate targets for the future development of novel pan-coronavirus inhibitors. In summary, we show that while recombination created a new configuration that increased the covariant dynamic movements of the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein, negative selection preserved its inter-domain structure throughout evolution in different hosts and inter-species transmissions.","Tagliamonte, Massimiliano S; Abid, Nabil; Borocci, Stefano; Sangiovanni, Elisa; Ostrov, David A; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L; Salemi, Marco; Chillemi, Giovanni; Mavian, Carla",Int. j. mol. sci.

242873,Prediction of COVID-19 Infected Cases Using ARIMA: A Case Study,2020,"Importance: In the absence of a vaccine and therapeutic agent, personal hygiene and physical distancing are essential measures to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Objective: To determine whether a social media campaign, targeted at the gaps in behavior on personal hygiene and physical distancing and distributed nationwide via digital news media, may be an effective method to improve behavior and help to inhibit person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study was designed to uncover self-reported gaps in behavior regarding personal hygiene and physical distancing in the Netherlands. A diagnostic survey was distributed by a large national newspaper (De Telegraaf) and a popular social influencer (Govert Sweep) on March 17, 2020, and was completed by 16â¯072 participants. Analysis of these outcomes showed that coughing and sneezing in the elbow was done well, but that handwashing, face touching, and physical distancing showed serious gaps compared with advised behavior. This diagnostic information was used to design infographics and a video targeted at repairing these gaps in behavior. The video and infographics were distributed on a national level on March 21, 2020, followed by a postcampaign survey to measure the results on March 24, 2020. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2020. Exposure: Exposed participants were those who viewed the infographics and/or video. Main Outcomes and Measures: Improvement on the extent of handwashing in all areas, handwashing duration of 20 seconds or longer, awareness on face touching, and physical distancing were measured according to responses on the postcampaign survey. Results: A total of 17â¯189 participants (mean [SD] age, 47.61 [13.57] years; 9100 women [52.9%]) responded to the postcampaign survey. The news article in De Telegraaf was read more than 2 million times, and the influencer video was watched more than 80â¯000 times. Cross-sectional analysis of the postcampaign survey using logistic regression correcting for age, gender, and educational level showed that exposure to the video plus infographics (827 participants) (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.83-2.50; P < .001) and to the infographics alone (11â¯348 participants) (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.22-1.40; P < .001) were positively associated with washing hands in all areas compared with the unexposed group (4751 participants). In addition, exposure to the video plus infographics (adjusted OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.59-2.16; P < .001) and to the infographics alone (adjusted OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.19-1.36; P < .001) were positively associated with washing hands long enough compared with the unexposed group. Exposure to the video alone was not associated with improved handwashing. Compared with the unexposed group, exposure to the infographics alone and video plus infographics were associated with improvements in physical distancing when the participant had COVID-19 syptoms (infographics alone, adjusted OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17; P = .006; video plus infographics, adjusted OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91; P = .001) and face touching (infographics alone, adjusted OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.22-1.38; P < .001; infographics and video, adjusted OR, 1.49, 95% CI, 1.30-1.71; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that a targeted behavioral change campaign, promoted by a news platform and social media, was associated with self-reported improvement in personal hygiene with the aim to prevent person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This method of evidence-based campaigning may be an effective way to improve critical public health issues, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Yousuf, Hamza; Corbin, Jonathan; Sweep, Govert; Hofstra, Martijn; Scherder, Erik; van Gorp, Eric; Zwetsloot, Peter Paul; Zhao, Jiayu; van Rossum, Bert; Jiang, Ting; Lindemans, Jan-Willem; Narula, Jagat; Hofstra, Leonard",JAMA Netw Open,,253

243920,COVID‐19 and food processing in Canada,2021,"Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 caused one of the most devastating pandemics in the recent history of mankind. Due to various countermeasures, including lock-downs, wearing masks and increased hygiene, the virus has been controlled in some parts of the world. More recently, the availability of vaccines, based on RNA or Adenoviruses, have greatly added to our ability to keep the virus at bay;again, however, in some parts of the world only. While available vaccines are effective, it would be desirable to also have more classical vaccines at hand for the future. Key feature of vaccines for long-term control of SARS-CoV-2 would be inexpensive production at large scale, ability to make multiple booster injections and long-term stability at 4°C. Methods Here we describe such a vaccine candidate, consisting of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif grafted genetically onto the surface of the immunologically optimized cucumber mosaic virus, called CuMVTT-RBM. Results Using bacterial fermentation and continuous flow centrifugation for purification, the productivity of the production process is estimated to be >2.5 million doses per 1000-liter fermenter run. We demonstrate that the candidate vaccine is highly immunogenic in mice and rabbits and induces more high avidity antibodies compared to convalescent human sera, and antibodies induced are more cross-reactive to mutant RBDs for variants of concern (VOC). Furthermore, antibody responses are neutralizing and long-lived. In addition, the vaccine candidate was stable for at least 14 months at 4°C Conclusion Thus, the here presented VLP-based vaccine may be a good candidate for use as conventional vaccine in the long-term.","Mohsen, Mona O.; Balke, Ina Zinkhan Simon Zeltina Villija Liu Xuelan Chang Xinyue Krenger Pascal S.; Plattner, Kevin Gharailoo Zahra Vogt Anne-Cathrine S.; Augusto, Gilles Zwicker Marianne Roongta Salony Rothen Dominik A.; Josi, Romano da Costa Joana J.; Sobczak, Jan M.; Nonic, Aleksandra Brand Lee-Anne Nuss Katja Martina Byron Speiser Daniel E.; Kündig, Thomas Jennings Gary T.; Walton, Senta M.; Vogel, Monique Zeltins Andris Bachmann Martin F.",Allergy,,253

245226,Impacts of COVID-19: A Research Agenda to Support People in Their Fight,2020,"Free-water imaging is a diffusion MRI technique that separately models water diffusion hindered by fiber tissue and water that disperses freely in the extracellular space. Studies using this technique have shown that schizophrenia is characterized by a lower level of fractional anisotropy of the tissue compartment (FAt) and higher free-water fractional volume (FW). It is unknown, however, whether such abnormalities are an expression of pre-existing (genetic) risk for schizophrenia or a manifestation of the illness. To investigate the contribution of familial risk factors to white matter abnormalities, we used the free-water imaging technique to assess FAt and FW in a large cohort of 471 participants including 161 patients with schizophrenia, 182 non-psychotic siblings, and 128 healthy controls. In this sample, patients did not show significant differences in FAt as compared to controls, but did exhibit a higher level of FW relative to both controls and siblings in the left uncinate fasciculus, superior corona radiata and fornix / stria terminalis. This increase in FW was found to be related to, though not solely explained by, ventricular enlargement. Siblings did not show significant FW abnormalities. However, siblings did show a higher level of FAt as compared to controls and patients, in line with results of a previous study on the same data using conventional DTI. Taken together, our findings suggest that extracellular free-water accumulation in patients is likely a manifestation of established disease rather than an expression of familial risk for schizophrenia and that super-normal levels of FAt in unaffected siblings may reflect a compensatory process.","Chang, Xiao; Mandl, René C W; Pasternak, Ofer; Brouwer, Rachel M; Cahn, Wiepke; Collin, Guusje",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,253

This study aimed to evaluate the neurologic manifestations and their correlated factors in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted from March 17, 2020 to June 20, 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Iran. The study population consisted of adult patients with a positive result for COVID-19 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nasopharyngeal swabs. Both written and electronic data regarding baseline characteristic, laboratory findings, and neurological manifestations were evaluated and reported. Results: 727 COVID-19 patients with the mean age of 49.94 +/- 17.49 years were studied (56.9% male). At least one neurological symptom was observed in 403 (55.4%) cases. Headache (29.0%), and smell (22.3%) and taste (22.0%) impairment were the most prevalent neurological symptoms, while seizure (1.1%) and stroke (2.3%) were the least common ones.

246759,Growth with Adjectives: Global Poverty and Inequality After the Pandemic,2020,"This study was performed to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and explore risk factors for severe infection. Data of all 131 confirmed cases in Tianjin before February 20 were collected. By February 20, a total of 14/16 districts reported COVID-19 cases, with Baodi district reporting the most cases (n = 56). A total of 22 (16.8%) cases had a Wuhan-related exposure. Fever was the most common symptom (82.4%). The median duration of symptom onset to treatment was [1.0 (0.0–4.0) days], the duration of symptom onset to isolation [2.0 (0.0–6.0) days], and the duration of symptom onset to diagnosis [5.0 (2.0–8.0) days]. The analysis of the transmission chain showed two cluster infections with 62 cases infected. Transmission from a family member constituted 42%, usually at the end of transmission chain. Compared with patients with non-severe infections, patients with severe infections were more likely to be male (46.2 vs. 77.3%, P = 0.009) and had a Wuhan-related exposure (14.0 vs. 40.9%, P = 0.004). Multivariate logistic regression showed that male (OR 3.913, 95% CI 1.206, 12.696; P = 0.023) was an independent risk factor for severe infection. This study provides evidence on the epidemic of COVID-19 by analyzing the epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases in Tianjin. Self-quarantine at an outbreak's early stage, especially for those with high-risk exposures, is conducive to prevent the transmission of infection. Further investigation is needed to confirm the risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection and investigate the mechanisms involved.","Wang, Jin; Li, Zhihui; Cheng, Xiaomin; Hu, Huan; Liao, Conghui; Li, Pengyuan; Lu, Jiahai; Chen, Zeliang",Front.

247027,How Did Banks Fund C&I Drawdowns at the Onset of the COVID-19 Crisis?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Primary health centers (PHCs) represent the first tier of the Indian health care system, providing a range of essential outpatient services to people living in the rural, suburban, and hard-to-reach areas. Diversion of health care resources for containing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly undermined the accessibility and availability of essential health services. Under these circumstances, the preparedness of PHCs in providing safe patient-centered care and meeting the current health needs of the population while preventing further transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is crucial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the primary health care facility preparedness toward the provision of safe outpatient services during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among supervisors and managers of primary health care facilities attached to medical colleges and institutions in India. A list of 60 faculties involved in the management and supervision of PHCs affiliated with the community medicine departments of medical colleges and institutes across India was compiled from an accessible private organization member database. We collected the data through a rapid survey from April 24 to 30, 2020, using a Google Forms online digital questionnaire that evaluated preparedness parameters based on self-assessment by the participants. The preparedness domains assessed were infrastructure availability, health worker safety, and patient care. RESULTS: A total of 51 faculties responded to the survey. Each medical college and institution had on average a total of 2.94 (SD 1.7) PHCs under its jurisdiction. Infrastructural and infection control deficits at the PHC were reported in terms of limited physical space and queuing capacity, lack of separate entry and exit gates (n=25, 49%), inadequate ventilation (n=29, 57%), and negligible airborne infection control measures (n=38, 75.5%). N95 masks were available at 26 (50.9%) sites. Infection prevention and control measures were also suboptimal with inadequate facilities for handwashing and hand hygiene reported in 23.5% (n=12) and 27.4% (n=14) of sites, respectively. The operation of outpatient services, particularly related to maternal and child health, was significantly disrupted (P<.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Existing PHC facilities in India providing outpatient services are constrained in their functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic due to weak infrastructure contributing to suboptimal patient safety and infection control measures. Furthermore, there is a need for effective planning, communication, and coordination between the centralized health policy makers and health managers working at primary health care facilities to ensure overall preparedness during public health emergencies.","Garg, Suneela; Basu, Saurav; Rustagi, Ruchir; Borle, Amod",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,253

Despite the evidence that maximizing ovarian response can improve the chances of live born babies in poor responders, there are still voices suggesting that all poor responders are the same, irrespective of their age and their actual ovarian reserve. This has resulted in the suggestion of adopting a mild ovarian stimulation approach for all poor responders, based on the results of several trials which failed to identity differences when comparing mild and more intense stimulation in predicted poor responders. The current article analyzes in detail these studies and discusses the shortcomings in terms of type of population included, outcomes and settings performed, which may actually be responsible for the belief that only mild stimulation should be used. In the era of individualization in medicine, it must be realized that there are subgroups of predicted poor responders who will benefit from an individual rather than 'one fits all' mild stimulation approach and thus we should provide the same standard of treatment for all our poor responder patients.","Polyzos, N P; Popovic-Todorovic, B",Hum. reprod,,253
247594,The mediating effect of air quality on the association between human mobility and COVID-19 infection in China,2020,"Major depression (MD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) share common brain mechanisms and treatment strategies. Nowadays, the dramatically developing COVID-19 situation unavoidably results in stress, psychological trauma, and high incidence of MD and PTSD. Hence, the importance of the development of new treatments for these disorders cannot be overstated. Herbal medicine appears to be an effective and safe treatment with fewer side effects than classic pharmaca and that is affordable in low-income countries. Currently, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation attract increasing attention as important mechanisms of MD and PTSD. We investigated the effects of a standardized herbal cocktail (SHC), an extract of clove, bell pepper, basil, pomegranate, nettle, and other plants, that was designed as an antioxidant treatment in mouse models of MD and PTSD. In the MD model of ""emotional"" ultrasound stress (US), mice were subjected to ultrasound frequencies of 16-20 kHz, mimicking rodent sounds of anxiety/despair and ""neutral"" frequencies of 25-45 kHz, for three weeks and concomitantly treated with SHC. US-exposed mice showed elevated concentrations of oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl, increased gene and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 and other molecular changes in the prefrontal cortex as well as weight loss, helplessness, anxiety-like behavior, and neophobia that were ameliorated by the SHC treatment. In the PTSD model of the modified forced swim test (modFST), in which a 2-day swim is followed by an additional swim on day 5, mice were pretreated with SHC for 16 days. Increases in the floating behavior and oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl in the prefrontal cortex of modFST-mice were prevented by the administration of SHC. Chromatography mass spectrometry revealed bioactive constituents of SHC, including D-ribofuranose, beta-D-lactose, malic, glyceric, and citric acids that can modulate oxidative stress, immunity, and gut and microbiome functions and, thus, are likely to be active antistress elements underlying the beneficial effects of SHC. Significant correlations of malondialdehyde concentration in the prefrontal cortex with altered measures of behavioral despair and anxiety-like behavior suggest that the accumulation of oxidative stress markers are a common biological feature of MD and PTSD that can be equally effectively targeted therapeutically with antioxidant therapy, such as the SHC investigated here.","de Munter, J.; Pavlov, D.; Gorlova, A.; Sicker, M.; Proshin, A.; Kalueff, A.

249491,Perspectives on UK university employment from autistic researchers and lecturers,2020,"INTRODUCTION: As the coronavirus pandemic swept across national and state borders, institutions of higher learning, including cytology, began closing campuses and moving instruction online. We have described a method of remotely teaching cytology in our institution, including using the telecytology concept used with rapid onsite evaluation and remote conferencing and educational tools to conduct eCytology learning. This is a cost-effective method to transition a traditional in-classroom program into online teaching for cytology. It can also be implemented quickly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In March 2020, our cytology program developed a method for teaching cytology remotely. The distance-learning teaching method included the use of remote conferencing (Zoom platform) and learning management platforms (Canvas) to present lectures and administer tests. Remote multihead sessions were conducted by adapting the telecytology rapid onsite evaluation concept, which attaches a mobile device to the microscope to transmit live video to remote learners. RESULTS: When asked about their experience with online learning, the students had responded positively. All the students indicated a willingness to attend classes remotely in the future, even when the traditional in-classroom learning option is available. CONCLUSIONS: We have presented a method for educating students remotely using existing technology that is affordable and can be implemented quickly by nearly all cytology education programs.","Chiou, Paul Z",J Am Soc Cytopathol,,253

This paper aims at analyzing the effect of the travel restriction measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic from a passenger perspective on the US air transportation system. Four metrics based on data generated by passengers and airlines on social media are proposed to measure how the travel restriction measures impacted the relation between passengers and airlines in close to real-time. The proposed metrics indicate that each airline has reacted differently to the COVID-19 travel restriction measures from a passenger perspective, therefore they can be used by airlines and passengers to improve their decision making process. This report comes ahead of official data related to the same sequence of events, thereby showing the value of passenger-borne data in an industry where corporate priorities, institutional prudence, and passenger satisfaction come close together.","Monmousseau, Philippe; Marzuoli, Aude; Feron, Eric; Delahaye, Daniel",Transp.

We tested whether emotional stability would moderate the effect of infection and economic worries on personal values. In line with predictions, we found that infection worries were more strongly related to Security values, especially among individuals with less emotional stability, whereas economic worries were more strongly correlated with Power values, in particular among individuals with less emotional stability. Findings for Achievement values suggested perceived behavioral control effects for individuals high in Emotional Stability. Our findings provide insights into possible longer-term psychological effects of the current pandemic. Emotional dynamics in connection with worries created by the pandemic could influence values of importance for societal functioning in the short to medium term.","Fischer, Ronald Bortolini Tiago Pilati Ronaldo Porto Juliana Moll Jorge",Personality and Individual Differences,,253

Five factors that are problematic are (a) a sustained systemic inflammatory response in the xenograft recipient, (b) thrombotic microangiopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation, (c) ischemia-reperfusion injury, (d) complement activation, and (e) vascular endothelial cell injury. In xenotransplantation, histones, which are positively charged proteins, are released into the extracellular space from damaged and activated cells, cause cell and tissue damage, and act as danger/damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that mediate inflammation, coagulation disorders, an immune response, and cytotoxicity. We have previously demonstrated that serum histones increase after pig-to-baboon organ transplantation and infection. Treatment of the recipient with tocilizumab (interleukin-6 receptor blockade) reduces the level of serum histones and C-reactive protein. In this review, the potential role of extracellular histones in xenotransplantation is discussed, and we briefly summarize the relationship between extracellular histones and the inflammatory response, coagulation dysfunction, ischemia-reperfusion injury, the complement system, and vascular endothelial cell injury.","Li, Tao; Jiang, Hongtao; Liu, Houqin; Cooper, David K C; Wang, Yi",Xenotransplantation,,253

COVID-19, similar to other emerging zoonotic diseases, has had a devastating impact on our planet. In this perspective, we argue that as humans continue to globalize and encroach on our surrounding natural systems, societies must adopt a ""planetary health lens"" to prepare and adapt to these emerging infectious diseases. This piece further explores other critical components of a planetary health approach to societal response, such as the seasonality of disease patterns, the impact of climate change on infectious disease, and the built environment, which can increase population vulnerabilities to pandemics. To address planetary health threats that cross international borders, such as COVID-19, societies must practice interdependence sovereignty and direct resources to organizations that facilitate shared global governance, and thus can enable us to adapt and ultimately build a more resilient world.","Jowell, Ashley; Barry, Michele",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,253

253885,[Effect of an intervention on social networks in the time of COVID-19],2020,"The current research examined whether men's hostile sexism was a risk factor for family-based aggression during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in which families were confined to the home for 5 weeks. Parents who had reported on their sexist attitudes and aggressive behavior toward intimate partners and children prior to the COVID-19 pandemic completed assessments of aggressive behavior toward their partners and children during the lockdown (N = 362 parents of which 310 were drawn from the same family). Accounting for pre-lockdown levels of aggression, men who more strongly endorsed hostile sexism reported greater aggressive behavior toward their intimate partners and their children during the lockdown. The contextual factors that help explain these longitudinal associations differed across targets of family-based aggression. Men's hostile sexism predicted greater aggression toward intimate partners when men experienced low power during couples' interactions, whereas men's hostile sexism predicted greater aggressive parenting when men reported lower partner-child relationship quality. Novel effects also emerged for benevolent sexism. Men's higher benevolent sexism predicted lower aggressive parenting, and women's higher benevolent sexism predicted greater aggressive behavior toward partners, irrespective of power and relationship quality. The current study provides the first longitudinal demonstration that men's hostile sexism predicts residual changes in aggression toward both intimate partners and children. Such aggressive behavior will intensify the health, well-being, and developmental costs of the pandemic, highlighting the importance of targeting power-related gender role beliefs when screening for aggression risk and delivering therapeutic and education interventions as families face the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19.

255612,"Economic Inequality, the Digital Divide, and Remote Learning During COVID-19",2021,"PURPOSE: Critical care nurses caring for patients with a tracheostomy are at high risk because of the predilection of SARS-CoV-2 for respiratory and mucosal surfaces. This review identifies patient-centered practices that ensure safety and reduce risk of infection transmission to health care workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Consensus statements, guidelines, institutional recommendations, and scientific literature on COVID-19 and previous outbreaks were reviewed. A global interdisciplinary team analyzed and prioritized findings via electronic communications and video conferences to develop consensus recommendations. RESULTS: Aerosol-generating procedures are commonly performed by nurses and other health care workers, most notably during suctioning, tracheostomy tube changes, and stoma care. Patient repositioning, readjusting circuits, administering nebulized medications, and patient transport also present risks. Standard personal protective equipment includes an N95/FFP3 mask with or without surgical masks, gloves, goggles, and gown when performing aerosol-generating procedures for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Viral testing of bronchial aspirate via tracheostomy may inform care providers when determining the protective equipment required. The need for protocols to reduce risk of transmission of infection to nurses and other health care workers is evident. CONCLUSION: Critical care nurses and multidisciplinary teams often care for patients with a tracheostomy who are known or suspected to have COVID-19. Appropriate care of these patients relies on safeguarding the health care team.

255817,Pandemic Resilience: Getting it Done,2020,"To eliminate the spread of a novel coronavirus breaking out in the end of 2019 (COVID-19), the Chinese government has implemented a nationwide lockdown policy after the Chinese lunar New Year of 2020, resulting in a sharp reduction in air pollutant emissions. To investigate the impact of the lockdown on aerosol chemistry, the number fraction, size distribution and formation process of oxalic acid (C2) containing particles and its precursors were studied using a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS) at the urban site of Liaocheng in the North China Plain (NCP). Our results showed that five air pollutants (i.e., PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO) decreased by 30.0-59.8% during the lockdown compared to those before the lockdown, while O3 increased by 63.9% during the lockdown mainly due to the inefficient titration effect of O3 via NO reduction. The increased O3 concentration can boost the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and further enhance the formation of secondary organic aerosols, thereby significantly enhancing the C2 particles and its precursors as observed during the lockdown. Before the lockdown, C2 particles were significantly originated from biomass burning emissions and their subsequent aqueous-phase oxidation. The hourly variation patterns and correlation analysis before the lockdown suggested that relative humidity (RH) and aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) played a key role in the formation of C2 particles and the increased aerosol acidity can promote the conversion of precursors such as glyoxal (Gly) and methyglyoxal (mGly) into C2 particles in the aqueous phase. RH and ALWC decreased sharply but O3 concentration and solar radiation increased remarkably during the lockdown, the O3-dominated photochemical pathways played an important role in the formation of C2 particles in which aerosol acidity was ineffective. Our study indicated that air pollution treatment sponges on a joint-control and balanced strategy for controlling numerous pollutants.","Meng, Jingjing; Li, Zheng; Zhou, Ruiwen; Chen, Min; Li, Yuanyuan; Yi, Yanan; Ding, Zhijian; Li, Hongji; Yan, Li; Hou, Zhanfang; Wang, Gehui",Sci Total Environ,,253

256221,From Prediction to Prescription: AI-Based Optimization of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions for the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-05-28,"The discovery of cheap and eco-friendly functional materials for the removal of anionic heavy metal ions is still challenging in the treatment of heavy metal-contaminated water. Herein, a new poly(allyltrimethylammonium) grafted chitosan and biochar composite (PATMAC-CTS-BC) was introduced for the removal of selenate (SeO42-) in water. Results suggest that the PATMAC-CTS-BC showed a rapid removal of SeO42- with efficiency of >97% within 10 min and it followed a pseudo-second-order model. High capacity of SeO42- adsorption by the composite was achieved, with maximum value of 98.99 mg g-1 based on Langmuir model, considerably higher than most of reported adsorbents. The thermodynamic results reflected the spontaneous and exothermic nature of SeO42- adsorption onto the composite. The composite could be applied at a wide initial pH range (2-10) with high removal efficiency of SeO42- because of permanent positive charges of quaternary ammonium groups (=N+-). The removal mechanisms of SeO42- were mainly attributed to electrostatic interactions with =N+- and protonated -NH3+ groups, and redox-complexation interactions with -NH2, -NH-, and -OH groups. Besides SeO42-, the hexavalent chromium (Cr2O72-) was considered as example to further demonstrate the anion removal capability of cationic hydrogel-BC composite. The study outcomes open up new opportunities to efficiently remove anionic heavy metal ions (e.g., SeO42- and Cr2O72-) in water using these materials.","Zhang, Lixun; Jiang, Sunny C; Guan, Yuntao",Environ Res,,253
256320,Natural Disasters As A Source Of Entrepreneurial Opportunity: Family Business Resilience After An Earthquake,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously affects humans' health worldwide physically and mentally. Studies revealed that the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increased under this condition. PTSD can change the structure of patients' central nervous system, and increase the risk of anxiety or depression, thus greatly affecting the quality of patients' life and their families. PTSD is preventable, and the effects of early prevention are better. Non-drug intervention can prevent or reduce the psychological sequelae after hospitalization, help patients understand the experience during hospitalization, and be beneficial to their psychological rehabilitation. Whether smartphone app based intervention can be an alternative therapy for PTSD in terms of COVID-19 convalescent patients is still controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the effects of smartphone app based intervention on PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients, so as to provide some guidance for clinical application. METHODS: The literatures that are related to the smartphone app based intervention and PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients from inception to February 2021 will be searched. The following databases are our focused areas: ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials repositories, PubMed, EmBase, and Web of Science databases. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2 investigators would independently screen the literature extract data and evaluate the risk of bias in the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan5.3 software. RESULTS: The results of this meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of our study could provide evidence for the judgment of whether smartphone app based intervention is an effective intervention on PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients.

A plastic object that was fixed to a urease-immobilized filter paper was used as a self-propelled object, termed a urease motor, placed on a urea aqueous solution. The driving force of the urease motor is the difference in the surface tension around the object. Oscillatory motion or no motion was triggered depending on the initial pH of the urea solution. Both the frequency and maximum speed of the oscillatory motion varied depending on the initial pH of the water phase. The mechanisms underlying the oscillatory motion and no motion were discussed in relation to the bell-shaped enzyme activity of urease in the enzyme reaction and the surface tension around the urease motor.","Nakata, Satoshi; Xu, Yu; Ji, Lin; Izumi, Shunsuke",Chem. - Asian j.

At this stage, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease. Though it is difficult to trace back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable, estimating the average spreading rate is possible if a proper mathematical model can be devised to analyze daily event-occurrences. To render an accurate assessment, we have devised a state-space method for fitting a discrete-time variant of the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. The proposed method detects changes occurring in each country and assesses the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number, which corresponds to the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case. Moreover, the proposed method can be used to predict the possible consequences of alternative political measures. This information can serve as a reference for behavioral guidelines that should be adopted according to the varying risk of infection.","Koyama, Shinsuke; Horie, Taiki; Shinomoto, Shigeru",PLoS Comput Biol,,253

As the pandemic has progressed, many have justifiably speculated that such restrictions may pose a danger to the safety and well-being of people experiencing such violence. Early in the pandemic, countries hard hit by COVID-19 began raising the alarm bell about the impacts of the disease on IPV occurrence. Police in China report that 90% of the causes of recent IPV cases could be attributed to the COVID-19 epidemic. Rising fears and anxiety about prolonged movement restrictions, increased economic strain and diminished health care capacity to support survivors are among the potential reasons for such dramatic effects. Under normal circumstances: low income, unemployment, economic stress, depression, emotional insecurity and social isolation are all risk factors for using violence against partners. Many of these factors may worsen in the context of COVID-19. Despite the urgency in addressing COVID-19, existing health concerns like Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) persist-and may well be worsened by the virus. We simply do not yet know the effects of COVID-19 on violence, nor do we know which interventions work best to prevent and respond to it within the context of the pandemic. The vast majority of information available about IPV and violence during the pandemic has been based on anecdotal reports. The call to action for the research community is clear. We must systematically measure the effects of COVID-19 and movement related restrictions on violence. As always when researching violence, serious consideration must be given to ethics and safety. Violence researchers must mobilize to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on violence and human health.","Evans, Dabney P",BMC Womens Health,,253

This behavior has been exploited in the production of gel particles that range between approximately 100 and 4000 µm in diameter. Here, we investigate their performance as materials for the encapsulation and release of the aromatic oil cymene. The gel particles ( 1500 µm in diameter) are prepared by dropwise addition of an oil-in-water suspension made of cymene droplets dispersed in a viscous solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and ,,-trimethylammonium derivatized hydroxyethyl cellulose (JR-400) to a gelling solution of excess SDS. The release of cymene into aqueous (5 wt.% SDS and 4 wt.% pentanol in water) and organic (isooctane) solutions is measured using UV-VIS spectroscopy and analyzed with the shrinking core model. The experimental data and model analysis indicate that the release rate is determined by the effective diffusivity and solubility of the oil in the aqueous gel matrix, both of which depend on the presence of surfactant in the receiving solution, and the swelling of the gel particle.","Lapitsky, Yakov; Kaler, Eric W",Soft Matter,,253

This has led to increased stress and anxiety among employees, which explicably affects their satisfaction with life. Thus, the present study analyses the effect of COVID-19 induced stressors (role overload, lifestyle choices, family distraction, and occupational discomfort) on employees' distress levels and job performance. Subsequently, the impact of such distress and job performance on the employees' life satisfaction is analyzed during the lockdown period. Methodology: Data was collected from 433 working professionals of private and public organizations in the Delhi and NCR region of India during India's third and fourth phase of lockdown via a survey, which was distributed online. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was applied first to establish the validity of this study's model (measurement model validity) and subsequently test the hypothesized relationships in the model (structural model). Results: The COVID-19 induced stressors, i.e., role overload, lifestyle choices, and occupational discomfort, were significant predictors of distress during the lockdown. It has been found that role overload and change in lifestyle choice did not significantly affect job performance. Family distraction, occupational discomfort, and distress were significant in impacting job performance, with distress being the most significant one. During the COVID-19 pandemic, life satisfaction has reduced due to a significant increase in distress levels and lowered job performances.

Evidence from the United Kingdom at the Height of the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have introduced steps such as spatial distancing and ""staying at home"" to curb its spread and impact. The fear resulting from the disease, the 'lockdown' situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns.

262654,Impacts of COVID-19 and fiscal stimuli on global emissions and the Paris Agreement,2020,"The second wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia is largely attributed to a four-day mass gathering held in Sri Petaling from February 27, 2020, which contributed to an exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in the country. Starting from March 18, 2020, the Malaysian government introduced four consecutive phases of a Movement Control Order (MCO) to stem the spread of COVID-19. The MCO was implemented through various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The reported number of cases reached its peak by the first week of April and then started to reduce, hence proving the effectiveness of the MCO. To gain a quantitative understanding of the effect of MCO on the dynamics of COVID-19, this paper develops a class of mathematical models to capture the disease spread before and after MCO implementation in Malaysia. A heterogeneous variant of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model is developed with additional compartments for asymptomatic transmission. Further, a change-point is incorporated to model disease dynamics before and after intervention which is inferred based on data. Related statistical analyses for inference are developed in a Bayesian framework and are able to provide quantitative assessments of (1) the impact of the Sri Petaling gathering, and (2) the extent of decreasing transmission during the MCO period. The analysis here also quantitatively demonstrates how quickly transmission rates fall under effective NPI implementation within a short time period. The models and methodology used provided important insights into the nature of local transmissions to decision makers in the Ministry of Health, Malaysia.","Dass, Sarat C; Kwok, Wai M; Gibson, Gavin J; Gill, Balvinder S; Sundram, Bala M; Singh, Sarbhan",PLoS One,,253

Design/Methodology/Approach: The research employed the diagnostic poll method. The study was conducted between March and September 2020 among 636 students of medical universities in Poland. The comparative analysis of qualitative variables employed Pearson's χ2 test and contingency tables. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney U test were applied in the analysis of rank order scale responses. Findings: Findings of the research confirm the existence of an educational gap concerning education for sustainable development (ESD) at medical universities in Poland. The study confirmed that the students possess elementary knowledge of sustainable development. It ought to be noted that they associate SD primarily with environmental and economic aspects. The analysis of results also revealed that the students are aware of the impact an individual may exert upon sustainable development. The study indicated that men proved to be familiar with elementary SD terminology significantly more frequently than women. Practical Implications: The results of the study offer a basis for changes in educational curricula and in projects executed at medical universities concerning SD-associated matters. Originality/Value: Results concerning education, fundamental SD knowledge and familiarity with SD-related issues exhibited by medical university students in Poland.

263646,Nontargets: Understanding the Apathy Towards the Israeli Security Agency's COVID- 19 Surveillance,2021,"While economic inequalities have been a key focus of attention through the COVID 19 pandemic, gendered relations of power at every level have undermined health rights of women, girls and gender diverse individuals. Sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) have always been sites of power contestations within families, societies, cultures, and politics; these struggles are exacerbated by economic, racial, religious, caste, citizenship status, and other social inequities, especially in times of crisis such as these. Policy responses to the COVID pandemic such as lockdown, quarantine, contact tracing and similar measures are premised on the existence of a social contract between the government and the people and among people, with the health sector playing a key role in preventive and curative care.We propose the use of an intersectional lens to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social contract, drawing on our field experiences from different continents particularly as related to SRHR. Along with documenting the ways in which the pandemic hinders access to services, we note that it is essential to interrogate state-society relations in the context of vulnerable and marginalized groups, in order to understand implications for SRHR. Intersectional analysis takes on greater importance now than in non-pandemic times as the state exercises more police or other powers and deploys myriad ways of 'othering'.We conclude that an intersectional analysis should not limit itself to the cumulative disadvantages and injustices posed by the pandemic for specific social groups, but also examine the historical inequalities, structural drivers, and damaged social contract that underlie state-society relationships. At the same time, the pandemic has questioned the status quo and in doing so it has provided opportunities for disruption; for re-imagining a social contract that reaches across sectors, and builds community resilience and solidarities while upholding human rights and gender justice. This must find place in future organizing and advocacy around SRHR.","Dasgupta, Jashodhara; Schaaf, Marta; Contractor, Sana Qais; Banda, Amanda; Viana, Marisa; Kashyntseva, Oksana; Ruano, Ana Lorena",Int J Equity Health,,253

In the past decades, disease outbreaks due to such zoonotic pathogens have appeared with an accelerated rate, which calls for an urgent development of adaptive (smart) therapeutics. Here, a computational strategy is developed to adaptively evolve peptides that could selectively inhibit mutating S protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) of different SARS-CoV-2 viral strains from binding to their human host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Starting from suitable peptide templates, based on selected ACE2 segments (natural RBD binder), the templates are gradually modified by random mutations, while retaining those mutations that maximize their RBD-binding free energies. In this adaptive evolution, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the template-RBD complexes are iteratively perturbed by the peptide mutations, which are retained under favorable Monte Carlo decisions.

The time-resolved photoelectron spectra and photoelectron angular distributions at all pump wavelengths are carefully analysed and the following picture is derived: at the longest pump wavelengths (254.8, 248.3 and 246.1 nm), 2-ethylpyrrole is excited to the S1(1&#960;&#963;*) state having a lifetime of about 50 fs. At 248.3, 246.1 and 237.4 nm, another excited state of Rydberg character is excited. The lifetime of this state is â¼570 fs at 237.4 nm and becomes slightly longer at other two pump wavelengths. At the shortest pump wavelengths (230.8 and 218.0 nm), 2-ethylpyrrole is excited to a state which is tentatively assigned to the 11&#960;&#960;* state, having a lifetime of 75 ± 15 and 48 ± 10 fs for the longer and shorter pump wavelengths, respectively. Internal conversion to the S1(1&#960;&#963;*) state might be one of the decay mechanisms of the 11&#960;&#960;* state.","Yuan, Wenpeng; Yang, Dongyuan; Feng, Baihui; Min, Yanjun; Chen, Zhichao; Yu, Shengrui; Wu, Guorong; Yang, Xueming",PCCP.

264565,Consumer emotions and collaborative consumption: The effect of COVID-19 on the adoption of use-oriented product-service systems,2021,"Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. As the virus spread worldwide causing a global pandemic, China reduced transmission at considerable social and economic cost. Post-lockdown, resuming work safely, that is, while avoiding a second epidemic outbreak, is a major challenge. Exacerbating this challenge, Beijing hosts many residents and workers with origins elsewhere, making it a relatively high-risk region in which to resume work. Nevertheless, the step-by-step approach taken by Beijing appears to have been effective so far. To learn from the epidemic progression and return-to-work measures undertaken in Beijing, and to inform efforts to avoid a second outbreak of COVID-19, we simulated the epidemiological progression of COVID-19 in Beijing under the real scenario of multiple stages of resuming work. A new epidemic transmission model was developed from a modified SEIR model for SARS, tailored to the situation of Beijing and fitted using multi-source data. Because of strong spatial heterogeneity amongst the population, socio-economic factors and medical capacity of Beijing, the risk assessment was undertaken spatiotemporally with respect to each district of Beijing. The epidemic simulation confirmed that the policy of resuming work step-by step, as implemented in Beijing, was sufficient to avoid a recurrence of the epidemic. Moreover, because of the structure of the model, the simulation provided insights into the specific factors at play at different stages of resuming work, allowing district-specific recommendations to be made with respect to monitoring at different stages of resuming work . As such, this research provides important lessons for other cities and regions dealing with outbreaks of COVID-19 and implementing return-to-work policies.","Zhang, Wen-Bin; Ge, Yong; Liu, Mengxiao; Atkinson, Peter M; Wang, Jinfeng; Zhang, Xining; Tian, Zhaoxing",Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess,,253

This problem emerged in Lombardy, the Italian region where the pandemic exacted the heaviest toll. Study aims were to assess mental health of HW in Lombardy after the peak of COVID-19 related hospitalizations, through the joint evaluation of PTSD and positive mental health; and to explore the potential role of positive mental health in PTSD development. METHODS: HW completed an online survey including demographic and work-related information; PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; Mental Health Continuum Short-Form. Analyses comprised calculation of percentages of participants meeting a provisional PTSD and mental health diagnosis (flourishing, moderate, languishing); a binary logistic regression with demographics, work-related features, and positive mental health as predictors, and provisional PTSD diagnosis as outcome. RESULTS: Out of 653 participants, 39.8% received a provisional PTSD diagnosis; 33.4% reported flourishing, 57.7% moderate, and 8.9% languishing mental health. Regression analysis highlighted that women vs. men, nurses vs. technical/rehabilitation HW, frontline vs. second-line workers and languishing vs. moderately mentally healthy HW were more likely to receive a provisional PTSD diagnosis, whereas flourishing participants were more likely not to receive it. No role emerged for job seniority. LIMITATIONS: Self-reported PTSD scores, stress symptoms related to COVID-19 considered as a global stressor, cross-sectional study design. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest the potential usefulness of supporting vulnerable HW categories during massive disease outbreaks through emergency-focused professional training and psychological intervention addressing both positive mental health promotion and PTSD prevention.","Bassi, Marta; Negri, Luca; Delle Fave, Antonella; Accardi, Roberto",J Affect Disord,,253

This study presents a retrospective observational cohort study of 62 test-positive cases of coronavirus disease 2019 that presented at an affiliated tertiary university medical city from March 2020 to May 2020. A total of 14 patients (22.5%) presented with obvious typical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 associated viremia and were identified after they developed symptoms during admission or after the implementation of universal testing for all obstetric admissions. A total of 62 mothers were screened positive for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Length of stay was higher in the symptomatic group. The median length of stay was 4 days for the asymptomatic cases while it was 6 days for the symptomatic cases. Amniotic fluid was meconium stained in (12.5%) of the asymptomatic group and in 30.8% in the symptomatic group.

267200,Crisis-Induced Behavior: From Fear and Frugality to the Familiar,2021,"Summary: Postoperative fever is common following orthopedic trauma surgery. As the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increases in the community, migration into the acute care hospital setting intensifies, creating confusion when fever develops postoperatively. The transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 make it difficult to adequately gauge and pinpoint risk groups with questionnaires at the time of hospital admission. This is particularly problematic when asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 require urgent surgery and cannot be screened effectively. One approach is to treat every patient as though they were SARS-CoV-2-positive in preparation for surgery, but doing so could exacerbate shortages of personal protective equipment and staffing limitations. Uncertainty regarding the etiology of postoperative fever could be significantly reduced by universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of all surgical patients at the time of hospital admission in addition to routine screening, but testing capacity and a rapid turnaround time would be required.","Bourget-Murray, Jonathan; Heard, Bryan J; Bansal, Rohit; Johnson, Andrew S; Powell, James",Can J Surg,,253

It soon became apparent that the incidence of pediatric COVID-19 was much lower than the adult form. Morbidity in children is characterized by a variable clinical presentation and course. Symptoms are similar to those of other acute respiratory viral infections, the upper airways being more affected than the lower airways. Thus far, over 90% of children who tested positive for the virus presented mild or moderate symptoms and signs. Most children were asymptomatic, and only a few cases were severe, unlike in the adult population. Deaths have been rare and occurred mainly in children with underlying morbidity. Factors as reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor expression, increased activation of the interferon-related innate immune response, and trained immunity have been implicated in the relative resistance to COVID-19 in children, however the underlying pathogenesis and mechanism of action remain to be established. While at the pandemic outbreak, mild respiratory manifestations were the most frequently described symptoms in children, subsequent reports suggested that the clinical course of COVID-19 is more complex than initially thought. Thanks to the experience acquired in adults, the diagnosis of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection has improved with time. Data on the treatment of children are sparse, however, several antiviral trials are ongoing. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize current understanding of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide more accurate information for healthcare workers and improve the care of patients.","Borrelli, M.; Corcione, A.; Castellano, F.; Fiori Nastro, F.; Santamaria, F.",Frontiers in Pediatrics,,253

271534,Investment motives and preferences – An empirical inquiry during COVID-19,2021,"Most respirators employed in health care settings, and often in first responder and industrial settings, are intended for single-use: the user dons the respirator, performs a work activity, and then doffs and discards the respirator. However, in the current COVID-19 pandemic, in the presence of persistent shortages of personal protective equipment, extended use and reuse of filtering facepiece respirators are routinely contemplated by many health care organizations. Further, there is considerable current effort to understand the effect of sterilization on the possibility of reuse, and some investigations of performance have been conducted. While the ability of such a respirator to continue to provide effective protection after repeated sanitization cycles is a critical component of implementing its reuse, of equal importance is an understanding of the impact that reusing the respirator multiple times in a day while performing work tasks, and even extending its wear over multiple days, has on the workplace protective performance. In this study, we subjected a stockpiled quantitatively fitted surgical style N95 filtering facepiece respirator device to extreme reuse and extended wear conditions (up to 19 uses over a duration of 5 days) and measured its protective performance at regular intervals, including simulated workplace protection factor measurements using total inward leakage. With this respirator, it was shown to be possible to maintain protection corresponding to an assigned protection factor greater than 10 under extreme usage conditions provided an individual is properly trained in the use of, and expertly fitted in, the respirator. Other factors such as hygiene and strap breakage are likely to place limits on reuse.","Duncan, Scott; Bodurtha, Paul; Bourgeois, Cara; Dickson, Eva; Jensen, Cheryl; Naqvi, Syed",J Occup Environ Hyg,,253

Stem cell-based islet organoids faithfully recapitulate islet development in vitro and provide large amounts of three-dimensional functional islet biomimetic materials with a morphological structure and cellular composition similar to those of native islets. Thus, islet organoids hold great promise for modeling islet development and function, deciphering the mechanisms underlying the onset of diabetes, providing an in vitro human organ model for infection of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, and contributing to drug screening and autologous islet transplantation. However, the currently established islet organoids are generally immature compared with native islets, and further efforts should be made to improve the heterogeneity and functionality of islet organoids, making it an authentic and informative disease model for diabetes.

272695,The Impact of Covid-19 on the Quality of Human Capital for the Economic Development of Azerbaijan,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has struck many countries globally. Jordan has implemented strict nationwide control measures to halt the viral spread, one of which was the closure of universities and shifting to remote teaching. The impact of this pandemic could extend beyond the risk of physical harm to substantial psychological consequences. Our study aimed at assessing 1) psychological status, 2) challenges of distance teaching, and 3) coping activities and pandemic-related concerns among university teachers in Jordan in the midst of COVID-19-related quarantine and control measures. We conducted a cross-sectional study using an anonymous online survey. The measure of psychological distress was obtained using a validated Arabic version of the Kessler Distress Scale (K10). Other information collected included sociodemographic profile, methods used to handle distress, motivation to participate in distance teaching, and challenges of distance teaching as well as the most worrisome issues during this pandemic. Three hundred eighty-two university teachers returned completed surveys. Results of K10 showed that 31.4% of respondents had severe distress and 38.2% had mild to moderate distress. Whereas gender was not associated with distress severity, age had a weak negative correlation (Rho = -0.19, P < 0.0001). Interestingly, most teachers had moderate to high motivation for distance teaching. Engagement with family was the most reported self-coping activity. More than half of the participants were most concerned and fearful about SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, university teachers have shown to exhibit various levels of psychological distress and challenges during the implementation of precautionary national measures in the battle against COVID-19 in Jordan.","Akour, Amal; Al-Tammemi, Ala039; a, B; Barakat, Muna; Kanj, Rama; Fakhouri, Hussam N; Malkawi, Ahmad; Musleh, Ghadeer",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,253

272884,Global pandemic and the rise of teledentistry,2020,"In recent years, GIS and virtual auditing have been widely used to measure the built environment, and each method carries its strengths and weaknesses. To generate higher quality, more cost-effective, and less time-consuming measures, it is necessary to explore dual- or multi-method strategy toward sampling optimization, improvement of measurement, and enhancement of efficiency. To justify the proposed dual-method approach, the study has three major objectives. First, it examines the uncertainties associated with different sample sizes by using GIS to generate scenarios that contrast the validity of measurements to aid sampling optimization in auditing. Second, it compares the validity of GIS measures with those generated through Google Street View Auditing (GSVA) by human raters. Third, it further examines the efficiency of the proposed dual-method approach in comparison to the two individual methods. Such investigation generates several novel findings. First, the study presents important evidence to support that GIS measures can offer sampling guidance applicable to the GSVA method. It leads to a recommendation of sampling sizes (5%-20%) for cases in settings with a mixture of affluent and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Results further indicate that different communities and certain individual features and characteristics may demand different sampling practices. Second, the study found that while GSVA is trustworthy for most characteristic variables, especially those that required subjective input, GIS provides well-validated measures for certain objective environmental attributes. Furthermore, the study reports that a dual-method approach of GIS and GSVA had a lower financial and time burden than using GSVA alone and is thus recommended as a comprehensive solution for optimal measurement of an objective built environment in mixed urban neighborhoods.","Li, Weimin; Winter, Patricia L; Milburn, Lee-Anne; Padgett, Pamela E",Health Place,,253

In this study, using data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, we analyze the spatial patterns of infection and mortality from Covid-19 across small areas of Brazil. We apply spatial autoregressive Bayesian models and estimate the risks of infection and mortality, taking into account age, sex composition of the population and other variables that describe the health situation of the spatial units. We also perform a decomposition analysis to study how age composition impacts the differences in mortality and infection rates across regions. Our results indicate that death and infections are spatially distributed, forming clusters and hotspots, especially in the Northern Amazon, Northeast coast and Southeast of the country. The high mortality risk in the Southeast part of the country, where the major cities are located, can be explained by the high proportion of the elderly in the population. In the less developed areas of the North and Northeast, there are high rates of infection among young adults, people of lower socioeconomic status, and people without access to health care, resulting in more deaths.","Lima, Everton Emanuel Campos de; Gayawan, Ezra; Baptista, Emerson Augusto; Queiroz, Bernardo Lanza",PLoS One,,253

Methods: The clinical data and treatment strategies of COVID-19 patients were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Results: Major clinical manifestations of the patients with COVID-19 were fever (75. 5%) and cough (41. 5%). Of the 53 COVID-19 patients, 42 were of common type, 6 were of severe type and 5 were of critical type. Most of the critical type patients were the elderly with basic diseases. Serum lymphocyte count decreased when they were admitted into hospital. During hospitalization,C-reactive protein significantly increased in critical type patients. Liver injury was observed in severe type and critical type patients. With regard to treatment, 30 patients in the common type were treated with traditional Chinese medicine alone, 8 patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine combined with lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r), 2 patients were given traditional Chinese medicine combined with other drugs, and still another 2 patients were given interferon alone. One severe type patient was treated with LPV/r combined with glucocorticoids, traditional Chinese medicine was given to other 5 severe type patients, including 2 patients with methylprednisolone sodium succinate combined treatment and one patient with interferon combined treatment. The treatment of the critically ill patients was relatively complex, including antiviral, diuretic, cardiotonic treatment, as well as nutritional support. Conclusion;Traditional Chinese medicine was beneficial to the recovery of COVID-19 patients. However, definite benefits of combined treatment with LPV/r or glucocorticoids were not clearly observed. © 2020 Publishing House of Pharmaceutical Care and Research.

275768,Insights Gained into Marginalized Students Access Challenges During the COVID-19 Academic Response,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To explore changes in quality of life and perceived productivity, focusing on the effects of working from home during the first COVID-19 50-day mitigation period in Austria. METHODS: We conducted an Austrian-representative online survey (N = 1010) of self-reported life- and work-related changes during the first COVID-19 50-day mitigation period (March 16 through May 1 2020) compared to the situation before. We used multinominal logistic regression models to identify correlates of improved/decreased quality of life in the entire sample, and of improved/decreased productivity in a subsample of the working population (N = 686). We also calculated age- and multivariable-adjusted ORs and 95% CIs of an improved/decreased quality of life and an improved/decreased productivity by work from home status. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 mitigation period, quality of life improved in 17.5%, but decreased in 20.7% of the general Austrian population; perceived productivity at work increased in 12.7%, but decreased in 30.2% of the working population. Working from home during the mitigation period was associated with an increased quality of life (vs. none, partially: OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.09-3.91; all the time: 3.69, 1.86-7.29). In contrast, perceived productivity seemed to decrease when people worked from home (vs. none, partially: 1.42, 0.86-2.35; all the time: 1.48, 0.85-2.58). Working from home and related benefits were not equally distributed among gender, age, and educational attainment. CONCLUSIONS: A transition to more flexibility of workplace and working hours for employees could have important positive consequences for family and professional life, for stakeholders, for public health, and ultimately for the environment.","Weitzer, Jakob; Papantoniou, Kyriaki; Seidel, Stefan; Klösch, Gerhard; Caniglia, Guido; Laubichler, Manfred; Bertau, Martin; Birmann, Brenda M; Jäger, Carlo C; Zenk, Lukas; Steiner, Gerald; Schernhammer, Eva",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,,253

In previous publications including ours, the role of kininogen system has been postulated. A correlation between clinical findings of the disease and this mechanism has been drawn to denote a pivotal role of kininogen-kallikrein system in pathophysiology of the disease. Therein the possible role of Icatibant, Ecallantide and Aprotinin in the treatment of this disease has been raised. Here we want to emphasize on an important post-receptor mechanism of bradykinin that is Nitric Oxide. We came to this aim because we found out how access to these novel treatment nominees may be expensive and unaffordable. For this reason we are focusing on possible role of an old albeit “mysterious” drug namely Methylene Blue. This medication may abort effects of Bradykinin by inhibition of Nitric Oxide synthase inhibitor and promote oxygen saturation while it is inexpensive and ubiquitously accessible.

In this context, knowledge of growth and physiology in seedlings of different provenances can be useful in the selection of appropriate seed sources for restoration. In this study we investigated variations in survival, growth, and leaf-level physiology of five provenances of Quillaja saponaria Mol. and five provenances of Cryptocarya alba Mol. originated from coastal and Pre Andean sites exhibiting latitudinal-related climate differences in central Chile. Seedlings were grown in a nursery on 600 mL pots for 18 months and then planted in a dryland site severely damaged by fire. One year after establishment, we measured survival, growth, and leaf-level physiology. We also analyzed the relationship between outplanting survival with seedling characteristics prior to planting, and the relationship between growth and survival with physiological traits and with climate variables. Growth and survival were similar among provenances of Q. saponaria and C. alba, with the exception of differing heights observed within the provenance of Q. saponaria. Initial root collar diameter of Q. saponaria was observed to be positively correlated to outplanting survival. With the exception of photosynthesis in Q. saponaria, all provenances of both species differed in the leaf-level physiological traits. Those provenances originating from interior dryland sites exhibited lower stomatal conductance and used water more efficiently. The opposite was true for provenances coming from coastal sites. In outplanting sites with Mediterranean-type climates that have been damage by severe fire, selections based on larger diameter seedlings, especially for Q. saponaria and from interior and pre-Andean provenances, will likely improve outplanting success.","Espinoza, Sergio E; Yañez, Marco A; Martínez, Eduardo E; Carrasco-Benavides, Marcos R; Vaswani, Suraj A; Gajardo, John; Magni, Carlos R",Sci Rep,,253

277556,From the Field: Education Research During a Pandemic,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that is the cause of a serious life-threatening disease known as COVID-19. It was first noted to have occurred in Wuhan, China in November 2019 and the WHO reported the first case on December 31, 2019. The outbreak was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 and by May 30, 2020, a total of 5 899 866 positive cases were registered including 364 891 deaths. SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the lung and enters the body through ACE2 receptors. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue, yet some atypical symptoms like loss of smell and taste have also been described. 20% require hospital admission due to severe disease, a third of whom need intensive support. Treatment is primarily supportive, however, prognosis is dismal in those who need invasive ventilation. Trials are ongoing to discover effective vaccines and drugs to combat the disease. Preventive strategies aim at reducing the transmission of disease by contact tracing, washing of hands, use of face masks and government-led lockdown of unnecessary activities to reduce the risk of transmission.","Adil, Md Tanveer; Rahman, Rumana; Whitelaw, Douglas; Jain, Vigyan; Al-Taan, Omer; Rashid, Farhan; Munasinghe, Aruna; Jambulingam, Periyathambi",Postgrad. med. j,,253

In this context, a deep reorganization of allergy clinics, in order to ensure proper diagnosis and care despite of social distancing measures expose, is needed. Main text: The reorganization of allergy clinics should include programmed checks for severe and poorly controlled patients, application of digital medicine service for mild-to-moderate disease in well-controlled ones, postponement of non urgent diagnostic work-ups and domiciliation of therapies, whenever possible. As far as therapies, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) should not be stopped and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) fits perfectly for this purpose, since a drug home-delivery service can be activated for the entire pandemic duration. Moreover, biologic agents for severe asthma, chronic spontaneous urticaria and atopic dermatitis should be particularly encouraged to achieve best control possible of severe disease in times of COVID-19 and, whenever possible, home-delivery and self-administration should be the preferred choice. Conclusion: During COVID-19 pandemic, allergists have the responsibility of balancing individual patients' needs with public health issues, and innovative tools, such as telemedicine and digital medicine services, can be helpful to reduce the risk of viral spreading while delivering up-to-date personalized care.","Malipiero, Giacomo; Heffler, Enrico; Pelaia, Corrado; Puggioni, Francesca; Racca, Francesca; Ferri, Sebastian; Spinello, Lina; Merigo, Morena; Lamacchia, Donatella; Cataldo, Giuseppe; Sansonna, Melissa; Canonica, Giorgio Walter; Paoletti, Giovanni",Clin.

278624,Sustainability at stake during COVID-19: Exploring the role of accounting in addressing environmental crises,2021,"Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19) is a pandemic with many countries employing massive public health responses. Little is known about the severity of illness in the pediatric population. This study sought to identify demographic information and severity of disease in pediatric patients with COVID-19. This was a retrospective study conducted on patients less than 18 years who were suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 and were reported to the Chinese Centers for Disease Control (China CDC). Children were considered high risk and suspected if they had positive exposure to an endemic area or a confirmed case of COVID-19. High suspicion also included those with fever, respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, or fatigue, normal or low white blood cell count and increased C-reactive protein, or abnormal chest radiography, or those at lower risk for whom influenza or other respiratory illnesses were ruled out. Confirmed cases were defined as having a nasopharyngeal swab or blood sample positive via PCR or a genetic sampling of respiratory secretions or blood consistent with SARS-CoV-2. Once identified, patients were categorized by severity of disease using clinical features as well as laboratory and radiographic findings. Severity categories included asymptomatic (no symptoms but positive test), mild (mild respiratory symptoms and normal lung exam), moderate (pneumonia, fever, and cough but without hypoxemia or respiratory distress), severe (above symptoms as well as oxygen saturation less than 92% and respiratory distress), or critical disease (acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, or other life-threatening organ dysfunction). There were 2143 patients included who were suspected (65.9%) or confirmed (34.1%) to have COVID-19. Median age was 7 years (IQR 2-13) and the majority (56.6%) were male. The median time from onset of symptoms to presentation was 2 days (range 0-42). Nearly all were categorized as asymptomatic (4.4%), mild (50.9%), or moderate (38.8%) severity, leaving only 5.9% as severe or critical. Looking at breakdown by age, infants made up the highest proportion of severe or critical disease (32%) with preschool ages (1-5 years) next with 28.8%. Half (7) of the 13 critical patients were under 1 year old. No significant differences were seen between male or female patients. There was one death in the sample: a 14-year old boy. Limitations included lack of clinical characteristics, as only data from the Chinese CDC was used rather than electronic medical records from individual patients. Additionally the majority of cases were suspected, not confirmed, and some of the children remained hospitalized at the end of the study therefore severity of disease may not be accurate. The authors concluded that COVID-19 caused infection in all ages without obvious gender differences, however younger children appeared to have higher severity of disease. Comment: This is the largest cohort of pediatric COVID-19 patients to date. This study is based on the China CDC dataset and is limited to the variables that are reported to the CDC. We cannot assume children in the United States will be affected similarly. Overall, this dataset suggests that critical disease is rare in children with COVID-19. Emergency physicians should use caution with infants and young children, however, as they appear to be at highest risk of severe disease and may need closer observation in the emergency department or inpatient admission.","Eastin, Carly; Eastin, Travis",J.

METHODS: A single-center observational study was performed in patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx by total (pharyngo)-laryngectomy between 2010 and 2015. Study data comprised: maximum phonation time (sec), number of and reasons for prosthesis exchanges (leakage through or around the prosthesis, expulsion or inclusion of the prosthesis), plus 2 quality of life questionnaires (QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&N35) and the Voice Handicap Inventory (VHI 30). RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included. The most common causes of prosthesis exchange were leakage through (73.2%) or around the prosthesis (18.5%). The median time between exchanges was 4 months. Global quality of life status on the QLQ-C30 was 63.5. Mean maximum phonation time was 7.4sec. Mean VHI was 46/120; 10 patients had a mild voice handicap, 12 moderate and 10 severe. No relation emerged between the number of prosthesis exchanges per year and quality of life. Voice handicap significantly decreased quality of life, with QLQ-C30 72.3 for the 22 patients with mild to moderate voice handicap and 44.2 for the 10 patients with severe voice handicap (P=0.001).

279659,Monetary Policy Cooperation/Coordination and Global Financial Crises in Historical Perspective,2021,"Introduction La pandémie liée au SARS-CoV-2 est source d’une importante morbidité et mortalité avec 5 % des patients infectés nécessitant une hospitalisation en réanimation. L’oxygénothérapie haut débit par canule nasale par Optiflow® (OF) permet de diminuer le recours à la ventilation mécanique (VM). Malgré l’OF, beaucoup de patients nécessitent encore un recours à la VM. Nous avons réalisé une étude monocentrique rétrospective afin de déterminer les facteurs de risque de recours à la VM chez les patients traités par OF et leur devenir. Matériels et méthodes Nous avons analysé tous les dossiers de patients hospitalisés en réanimation pour une infection à SARS-CoV-2, du 1er septembre 2020 au 1er mars 2021, et ayant bénéficié d’OF. Nous avons comparé les données démographiques et cliniques à l’admission, la mortalité à six semaines et les durées d’OF et d’hospitalisation entre le groupe de patients traités par OF seul et le groupe de patients traités par OF ayant eu recours secondairement ayant eu recours à une VM. Résultats Nous avons inclus 72 patients traités par OF dont 36 (50 %) ont nécessité secondairement le recours à la VM. L’âge moyen dans le groupe VM était de 65,3 ans contre 64,1 ans dans le groupe OF seul (p=0,600). Parmi les défaillances d’organes à l’admission, 11 patients (28,3 %) présentaient une insuffisance rénale aiguë dans le groupe VM contre sept (19,4 %) dans le groupe OF seul (p= 0,283), trois (8,3 %) présentaient une décompensation cardiaque dans le groupe VM contre cinq (13,8 %) dans le groupe OF seul (p=0,460), un patient présentait une insuffisance hépatique aiguë dans chaque groupe et aucune défaillance neurologique n’était recensée. Il y avait plus d’insuffisance circulatoire aiguë dans le groupe VM (10 patients, 27,8 %) que dans le groupe OF seul (n=0) (p&lt;0,001). Le rapport PaO2/FiO2 moyen était plus faible (p=0,029) dans le groupe VM (85,3) que dans le groupe OF seul (110,2). Le score IGSII moyen était plus élevé dans le groupe VM que dans le groupe OF seul (39,5 contre 30,1, p=0,001). La durée d’OF avant recours à la VM était de 1,8 jours. Il y avait 10 complications lors de l’intubation (sept collapsus de reventilation, deux arrêts cardiaques et une bradycardie sévère). La durée de séjour en réanimation était plus longue dans le groupe VM (19,6 jours) que dans le groupe OF seul (6,3 jours) (p&lt;0,001). La mortalité à six semaines était de 33,3 % dans le groupe VM et de 13,9 % dans le groupe OF seul (p=0,053). Conclusion Notre étude retrouve une association entre des éléments de gravité à l’admission (score IGSII élevé, défaillance circulatoire, rapport PaO2/FiO2 bas) et le recours à la VM chez les patients infectés par le SARS-CoV-2. L’OF semble être une bonne alternative à la VM puisque 50 % des patients n’étaient pas intubés et bénéficiaient d’une durée d’hospitalisation plus courte. La survenue fréquente de complications graves lors de l’intubation impose la plus grande vigilance et la réalisation d’autres études afin de déterminer au mieux les facteurs de risque de recours à la VM.","Leroux, X.; Schock, M.; Lessire, H.; Bouterra, C.; Belilita, L.; Rerat, P.; Martinot, M.; Alvarez, A.; Gerber, V.",Infectious Diseases Now,,253
279714,Innovation management in crisis: patent analytics as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Objective: To explore the pathogenic variants of a family with syndromic deafness by high-throughput sequencing. Methods: The family was from Puyang City, Henan Province, and had four members, including two with syndromic deafness. The proband and his sister had congenital deafness, and their parents had normal phenotypes. The clinical phenotype of the family was characterized using clinical examinations and pedigree analysis. The clinical examinations included imaging examination, audiometry (pure tone audiometry, acoustic immittance, brainstem auditory evoked potential, and otoacoustic emission), vestibular function test, and ophthalmic examination (visual acuity test, visual field test, fundus examination, visual evoked potential, and electroretinogram). Target exome sequencing of 129 known deafness genes and bioinformatics analysis were used to screen suspected pathogenic variants. Sanger sequencing and minigene assay were used to verify and functionally investigate the mutation detected, respectively. According to the standards and guidelines for interpreting genetic variants proposed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, the variants c.6049G>A and c.8699A>G were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic, and the variant c.9856C>G was classified as variants of uncertain significance. Results: The probands and his sister had severe sensorineural hearing loss with decreased binocular vision, night blindness, decreased peripheral visual field sensitivity and partial visual field defect, and normal vestibular function. Both of them had three CDH23 mutations, including CDH23 (NM_022124.5) c.6049G>A (p.Gly2017Ser),c.9856C>G (p.His3286Asp), and c.8699A>G (p. Asp2900Gly), The first two were inherited from the father, and the last one was from the mother. The missense variants c.9856C>G and c.8699A>G were not included in the gnomad database. The missense mutation c.6049G>A was located in the last position of exon 46 and was predicted to affect splicing by bioinformatics software. The minigene experiment showed that the mutation cause exon skipping of exon 46, resulting in an abnormal protein. Conclusions: Compound heterozygous variations of the CDH23 are the leading cause of USH1D in the family. This study confirms that the compound heterozygosity of splicing and missense variants of the CDH23 gene could lead to USH1D.","Chen, B; Zhang, S; Tian, Y A; Liu, H F; Liu, D H; Xue, X; Li, R J; Hu, X X; Guan, J Y; Tang, W X; Xu, H E",Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi,,253

The present paper outlines selected measures (i.e., monitoring and identification of novel viral agents in animals, limitations to wildlife trade, decreasing hunting activities, changes to mink farming and meat production), the implementation of which would decrease such a risk. The role of viral surveillance systems and research exploring the virus strains associated with different animal hosts is emphasized along with the need for stricter wild trade regulations and changes to hunting activities. Finally, the paper suggests modifications to the meat production system, particularly through the introduction of cultured meat that would not only decrease the risk of exposure to novel human viral pathogens but also strengthen food security and decrease the environmental impacts of food production.","Halabowski, Dariusz; Rzymski, Piotr",Sci Total Environ,,253

In our 463 bedded, district general hospital, we noted an influx of young patients with myocarditis shortly after the peak of the outbreak. We report two cases presenting with myocarditis, both of whom tested negative for the virus despite clinical and biochemical evidence of recent infection. Diagnosis was made based on positive transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) findings and a raised troponin, not in the context of suspected acute coronary syndrome. We recommend that patients with negative coronavirus tests should still be considered at risk of potential sequelae from the disease. There should be a low threshold for performing basic cardiac investigations: ECG, troponin and TTE as well as seeking a cardiology opinion. Colchicine is a recognised treatment for viral pericarditis and should be considered as adjunctive treatment; however, further research is required specific to SARS-CoV-2.","Henwood, Matthew; Lake, Daniel; Allen, Felix; Sange, Mansoor",BMJ case reports,,253
281093,The Melodrama Machine,2021,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has generally increased levels of stress and depression among the public. However, the impact on college students in the United States has not been well-documented. OBJECTIVE: This paper surveys the mental health status and severity of depression and anxiety of college students in a large university system in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among undergraduate and graduate students recruited from Texas A&M University via email. The survey consisted of two standardized scales-the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder-7-for depression and anxiety, and additional multiple-choice and open-ended questions regarding stressors and coping mechanisms specific to COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 2031 participants, 48.14% (n=960) showed a moderate-to-severe level of depression, 38.48% (n=775) showed a moderate-to-severe level of anxiety, and 18.04% (n=366) had suicidal thoughts. A majority of participants (n=1443, 71.26%) indicated that their stress/anxiety levels had increased during the pandemic. Less than half of the participants (n=882, 43.25%) indicated that they were able to cope adequately with the stress related to the current situation. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of respondents showing depression, anxiety, and/or suicidal thoughts is alarming. Respondents reported academic-, health-, and lifestyle-related concerns caused by the pandemic. Given the unexpected length and severity of the outbreak, these concerns need to be further understood and addressed.","Wang, Xiaomei; Hegde, Sudeep; Son, Changwon; Keller, Bruce; Smith, Alec; Sasangohar, Farzan",J Med Internet Res,,253

METHODS: We recruited, via Instagram, a sample of full-time college students aged 18-22 from across the U.S. We surveyed them in April (baseline; N = 707; mean age = 20.0, SD = 1.3) and July (follow-up) 2020. This study presents overall levels of perceived stress and general anxiety symptoms and inequalities across each of these outcomes by gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and household income. We also explore potential explanations for these health issues by analyzing baseline qualitative data. RESULTS: All students, on average, were suffering from perceived stress and anxiety, with especially high levels in April. We also identified inequalities in college student mental well-being, particularly by gender identity and sexual orientation. Women reported worse well-being compared with men; transgender and gender diverse and sexual minority youths reported worse outcomes than their cisgender, heterosexual peers at both time points. Qualitative data illustrate how the COVID-19 pandemic has generated educational, economic, and environmental stressors that are affecting college students' well-being. CONCLUSIONS: As colleges and universities think about how to manage and mitigate the infectious disease dimensions of COVID-19 among their student populations, they must also consider who is most at risk for increased stress and anxiety during the pandemic.","Hoyt, Lindsay Till; Cohen, Alison K; Dull, Brandon; Maker Castro, Elena; Yazdani, Neshat",J. adolesc. health,,253

This viewpoint compares the response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK and in Germany. Despite being two large European countries of comparable size with good healthcare systems and similar patterns of exposure to Covid-19, Covid-19 related deaths in the UK currently far outnumber those in Germany. This has several reasons, but two explanations stick out: 1. lower long-term investment into healthcare in the UK rendered the NHS more vulnerable to Covid-19; 2. the existence of a well-governed decentralised and partially redundant organisation of healthcare increased resilience in Germany' s healthcare systems, enhancing the ability to adapt in response to unexpected challenges to healthcare.

282205,A gender-sensitive approach to U.S. crisis communication for COVID-19 and beyond,2020,"Prospective planning of COVID-19 vaccines allocation will be essential to maximize public health and societal benefits while preserving equity. Decisions about how to allocate limited supplies of vaccines need to be clear about the criteria used in setting priorities, with a specific commitment to transparency and communication. The aim of our study was to think through these competing demands, focusing on the opinion of healthcare workers (HCWs). The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the opinion of all the HCWs in a University based Italian Hospital about the fairest priority order to COVID 19 vaccines and to understand on which criteria the prioritization preferences of HCWs are implicitly based. The secondary endpoints were to assess whether HCWs approach differs from national guidelines and to assess the attitude of HCWs towards mandatory vaccination. An online survey accounting with multiple choice single answer questions and ranking questions was administered to all the HCWs of the University Hospital P. Giaccone of Palermo (Italy) and completed by a total of 465 participants. Almost all respondents confirmed the need for prioritization in COVID-19 vaccination for HCWs (n = 444; 95.5%), essential services and law enforcement (both n = 428; 92%). Clinically vulnerable individuals, HCWs and population over 65 years have been considered the first three groups to be involved in getting vaccination, being indicated as first position group by 26.5%, 32.5% and 21.9% of respondents, respectively. A large majority of respondents (85%) asked for a consistent, transparent and detailed order of priority at a national level. After adjusting for potential confounding due to sex and age, physicians have been found to be statistically significantly associated with the choice of mandatory vaccination (odds ratio (OR): 10.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.7-39.1) or with other strategies different from voluntary (OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 1.9-27.3). The broad consensus expressed by respondents towards mandatory vaccination for HCWs is extremely relevant at a time when vaccination hesitation is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving herd immunity. Data show a mismatch in the position attributed to long-term care residents compared to the position of absolute priority assigned by most of national distribution plans, impelling us to reflect on the issue of maximizing benefit from limited healthcare resources. Our findings clearly indicate a preference for COVID-19 frontline health professionals as the first tier of recipients, since they better meet all the criteria (higher risk, immediate system stability). As the guidelines are likely to directly affect a considerable number of citizens, our results call for policy interventions to inform people on the ethical rationale behind vaccine distribution decisions, to avoid resentment and feelings of unfairness.","Craxì, Lucia; Casuccio, Alessandra; Amodio, Emanuele; Restivo, Vincenzo",,,253

Using almost 1.3 million online articles on Italian media covering a period of four years, we assessed the incremental predictive power of economic-related keywords on the Consumer Confidence Index. We transformed news into networks of co-occurring words and calculated the semantic importance of specific keywords, to see if words appearing in the articles could anticipate consumers' judgements about the economic situation. Results show that economic-related keywords have a stronger predictive power if we consider the current households and national situation, while their predictive power is less significant with regards to expectations about the future. Our indicator of semantic importance offers a complementary approach to estimate consumer confidence, lessening the limitations of traditional survey-based methods.","Colladon, A.

We show that these concepts, combined with Le Cam's asymptotic theory of statistical experiments, yield novel testing procedures, which (a)~are valid under a broad class of innovation densities (possibly non-elliptical, skewed, and/or with infinite moments), (b)~are optimal (locally asymptotically maximin or most stringent) at selected ones, and (c) are robust against additive outliers. In order to do so, we establish a H\' ajek asymptotic representation result, of independent interest, for a general class of center-outward rank-based serial statistics. As an illustration, we consider the problems of testing the absence of serial correlation in multiple-output and possibly non-linear regression (an extension of the classical Durbin-Watson problem) and the sequential identification of the order $p$ of a vector autoregressive (VAR($p$)) model. A Monte Carlo comparative study of our tests and their routinely-applied Gaussian competitors demonstrates the benefits (in terms of size, power, and robustness) of our methodology; these benefits are particularly significant in the presence of asymmetric and leptokurtic innovation densities.

Obesity and other components of the metabolic syndrome may aggravate the severity of COVID-19. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, case-control study, enrolling 71 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of fatty liver by computed tomography scan. All medical records of eligible patients were reviewed including demographic, clinical, laboratory parameters and data regarding the presence of NAFLD and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: NAFLD was identified in 22/71 (31%) of the study group. Out of 71, thirteen suffered from severe COVID-19. NAFLD patients had more severe COVID-19 compared with non-NAFLD subjects, 8/22 (36.3%) vs. 5/49(10.2%), (P < 0.005), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that NAFLD subjects were more likely to have severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio 3.57, 95% confidence interval: 1.22, 14.48, P = 0.0031). CONCLUSION: NAFLD represents a high risk for severe COVID-19 irrespective to gender, and independent of metabolic syndrome specifically in male gender. Moreover, obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome were also significantly associated with severe COVID-19.","Mahamid, Mahmud; Nseir, Wiliam; Khoury, Tawfik; Mahamid, Baker; Nubania, Adi; Sub-Laban, Kamal; Schifter, Joel; Mari, Amir; Sbeit, Wisam; Goldin, Eran",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,,253

286456,COVID-19 and Health-Related Authority Allocation Puzzles,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since March 2020, companies nationwide have started work from home (WFH) owing to the rapid increase of confirmed COVID-19 cases in an attempt to help prevent the disease from spreading and to rescue the economy from the pandemic. Many organizations have conducted surveys to understand people's opinions toward WFH. However, the findings are limited owing to a small sample size and the dynamic topics over time. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand public opinions regarding WFH in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a large-scale social media study using Twitter data to portray different groups of individuals who have positive or negative opinions on WFH. We performed an ordinary least squares regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the sentiment about WFH and user characteristics including gender, age, ethnicity, median household income, and population density. To better understand the public opinion, we used latent Dirichlet allocation to extract topics and investigate how tweet contents are related to people's attitude. RESULTS: On performing ordinary least squares regression analysis using a large-scale data set of publicly available Twitter posts (n=28,579) regarding WFH during April 10-22, 2020, we found that the sentiment on WFH varies across user characteristics. In particular, women tend to be more positive about WFH (P<.001). People in their 40s are more positive toward WFH than those in other age groups (P<.001). People from high-income areas are more likely to have positive opinions about WFH (P<.001). These nuanced differences are supported by a more fine-grained topic analysis. At a higher level, we found that the most negative sentiment about WFH roughly corresponds to the discussion on government policy. However, people express a more positive sentiment when discussing topics on ""remote work or study"" and ""encouragement."" Furthermore, topic distributions vary across different user groups. Women pay more attention to family activities than men (P<.05). Older people talk more about work and express a more positive sentiment regarding WFH. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a large-scale social media-based study to understand the public opinion on WFH in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that this study can contribute to policymaking both at the national and institution or company levels to improve the overall population's experience with WFH.","Xiong, Ziyu; Li, Pin; Lyu, Hanjia; Luo, Jiebo",JMIR Med Inform,,253

287099,Governing in a pandemic: from parliamentary sovereignty to autocratic technocracy,2020,"The difference in COVID 19 death rates across political regimes has caught a lot of attention. The""efficient autocracy""view suggests that autocracies may be more efficient at putting in place policies that contain COVID 19 spread. On the other hand, the""biasing autocracy""view underlines that autocracies may be under reporting their COVID 19 data. We use fixed effect panel regression methods to discriminate between the two sides of the debate. Our results show that a third view may in fact be prevailing: once pre-determined characteristics of countries are accounted for, COVID 19 death rates equalize across political regimes. The difference in death rate across political regime seems therefore to be primarily due to omitted variable bias.","Cassan, Guilhem; Steenvoort, Milan Van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09960v1.pdf,253
287509,How Technology Can Help Post-COVID Anxiety: A Call to Action,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Older adults have repeatedly been referred to as more physically vulnerable during the COVID -19 pandemic. The pandemic, however, is not only about becoming physically ill. It has many psychosocial aspects: people are exposed to myriad life challenges. The life story approach does not ignore physical status but also emphasizes psychosocial strengths. It highlights that older people are likely to have developed resilience through experiencing life challenges and living across history. METHODS: We used the narrative method to review research on three strengths: tendency toward life reflection, adaptive use of personal memory, and temporal focus encouraging generativity. RESULTS: For each, we (i) present evidence that this strength manifests in the second half of life, and (ii) identify how it may specifically be applied in dealing with the challenges of the pandemic. In considering their life stories, the picture that emerges is one of older adults as having the potential to show considerable psychosocial strength despite the adversities of the pandemic. DISCUSSION: We conclude that during this period of sweeping change in the lives of individuals of all ages, our older citizens may act as valuable societal anchors.","Lind, Majse; Bluck, Susan; McAdams, Dan P",,,253

287713,Measuring Human and Economic Activity From Satellite Imagery to Support City-Scale Decision-Making During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), presents an unprecedented challenge to global public health with researchers striving to find a possible therapeutic candidate that could limit the spread of the virus. In this context, the present study employed an in silico molecular interaction-based approach to estimate the inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals from ethnomedicinally relevant Indian plants including Justicia adhatoda, Ocimum sanctum and Swertia chirata, with reported antiviral activities against crucial SARS-CoV-2 proteins. SARS-CoV-2 proteins associated with host attachment and viral replication namely, spike protein, main protease enzyme Mpro and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are promising druggable targets for COVID-19 therapeutic research. Extensive molecular docking of the phytocompounds at the binding pockets of the viral proteins revealed their promising inhibitory potential. Subsequent assessment of physicochemical features and potential toxicity of the compounds followed by robust molecular dynamics simulations and analysis of MM-PBSA energy scoring function revealed anisotine against SARS-CoV-2 spike and Mpro proteins and amarogentin against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as potential inhibitors. It was interesting to note that these compounds displayed significantly higher binding energy scores against the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins compared to the relevant drugs that are currently being targeted against them. Present research findings confer scopes to explore further the potential of these compounds in vitro and in vivo towards deployment as efficient SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors and development of novel effective therapeutics.

METHODS: We searched the PubMed database using combinations of the following MeSH terms: intracranial aneurysm, radiosurgery, radiotherapy, inflammatory changes in aneurysmal walls from 1967 to 2019. RESULTS: 51 studies, for a total cohort of 60 patients, are described. The median latency between the radiation treatment and the diagnosis was 9,83 years, ranging from a minimum of 0,33 to a maximum of 33. The modality of rays' administration was variable, and the dosage ranged from a minimum of 12 grays to a maximum of 177,2 grays. The anterior circulation appeared to be more frequently involved, and the most compromised vessel was the internal carotid artery. Radiation-induced vascular diseases have already been described in literature as well as RT-induced cellular and structural changes such as necrosis, macrophage or mononuclear cell infiltration, and several data support the role of inflammation in the development and remodelling of intracranial aneurysms, that, on one hand, favours them and, on the other, is necessary to their healing after endovascular treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our team suggested a new insight in the management of these vascular lesions, which corresponds to a lower threshold when deciding whether or not to treat, and a longer and stricter follow-up.","Paolucci, Aldo; Schisano, Luigi; Pluderi, Mauro; Grimoldi, Nadia; Caranci, Ferdinando; Angileri, Alessio; Arrichiello, Antonio; Costa, Antonella",Acta Biomed,,253

Method Thirty-six monolingual English-speaking children aged 4 and 5 years, half with SSD and half with typical speech and language skills, participated in this study. Participants completed standardized speech and language tests as well as a mispronunciation detection task targeting omissions and substitutions of the phonemes /k, s, É¹/ in five word positions/shapes. Results The children with SSD obtained significantly lower perceptual accuracy than the children with typical development. There was no statistically significant effect for phoneme. Omissions were more likely to be detected by both groups of participants compared with substitutions, and children with SSD had greater difficulty identifying substitutions as incorrectly produced words. Conclusions Speech perception difficulties may be a distinguishing feature of children with phonological SSD and without concomitant language difficulties. Further research is needed to investigate specific speech contexts in which perception predicts accurate production in children with SSD.","Brosseau-Lapré, Françoise; Schumaker, Jennifer",J Speech Lang Hear Res,,253

289672,The Imperative of Civility in Uncertain Times,2020,"This review evaluates whether pregnancy is a risk factor for COVID-19 by looking at the expression of immune markers such as immune cells and cytokines in order to have a better understanding on the pathophysiology of the disease, thus reducing maternal deaths. Pregnant women are more at risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their weakened immune system. Studies demonstrate that COVID-19 is an immune condition which is marked by reduced lymphocytes and elevated selected proinflammatory cytokines. Similar immune expression has been demonstrated in pregnancy by several studies. In addition, the placenta has been shown to possess ACE2 receptors on the villous cytotrophoblast and the syncytiotrophoblast and findings suggest that the coronavirus enters the host cells via these ACE2 receptors. The immune response in pregnancy increases the risk of contracting COVID-19. Both normal pregnancy and COVID-19 are marked by decreased lymphocytes, NKG2A inhibitory receptors, and increased ACE2, IL-8, IL-10, and IP-10 it therefore safer to conclude that pregnancy is a risk factor for COVID-19 development. Furthermore, the presence of the ACE2 receptors in the placenta may increase the risk of mother to baby transmission of the virus. Therefore, more studies investigating the link between pregnancy and COVID-19 are needed.","Phoswa, Wendy N; Khaliq, Olive P",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,253

Overall survival in those who received convalescent plasma was significantly higher than in the historical group (p = 0.03460). The plasma-treated group also showed a significantly milder course of infection (p = 0.03807), characterized by less severe symptoms and faster recovery (p = 0.00001).

Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of internet-based teaching versus face-to-face teaching in improving the CBT theory, assessment, and formulation skills of a group of mental health practitioners in Khartoum, Sudan. Method: Participants (N = 36) were randomly assigned to (a) a 3 h live lecture, or (b) a computer-based multimedia recorded lecture of the same duration. Participants were rated before and after training for their ability to assess a simulated patient and construct a CBT formulation of the presenting difficulties. Participants also rated the feasibility and acceptability of the training they had received. Results: Both teaching methods resulted in significant improvements in participants' abilities to carry out the assessment and formulation tasks. However, participants allocated to computer-based teaching performed better than those allocated to live teaching (between-groups effect size d = 0.26-0.74). Both teaching methods were rated as highly acceptable and feasible by participants. Conclusions: Computer-based teaching could offer a cheaper and effective method to help disseminate CBT to countries with limited resources and expertise, replacing and supplementing other costly traditional methods such as face-to-face teaching.","Ismail, Ahmed; Rakovshik, Sarah; Abdelrahim, Sarah",BJPsych Int,,253

Causative agent is a novel coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV). While new line of drug/vaccine development has been initiated world-wide, in the current scenario of high infected numbers, severity of the disease and high morbidity, repurposing of the existing drugs is heavily explored. Here, we used a homology-based structural model of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a cell surface receptor, required for entry of virus to the target host cell. Using the strengths of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we examined the binding potential of Withaferin-A (Wi-A), Withanone (Wi-N) and caffeic acid phenethyl ester to TPMRSS2 in comparison to its known inhibitor, Camostat mesylate. We found that both Wi-A and Wi-N could bind and stably interact at the catalytic site of TMPRSS2. Wi-N showed stronger interactions with TMPRSS2 catalytic residues than Wi-A and was also able to induce changes in its allosteric site. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Wi-N on TMPRSS2 expression in MCF7 cells and found remarkable downregulation of TMPRSS2 mRNA in treated cells predicting dual action of Wi-N to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. Since the natural compounds are easily available/affordable, they may even offer a timely therapeutic/preventive value for the management of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also report that Wi-A/Wi-N content varies in different parts of Ashwagandha and warrants careful attention for their use.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Our analysis show that: (i) in many cases the epidemic curve can be described by a Gaussian-type function; (ii) the temporal evolution of the accumulative number of infections and fatalities follow a logistic function; (iii) the key role played by the quarantine to block the spread of Covid-19 in terms of an interacting parameter between people. In the frame of elementary percolation theory, we show that: (i) the percolation probability can be associated with the probability of a person being infected with Covid-19; (ii) the concepts of blocked and non-blocked connections can be associated, respectively, with a person respecting or not the social distancing.

METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed clinical variables in patients with stage G1-G4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with complete or incomplete remission of proteinuria, who were managed in a nephrology outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Tokyo. The clinical variables during the COVID-19 pandemic (term 1, June-July 2020) were compared to those one year before the pandemic (term 0, June-July 2019). The urinary protein excretion (UPE) was used as the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: This study included 325 patients with stage G1-G4 CKD (mean age 58.5 years old, 37.5% female, 80.6% on renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors [RAASis], 12.0% on maintenance dose immunosuppression therapy) evaluated at term 0. The UPE at terms 0 and 1 was 247 (92-624) and 203 (84-508) mg/day [median (25th-75th percentile)], respectively; the value in term 1 was 18% lower than that in term 0 (p<0.001), with no marked difference in body weight, blood pressure, protein intake or urinary salt excretion. In multivariable analyses, incomplete remission of proteinuria in term 0 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.70, p = <0.001), RAASi use (OR = 2.09, p = 0.02) and decreased urinary salt excretion in term 1 vs. term 0 (OR = 1.94, p = 0.002) were identified as independent variables associated with reduced UPE in term 1 vs. term 0. No significant interactions between the variables were observed. CONCLUSION: In kidney disease patients receiving standard medical care from nephrologists, the UPE after the emergency declaration in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic was lower than before the declaration. The UPE reduction may be associated with reduced dietary salt intake during the pandemic in patients treated with RAASi for insufficient control of proteinuria. Our results support the current proposal to continue therapeutic approaches to these patients, which involve RAASi therapy along with optimizing dietary habits, even while dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tsuboi, Nobuo; Sasaki, Takaya; Kashihara, Naoki; Yokoo, Takashi",PLoS One,,253

Many institutions and health care offices have turned to screening questionnaires to determine the likelihood of COVID-19 positivity. However, screening questionnaires are woefully inadequate as studies have shown that roughly 6.4% to 50% of patients may spread this virus without any symptoms. In this paper, we have outlined a proposal to restart elective procedures after the curve has flattened in a certain locale, particularly for ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). Until additional data are collected for specific sensitivity and specificity values for PCR testing, we recommend performing two consecutive PCR tests to minimize false negative rates. The algorithm described in this paper can help ASCs begin their practices and provide local public health officials with valuable data that can help establish true sensitivity and specificity rates for these tests.","Naidu, Ramana; Sheth, Samir; Chaturvedi, Rahul; Chakravarthy, Krishnan",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,253

It is estimated that at least 50% of older adults in the U.S. have pets; while pets may be a source of support, they could also pose unique challenges during an already trying time. We aimed to investigate how pets impacted the everyday lives of older adults in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A large survey of U.S. pet owners (n = 2,068) was administered to assess the impact of relationships with pets during COVID-19 on human health and well-being. We conducted bivariate analyses to compare levels of social support, loneliness, pet attachment, and family income for a subset of older adults (ages 65 and older) with a younger comparison group (ages 18-64). Using thematic and content analysis, we analyzed two open-ended prompts from age 65+ respondents (n = 122): (1) the pros and cons of living with pets during the pandemic, and (2) advice for those living with pets in future pandemics. Results: Older adults, on average, reported lower levels of social support and less loneliness than respondents below age 65. There were no significant differences in strength of attachment to pets nor income between the younger and older respondents. For the open-ended prompt regarding pros and cons, we coded three emerging themes and related sub-themes: (1) pros (company; more time together; life purpose or meaning; love; support; stress relief; routine; distraction; exercise), (2) cons (general worry; potential for illness; limited participation; veterinary care access; obtaining supplies; difficulty meeting pet needs; financial concerns), and (3) no difference. Advice shared was coded into 13 themes/sub-themes: pets' health and welfare; make plans; veterinary information; treat pets like family; don't abandon pets; human health and well-being; stay calm; enjoy pets; keep routine; be careful of transmission; seek community resources; keep supplies stocked; and finances. Conclusions: Pets may fulfill some social and emotional needs for older adults during this particularly isolating event; equally important to consider are the challenges that may be precipitated by and/or exacerbated by this public health emergency.","Applebaum, Jennifer W; Ellison, Carlyn; Struckmeyer, Linda; Zsembik, Barbara A; McDonald, Shelby E",Front Public Health,,253

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed, EuropePMC, and Cochrane Central databases. The data of interest were the number of strokes, reperfusions, and mechanical thrombectomies during the COVID-19 pandemic versus that during the pre-pandemic period (in a historical comparator group over a specified period of same period length). RESULTS: The study included 59,233 subjects from 9 studies. Meta-analysis showed that the number of stroke alerts during the pandemic was 64% (56-71%) of that during the pre-pandemic period. The number of reperfusion therapies during the pandemic was 69% (61-77%) of that during the pre-pandemic period. Pooled analysis showed that the number of mechanical thrombectomies performed during the pandemic was 78% (75-80%) of that during the pre-pandemic period. The number of mechanical thrombectomies per stroke patient was higher during the pandemic (OR 1.23 [1.12-1.36], p < 0.001; I2: 0%, pâ¯=â¯0.845).

DESIGN: Matched pairs analysis of nursing homes that had their initial vaccine clinics between December 18, 2020, and January 2, 2021, versus between January 3, 2021, and January 18, 2021. Matched facilities had their initial vaccine clinics between 12 and 16 days apart. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and eighty nursing homes in 21 states owned and operated by the largest long-term care provider in the United States. MEASUREMENTS: Incident SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100 at-risk residents per week; hospital transfers and/or deaths per 100 residents with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection per day, averaged over a week. RESULTS: The early vaccinated group included 136 facilities with 12,157 residents; the late vaccinated group included 144 facilities with 13,221 residents. After 1 week, early vaccinated facilities had a predicted 2.5 fewer incident SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100 at-risk residents per week (95% CI: 1.2-4.0) compared with what would have been expected based on the experience of the late vaccinated facilities. The rates remained significantly lower for several weeks. Cumulatively over 5 weeks, the predicted reduction in new infections was 5.2 cases per 100 at-risk residents (95% CI: 3.2-7.3). By 5 to 8 weeks post-vaccine clinic, early vaccinated facilities had a predicted 1.1 to 3.8 fewer hospitalizations and/or deaths per 100 infected residents per day, averaged by week than expected based on late vaccinated facilities' experience for a cumulative on average difference of 5 events per 100 infected residents per day.

Such differences in views can be a source of misunderstanding, leading to unintended side effects. Online open-ended surveys resulted in 1341 comments received from 210 university educators and 347 students. The coding, based on the principles of Grounded Theory, resulted in 35 concepts, organized into 6 categories. The main findings were that students and educators shared most of the negative and positive views; however, there exist unique views that are not shared between the two groups. The negative views outweigh the positive ones, and educators are more negative than students. The category 'Perceived usefulness' is the most positive and 'Technology' the most negative category. Positive views were attributed to the quality of life, not the quality of the study. The most important contribution of the work to the existing body of knowledge is the comparative analysis of the unconstrained views of students and their educators about Online Learning Environments (OLE) as the workhorse of Forced Online Distance Education (FODE). The results of this study can be helpful for institutional evaluators, since they reveal undesirable side effects that are usually overlooked.

299493,The Wretched of COVID-19 in Brazil: Colonial Spectres of an Announced Crisis,2021,"Currently, there are at least 14 ongoing clinical studies on low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) for COVID-19 pneumonia in seven countries. One of the underlying assumptions is that irradiation at the level of about 1 Gy is effective at ameliorating viral pneumonia. Its rationale, however, relies on early human case studies or animal studies mostly obtained in the pre-biotic era, where rigorous statistical analyses were not performed. It therefore remains unclear whether those early data would support such assumptions. With state-of-the-art statistical models, we re-analyzed eleven radiobiological animal datasets (generally dating from the 1920s to early 1970s) in which animals received moderate doses of radiation before or after bacterial or viral inoculation. A number of different model systems (guinea pigs, dogs, cats, mice) and types of challenging infection, both bacterial and viral, are considered. For post-inoculation radiation exposure (which is more relevant to LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia) the results are heterogeneous, with one study (of six) showing a significant increase in risk associated with radiation exposure, another showing a significant decrease in risk associated with radiation exposure, and all other results being non-significant. For pre-inoculation exposure the results are also heterogeneous, with four (of six) datasets showing significant increase in risk associated with radiation exposure and the other two showing a significant decrease in risk. Collectively, these data do not suggest that there are strong modifying effects of radiation exposure after inoculation. Although there are stronger indications of modifications of risk by radiation exposure before inoculation, the inconsistency of direction of effect makes this body of data difficult to interpret.","Little, Mark P; Zhang, Wei; Hamada, Nobuyuki",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02625v3.pdf,253

Intellectual humility, a virtue characterized by nonjudgmental recognition of one's own intellectual fallibility, may counter rigidity associated with anti-vaccination attitudes and help promote vaccine-related behaviors. This study investigated whether intellectual humility is related to anti-vaccination attitudes and intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19, and whether intellectual humility can predict unique variance in these outcomes beyond participant demographic and personal factors. Participants (N = 351, 57.23% male, mean age = 37.41 years, SD = 11.51) completed a multidimensional measure for intellectual humility, the anti-vaccination attitudes (VAX) scale, and a two-item COVID-19 vaccination intention scale. Bivariate correlations demonstrated that intellectual humility was negatively related with anti-vaccination attitudes overall, r(349) = -.46, p < .001, and positively related to intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19, r(349) = .20, p < .001. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that intellectual humility predicted all four types anti-vaccination attitudes, overall anti-vaccination attitudes, and COVID-19 vaccination intentions above and beyond demographic and personal factors (i.e., sex, race/ethnicity, age, education, socioeconomic status, and political orientation), &#916;R 2 between .08 and .18, ps < .001. These results bolster intellectual humility as a malleable psychological factor to consider in efforts to combat anti-vaccination attitudes and promote COVID-19 vaccination uptake.","Huynh, Ho P; Senger, Amy R",,,253

300767,A closer look on the effectiveness of the EU legal framework for excessive pricing during the COVID-19 crisis,2021,"The outbreak of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) calls for an urgent unmet need for developing a facial and cost-effective detection method. The requirement of well-trained personnel and sophisticated instrument of current primary mean (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) may hinder the practical application worldwide. In this regard, a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) coupled with CRISPR-Cas12a colorimetric assay is proposed for the SARS-CoV-2 detection. The methodology we have described herein utilizes DNA-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a universal colorimetric readout and can specifically target ORF1ab and N regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. After the virus genome is amplified through RT-RPA, the resulting abundant dsDNA will bind and activate Cas12a. Under trans-cleavage degradation, the capped DNA substrate will be hydrolyzed gradually from AuNPs, demonstrating a change in the surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which can be facially monitored by UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy and naked eye observation. The high amplification efficiency from RT-RPA and Cas12a trans-cleavage process bring the sensitivity of our method to 1 copy of viral genome sequence per test. Notably, under the dual variations inspecting from the isothermal amplification and Cas12a activation process, the false positive events from other beta coronavirus members can be effectively avoided and thus significantly improve the specificity. Furthermore, the reliability of this colorimetric assay is validated by standard clinical samples from the hospital laboratory department. Through integration of the inherently high sensitivity and specificity from an RPA-coupled Cas12a system with the intrinsic simplicity of AuNP-based colorimetric assay, our method increases the practical testing availability of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhang, Wei S; Pan, Jianbin; Li, Feng; Zhu, Min; Xu, Mengting; Zhu, Hongyan; Yu, Yanyan; Su, Gaoxing",Anal Chem,,253

Models for plasma exchange with either veno-arterial or veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are considered. Two classes of models are derived for each case, one in the form of an algebraic delay equation and another in the form of a system of delay differential equations. In special cases, our models reduce to single compartment ones for plasma exchange that have been validated with experimental data. We also show that the algebraic delay equations are forward Euler discretizations of the delay differential equations, with timesteps equal to transit times through model compartments. Numerical simulations are performed to compare different model types, to investigate the impact of plasma device port switching on the efficiency of the exchange process, and to study the sensitivity of the models to their parameters.","Puelz, Charles; Danial, Zach; Marinaro, Jon; Raval, Jay S.; Griffith, Boyce E.; Peskin, Charles S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06100v1.pdf,253

Purpose To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods An AI system (CAD4COVID-XRay) was trained on 24 678 chest radiographs, including 1540 used only for validation while training. The test set consisted of a set of continuously acquired chest radiographs (n = 454) obtained in patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia between March 4 and April 6, 2020, at one center (223 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] results, 231 with negative RT-PCR results). Radiographs were independently analyzed by six readers and by the AI system. Diagnostic performance was analyzed with the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results For the test set, the mean age of patients was 67 years ± 14.4 (standard deviation) (56% male). With RT-PCR test results as the reference standard, the AI system correctly classified chest radiographs as COVID-19 pneumonia with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81. The system significantly outperformed each reader (P < .001 using the McNemar test) at their highest possible sensitivities. At their lowest sensitivities, only one reader significantly outperformed the AI system (P = .04). Conclusion The performance of an artificial intelligence system in the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 on chest radiographs was comparable with that of six independent readers. © RSNA, 2020.","Murphy, Keelin; Smits, Henk; Knoops, Arnoud J G; Korst, Michael B J M; Samson, Tijs; Scholten, Ernst T; Schalekamp, Steven; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia M; Philipsen, Rick H H M; Meijers, Annet; Melendez, Jaime; van Ginneken, Bram; Rutten, Matthieu",Radiology,,253

It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for the pandemic reasoned respiratory insufficiency and death. At first, it was thought that the patients who use immunmodulator therapy could be even at higher risks of disease complications. However, it has been also speculated about that using immunmodulators could be an advantage for the clinical prognosis. Therefore, several immunmodulators are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with type 1 interferon for multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. RESULTS: Despite using immunmodulator, the symptoms of the patient at hospitalization were mild and he did not show elevated D-dimer, and there was no lymphopenia. He was discharged to home-quarantine with no symptoms. DISCUSSION: This report supports the idea of using type 1 interferon in the treatment could be effective in COVID-19 affected patients.","Gemcioglu, Emin; Davutoglu, Mehmet; Ozdemir, Ese Ece; Erden, Abdulsamet",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,253

The parameters are projected into a low-dimensional subspace to alleviate the approximation error of KDE in high dimensions. We formulate a projected Wasserstein gradient flow and analyze its convergence property under mild assumptions.

308577,"Even in a global pandemic, there’s no such thing as a crisis",2020,"P. aeruginosa is classified as a priority one pathogen by the World Health Organisation, and new drugs are urgently needed, due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Antimicrobial-resistant nosocomial pathogens such as P. aeruginosa pose unwavering and increasing threats. Antimicrobial stewardship has been a challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a majority of those hospitalized with SARS-CoV2 infection given antibiotics as a safeguard against secondary bacterial infection. This increased usage, along with increased handling of sanitizers and disinfectants globally, may further accelerate the development and spread of cross-resistance to antibiotics. In addition, P. aeruginosa is the primary causative agent of morbidity and mortality in people with the life-shortening genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Prolonged periods of selective pressure, associated with extended antibiotic treatment and the actions of host immune effectors, results in widespread adaptive and acquired resistance in P. aeruginosa found colonizing the lungs of people with CF. This review discusses the arsenal of resistance mechanisms utilized by P. aeruginosa, how these operate under high-stress environments such as the CF lung and how their interconnectedness can result in resistance to multiple antibiotic classes. Intrinsic, adaptive and acquired resistance mechanisms will be described, with a focus on how each layer of resistance can serve as a building block, contributing to multi-tiered resistance to antimicrobial activity. Recent progress in the development of anti-resistance adjuvant therapies, targeting one or more of these building blocks, should lead to novel strategies for combatting multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa. Anti-resistance adjuvant therapy holds great promise, not least because resistance against such therapeutics is predicted to be rare. The non-bactericidal nature of anti-resistance adjuvants reduce the selective pressures that drive resistance. Anti-resistance adjuvant therapy may also be advantageous in facilitating efficacious use of traditional antimicrobials, through enhanced penetration of the antibiotic into the bacterial cell. Promising anti-resistance adjuvant therapeutics and targets will be described, and key remaining challenges highlighted. As antimicrobial stewardship becomes more challenging in an era of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and global conflict, innovation in antibiotic adjuvant therapy can play an important role in extending the shelf-life of our existing antimicrobial therapeutic agents.","Langendonk, R Frèdi; Neill, Daniel R; Fothergill, Joanne L",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,253

Fifteen workshops were held in seven of SA's nine provinces with a total of 323 attendees. Quantitative and qualitative findings (n = 281) indicate that these workshops were feasible for community-based dissemination of the guidelines and that this method of dissemination was acceptable to CBOs and end-users. Findings from follow-up focus groups (6 groups, n = 28 participants) indicate that the guidelines were shared with end-users of CBOs who participated in the focus groups. An additional musical storytelling resource, the ""Woza, Mntwana"" song, was well-received by participants; sharing via WhatsApp was believed to be the most effective way to disseminate this song. These findings confirm the feasibility and acceptability of culturally appropriate and context-specific community-based dissemination of behavioural guidelines in low-income settings.","Draper, Catherine E; Silubonde, Takana M; Mukoma, Gudani; van Sluijs, Esther M F",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,253

Despite large concentrations of dislocations and voids in the pristine samples, positron annihilation measurements uncovered the structure of vacancy clusters and the change in their size and density with irradiation dose. When combined with transmission electron microscopy measurements, the study demonstrates an association between the increase in the density of small vacancy clusters with irradiation and a remarkable reduction in the size of large voids. This, previously unknown, mechanism for the interaction of cascade damage with voids in ion-irradiated materials is a consequence of the high porosity of the initial microstructure.","Agarwal, S; Liedke, M O; Jones, A C L; Reed, E; Kohnert, A A; Uberuaga, B P; Wang, Y Q; Cooper, J; Kaoumi, D; Li, N; Auguste, R; Hosemann, P; Capolungo, L; Edwards, D J; Butterling, M; Hirschmann, E; Wagner, A; Selim, F A",Sci Adv,,253

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of recent scientific literature to assess whether AKI may be associated with worse prognosis and increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was conducted between 1st November 2019 and 15th May 2020 on Medline (PubMed interface) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify potentially eligible studies. Cohort or case-control studies reporting data on AKI in patients with or without severe COVID-19 were included. Studies were divided into separate cohorts for analysis based on two endpoints (severity [severe vs non-severe] and mortality [non-survivors vs survivors]). Data were pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for either outcome. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies (n= 5,832 patients) were included in the analysis. Overall, AKI was found to be associated with significantly increased odds of COVID-19 severity (OR= 18.5; 95% CI 8.99-38.08) and mortality (OR= 23.9; 95% CI 18.84-30.31).

AKI could be used as a clinical characteristic in severity classification and risk -stratification.","Cheruiyot, Isaac; Henry, Brandon; Lippi, Giuseppe; Kipkorir, Vincent; Ngure, Brian; Munguti, Jeremiah; Misiani, Musa",Acta Biomed,,253
311287,COVID-19 Presenting as Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis,2021,"Despite the huge growth in online purchases, e-grocery (i.e. ordering grocery online) was still limited in scope in Italy so far. More recently, its growth has been substantial and 2020 witnessed a huge increase due to COVID-19-related mobility restrictions. In principle, e-grocery could reduce the number of shopping trips, yet an exponential increase in shipping and deliveries could have a negative impact on the environment. In order to explore the willingness to e-grocery, and delivery preferences (self-delivery, home delivered grocery or collected in a specific place) - and estimate their market shares - a stated preference survey was carried in Rome and Milan. Respondents were asked about their grocery shopping habits and to choose among different shopping and delivery options. Discrete choice modelling allows investigating preference heterogeneity and estimating willingness to pay measures. Main results indicate that respondents, characterised by distinct socio-economic, attitudinal, and geographical elements, react differently to attribute variations for alternative grocery shopping channels. Scenario simulations can help in defining successful business-strategies and possible solutions to external costs. Under this respect, results suggest that the best strategy to increase e-grocery shares in the two cities should be non-monetary, but rather aimed at expanding the product range available online.","Maltese, Ila Le Pira Michela Marcucci Edoardo Gatta Valerio Evangelinos Christos",Research in Transportation Economics,,253

312037,The Reorganization of Global Value Chains in East Asia before and after COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several healthcare systems facing respiratory viral infections outbreaks, like COVID-19, have not been prepared to manage them. Public health mitigation solutions ranging from isolation of infected or suspected cases to implementation of national lockdowns have proven their effectiveness for the outbreak's control. However, the adjustment of public health measures is crucial during transition phases to avoid new outbreaks. To address the need for designing evidence-based strategies, we performed a systematic review to identify healthcare systems interventions, experiences and recommendations that have been used to manage different respiratory viral infections outbreaks in the past. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane were searched to retrieve eligible studies of any study design, published in English until 17 April 2020. Double-blinded screening process was conducted by titles/abstracts and subsequently eligible full texts were read and pertinent data were extracted. When applicable, quality assessment was conducted for the included articles. We performed a narrative synthesis of each implemented public health approaches. RESULTS: We included a total of 24 articles addressing the public health approaches implemented for respiratory viral infections outbreaks for COVID-19, influenza A H1N1, MERS and severe acute respiratory syndrome . The identified approaches are ascribable to two main categories: healthcare system strategies and healthcare provider interventions. The key components of an effective response on respiratory viral outbreaks included the implementation of evidence-based contextual policies, intrahospital management actions, community healthcare facilities, non-pharmaceutical interventions, enhanced surveillance, workplace preventive measures, mental health interventions and communication plans. CONCLUSION: The identified healthcare system strategies applied worldwide to face epidemics or pandemics are a useful knowledge base to inform decision-makers about control measures to be used in the transition phases of COVID-19 and beyond.","Cascini, Fidelia; Hoxhaj, Ilda; Zaçe, Drieda; Ferranti, Margherita; Di Pietro, Maria Luisa; Boccia, Stefania; Ricciardi, Walter",,,253
313596,Care-educational technology to support men in facing the coronavirus pandemic,2020,"As of April 19, 2021, 21.6 million COVID-19 cases had been reported among U.S. adults, most of whom had mild or moderate disease that did not require hospitalization (1). Health care needs in the months after COVID-19 diagnosis among nonhospitalized adults have not been well studied. To better understand longer-term health care utilization and clinical characteristics of nonhospitalized adults after COVID-19 diagnosis, CDC and Kaiser Permanente Georgia (KPGA) analyzed electronic health record (EHR) data from health care visits in the 28-180 days after a diagnosis of COVID-19 at an integrated health care system. Among 3,171 nonhospitalized adults who had COVID-19, 69% had one or more outpatient visits during the follow-up period of 28-180-days. Compared with patients without an outpatient visit, a higher percentage of those who did have an outpatient visit were aged &#8805;50 years, were women, were non-Hispanic Black, and had underlying health conditions. Among adults with outpatient visits, 68% had a visit for a new primary diagnosis, and 38% had a new specialist visit. Active COVID-19 diagnoses* (10%) and symptoms potentially related to COVID-19 (3%-7%) were among the top 20 new visit diagnoses; rates of visits for these diagnoses declined from 2-24 visits per 10,000 person-days 28-59 days after COVID-19 diagnosis to 1-4 visits per 10,000 person-days 120-180 days after diagnosis. The presence of diagnoses of COVID-19 and related symptoms in the 28-180 days following acute illness suggests that some nonhospitalized adults, including those with asymptomatic or mild acute illness, likely have continued health care needs months after diagnosis. Clinicians and health systems should be aware of post-COVID conditions among patients who are not initially hospitalized for acute COVID-19 disease.","Hernandez-Romieu, Alfonso C; Leung, Serena; Mbanya, Armand; Jackson, Brendan R; Cope, Jennifer R; Bushman, Dena; Dixon, Meredith; Brown, Jessica; McLeod, Tim; Saydah, Sharon; Datta, Deblina; Koplan, Kate; Lobelo, Felipe",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,253

315041,How Did China's COVID-19 Shutdown Affect US Supply Chains?,2020,"Pandemics are caused by novel pathogens to which pre-existing antibody immunity is lacking. Under these circumstances, the body must rely on innate interferon-mediated defenses to limit pathogen replication and allow development of critical humoral protection. Here, we highlight studies on disease susceptibility during H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemics. An emerging concept is that genetic and non-genetic deficiencies in interferon system components lead to uncontrolled virus replication and severe illness in a subset of people. Intriguingly, new findings suggest that individuals with autoantibodies neutralizing the antiviral function of interferon are at increased risk of severe COVID-19. We discuss key questions surrounding how such autoantibodies develop and function, as well as the general implications of diagnosing interferon deficiencies for personalized therapies.","Stertz, Silke; Hale, Benjamin G",Trends microbiol,,253

Measurements were performed by means of electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry after microwave-assisted acid digestion according to previously optimized and validated procedure. The results obtained indicate that data cover the wide range of concentrations and generally are consistent with other published findings. Nickel levels in the brain, stomach, liver, kidneys, lungs and heart (wet weight) were between 2.15-79.4 ng/g, 0.5-44.2 ng/g,7.85-519 ng/g, 12.8-725 ng/g, 8.47-333 ng/g and 2.3-97.7 ng/g, respectively. Females had generally lower levels of nickel in tissues than males (statistically significant relationships were found for the liver, kidneys and lungs), and median nickel concentrations in all studied material within all age groups had very similar values, with the exception of stomach.","Dudek-Adamska, Danuta; Lech, Teresa; Konopka, Tomasz; Koscielniak, Pawel",Biol. trace elem. res,,253

A 51-question survey, including demographic and pandemic questions and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), was used as a data collection method and administered to dentists in Turkey via the internet in two stages. A link to the survey (onlineanketler.com) was sent to the participants by e-mail or social media (WhatsApp©). A total of 442 dentists in the first stage and 264 dentists in the second stage answered the questionnaire. The second stage of the survey only applied to dentists who are assigned within the scope of COVID-19 measures in Turkey. Standard descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, independent samples t test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. Most of the participants showed higher stress levels. Occupational burnout levels of participants according to filiation service (serve/FP, did not serve/FN) were 34.4% and 17.6%, respectively. The FP group showed significantly higher stress levels than the FN group.

316363,A content analysis of Chinese news coverage on COVID-19 and tourism,2020,"BACKGROUND: Considerable evidence suggests that smell dysfunction is common in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Unfortunately, extant data on prevalence and reversibility over time are highly variable, coming mainly from self-report surveys prone to multiple biases. Thus, validated psychophysical olfactory testing is sorely needed to establish such parameters. METHODS: One hundred severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients were administered the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in the hospital near the end of the acute phase of the disease. Eighty-two were retested 1 or 4 weeks later at home. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance and mixed-effect regression models. RESULTS: Initial UPSIT scores were indicative of severe microsmia, with 96% exhibiting measurable dysfunction; 18% were anosmic. The scores improved upon retest (initial test: mean, 21.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.84-23.09; retest: mean, 31.13; 95% CI, 30.16-32.10; p < 0.0001); no patient remained anosmic. After 5 weeks from COVID-19 symptom onset, the test scores of 63% of the retested patients were normal. However, the mean UPSIT score at that time continued to remain below that of age- and sex-matched healthy controls (p < 0.001). Such scores were related to time since symptom onset, sex, and age. CONCLUSION: Smell loss was extremely common in the acute phase of a cohort of 100 COVID-19 patients when objectively measured. About one third of cases continued to exhibit dysfunction 6 to 8 weeks after symptom onset. These findings have direct implications for the use of olfactory testing in identifying SARS-CoV-2 carriers and for counseling such individuals with regard to their smell dysfunction and its reversibility.","Moein, Shima T; Hashemian, Seyed MohammadReza; Tabarsi, Payam; Doty, Richard L",Int. forum allergy rhinol,,253

A valid approach presented in the literature is to develop an image-based method to support COVID-19 diagnosis using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Because the availability of radiological data is rather limited due to the novelty of COVID-19, several methodologies consider reduced datasets, which may be inadequate, biasing the model. Here, we performed an analysis combining six different databases using chest X-ray images from open datasets to distinguish images of infected patients while differentiating COVID-19 and pneumonia from 'no-findings' images. In addition, the performance of models created from fewer databases, which may imperceptibly overestimate their results, is discussed. Two CNN-based architectures were created to process images of different sizes (512 × 512, 768 × 768, 1024 × 1024, and 1536 × 1536). Our best model achieved a balanced accuracy (BA) of 87.7% in predicting one of the three classes ('no-findings', 'COVID-19', and 'pneumonia') and a specific balanced precision of 97.0% for 'COVID-19' class. We also provided binary classification with a precision of 91.0% for detection of sick patients (i.e., with COVID-19 or pneumonia) and 98.4% for COVID-19 detection (i.e., differentiating from 'no-findings' or 'pneumonia'). Indeed, despite we achieved an unrealistic 97.2% BA performance for one specific case, the proposed methodology of using multiple databases achieved better and less inflated results than from models with specific image datasets for training. Thus, this framework is promising for a low-cost, fast, and noninvasive means to support the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Maior, Caio B S; Santana, João M M; Lins, Isis D; Moura, Márcio J C",PLoS One,,253

(Working Paper: FISH-2021-02.),2021,"Deep neural network (DNN) classifiers have attained remarkable performance in diagnosing known diseases when the models are trained on a large amount of data from known diseases. However, DNN classifiers trained on known diseases usually fail when they confront new diseases such as COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework and pipeline for explainable medical imaging that can classify known diseases as well as detect new/unknown diseases when the models are only trained on known disease images. We first provide in-depth mathematical analysis to explain the overconfidence phenomena and present the calibrated confidence that can mitigate the overconfidence. Using calibrated confidence, we design a decision engine to determine if a medical image belongs to some known diseases or a new disease. At last, we introduce a new visual explanation to further reveal the suspected region inside each image. Using both Skin Lesion and Chest X-Ray datasets, we validate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of new disease discovery, i.e., distinguish COVID-19 from pneumonia without seeing any COVID-19 data during training. We also qualitatively show that our visual explanations are highly consistent with doctors’ ground truth. While our work was not designed to target COVID-19, our experimental validation using the real world COVID-19 cases/data demonstrates the general applicability of our pipeline for different diseases based on medical imaging.","Tang, Claire",Commun.

Pandemics, including COVID-19, may influence changes to physical activity and sedentary behaviours among children. However, the role of parent anxiety related to COVID-19 on children's physical activity and sedentary behaviours has yet to be explored. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between parent COVID-19 anxiety and physical activity and sedentary behaviours among school-aged children (5-17 years) and; to describe these behaviour patterns among school-aged children in relation to the COVID-19 public health emergency response. Between April and June 2020, a random sample of adults (Calgary, Canada) completed an online questionnaire. This sample included 345 parents of at least one school-aged child (80.5% aged 5 to 11 years and 54.9% male). Approximately one-third of parents (35.7%) reported being extremely or very anxious about COVID-19. During this period, most children increased television watching (58.8%), computing or gaming (56.4%), and use of screen-based devices (75.9%). Not surprisingly, given the mandated closure of playgrounds, approximately one-half of children decreased playing at the park (52.7%) and in public spaces (53.7%). Children's physical activity at home either increased (48.8%) or remained unchanged (32.9%). Children of more anxious parents had fewer visits to the park and were more likely to spend &#8805;2 hours/day computing or gaming compared with children of less anxious parents. Strategies to counteract the unintended consequences of the COVID-19 public health measures on parent and child wellbeing are needed.","McCormack, Gavin R; Doyle-Baker, Patricia K; Petersen, Jennie A; Ghoneim, Dalia",Prev Med Rep,,253
320028,"Corporate liquidity, supply chain and cost issues awareness within the Covid-19 context: evidence from us management reports’ textual analysis",2021,"PURPOSE: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, an increasing number of patients are afflicted by olfactory loss, a now well-recognized symptom of the disease. Though many patients seem to recover their sense of smell after a few weeks, a certain proportion of them seem to develop long-lasting olfactory disorder. Yet, as of October 2020, there is no recommended standardized treatment to reduce the risk of developing long-term olfactory disorder. In this pilot study, we investigated the efficacy and the safety of oral corticosteroids and olfactory training as a treatment for patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction as a result of COVID-19. METHODS: Non-hospitalized patients with a sudden loss of smell and a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were recruited by hospital call from February to April 2020. These participants were submitted to an extensive psychophysical testing in order to identify those with persistent dysosmia. Dysosmic patients were then treated either by a 10-day course of oral corticosteroids combined with olfactory training, or by olfactory training alone. All participants were subject to a second olfactory test after a mean of 10 weeks. RESULTS: 72 subjects with documented COVID-19 infection performed the initial olfactory test, on average 5 weeks after losing their sense of smell. Amongst them, 27 (37.5%) patients showed persistent dysosmia and were all included in this study. Nine participants received oral corticosteroids and performed olfactory training (OCS + OT), while 18 performed olfactory training (OT) only. Only participants in the OCS + OT group had significantly improved their olfactory score and did so above the minimal clinically important difference for subjective improvement of smell (p = 0.007). Three of the participants who received oral corticosteroids reported minimal and transient side effects. CONCLUSION: This pilot study may suggest the combination of a short course of oral corticosteroids and olfactory training is safe and may be beneficial in helping patients with enduring dysosmia recover from olfactory loss due to COVID-19. There is a crucial need for further investigation with larger cohorts to corroborate these findings.","Le Bon, Serge-Daniel; Konopnicki, Deborah; Pisarski, Nathalie; Prunier, Léa; Lechien, Jérôme R; Horoi, Mihaela",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,253

We evaluated the analytical performance of the Abbott(R) Panbio RADT on nasopharyngeal samples stored at the Ministry of Health National Reference Lab in Nassau, Bahamas. The Panbio demonstrated a test sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 100% on 50 PCR negative samples and 50 samples presumed to be infectious based on having PCR cycle threshold values below 30. Additionally, in our examination of operator results there was low interpersonal variation (1%) among three blind operators and significant correlation between sample Ct value and perceived signal strength on the RADT device.

Adapting neuropsychology services using teleneuropsychology models (e.g. video or telephone assessments) may not always be a viable option for all providers and settings. Based on the existing teleneuropsychology literature, we propose a ""contactless"" evidence-based inpatient test battery to be used for in-person assessments amenable to physical distancing. Method: In addition to the proposed test battery, we suggest a decision-making workflow process to help readers determine the appropriateness of the proposed methods given their patients' needs. Considerations for special populations (i.e. seniors, patients with brain injury, psychiatric patients), feedback, limitations of the proposed physical distancing approach, and future directions are also discussed. Conclusions: Our aim is that the suggested teleneuropsychology-informed battery and model may inform safe and practical neuropsychological inpatient assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic and other situations requiring contact precautions for infection prevention and control.","Parlar, Melissa E; Spilka, Michael J; Wong Gonzalez, Daniela; Ballantyne, Elena C; Dool, Catherine; Gojmerac, Christina; King, Jelena; McNeely, Heather; MacKillop, Emily",Clin Neuropsychol,,253

321894,Pentair updates on Covid-19 impact,2020,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of the COVID-19 health-care system quality (HSQ) and its impact on the individual (satisfaction) and social (quality of life [QOL]) outcomes in the context of a transformative health-care delivery system using service-dominant logic (SDL). Design/methodology/approach: A sample consisting of 1,008 individuals who have experienced the COVID-19 health-care system was drawn from four different regions of Saudi Arabia using the simple random sampling technique. The survey was conducted using an online survey and 1,008 respondents answered, based on their experience and knowledge of the COVID-19 health-care system. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to test the proposed research model. Findings: The study findings suggest that service system satisfaction (SAT) significantly mediates the role of the HSQ in delivering and enhancing the QOL. HSQ also has a significant role to play on the SAT as well as the QOL. These findings contribute to the body of knowledge on SDL in the context of HSQ in understanding the significant role of technologies can play in enhancing service satisfaction and better QOL during a crisis such as COVID-19. This study also improves the understanding of the importance of customer-centricity, real-time visibility through tracking and tracing of service flow, agile decision-making, fewer but better-defined service objectives, and finally shaping mindsets and behaviors of all the relevant parties involved in the HSQ service delivery process. Research limitations/implications: One of the major limitations of this study is that, although COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic, cross-sectional data were collected in only one country. The findings may not be generalizable across subsequent waves of the pandemic. The best practices of HSQ could be studied around the globe and the results used to support continuous improvement. Originality/value: This study advances the understanding of the SDL in the context of a transformative health-care system for a transitional economy by focusing on individual and social well-being during an unexpected crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also contributes toward the understanding of the roles of enabling technologies to improve the service delivery system which results in an improved SAT, as well as better QOL for the society at large. Based on SDL this research validates the HSQ model, relevant measures and its overall impact on SAT and QOL in the context of a transformative health-care service system in Saudi Arabia. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Salam, M.

Identifying the most effective control strategies has been the imperative task all around the world. Various public health control strategies have been proposed and tested against pandemic diseases (e.g., COVID-19). We study two specific pandemic control models: the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination control; and the SEIR model with shield immunity control. We express the pandemic control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas. We then develop an iterative approach for synthesizing the optimal control strategies with MTL specifications. We provide simulation results in two different scenarios for robust control of the COVID-19 pandemic: one for vaccination control, and another for shield immunity control, with the model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy. The results show that the proposed synthesis approach can generate control inputs such that the time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune) satisfy the MTL specifications with robustness against initial state and parameter uncertainties.","Xu, Zhe; Duan, Xiaoming",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14262v1.pdf,253

This prospective, randomized study compared placebo with pregabalin in the hope that a lower pregabalin dose would improve analgesia without increasing side-effects after THA. METHODS: This study was a prospective randomized blinded study, with a parallel design and an allocation ratio of 1:1 for the treatment groups. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board in Weifang People's Hospital and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before enrolment. A total of 120 patients who meet inclusion criteria are randomized to either pregabalin or placebo group. The primary objective of the study was visual analog scale score. As secondary outcomes, opioid consumption measurement, Harris Hip Score, hip range of motion, patient satisfaction, and complications were made at different time points throughout the study for comparison. RESULTS: The null hypothesis of this study was that pregabalin would reduce pain after THA.

El mecanismo de transmisión del SARS-CoV-2 entre humanos es mediante las secreciones generadas durante la respiración y estornudos, presentándose con un período de incubación desde 1 a 14 días. Se describen fiebre, tos y astenia como los síntomas más habituales. El diagnóstico definitivo se logra a través de la correlación entre la presentación clínica y exámenes complementarios, pero en la actualidad, el método de muestreo de preferencia para el diagnóstico de SARS-CoV-2 es mediante una muestra de nasofaringe, en donde se analiza la presencia de material genético viral por medio de RT-PCR. Debido a las complicaciones en la obtención de la muestra, tanto para el personal sanitario como para el paciente, se ha implementado la muestra de saliva con finalidad diagnóstica, como un método que proporciona una detección rápida, simple y no invasiva de la infección viral. Esta alternativa diagnóstica podría entregar información respecto a la patogenia de la enfermedad, permitiendo el manejo y control de pacientes positivos.

Patients with psychiatric illness often suffer from the stigma of mental illness and receive poor medical care. Many patients with severe and persistent mental illness face additional barriers, including poverty, marginal housing, and food insecurity. Patients who require psychiatric hospitalization now face the risk of transmission of Covid-19 due to the inherent difficulties of social distancing within a psychiatric hospital. Patients whose freedom and self-determination have been temporarily overruled as they receive involuntary psychiatric treatment deserve a setting that maintains their health and safety. While tele-mental health has been rapidly expanded to provide new ways to access psychiatric treatment, some patients may have limitations in technological literacy or access to devices. The social isolation, economic fallout, and potential traumatization related to the current pandemic will disproportionately affect this vulnerable population, and society's duties to them must be considered.","Conrad, Rachel C; Baum, Matthew L; Shah, Sejal B; Levy-Carrick, Nomi C; Biswas, Jhilam; Schmelzer, Naomi A; Silbersweig, David",Hastings Cent Rep,,253

To date, there are no effective antiviral drugs for the targeted treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We provide the VITYALA YETHINDRA (VYTR) hypothesis for the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of GS-5734 treatment in humans with COVID-19. Prophylactic GS-5734 treatment may prevent SARS-CoV-2 induced disease and lung lesions in participants inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Therapeutic GS-5734 treatment may show a reduction in the severity of symptoms, reduce viral repli-cation, the complete eradication of lung lesions in some participants and decrease in the extent of lesions in 50% of participants may be possible. As broad-spectrum drugs are capable of inhibiting coronavirus infections, GS-5734 should be considered a broad-spectrum, first-line drug and may inhibit coronavirus infections and COVID-19. More clinical trials are needed to prove that GS-5734 (Remdesivir) is a safe and effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19.","Yethindra, Vityala; Dzhangazieva, Ainura; Kurzhunbaeva, Zhyldyz; Tagaev, Tugolbai; Nazami, Furquan",Int.

327229,Access to justice in the time of pandemic: Functioning of legal aid forms in north macedonia,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2), a novel coronavirus responsible for the recent infectious pandemic, is known to downregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Most current investigations focused on SARS-COV-2-related effects on the renin-angiotensin system and especially the resultant increase in angiotensin II, neglecting its effects on the kinin-kallikrein system. SARS-COV-2-induced ACE2 inhibition leads to the augmentation of bradykinin 1-receptor effects, as ACE2 inactivates des-Arg9-bradykinin, a bradykinin metabolite. SARS-COV-2 also decreases bradykinin 2-receptor effects as it affects bradykinin synthesis by inhibiting cathepsin L, a kininogenase present at the site of infection and involved in bradykinin production. The physiologies of both the renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein system are functionally related suggesting that any intervention aiming to treat SARS-COV-2-infected patients by triggering one system but ignoring the other may not be adequately effective. Interestingly, the snake-derived bradykinin-potentiating peptide (BPP-10c) acts on both systems. BPP-10c strongly decreases angiotensin II by inhibiting ACE, increasing bradykinin-related effects on the bradykinin 2-receptor and increasing nitric oxide-mediated effects. Based on a narrative review of the literature, we suggest that BPP-10c could be an optimally effective option to consider when aiming at developing an anti-SARS-COV-2 drug.","Gouda, Ahmed S; Mégarbane, Bruno",Drug Dev Res,,253

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2015 to 2019, 222 HVPG measurements performed during transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation were eligible for this study. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) software color-coded each pixel of a two-dimensional DSA series by time-intensity curve to classify IHVS. Different degrees of IHVS were found in 36.5% of patients (81/222). Mild IHVS was found in 10.8% of patients (24/222), moderate IHVS was found in 10.8% of patients (24/222), and severe IVHS was found in 14.9% of patients (33/222). RESULTS: Mean wedged hepatic vein pressure (WHVP) and HVPG were significantly lower in patients with IHVS compared with patients without IHVS (WHVP: 17.78 mm Hg ± 7.00 vs 24.89 mm Hg ± 8.69, P = .001; HVPG: 11.93 mm Hg ± 5.76 vs 18.6 mm Hg ± 6.85, P < .001). Mild IHVS had little effect on WHVP and HVPG. Mean WHVP and HVPG were 11 mm Hg lower in patients with moderate IHVS (WHVP: 20.38 mm Hg ± 8.38 vs 31.5 mm Hg ± 9.39, P = .026; HVPG: 13.88 mm Hg ± 6.33 vs 25.00 mm Hg ± 9.81, P < .001) and 15 mm Hg lower in patients with severe IHVS (WHVP: 13.45 mm Hg ± 5.28 vs 28.64 mm Hg ± 6.38, P = .017; HVPG: 8.27 mm Hg ± 3.85 vs 23.45 mm Hg ± 6.95, P < .001) than mean portal vein pressure and portal vein gradient. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with moderate or severe IHVS, HVPG might greatly underestimate the actual value of portal vein pressure, and the portal vein should be catheterized to measure portal pressure.","Ma, Jingqin; Gong, Ximing; Luo, Jianjun; Gu, Junying; Yan, Zhiping; Zhang, Wen; Li, Changyu; Zhang, Zihan; Yang, Minjie",J Vasc Interv Radiol,,253

The current study aims to investigate the association of COVID-19-related stressful experiences with ASD and possible psychological mechanisms of the association among college students. METHODS: Data were collected from 7,800 college students via an online survey during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in China (from 31 January to 11 February 2020). Existing scales were adapted to measure stressful experiences, resilience, coping, social support, and ASD symptoms. Path analysis was employed to examine the research hypotheses. RESULTS: Among the 7,800 college students, 61.53% were women and their mean age was 20.54 years. Both direct and indirect effects from COVID-19-related stressful experiences to ASD symptoms were significant. The relationship between COVID-19-related stressful experiences and ASD could be mediated by resilience (ß = 0.01, p < .001), adaptive coping strategies (ß = 0.02, p < .001), and social support (ß = 0.01, p < .001); while not being significantly mediated by maladaptive coping strategies.

Currently, an important percentage of patients in haemodialysis are elderly. Herein, we investigated the impact of age on mortality among haemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Data was obtained from the Spanish COVID-19 chronic kidney disease (CKD) Working Group Registry. From 18 March 2020 to 27 August 2020, 930 patients on haemodialysis affected by COVID-19 were included in the Registry. A total of 254 patients were under 65 years old and 676 were 65 years or older (elderly group). Mortality was 25.1% higher (95% CI: 22.2-28.0%) in the elderly as compared to the non-elderly group. Death from COVID-19 was increased 6.2-fold in haemodialysis patients as compared to the mortality in the general population in a similar time frame.

OBJECTIVES: To describe 3 pediatric Kawasaki Disease patients with false positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively recruited children with KD diagnosed during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. Clinical characteristics and laboratory test results including SARS-CoV-2 PCR results were retrieved. We performed a microparticle-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG against nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), and a microneutralization assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: Three Chinese children with typical KD were identified. They had no epidemiological links with COVID-19 patients and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 NPA PCR. They were treated with IVIG and aspirin, and were discharged without complications. Subsequently 2 of them were tested positive against anti-RBD and anti-NP antibodies and 1 was tested positive against anti- RBD antibodies. However, microneutralization assay showed that neutralizing antibodies were absent, suggesting a false-positive IgG result. CONCLUSION: Detection of neutralizing antibodies is recommended to confirm previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in IgG-positive but PCR-negative patients.","To, Kelvin Kw; Chua, Gilbert T; Kwok, Ka Li; Wong, Joshua Sc; Au, Dennis Chi Yu; Lam, Yuen Yu; Wong, Wilfred Hs; Ho, Marco Hk; Chan, Godfrey Cf; Chui, Celine Sl; Li, Xue; Tung, Keith Ts; Wong, Rosa S; Tso, Winnie Wy; Wong, Ian Ck; Wong, Christina Sm; Fong, Carol Hy; Chan, Kwok Hung; Yuen, Kwok Yung; Ip, Patrick; Kwan, Mike Yw",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,,253

330897,Gradient-Based Grey Wolf Optimizer with Gaussian Walk: Application in Modelling and Prediction of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Ly49Q is an ITIM-bearing MHC class I receptor that is highly expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Ly49Q is required for the TLR9-mediated IFN-I production in pDCs, although the mechanism is not fully understood. We here demonstrate that Ly49Q protects pDCs from pyroptotic cell death induced by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG). In the Ly49Q-deficient (Klra17-/-) mouse spleen, the number of ssDNA-positive pDCs increased significantly after CpG treatment, strongly suggesting that Klra17-/- pDCs were susceptible to CpG-induced cell death. In Klra17-/- bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), CpG-induced cell death was accompanied by increased cathepsin B leakage from the vesicular compartments into the cytoplasm. Concurrently, IL-1ß secretion increased in the CpG-treated Klra17-/- BMDCs, strongly suggesting that the CpG-induced cell death in these cells is pyroptotic in nature. Consistent with these observations, inhibiting cathepsin B or caspase 1 in CpG-stimulated Klra17-/- BMDCs reversed the increase in cell death. Pyroptotic cell death and IL-1ß secretion were also observed in BMDCs derived from transgenic mice expressing an ITIM-less Ly49Q (Ly49Q-YF Tg). CpG also increased the IL-1ß production and cell death in B2m-/- BMDCs. These results suggest that Ly49Q and MHC class I play important roles for protecting pyroptosis-like cell death of DCs by influencing lysosome state.","Sasawatari, Shigemi; Karyu, Hitomi; Nguyen Tien, Dat; Furuyama-Tanaka, Kaori; Toyama-Sorimachi, Noriko",Mol Immunol,,253
331199,Strategies to Reenvision Doctor of Nursing Practice Projects to Meet Organization Goals During a Pandemic,2021,"Many kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) schools offering in-person learning have adopted strategies to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). These measures include mandating use of face masks, physical distancing in classrooms, increasing ventilation with outdoor air, identification of close contacts,* and following CDC isolation and quarantine guidance (2). A 2-week pilot investigation was conducted to investigate occurrences of SARS-CoV-2 secondary transmission in K-12 schools in the city of Springfield, Missouri, and in St. Louis County, Missouri, during December 7-18, 2020. Schools in both locations implemented COVID-19 mitigation strategies; however, Springfield implemented a modified quarantine policy permitting student close contacts aged &#8804;18 years who had school-associated contact with a person with COVID-19 and met masking requirements during their exposure to continue in-person learning.§ Participating students, teachers, and staff members with COVID-19 (37) from 22 schools and their school-based close contacts (contacts) (156) were interviewed, and contacts were offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. Among 102 school-based contacts who received testing, two (2%) had positive test results indicating probable school-based SARS-CoV-2 secondary transmission. Both contacts were in Springfield and did not meet criteria to participate in the modified quarantine. In Springfield, 42 student contacts were permitted to continue in-person learning under the modified quarantine; among the 30 who were interviewed, 21 were tested, and none received a positive test result. Despite high community transmission, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies was lower than that in the community. Until additional data are available, K-12 schools should continue implementing CDC-recommended mitigation measures (2) and follow CDC isolation and quarantine guidance to minimize secondary transmission in schools offering in-person learning.","Dawson, Patrick; Worrell, Mary Claire; Malone, Sara; Tinker, Sarah C; Fritz, Stephanie; Maricque, Brett; Junaidi, Sadaf; Purnell, Gemille; Lai, Albert M; Neidich, Julie A; Lee, Justin S; Orscheln, Rachel C; Charney, Rachel; Rebmann, Terri; Mooney, Jon; Yoon, Nancy; Petit, Machelle; Schmidt, Spring; Grabeel, Jean; Neill, Lee Ann; Barrios, Lisa C; Vallabhaneni, Snigdha; Williams, Randall W; Goddard, Clay; Newland, Jason G; Neatherlin, John C; Salzer, Johanna S",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,253

331687,The university’s fragile role in fostering societal resilience by facilitating the development of community-engaged professionalism,2021,"Social media plays a significant role in disaster management by providing valuable data about affected people, donations and help requests. Recent studies highlight the need to filter information on social media into fine-grained content labels. However, identifying useful information from massive amounts of social media posts during a crisis is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose I-AID, a multimodel approach to automatically categorize tweets into multi-label information types and filter critical information from the enormous volume of social media data. I-AID incorporates three main components: i) a BERT-based encoder to capture the semantics of a tweet and represent as a low-dimensional vector, ii) a graph attention network (GAT) to apprehend correlations between tweets' words/entities and the corresponding information types, and iii) a Relation Network as a learnable distance metric to compute the similarity between tweets and their corresponding information types in a supervised way. We conducted several experiments on two real publicly-available datasets. Our results indicate that I-AID outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of weighted average F1 score by +6% and +4% on the TREC-IS dataset and COVID-19 Tweets, respectively.","Zahera, Hamada M.; Jalota, Rricha; Sherif, Mohamed A.; Ngomo, Axel N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13544v2.pdf,253

In the present work, we put forward the first wastewater surveillance-based city zonation for effective COVID-19 pandemic preparedness. A three-month data of Surveillance of Wastewater for Early Epidemic Prediction (SWEEP) was generated for the world heritage city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. In this expedition, one hundred sixteen wastewater samples were analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, from September 3rd to November 26th, 2020. A total of 111 samples were detected with at least two out of three SARS-CoV-2 genes (N, ORF 1ab, and S). Monthly variation depicted a significant decline in all three gene copies in October compared to September 2020, followed by a sharp increment in November 2020. Correspondingly, the descending order of average effective gene concentration was: November (~10,729 copies/L) &gt; September (~3047 copies/L) &gt; October (~454 copies/L). Monthly variation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater samples may be ascribed to a decline of 20.48% in the total number of active cases in October 2020 and a rise of 1.82% in November 2020. Also, the monthly recovered new cases were 16.61, 20.03, and 15.58% in September, October, and November 2020, respectively. The percentage change in the gene concentration was observed in the lead of 1–2 weeks with respect to the provisional figures of confirmed cases. SWEEP data-based city zonation was matched with the heat map of the overall COVID-19 infected population in Ahmedabad city, and month-wise effective RNA concentration variations are shown on the map. The results expound on the potential of WBE surveillance of COVID-19 as a city zonation tool that can be meaningfully interpreted, predicted, and propagated for community preparedness through advanced identification of COVID-19 hotspots within a given city.","Kumar, Manish Joshi Madhvi Shah Anil V.; Srivastava, Vaibhav Dave Shyamnarayan",Science of The Total Environment,,253

The purpose of this study was to identify RVA in nomadic goats and calves during severe diarrhea outbreaks in 2012 and 2014 in Bouaarfa, Morocco, and to characterize the complete genomic constellation of two bovine and caprine strains (S18 and S19) and their genetic relatedness with the human strain ma31 detected in 2011 in Morocco. Partial nucleotide sequencing of VP4 and VP7 genes for the twenty-two positive samples revealed three circulating genotypes: G6P[14], G10P[14], and G10P[5] with predominance of G6P[14] genotype. Full-genome sequencing for both strains S18 and S19 presented, respectively, the following genomic constellations: G6-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 and G10-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3. Phylogenetic analyses and the analysis of the VP8* antigenic epitopes for S18, S19 and ma31 revealed a shared similarity with bovine, caprine, ovine and human strains from Morocco and other countries. The VP2 and NSP1 genes of the S19 strain were closely related to those of the cognate genes of the human ma31 strain, while the VP4 gene of S18 strain was closely related to the cogent gene of the ma31 strain. Our findings revealed cases of zoonotic transmission and confirmed the risk of emergence of new genotypes in some environments such as nomadic regions, where close physical proximity between human and livestock is common. The present study is novel in reporting whole-genome analyses of RVA isolates obtained from nomadic livestock in Morocco.","Alaoui Amine, Sanaâ; Melloul, Marouane; El Alaoui, Moulay Abdelaziz; Boulahyaoui, Hassan; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Touil, Nadia; El Fahime, Elmostafa",Virus Genes,,253

Recent studies propose an active role of coagulation disorders in disease progression. This hypercoagulability has been displayed by marked increase in D-dimer in hospitalized patients. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, generation of cytokine storm, the interdependence between inflammation and coagulation, its consequences and the possible management options for coagulation complications like venous thromboembolism (VTE), microthrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and systemic and local coagulopathy. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for relevant reports using COVID-19, cytokine storm, and coagulation as keywords. EXPERT OPINION: A prophylactic dose of 5000-7500 units of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been recommended for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in order to prevent VTE. Treatment dose of LMWH, based on disease severity, is being contemplated for patients showing a marked rise in levels of D-dimer due to possible pulmonary thrombi. Additionally, targeting PAR-1, thrombin, coagulation factor Xa and the complement system may be potentially useful in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection induced lung injury, microvascular thrombosis, VTE and related outcomes like DIC and multi-organ failure.","Savla, Shreya R; Prabhavalkar, Kedar S; Bhatt, Lokesh K",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,253

Employing path analytical framework and bootstrap methods, we analysed data from an international sample of 100 project teams in management studies. Drawing on procedural justice theory, we theorised and found support that students' uncertainty avoidance orientation and virtuality in collaboration were positively related to their satisfaction with use of a peer feedback system. Such satisfaction in turn allowed them to be more effective team members. Our findings provide evidence for higher education institutions and instructors considering the adoption of online peer feedback systems alongside teamwork in their curricula. Specifically, peer feedback appears to be effective in the development of teamwork skills and students appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback to their peers in a structured and dedicated environment. Our findings are timely and of important practical significance as educational institutions increasingly rely on the use of computer-mediated technology during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Donia, M. B.

METHODS: Children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia or with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia were included. Data including lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokines were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 56 patients were included in the study, 40 children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and 16 children with RSV pneumonia. Compared with children with RSV pneumonia, patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia had higher count of CD3+8+ lymphocyte, higher percentages of CD3+, CD3+8+ lymphocytes and a lower percentage of CD19+ lymphocyte. The serum IL-10 level was significantly higher in children with RSV pneumonia. One 2019-nCoV pneumonia child who was with an obvious increase of IL-10 developed severe pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Immune response played a very important role in the development of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The effective CD8+ T cell response might influence the severity of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The adaptable change in IL-10 level might contribute to the relatively mild pneumonia symptoms in children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and bacterial co-infection might be a risk factor of severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia.","Li, Hui; Chen, Kailan; Liu, Maochang; Xu, Hua; Xu, Qiong",J Infect,,253

339238,Recurrent Narratives Around the COVID-19 Crisis in Social Networks: A Case Study Analysis on Facebook,2020,"Biological activity of antisense oligonucleotides (asON), especially those with a neutral backbone, is often attenuated by poor cellular accumulation. In the present proof-of-concept study, we propose a novel delivery system for asONs which implies the delivery of modified antisense oligonucleotides by so-called transport oligonucleotides (tON), which are oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to asON conjugated with hydrophobic dodecyl moieties. Two types of tONs, bearing at the 5'-end up to three dodecyl residues attached through non-nucleotide inserts (TD series) or anchored directly to internucleotidic phosphate (TP series), were synthesized. tONs with three dodecyl residues efficiently delivered asON to cells without any signs of cytotoxicity and provided a transfection efficacy comparable to that achieved using Lipofectamine 2000. We found that, in the case of tON with three dodecyl residues, some tON/asON duplexes were excreted from the cells within extracellular vesicles at late stages of transfection. We confirmed the high efficacy of the novel and demonstrated that MDR1 mRNA targeted asON delivered by tON with three dodecyl residues significantly reduced the level of P-glycoprotein and increased the sensitivity of KB-8-5 human carcinoma cells to vinblastine. The obtained results demonstrate the efficacy of lipophilic oligonucleotide carriers and shows they are potentially capable of intracellular delivery of any kind of antisense oligonucleotides.","Markov, Oleg V; Filatov, Anton V; Kupryushkin, Maxim S; Chernikov, Ivan V; Patutina, Olga A; Strunov, Anton A; Chernolovskaya, Elena L; Vlassov, Valentin V; Pyshnyi, Dmitrii V; Zenkova, Marina A",Molecules (Basel),,253
339535,The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Month of Bioethics in Finland,2020,"The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, taking on pandemic proportions, is placing extraordinary and unprecedented demands on healthcare systems worldwide. The increasing number of critical patients who, experiencing respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome, need respiratory support, has been leading countries to race against time in arranging new Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and in finding affordable and practical solutions to manage patients in each stage of the disease. The simultaneous worldwide emergency caused serious problems for mechanical ventilators supply. This chaotic scenario generated, indeed, a frenetic race to buy life-saving ventilators. However, the variety of mechanical ventilators designs, together with the limitations in time and resources, make the decision-making processes on ventilators procurement crucial and not counterbalanced by the evaluation of devices quality. This paper aimed at offering an overview of how evidence-based approach for health technologies evaluation, might provide support during Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in ICUs management and critical equipment supply. We compared and combined all the publicly available indications on the essential requirements that ICU ventilators might meet to be considered acceptable for treating COVID-19 patients in severe to critical illnesses. We hope that the critical analysis of these data might help readers to understand how structured decision-making processes based on evidence, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of a given medical device and the effects of its introduction in a healthcare setting, are able to optimize time and resources allocation that should be considered essential, especially during pandemic period.","Martina, Andellini; Simone, De Santis; Federico, Nocchi; Elena, Bassanelli; Leandro, Pecchia; Matteo, Ritrovato",Health Technol (Berl),,253

A cornerstone of therapy is the work in the community through further education and community organisations. However, coronavirus restrictions have meant that such external supports are no longer available for the duration of the crisis. This has led to opportunities for developing new ways of offering rehabilitation within hospital environments. This article describes some of the new initiatives developed. The benefits of the lockdown for service users are also discussed. Many found the cessation of visits from family members with whom they had an ambivalent relationship helpful. The lockdown improved relationships between patients on the unit and encouraged a greater feeling of community. The lockdown has also emphasised the importance of team self-awareness and an awareness of the nature of the treatments offered.","Glancy, D; Reilly, L; Cobbe, C; Glynn, M; Punchoo, S; Foy, K",Ir J Psychol Med,,253

Sixteen studies involving a total of 575 patients (538 males and 37 females) were included in this systematic review. The COVID-19 phase was available for 479 patients: 426 in the acute and 53 in the recovery phase. De novo lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were observed in 43 patients and deterioration of pre-existing LUTS in 7. Bladder hemorrhage was observed in three patients and acute urinary retention in one. Regarding the male genital system, scrotal discomfort was observed in 8 patients, swelling in 14, pain in 16, and erythema in 1; low flow priapism was observed in 2 patients. Ultrasound examination identified acute orchitis in 10 patients, acute epididymitis in 7, and acute epididymo-orchitis in 16. A case-control study reported that patients with moderate COVID-19 show a significant reduction in sperm concertation, the total number of sperms per ejaculate, progressive motility, and complete motility.

340533,"Covid-19, Labour Law, and the Renewal of the Social State",2020,"Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that can infect animal and human hosts. The infection induces mild or sometimes severe acute respiratory diseases. Nowadays, the appearance of a new, highly pathogenic and lethal coronavirus variant, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for a pandemic (COVID-19), represents a global problem for human health. Unfortunately, only limited approaches are available to treat coronavirus infections and a vaccine against this new coronavirus variant is not yet available. The plasma membrane microdomain lipid rafts have been found by researchers to be involved in the replication cycle of numerous viruses, including coronaviruses. Indeed, some pathogen recognition receptors for coronaviruses as for other viruses cluster into lipid rafts, and it is therefore conceivable that the first contact between virus and host cells occurs into these specialized regions, representing a port of cell entry for viruses. Recent data highlighted the peculiar pro-viral or anti-viral role played by autophagy in the host immune responses to viral infections. Coronaviruses, like other viruses, were reported to be able to exploit the autophagic machinery to increase their replication or to inhibit the degradation of viral products. Agents known to disrupt lipid rafts, such as metil-β-cyclodextrins or statins, as well as autophagy inhibitor agents, were shown to have an anti-viral role. In this review, we briefly describe the involvement of lipid rafts and autophagy in coronavirus infection and replication. We also hint how lipid rafts and autophagy may represent a potential therapeutic target to be investigated for the treatment of coronavirus infections.","Fecchi, Katia; Anticoli, Simona; Peruzzu, Daniela; Iessi, Elisabetta; Gagliardi, Maria Cristina; Matarrese, Paola; Ruggieri, Anna",Front.

As the field continues to evolve, the criteria for referral and listing have also changed. The last update to these guidelines was in 2014 and several studies since then have changed how patients are transplanted. Our article aims to briefly discuss these updates in lung transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: This article discusses the importance of early referral of patients for lung transplantation and the concept of the 'transplant window'. We review the referral and listing criteria for some common pulmonary diseases and also cite the updated literature surrounding the absolute and relative contraindications keeping in mind that they are a constantly moving target. Frailty and psychosocial barriers are difficult to assess with the current assessment tools but continue to impact posttransplant outcomes. Finally, we discuss the limited data on transplantation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID19 as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation bridge to transplantation. SUMMARY: The findings discussed in this article will strongly impact, if not already, how we select candidates for lung transplantation. It also addresses some aspects of lung transplant such as frailty and ARDS, which need better assessment tools and clinical data.","Shah, Purav; Neujahr, David C",Curr Opin Organ Transplant,,253

341659,Reflections on China–US relations after the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is sweeping through China, posing the greatest ever threat to its public health and economy. As a tertiary cancer center in Southwest China, we formulated and implemented an anti-infection protocol to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 in our department. METHODS: The anti-infection protocol divided patients into 3 categories, namely outpatients, inpatients, and patients receiving radiation therapy at our cancer center, and each category had a distinct anti-infection protocol to minimize the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 transmission. In each category, the patients were classified into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups. Each risk group was managed differently. A survey of patient volume changes prior to and during the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak was performed. RESULTS: We carried out the anti-infection protocol at our cancer center during the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. We found that the total volume of both outpatient visits and inpatient treatment declined significantly depending on the conditions of each group. Radiation therapy and palliative service had the lowest and highest volume reductions at 58.3% and 100%, respectively. The decline in outpatient volumes was higher than the decline in inpatient treatment services (78.8% vs 71.8%). There was no Coronavirus disease 2019 cross-infection at our center, or Coronavirus disease 2019-related injury or death. The anti-infection protocol measures continue to be taken at the hospital even today but they have been modified depending on the prevalent local conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Challenges from the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic remain in our community. The anti-infection protocol implemented at our cancer center has been effective in preventing cross-infection. Whether our anti-infection protocol experience can be applied to curb the spread of the infection in other parts of the world remains to be tested.","Wang, Xiao Shan; Zeng, Ming",Technol Cancer Res Treat,,253

In this commentary, we argue that actions on health equity to date have been insufficient despite significant scholarship to guide both practice and policy. To move from talk to action on health equity, we propose the following five approaches: (1) reversing the erosion of publicly funded health systems; (2) creating broad economic means to support health; (3) moving health action upstream; (4) challenging ageist and/or ableist discourses; and (5) decolonizing approaches and enacting solidarity. Engaging in these actions will help close the gaps and address disparities made more evident during this global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the need for us to move from discussion to action if we are to achieve health for all. Adopting a health equity lens is a means of both understanding and stimulating action to readdress the root causes of inequities and work toward a fairer, more just society.","Caxaj, Susana; Oudshoorn, Abe; Ford-Gilboe, Marilyn; Webster, Fiona; Donelle, Lorie; Forchuk, Cheryl; Berman, Helene; Smye, Vicki",Nurs Leadersh (Tor Ont),,253

342931,Strategies for the Preservation of Service Levels in the Inventory Management During COVID-19: A Case Study in a Company of Biosafety Products,2021,"Cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to rise worldwide. To date, there is no effective treatment. Clinical management is largely symptomatic, with organ support in intensive care for critically ill patients. The first phase I trial to test the efficacy of a vaccine has recently begun, but in the meantime there is an urgent need to decrease the morbidity and mortality of severe cases. It is known that patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection than individuals without cancer because of their systemic immunosuppressive state caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments. Therefore, these patients might be at increased risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 could in some case induce excessive and aberrant non-effective host immune responses that are associated with potentially fatal severe lung injury and patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cytokine release syndrome and viral ARDS result from uncontrolled severe acute inflammation. Acute lung injury results from inflammatory monocyte and macrophage activation in the pulmonary luminal epithelium which lead to a release of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-&#945;. These cytokines play a crucial role in immune-related pneumonitis, and could represent a promising target when the infiltration is T cell predominant or there are indirect signs of high IL-6-related inflammation, such as elevated C-reactive protein. A monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab has been administered in a number of cases in China and Italy. Positive clinical and radiological outcomes have been reported. These early findings have led to an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial in China and Italy. While data from those trials are eagerly awaited, patients' management will continue to rely for the vast majority on local guidelines. Among many other aspects, this crisis has proven that different specialists must join forces to deliver the best possible care to patients.","Addeo, Alfredo; Obeid, Michel; Friedlaender, Alex",J. immunotherap. cancer,,253
343261,Gender and Political Leadership in a Time of COVID,2020,"BACKGROUND: Our objective was to assess the effects of COVID-19 antiepidemic measures and subsequent changes in the function of the health care system on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers in the Republic of Croatia. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective, population- and registry-based study during 2020. The comparator was the number of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer during 2017, 2018, and 2019. The outcome was the change in number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases. RESULTS: The average monthly percent change after the initial lockdown measures were introduced was -11.0% (95% confidence interval - 22.0% to 1.5%), resulting in a 24% reduction of the newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during April, May, and June compared with the same period of 2019. However, during 2020, only 1% fewer new cases were detected than in 2019, or 6% fewer than what would be expected based on the linear trend during 2017-2019. CONCLUSION: It seems that national health care system measures for controlling the spread of COVID-19 had a detrimental effect on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during the first lockdown. As it is not plausible to expect an epidemiological change to occur at the same time, this may result in later diagnosis, later initiation of treatment, and less favorable outcomes in the future. However, the effect weakened after the first lockdown and COVID-19 control measures were relaxed, and it has not reoccurred during the second COVID-19 wave. Although the COVID-19 lockdown affected the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers, the oncology health care system has shown resilience and compensated for these effects by the end of 2020. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is possible to compensate for the adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic control measures on breast cancer diagnosis relatively promptly, and it is of crucial importance to do it as soon as possible. Moreover, as shown by this study's results on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases during the second wave of the pandemic, these adverse effects are preventable to a non-negligible extent.","Vrdoljak, Eduard; Balja, Melita Peric; Marusic, Zlatko; Avirovic, Manuela; Blazicevic, Valerija; Tomasovic, Cedna; Cerina, Dora; Bajic, Zarko; Mise, Branka Petric; Lovasic, Ingrid Belac; Flam, Josipa; Tomic, Snjezana",Oncologist,,253

Forty Wistar male rats were used, with a mean age of 120 days and a mean weight of 302 g. The animals were allocated in two groups of 20 animals each: a control group and an experimental group. Under ether anesthesia, the rats of the experimental group were submitted to a laparotomy and the abdominal sepsis was induced according to the Wichterman method, while those in the control group were submitted to laparotomy and manipulation of the intestinal segments involved in the experiment. Twenty four hours later, the animals underwent to a new laparotomy and a left colonic anastomosis, with a single layer of polypropilene interrupted suture, 2,0 cm above the peritoneal reflection. On the 3rd and 7th post-operative day, the colonic segment with the anastomosis was resected in order to evaluate the bursting strength . The Red Sirius dye was used to evaluate collagen concentration in the histopathological study. Results showed in both groups an increase in the bursting strength , relating to post-operative day. Collagen concentration was poorer in the peritonitis group on the 3rd and 7th post-operative days (p = 0.000168) (p = 0.0020) respectively. The percentages of collagen I and III were similar on the 3rd post-operative day. On the 7th day, however, collagen type III (p =0.000079) predominated in the peritonitis group. The results above showed that the concentration and maturation of collagen are reduced in a colonic anastomosis performed when peritonitis is present. These alterations does not interfere in the bursting strength.","de Lourdes Pessole Biondo-Simões, Maria; Hintz Greca, Fernando; Bryk Junior, Agostinho; Cláudia Gomes Komatsu, Maria; de Oliveira Bittencourt, Fabiano; Maria Greca, Letícia",Acta cir. bras.,,253

Overall, there has been a generalized lack of appropriateness in prescriptions, which, in the field of transfusion medicine, is termed patient-blood management. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to separate study design variables that could affect clinical outcome after CCP therapy. We focus here on variables such as pretransfusion antibody testing in recipients, dose adjustments and antibody affinity measurements. SOURCES: We searched PubMed and preprint servers for relevant preclinical and clinical studies discussing each of these variables in the field of CCP therapy. CONTENT: We show evidence that neglecting those variables has affected the outcomes of the vast majority of CCP clinical trials to date. IMPLICATIONS: A better understanding of such variables will improve the design of the next generation of CCP clinical trials. This will likely lead to better clinical outcomes and will minimize risks of immune evasion from subneutralizing doses of neutralizing antibodies.","Focosi, Daniele; Maggi, Fabrizio; Franchini, Massimo; Aguzzi, Adriano; Lanza, Maria; Mazzoni, Alessandro; Menichetti, Francesco",Clin Microbiol Infect,,253

We comprehensively described air pollution during and after the lockdown periods in 2020 compared with 2018-2019, and estimated the mortality burden indicated by the number of deaths and years of life lost (YLL) related to the air pollution changes. The mean air quality index (AQI), PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and CO concentrations during the lockdown across China declined by 18.2 (21.2%), 27.0 µg/m3 (28.9%), 10.5 µg/m3 (18.3%), 8.4 µg/m3 (44.2%), 13.1 µg/m3 (38.8%), and 0.3 mg/m3 (27.3%) respectively, when compared to the same periods during 2018-2019. We observed an increase in O3 concentration during the lockdown by 5.5 µg/m3 (10.4%), and a slight decrease after the lockdown by 3.4 µg/m3 (4.4%). As a result, there were 51.3 (95%CI: 32.2, 70.1) thousand fewer premature deaths (16.2 thousand during and 35.1 thousand after the lockdown), and 1066.8 (95%CI: 668.7, 1456.8) thousand fewer YLLs (343.3 thousand during and 723.5 thousand after the lockdown) than these in 2018-2019. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 lockdown has caused substantial decreases in air pollutants except for O3, and that substantial human health benefits can be achieved when strict control measures for air pollution are taken to reduce emissions from vehicles and industries. Stricter tailored policy solutions of air pollution are urgently needed in China and other countries, especially in well-developed industrial regions, such as upgrading industry structure and promoting green transportation.","Chen, Guimin; Tao, Jun; Wang, Jiaqi; Dong, Moran; Li, Xuan; Sun, Xiaoli; Cheng, Shouzhen; Fan, Jingjie; Ye, Yufeng; Xiao, Jianpeng; Hu, Jianxiong; He, Guanhao; Sun, Jiufeng; Lu, Jing; Guo, Lingchuan; Li, Xing; Rong, Zuhua; Zeng, Weilin; Zhou, He; Chen, Dengzhou; Li, Jiali; Yuan, Lixia; Bi, Peng; Du, Qingfeng; Ma, Wenjun; Liu, Tao",Environ Res,,253

344964,Links between air pollution and COVID-19 in England,2021,"In the face of new emerging respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV2, vaccines and drug therapies are not immediately available to curb the spread of infection. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing and social distance, can slow the transmission. However, both mask and social distance have not prevented the spread of respiratory viruses SARS-CoV2 within the US. There is an urgent need to develop an intervention that could reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. The key to preventing transmission is to eliminate the emission of SARS-CoV2 from an infected person and stop the virus from propagating in the human population. Rhamnolipids are environmentally friendly surfactants that are less toxic than the synthetic surfactants. In this study, rhamnolipid products, 222B, were investigated as disinfectants against enveloped viruses, such as bovine coronavirus and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). The 222B at 0.009% and 0.0045% completely inactivated 6 and 4 log PFU/mL of HSV-1 in 5-10 min, respectively. 222B at or below 0.005% is also biologically safe. Moreover, 50 µL of 222B at 0.005% on ~1 cm2 mask fabrics or plastic surface can inactivate ~103 PFU HSV-1 in 3-5 min. These results suggest that 222B coated on masks or plastic surface can reduce the emission of SARS-CoV2 from an infected person and stop the spread of SARS-CoV2.","Jin, Ling; Black, Wendy; Sawyer, Teresa",Viruses,,253
345157,Innovations in Government Management of the Healthcare System: Forecasting of Covid-19 Consequences in Social Investment and Business Development,2020,"This paper develops an empirical and theoretical case for how 'hype' among retail investors can drive large asset fluctuations. We use the dataset of discussions on WallStreetBets (WSB), an online investor forum with over nine million followers as of April 2021, to show how excitement about trading opportunities can ripple through an investor community with large market impacts. This paper finds empirical evidence of psychological contagion among retail investors by exploiting differences in stock price fluctuations and discussion intensity. We show that asset discussions on WSB are self-perpetuating: an initial set of investors attracts a larger and larger group of excited followers. Sentiments about future stock performance also spread from one individual to the next, net of any fundamental price movements. Leveraging these findings, we develop a model for how social contagion impacts prices. The proposed model and simulations show that social contagion has a destabilizing effect on markets. Finally, we establish a causal relationship between WSB activity and financial markets using an instrumental variable approach.","Semenova, Valentina; Winkler, Julian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01847v2.pdf,253

Here, we developed a synthetic soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) DNA-based vaccine candidate, GX-19. In mice, immunization with GX-19 elicited not only S-specific systemic and pulmonary antibody responses but also Th1-biased T cell responses in a dose-dependent manner. GX-19-vaccinated nonhuman primates seroconverted rapidly and exhibited a detectable neutralizing antibody response as well as multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Notably, when the immunized nonhuman primates were challenged at 10 weeks after the last vaccination with GX-19, they had reduced viral loads in contrast to non-vaccinated primates as a control. These findings indicate that GX-19 vaccination provides a durable protective immune response and also support further development of GX-19 as a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2.","Seo, Yong Bok; Suh, You Suk; Ryu, Ji In; Jang, Hwanhee; Oh, Hanseul; Koo, Bon-Sang; Seo, Sang-Hwan; Hong, Jung Joo; Song, Manki; Kim, Sung-Joo; Sung, Young Chul",,,253

However, the exact features of antibody responses that govern COVID-19 disease outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed humoral immune responses in 229 patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 over time to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality. We observed a correlation between anti-spike (S) immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. Although high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed, response, measured by anti-S, anti-receptor-binding domain IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, although sera from 85% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation before 14 d of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral antibody levels per se but, rather, with the delayed kinetics of NAb production.","Lucas, Carolina; Klein, Jon; Sundaram, Maria E; Liu, Feimei; Wong, Patrick; Silva, Julio; Mao, Tianyang; Oh, Ji Eun; Mohanty, Subhasis; Huang, Jiefang; Tokuyama, Maria; Lu, Peiwen; Venkataraman, Arvind; Park, Annsea; Israelow, Benjamin; Vogels, Chantal B F; Muenker, M Catherine; Chang, C-Hong; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Moore, Adam J; Zell, Joseph; Fournier, John B; Wyllie, Anne L; Campbell, Melissa; Lee, Alfred I; Chun, Hyung J; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Schulz, Wade L; Farhadian, Shelli; Dela Cruz, Charles; Ring, Aaron M; Shaw, Albert C; Wisnewski, Adam V; Yildirim, Inci; Ko, Albert I; Omer, Saad B; Iwasaki, Akiko",Nat Med,,253

347516,Awareness of Using Radiology in Diagnosing COVID-19 among Radiological Students,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline nurses have faced extraordinary personal and professional challenges. These challenges have had mental health consequences, and concerning reports of burnout have emerged globally. We conducted a cross-sectional survey at a designated COVID-19 hospital in Shanghai at the peak of the pandemic, i.e. about 2 months after the onset of the outbreak from February to April 2020. Findings revealed burnout in 6.85% of nurses. Of 336 respondents, 87 (25.89%) had a high level of emotional exhaustion, 61 (18.15%) had a high level of depersonalization, and 100 (29.76%) had a low level of personal accomplishment. Burnout can be prevented by offering more support from families and supervisors, paying attention to health monitoring and personal protection, and creating a rational human resource allocation and shift management system. Specific training on infection control and self-protection, mental health guidance, and stress coping techniques must be implemented. As the current health crisis ultimately abates, moving the focus from mental health issues to public health issues, more attention and support at the national and organizational levels are needed to reduce occupational discrimination, nurse autonomy and status need to be promoted, and public health emergency teams need to be created. A positive and fair working environment is essential to effective healthcare delivery.","Zhang, Lin; Chai, Ling; Zhao, Yihong; Wang, Lin; Sun, Wenxiu; Lu, Lingqing; Lu, Hongzhou; Zhang, Jianliang",Biosci Trends,,253
347517,Awareness of Using Radiology in Diagnosing COVID-19 among Radiological Students,2021,"During the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), early reports indicated that certain groups of patients were at risk of developing severe COVID-19 infections. This included patients with arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases [1]. Many of those patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme 1 inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). SARS-CoV2- utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a membrane receptor to enter target cells [2]. Due to different chemical structures with ACE1, ACE2 is insensitive to ACEIs. ACEIs and ARBs may increase the amount of ACE-2 formation and, theoretically, increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, thus inducing inflammation [2]. The fear that ACEI or ARB might facilitate COVID-19 infections and increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection emerged [3]. The question is all the more delicate as arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are very common in the general population, especially in the elderly, for which ACEIs/ARBs are prescribed in 25-30% of cases [4]. In response, many scientific organizations and journals issued statements cautioning against discontinuation of these agents due to the lack of evidence of harm, and because discontinuation would predictably lead to uncontrolled blood pressure with its own cardiovascular disease risks. Moreover, direct evidence from COVID-19-infected patients, taking or not taking these agents, and on which reliable recommendations could be based, was not yet available.","Alexandre, Joachim; Cracowski, Jean-Luc",Fundam. clin. pharmacol,,253
347620,COVID-19 and International Business: A Viewpoint,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical presentation and burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections among medical school physicians and residents, mainly young medical doctors. The awareness of COVID­19 clinical manifestations can improve the early detection of mild cases, possibly reducing further transmission to colleagues and patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in March-May 2020, involving medical school physicians in a teaching hospital in northern Italy, with a working population of 881 medical doctors. Data collection was performed using a structured form investigating clinical and epidemiological information. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two medical doctors contacted the Occupational Health Service reporting acute respiratory symptoms or close contact exposure to a confirmed COVID­19 case. Among the confirmed COVID­19 cases, most were male doctors during residency, and 85% presented a mild clinical picture. Fever (70.3%) and cough (51.4%) represented the most prevalent symptoms of COVID­19. As revealed by the univariate analysis, the prevalence of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity increased with age (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14, p = 0.012), working in a COVID­19 ward (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.09-10.21, p = 0.031), presenting alteration or loss of smell/taste (OR = 10.00, 95%CI: 2.80-35.69, p < 0.001) and myalgia (OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.00-10.26, p = 0.046), while being a resident (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05-0.80, p = 0.030) was associated with reduced odds of being infected, compared to staff physicians. Age and loss of smell/taste were the only factors independently associated with RT-PCR positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID­19 cases showed a mild clinical syndrome, ranging from absence or paucity of symptoms to common cold or influenza-like symptoms. The findings of the present study increase the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis for the prompt identification and management of suspected COVID­19 cases, being particularly useful during resurges of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Independent test evaluations are needed to document the performance with different sample sets. We evaluated six lateral flow assays (LFAs) and two laboratory-based tests (EUROIMMUN-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA and Abbott-Architect-SARS-CoV-2-IgG). We tested 210 plasma samples from 89 patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19. These samples were collected at different time points after the onset of symptoms. In addition, 80 convalescent plasma samples, and 168 pre-pandemic samples collected from adults in the United States and in Africa were tested. LFA performance varied widely, and some tests with high sensitivity had low specificity. LFA sensitivities were low (18.8-40.6%) for samples collected 0 to 3 days after symptom onset, and were greater (80.3-96.4%) for samples collected > 14 days after symptom onset. These results are similar to those obtained by ELISA (15.6% and 89.1%) and chemiluminescent microparticle assay (21.4% and 93.1%). The range of test specificity was between 82.7% and 97%. The combined use of two LFAs can increase specificity to more than 99% without a major loss of sensitivity. Because of suboptimal sensitivity with early COVID-19 samples and background reactivity with some pre-pandemic samples, none of the evaluated tests alone is reliable enough for definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. However, antibody testing may be useful for assessing the status of the epidemic or vaccination campaign. Some of the LFAs had sensitivities and specificities that were comparable to those of more expensive laboratory tests, and these may be useful for seroprevalence surveys in resource-limited settings.","Fischer, Peter U; Fischer, Kerstin; Curtis, Kurt C; Huang, Yuefang; Fetcho, Nicole; Goss, Charles W; Weil, Gary J",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,253

OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and severity of COVID-19 by nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) use among HIV-positive persons receiving ART. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: HIV clinics in 60 Spanish hospitals between 1 February and 15 April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 77 590 HIV-positive persons receiving ART. MEASUREMENTS: Estimated risks (cumulative incidences) per 10 000 persons and 95% CIs for polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. Risk and 95% CIs for COVID-19 diagnosis and hospital admission by use of the NRTIs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/FTC, abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC), and others were estimated through Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Of 77 590 HIV-positive persons receiving ART, 236 were diagnosed with COVID-19, 151 were hospitalized, 15 were admitted to the ICU, and 20 died. The risks for COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization were greater in men and persons older than 70 years. The risk for COVID-19 hospitalization was 20.3 (95% CI, 15.2 to 26.7) among patients receiving TAF/FTC, 10.5 (CI, 5.6 to 17.9) among those receiving TDF/FTC, 23.4 (CI, 17.2 to 31.1) among those receiving ABC/3TC, and 20.0 (CI, 14.2 to 27.3) for those receiving other regimens. The corresponding risks for COVID-19 diagnosis were 39.1 (CI, 31.8 to 47.6), 16.9 (CI, 10.5 to 25.9), 28.3 (CI, 21.5 to 36.7), and 29.7 (CI, 22.6 to 38.4), respectively. No patient receiving TDF/FTC was admitted to the ICU or died. LIMITATION: Residual confounding by comorbid conditions cannot be completely excluded. CONCLUSION: HIV-positive patients receiving TDF/FTC have a lower risk for COVID-19 and related hospitalization than those receiving other therapies. These findings warrant further investigation in HIV preexposure prophylaxis studies and randomized trials in persons without HIV.

In this context, the entire health care workforce must be properly trained to guarantee an effective response. Just-in-time training has been an efficient solution for rapidly equipping health care workers with new knowledge, skills, and attitudes during emergencies; thus, it could also be an effective training technique in the context of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the unexpected magnitude of this health crisis, the health care workforce must be trained in two areas: (1) basic infection prevention and control, including public health skills that are the core of population-based health management and (2) disaster medicine principles, such as surge capacity, allocation of scarce resources, triage, and the ethical dilemmas of rationing medical care. This perspective reports how just-in-time training concepts and methods were applied in a tertiary referral hospital in March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy, one of the hardest hit places in the world.The COVID-19 just-in-time training was designed to provide hospital staff with the competencies they need to work proficiently and safely inside the hospital, including an understanding of the working principles and standard operating procedures in place and the correct use of personal protective equipment. Moreover, this training was intended to address the basic principles of disaster medicine applied to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such training was essential in enabling staff to rapidly attain competencies that most of them lacked because disaster medicine and global health are not included in the curricula of Italian medical and nursing schools. Although a formal evaluation was not performed, this is a useful example of how to create just-in-time training in a large hospital during a crisis of an unprecedented scale.","Ragazzoni, Luca; Barco, Ambra; Echeverri, Lina; Conti, Andrea; Linty, Monica; Caviglia, Marta; Merlo, Federico; Martini, Daniela; Pirisi, Alessandro; Weinstein, Eric; Barone-Adesi, Francesco; Della Corte, Francesco",Acad. med,,253

This review provided strong support for central nervous system (CNS) infection with SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on the neurological mechanism underlying the lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the published data, only 1.28% COVID-19 patients who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF. However, this does not mean the absence of CNS infection in most COVID-19 patients because postmortem studies revealed that some patients with CNS infection showed negative results in CSF tests for SARS-CoV-2. Among 20 neuropathological studies reported so far, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the brain of 58 cases in nine studies, and three studies have provided sufficient details on the CNS infection in COVID-19 patients. Almost all in vitro and in vivo experiments support the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2. In infected animals, SARS-CoV-2 was found within neurons in different brain areas with a wide spectrum of neuropathology, consistent with the reported clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Several lines of evidence indicate that SARS-CoV-2 used the hematopoietic route to enter the CNS. But more evidence supports the trans-neuronal hypothesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been found to invade the brain via the olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal pathways, especially at the early stage of infection. Severe COVID-19 patients with neurological deficits are at a higher risk of mortality, and only the infected animals showing neurological symptoms became dead, suggesting that neurological involvement may be one cause of death.","Liu, Jia-Mei; Tan, Bai-Hong; Wu, Shuang; Gui, Yue; Suo, Jia-Le; Li, Yan-Chao",J. med. virol,,253

A key question is therefore how well pandemic models relate to their implementation contexts. Drawing on the cases of Ebola and influenza, we map how sociological and anthropological research contributes in the modelling of pandemics to consider lessons for COVID-19. We show how models detach from their implementation contexts through their connections with global narratives of pandemic response, and how sociological and anthropological research can help to locate models differently. This potentiates multiple models of pandemic response attuned to their emerging situations in an iterative and adaptive science. We propose a more open approach to the modelling of pandemics which envisages the model as an intervention of deliberation in situations of evolving uncertainty. This challenges the 'business-as-usual' of evidence-based approaches in global health by accentuating all science, within and beyond pandemics, as 'emergent' and 'adaptive'.","Rhodes, Tim; Lancaster, Kari; Lees, Shelley; Parker, Melissa",,,253
350838,Key Lessons in Adapting Interactive Experiences for a COVID-Safe Museum,2021,"CONTEXT: The safe and effective application of psychomotor skills in the clinical environment is a central pillar of the health professions. The current global coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted health professions education (HPE) and has been of particular consequence for routine face-to-face (F2F) skill education for health professionals and clinical students worldwide. What is being experienced on an unprecedented scale parallels a problem familiar to regional, rural and remote health professionals and students: the learners are willing, and the educational expertise exists, but the two are separated by the tyranny of distance. This article considers how the problem of physical distance might be overcome, so that quality skill education might continue. ISSUES: Psychomotor skills are undeniably easier to teach and learn F2F, and training schedules in tertiary, in-service and accredited professional courses reflect this. This aspect of HPE is therefore at significant risk in the context of social distancing and physical isolation. Psychomotor skills are much more complex than the physical motor outputs alone might suggest, and an F2F skill session is only one way to build the complementary aspects of new skill performance. This article argues that educators and course designers can progress with psychomotor skill education from a physical distance. LESSONS LEARNED: Videos can be used to either passively present content to learners or actively engage them. It is the design of the educational activity, rather than the resource medium itself, that enables active engagement. Furthermore, while many training schedules have been adapted to accommodate intensive F2F skill training once it is safe to do so, distributed practice and the need for reflection during the acquisition and development of new skills may challenge the pedagogical effectiveness of this approach. Skill development can be fostered in the absence of F2F teaching, and in the absence of a shared physical space. Embracing the creative licence to do so will improve equitable access to regional, rural and remote clinicians and students well beyond the resolution of the current pandemic.","Seymour-Walsh, Amy E; Weber, Anthony; Bell, Andy; Smith, Tony",Rural Remote Health,,253

A total of 95 otolaryngology consultations were performed from March 1, 2020 to April 26, 2020 (COVID-era) and 363 were performed from September 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020 (pre-COVID-era) at the UPMC Oakland campus. Data collected included patient demographics, COVID-19 status, reason for consult, location of consult, type of consult, procedures performed, need for surgical intervention, length of hospital stay and recommended follow up. RESULTS: Patient populations in the pre-COVID-era and COVID-era were similar in terms of their distribution of demographics and chief complaints. Craniofacial trauma was the most common reason for consultation in both periods, followed by vocal fold and airway-related consults. We saw a 21.5% decrease in the rate of consults seen per month during the COVID-era compared to the 6 months prior. Review of trends in the consult workflow allowed for development of several algorithms to safely approach otolaryngology consults during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Otolaryngology consultations provide valuable services to inpatients and patients in the emergency department ranging from evaluation of routine symptoms to critical airways. Systematic otolaryngology consult service modifications are required in order to reduce risk of exposure to healthcare providers while providing comprehensive patient care.","Dharmarajan, Harish; Belsky, Michael A; Anderson, Jennifer L; Sridharan, Shaum",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,,253
351614,The macroeconomic impact of Trump,2021,"We live and to do so we must breathe and eat, so are we a combination of what we eat and breathe? Here, we will consider this question, and the role in this respect of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Emerging evidence suggests that AMPK facilitates central and peripheral reflexes that coordinate breathing and oxygen supply, and contributes to the central regulation of feeding and food choice. We propose, therefore, that oxygen supply to the body is aligned with not only the quantity we eat, but also nutrient-based diet selection, and that the cell-specific expression pattern of AMPK subunit isoforms is critical to appropriate system alignment in this respect. Currently available information on how oxygen supply may be aligned with feeding and food choice, or vice versa, through our motivation to breathe and select particular nutrients is sparse, fragmented and lacks any integrated understanding. By addressing this, we aim to provide the foundations for a clinical perspective that reveals untapped potential, by highlighting how aberrant cell-specific changes in the expression of AMPK subunit isoforms could give rise, in part, to known associations between metabolic disease, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, sleep-disordered breathing, pulmonary hypertension and acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Evans, A Mark; Hardie, D Grahame",,,253

However, there are still few studies on the integration of Augmented Reality (AR) technology into Blended Learning (BL), particularly on the education of prospective mathematics teachers. This research examines the effect of using augmented reality blended learning during the COVID 19 epidemic on 3D geometry, as well as the learning motivation and attitudes. 15 prospective teachers, including 4 males and 11 females, at one of Indonesia's private universities were engaged in to determine how 3D geometry is understood. Data on learning motivation and attitudes were collected through questionnaires and interviews and analyzed using descriptive statistics and paired-samples t-test. The results show that during the COVID-19 pandemic, augmented reality blended learning facilitates the comprehension of 3D geometry knowledge by prospective teacher applicants and promotes learning motivation and attitudes. Therefore, the use of new technology is significant to prospective teachers' needs, especially during the COVID 19 pandemic, to facilitate their teaching practice in real classrooms. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

Systematic microbiological monitoring of deaths provides a fundamental basis to particularly assess underrecording of community-acquired mortality. It should be further elucidated whether a death cohort of previously unreported cases may be structurally different from the cohort of officially registered cases. Methods: A systematic reverse transcription (RT) qPCR testing for SARS-CoV­2 infections from nasopharyngeal swab samples was carried out. A representative sample of corpses from crematoria and the Institute of Legal Medicine of the Federal State of Hamburg were included. A comparative analysis of primarily reported and unreported fatalities in an 8­week period after occurrence of the first pandemic-related deaths in Hamburg was performed. Results: A total of 1231 deaths were included, all of which were previously unsuspicious for SARS-CoV­2 infection. Thereof 29 cases of previously unknown infections were recorded. In the first phase of the pandemic, incidental findings predominantly occurred among younger people from domestic environments with unclear or unnatural manner of death at the Institute of Legal Medicine. Over time, incidental findings investigated at the crematoria increased, mostly related to nursing home residents. The overall cohort showed no significant sociodemographic differences to a comparative collective of known SARS-CoV­2-associated deaths. Primarily unreported cases showed a significantly lower proportion of COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death. Conclusion: A systematic PCR-based monitoring of deaths allows a more targeted detection and classification of SARS-CoV­2 positive cases. A preventive contribution can be made by disclosing unreported pandemic-related cases of death.","Klein, Anke; Langenwalder, Felicia; Heinrich, Fabian; Meißner, Kira; Schröder, Ann Sophie; Püschel, Klaus; Ondruschka, Benjamin; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Heinemann, Axel",Rechtsmedizin (Berl),,253

Extracellular Cyclophilin A is an emerging inflammatory mediator and metalloproteinase inducer, and the gene responsible for its expression has recently been linked to COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVES: Here we explore the involvement of extracellular Cyclophilin A in the pathophysiology of ventilator-induced lung injury. METHODS: Mice were ventilated with low or high tidal volume for up to 3 hours, with or without blockade of extracellular Cyclophilin A signalling, and lung injury and inflammation were evaluated. Human primary alveolar epithelial cells were exposed to in vitro stretch to explore the cellular source of extracellular Cyclophilin A, and Cyclophilin A levels were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, to evaluate clinical relevance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High tidal volume ventilation in mice provoked a rapid increase in soluble Cyclophilin A levels in the alveolar space, but not plasma. In vivo ventilation and in vitro stretch experiments indicated alveolar epithelium as the likely major source. In vivo blockade of extracellular Cyclophilin A signalling substantially attenuated physiological dysfunction, macrophage activation and matrix metalloproteinases. Finally, we found that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome showed markedly elevated levels of extracellular Cyclophilin A within bronchoalveolar lavage. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophilin A is upregulated within the lungs of injuriously ventilated mice (and critically ill patients), where it plays a significant role in lung injury. Extracellular Cyclophilin A represents an exciting novel target for pharmacological intervention.","Koh, Marissa W; Baldi, Rhianna F; Soni, Sanooj; Handslip, Rhodri; Tan, Ying Ying; O039,; Dea, Kieran P; Malesevic, Miroslav; McAuley, Daniel F; Kane, Cecilia M; Patel, Brijesh V; Takata, Masao; Wilson, Michael R",Am. j. respir. crit. care med,,253

In the era of remote, decentralized and increasingly personalized patient care, catalysed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the cardiovascular community must familiarize itself with the wearable technologies on the market and their wide range of clinical applications. In this Review, we highlight the basic engineering principles of common wearable sensors and where they can be error-prone. We also examine the role of these devices in the remote screening and diagnosis of common cardiovascular diseases, such as arrhythmias, and in the management of patients with established cardiovascular conditions, for example, heart failure. To date, challenges such as device accuracy, clinical validity, a lack of standardized regulatory policies and concerns for patient privacy are still hindering the widespread adoption of smart wearable technologies in clinical practice. We present several recommendations to navigate these challenges and propose a simple and practical 'ABCD' guide for clinicians, personalized to their specific practice needs, to accelerate the integration of these devices into the clinical workflow for optimal patient care.","Bayoumy, Karim; Gaber, Mohammed; Elshafeey, Abdallah; Mhaimeed, Omar; Dineen, Elizabeth H; Marvel, Francoise A; Martin, Seth S; Muse, Evan D; Turakhia, Mintu P; Tarakji, Khaldoun G; Elshazly, Mohamed B","Nat. rev.,Cardiol.

Nurses provide a vital role in mitigating the effects of health crises. In order to help nurses better understand their skills, abilities, and knowledge, as well as the actions that they should take to manage care, the research aims of this study are to (1) investigate the level of preparedness, readiness, and anxiety among nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak in Sabah, Malaysia; (2) examine the effects of various differences in preparedness and readiness among nurses; and (3) examine the effect of COVID-19 preparedness on anxiety among nurses. The results revealed that the nurses were moderately competent in managing the COVID-19 care situation. Each of the 3 differentiating characteristics (age, work experience, and previous disaster experience) did not predict how nurses would manage COVID-19 preparedness significantly. Besides, we also found only 2 dimensions of preparedness (familiarity with epidemiology and surveillance and familiarity with psychological issues) significantly predicted nurses' anxiety levels. Familiarity with epidemiology and surveillance predicted nurses' anxiety positively; in contrast, familiarity with psychological issues negatively influenced nurses' anxiety.","Chua, Bee Seok; Cosmas, Getrude; Arsat, Norkiah",Asia Pac J Public Health,,253

356971,The political economy of COVID-19,2021,"Young children will ultimately need to be vaccinated to stop the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Initial studies of vaccine were performed in adults. Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard. In the COVID-19 pandemic, many questions need to be answered about the ethics and feasibility of these trials. Given the harms of the COVID-19 pandemic and the now-known efficacy of the vaccines in adults and teens, the question of whether clinical equipoise exists for a placebo-controlled trial of vaccines in younger children remains. Parents may be reluctant to enroll children in these trials because they want their child to receive the vaccine or because they are worried about vaccines or clinical trials in general. One option for gathering data on tolerability and efficacy in children would be to use a nonrandomized trial to enroll parents willing to vaccinate their children and those who are hesitant. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such an open-label trial that could provide guidance for future pandemics.

Rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants may jeopardize newly introduced antibody and vaccine countermeasures. Here, using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), animal immune sera, human convalescent sera and human sera from recipients of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, we report the impact on antibody neutralization of a panel of authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants including a B.1.1.7 isolate, chimeric strains with South African or Brazilian spike genes and isogenic recombinant viral variants. Many highly neutralizing mAbs engaging the receptor-binding domain or N-terminal domain and most convalescent sera and mRNA vaccine-induced immune sera showed reduced inhibitory activity against viruses containing an E484K spike mutation. As antibodies binding to spike receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain demonstrate diminished neutralization potency in vitro against some emerging variants, updated mAb cocktails targeting highly conserved regions, enhancement of mAb potency or adjustments to the spike sequences of vaccines may be needed to prevent loss of protection in vivo.","Chen, Rita E; Zhang, Xianwen; Case, James Brett; Winkler, Emma S; Liu, Yang; VanBlargan, Laura A; Liu, Jianying; Errico, John M; Xie, Xuping; Suryadevara, Naveenchandra; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Zost, Seth J; Tahan, Stephen; Droit, Lindsay; Turner, Jackson S; Kim, Wooseob; Schmitz, Aaron J; Thapa, Mahima; Wang, David; Boon, Adrianus C M; Presti, Rachel M; O039,; Halloran, Jane A; Kim, Alfred H J; Deepak, Parakkal; Pinto, Dora; Fremont, Daved H; Crowe, James E; Corti, Davide; Virgin, Herbert W; Ellebedy, Ali H; Shi, Pei-Yong; Diamond, Michael S",Nat Med,,253

However, relatively little is known about the ferret immune system, due in part to a paucity of ferret-reactive reagents. In particular, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are critical in the generation of effective humoral responses in humans, mice and other animal models but to date it has not been possible to identify Tfh in ferrets. Here, we describe the screening and development of ferret-reactive BCL6, CXCR5 and PD-1 monoclonal antibodies. We found two commercial anti-BCL6 antibodies (clone K112-91 and clone IG191E/A8) had cross-reactivity with lymph node cells from influenza-infected ferrets. We next developed two murine monoclonal antibodies against ferret CXCR5 (clone feX5-C05) and PD-1 (clone fePD-CL1) using a single B cell PCR-based method. We were able to clearly identify Tfh cells in lymph nodes from influenza infected ferrets using these antibodies. The development of ferret Tfh marker antibodies and the identification of ferret Tfh cells will assist the evaluation of vaccine-induced Tfh responses in the ferret model and the design of novel vaccines against the infection of influenza and other viruses, including SARS-CoV2.","Jiang, Wenbo; Wong, Julius; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Kelly, Hannah G; Whitney, Paul G; Barr, Ian; Layton, Daniel S; Kent, Stephen J; Wheatley, Adam K; Juno, Jennifer A",Sci Rep,,253

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Emory University School of Medicine. METHODS: A 1-week virtual otolaryngology curriculum was offered to third- and fourth-year medical students that centered on the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's handbook Primary Care in Otolaryngology (fourth edition). The course covered a variety of topics and was conducted remotely via online video conferencing software. We applied multiple teaching modalities and surveyed students regarding the effectiveness of the course. Mixed methods analysis was employed to analyze the course data. RESULTS: Twelve students participated; 67% reported their baseline precourse understanding of otolaryngology in the ""poor-fair"" range. After the course, 92% of students reported increased understanding, with 42% and 58% reporting ""good"" and ""very good"" understanding, respectively. Following completion of the course, posttest scores on summative assessments were significantly higher than pretest scores (P < .001). Ninety-two percent of students reported either ""increased"" or ""greatly increased"" interest in otolaryngology postcourse. Qualitative survey results revealed students' appreciation of course organization, formative assessments, and case-based learning. CONCLUSIONS: An otolaryngology elective administered through a virtual format can be effective at providing an educational experience and garnering interest in the field. Positive exposure to otolaryngology can increase medical students' interest in pursuing the specialty and expand their general knowledge of consultation, diagnosis, and management in otolaryngology.","Steehler, Andrew J; Pettitt-Schieber, Brian; Studer, Matthew B; Mahendran, Geetha; Pettitt, Barbara J; Henriquez, Oswaldo A",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,253

Patients who developed severe forms of COVID-19 presented significantly lower CD3+ (median 344/mm3 (inter quartile range 197; 564) vs. 643/mm3 (397; 1251), and CD8+ T cell counts (124/mm3 (76; 229) vs. 240/mm3 (119; 435). However, activated CD4+ T cells were significantly more frequent in severe forms (2.9% (1.37; 5.72) vs. 1.4% (0.68; 2.35), counterbalanced by a significantly higher proportion of Tregs (3.9% (2.35; 5.87) vs 2.7% (1.9; 3.45)). A marked decrease in the proportion of NK cells was noted only in severe forms. In the B cell compartment, transitional B cells were significantly lower in severe forms (1.2% (0.7; 4.2) vs. 3.6% (2.1; 6.2). Nonetheless, a majority of transplant recipients developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (77% and 83% in mild and severe forms respectively). Thus, our data revealed immunological differences between mild and severe forms of COVID 19 in solid organ transplant recipients, similar to previous reports in the immunocompetent population.","Del Bello, Arnaud; Kamar, Nassim; Vergez, Francois; Faguer, Stanislas; Marion, Olivier; Beq, Audrey; Lathrache, Yasmine; Abravanel, Florence; Izopet, Jacques; Treiner, Emmanuel",Kidney int,,253
362111,Compliance and containment in social distancing: mathematical modeling of COVID-19 across townships,2021,"Timely and accurate laboratory testing is essential for managing the global COVID-19 pandemic. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction remains the gold-standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, but several practical issues limit the test's use. Immunoassays have been indicated as an alternative for individual and mass testing. OBJECTIVES: To access the performance of 12 serological tests for COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a blind evaluation of six lateral-flow immunoassays (LFIAs) and six enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) commercially available in Brazil for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: Considering patients with seven or more days of symptoms, the sensitivity ranged from 59.5% to 83.1% for LFIAs and from 50.7% to 92.6% for ELISAs. For both methods, the sensitivity increased with clinical severity and days of symptoms. The agreement among LFIAs performed with digital blood and serum was moderate. Specificity was, in general, higher for LFIAs than for ELISAs. Infectious diseases prevalent in the tropics, such as HIV, leishmaniasis, arboviruses, and malaria, represent conditions with the potential to cause false-positive results with these tests, which significantly compromises their specificity. CONCLUSION: The performance of immunoassays was only moderate, affected by the duration and clinical severity of the disease. Absence of discriminatory power between IgM/IgA and IgG has also been demonstrated, which prevents the use of acute-phase antibodies for decisions on social isolation.","Cota, Gláucia; Freire, Mariana Lourenço; de Souza, Carolina Senra; Pedras, Mariana Junqueira; Saliba, Juliana Wilke; Faria, Verônica; Alves, Líndicy Leidicy; Rabello, Ana; Avelar, Daniel Moreira",Int J Infect Dis,,253

Influential academics have strongly underlined that, in times of deep crisis, such as the current global health crisis, the long-term workability of legal systems is put to a severe test. In this period, in fact, the protection of health has been given priority, as a precondition that is orientating many current legal choices. Such an unprecedented health emergency has also raised a serious challenge in terms of fundamental rights and liberties. Several basic rights that normally enjoy robust protection under constitutional, supranational, and international guarantees, have experienced a devastating “suspension” for the sake of public health and safety, thus giving rise to a vigorous debate concerning whether and to what extent the pandemic emergency justifies limitations on fundamental rights. The present paper introduces the Special Issue on “The crisis of the religious freedom during the age of COVID-19 pandemic”. Taking as a starting point the valuable contributions of the participants in the Special Issue, it explores analogous and distinctive implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in different legal contexts and underlines the relevance of cooperation between religious and public actors to face a global health crisis.","Madera, Adelaide",Laws,,253

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the CE-approved eazyplex® SARS-CoV-2, a ready-to-use real time RT-LAMP assay for identification of the SARS-CoV-2â¯N and ORF8 genes from swabs in less than 30â¯min without RNA extraction. STUDY DESIGN: Oropharyngeal and nasal swabs from 100 positive and 50 negative patients were inoculated into 0.9 % saline and tested by NeuMoDx&#8482; RT-PCR. An aliquot was diluted fivefold in Copan sputum liquefying (SL) solution and directly analyzed by eazyplex® SARS-CoV-2. In addition, 130 patient swabs were prospectively tested with both methods in parallel. Analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined using virus stock dilutions. RESULTS: Positive percent agreement (PPA) between the eazyplex® SARS-CoV-2 and RT-PCR was 74 % for samples with Ct values < 35. When using a Ct cut-off &#8804; 28 the PPA increased to 97.4 %. In the prospective part of the study overall PPA of the eazyplex® kit was 66.7 % but increased to 100 % when only Ct values &#8804; 28 were considered. There were no false positive results. The median time to positivity was 12.5â¯min for the N gene and 16.75â¯min for ORF8. Analytical sensitivity was 3.75 TCID50/mL. 105 virus copies/mL were reproducibly detected. CONCLUSION: The eazyplex® SARS-CoV-2 is a rapid assay that accurately identifies samples with high viral loads. It may be useful for near-patient testing outside of a molecular diagnostic laboratory.","Egerer, Renate; Edel, Birgit; Löffler, Bettina; Henke, Andreas; Rödel, Jürgen",J Clin Virol,,253

We analyzed data from 46 subjects whose physiological data was collected with Empatica E4 wristband while taking an Implicit Association Test (IAT). Our machine learning and statistical analysis show that implicit bias can be predicted from physiological signals with 76.1% accuracy. Our results also show that the EDA signal associated with skin response has the strongest correlation with racial bias and that there are significant differences between the values of EDA features for biased and unbiased participants.","Nikseresht, Fateme; Yan, Runze; Lew, Rachel; Liu, Yingzheng; M.Sebastian, Rose; Doryab, Afsaneh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01287v1.pdf,253

We aimed to analyze the surgical outcomes of patients submitted to surgery after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Asymptomatic patients that had surgery delayed after preoperative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were matched in a 1:2 ratio for age, type of surgery and American Society of Anesthesiologists to patients with negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: About 1253 patients underwent surgical procedures and were subjected to screening for SARS-CoV-2. Forty-nine cases with a delayed surgery were included in the coronavirus disease (COVID) recovery (COVID-rec) group and were matched to 98 patients included in the COVID negative (COVID-neg) group. Overall, 22 (15%) patients had 30-days postoperative complications, but there was no statistically difference between groups -16.3% for COVID-rec and 14.3% for COVID-neg, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 1.17:95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-3.0; p = .74).

Janzen, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2019, 288 pp",2020,"CONTEXT: In this era of patient-centered care, it is increasingly important for HIV/AIDS care and treatment programs to customize their services according to patients' clinical stage progression and other risk assessments. To enable such customization of HIV care and treatment delivery, the research evidence explaining factors associated with patients' clinical stages is needed. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to produce such scientific evidence by analyzing the most recent data for patients at outpatient clinics in the provinces of Kinshasa and Haut-Katanga and to examine the patient characteristics associated with WHO stages of disease progression. METHODS: Using a quantitative retrospective cohort study design, we analyzed data from 49,460 people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) from 241 HIV/AIDS clinics located in Haut-Katanga and Kinshasa provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We performed Chi-square and multinomial logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A small proportion (i.e., 4.4%) of PLHIV were at WHO's clinical progression stage 4, whereas 30.7% were at clinical stage 3, another 22.9% at stage 2, and the remaining 41.9% were at stage 1, the least severe stage. After controlling for other demographic and clinical factors included in the model, the likelihood of being at stage 1 rather than stage 3 or 4 was significantly higher (at p &#8804; 0.05) for patients with no tuberculosis (TB) than those with TB co-infection (adjusted odds ratio or AOR, 5.73; confidence interval or CI, 4.98-6.59). The odds of being at stage 1 were significantly higher for female patients (AOR, 1.35; CI, 1.29-1.42), and those with the shorter duration on ART (vs. greater than 40.37 months). Patents in rural health zones (AOR, 0.32) and semi-rural health zones (AOR, 0.79) were less likely to be at stage 1, compared to patients in urban health zones. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that TB co-infection raised the risk for PLHIV to be at the severe stages of clinical progression of HIV. Such variation supports the thesis that customized HIV management approaches and clinical regimens may be imperative for this high-risk population. We also found significant variation in HIV clinical progression stages by geographic location and demographic characteristics. Such variation points to the need for more targeted efforts to address the disparities, as the programs attempt to improve the effectiveness of HIV care and treatment. The intersectionality of vulnerabilities from HIV, TB, and COVID-19-related hardships has elevated the need for customized care and treatment even more in the COVID-19 era.","Ewetola, Raimi; Shah, Gulzar H; Maluantesa, Lievain; Etheredge, Gina; Waterfield, Kristie; Mulenga, Astrid; Kilundu, Apolinaire",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,253

It has resulted in multiple fatalities from SARSs all around the world. A year after the global pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported more than 79 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 1.7 million deaths, making it one of the worst and most difficult pandemics encompassed in the modern history. The ongoing triad of escalating infections, mortality, and economic loss has urgently called for recognizing SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanisms as a crucial step in the initial stages of infection and to which possible interventional strategies should be targeted. To mediate host cell infections, Coronaviruses utilize the immunogenic studded spikes glycoproteins on its surface as a key factor for attachment, fusion, and entrance to host cells. Herein, we shed the light on a potential strategy involving disruption of SARS-CoV-2 S protein interaction with host cell receptors through design of neutralizing antibodies targeting receptor binding domain in S1 subunit, small peptide inhibitors, peptide fusion inhibitors against S2, host cell angiotensin converting enzymes 2 (ACE2), and protease inhibitors, aiming to pave the way for controlling viral cell entrance. In this review, we also highlight the recent research advances in the antiviral drugs that target the highly exposed spike protein, aiming to stem the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kamel, Noha A; El Wakeel, Lamia M; Aboshanab, Khaled M",Viral immunol,,253

Therefore, a new assay combining four targets in the form of the new Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV assay was evaluated. The assay was compared to the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2, Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV, Seegene Flu/RSV, influenza A/B r-gene® and RSV/hMPV r-gene®. A total of 295 nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were tested at four institutes throughout Europe including 72 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2, 65 for influenza A, 47 for influenza B, and 77 for RSV. The sensitivity of the new assay was above 95% for all targets, with the highest for SARS-CoV-2 (97.2%). The overall correlation of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values between Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay and Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV assay was high. The agreement between Ct values above 30 showed the multiplex giving higher Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 on average than the singleplex assay. In conclusion, the new assay is a rapid and reliable alternative with less hands-on time for the detection of not one, but four upper respiratory tract pathogens that may circulate at the same time.","Wolters, Femke; Grünberg, Maria; Huber, Michael; Kessler, Harald H; Prüller, Florian; Saleh, Lanja; Fébreau, Christine; Rahamat-Langendoen, Janette; Thibault, Vincent; Melchers, Willem J G",J. med. virol,,253

However, it can present with other rare symptoms. As this disease is a new disease, the full picture of the disease presentation is not yet clear, and it might present with symptoms and signs of other common diseases. Here, we report a 40 year old female who presented with acute onset nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and vague abdominal pain as a clinical picture of appendicitis, but her CT abdomen image showed normal appendix, bilateral patchy peripheral lung basal consolidation, and ground-glass attenuation, so she was tested for coronavirus disease-19, which was positive.","Abdalhadi, Ahmed; Alkhatib, Mohammed; Mismar, Ahmad Y.; Awouda, Waleed; Albarqouni, Loai",IDCases,,253

The aim of this observational, single-center, prospective study was to assess the association between corticosteroids and hospital mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who did not receive IMV (OSCI 3-5). Included were 1,311 COVID-19 patients admitted to nonintensive care wards, and they were divided in two cohorts: (i) 480 patients who received corticosteroid therapy and (ii) 831 patients who did not. The median daily dose was of 8 mg of dexamethasone or equivalent, with a mean therapy duration of 5 (3-9) days. The indication to administer or withhold corticosteroids was given by the treating physician. In-hospital mortality was similar between the two cohorts after adjusting for possible confounders (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.81-1.34, P = 0.74). There was also no difference in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (ORadj 0.81, 95% CI, 0.56-1.17, P = 0.26). COVID-19 patients with noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) had a lower risk for ICU admission if they received steroid therapy (ORadj 0.58, 95% CI, 0.35-0.94, P = 0.03). In conclusion, corticosteroids were overall not associated with a difference in hospital mortality for patients with COVID-19 with OSCI 3-5. In the subgroup of patients with NIMV (OSCI 5), corticosteroids reduced ICU admission, whereas the effect on mortality requires further studies.","Fusina, Federica; Albani, Filippo; Granato, Enza; Meloni, Angelo; Rozzini, Renzo; Sabatini, Tony; Stellini, Roberto; Terragnoli, Paolo; Rosano, Antonio; Abu Hilal, Mohammed; Natalini, Giuseppe",Clin Pharmacol Ther,,253

372995,The Muslim Call to Prayer in Canada's Pandemic Soundscape,2020,"BACKGROUND: The United Kingdom entered 'lockdown' on the 23 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in school closures forcing children to remain at home. Dental-facial trauma was still likely to be common place due to falls and injuries exercising. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice in a paediatric population in a tertiary care hospital and a linked Dental Institute. METHOD: A proforma was designed to capture the demographics, presenting complaints, type of dental-facial injury, treatment need and the treatment received for all paediatric patients presenting face to face with dental-facial trauma to King's College Hospital during the 'lockdown' period (23 March- 14 June 2020). RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty calls were triaged, converting to 102 patients seen face-to-face for dental-facial trauma. The remainder were able to be triaged 'virtually'. Injuries seen included 56 (54.9%) dentoalveolar injuries, 37 (36.2%) lacerations, five (4.9%) suspected facial fractures and four (3.9%) dog bites. Males and females were equally affected. The majority of incidents occurred in the home environment (n = 60, 58.8%), with the remainder (n = 42, 41.2%) occurring outside the home environment. The main causes of dental-facial trauma were falls (n = 47, 46.1%) and bicycles/scooters (n = 29, 28.4%). The most common type of dentoalveolar injury was lateral luxation (n = 15, 26.7%), followed by avulsion (n = 12, 21.4%). Only one child required treatment under general anaesthesia (GA). CONCLUSION: The demographic, presenting complaints and treatment needs of patients who presented during the lockdown period with dental-facial trauma were unusual. The overwhelming majority were able to be treated without the use of GA. The attendance protocol in a tertiary care setting and the use of 'teledentistry' ensured only the most severe trauma cases were seen. This highlights how more complex trauma can still occur during 'lockdown' and requires immediate management.","Ilyas, Nabeel; Green, Alexandra; Karia, Rishikesh; Sood, Sanjeev; Fan, Kathleen",Dent Traumatol,,253
373330,Pestis: The collective challenges of epidemics,2021,"The novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) has become the reason for the world to declare it as a global pandemic, which has already taken many lives from all around the world. This pandemic has become a disaster since the spreading rate from person to person is incredibly high and many techniques have come forth to aid in stopping the infection. Although various types of methods have been put into implementation, the search and suggestions of new approaches to reduce the increasing rate of infection will never come to an end until a vaccine terminates this pandemic. This study focuses on proposing a new framework that is based on Deep Learning algorithms for recognizing the COVID-19 cases, mostly in public places. The algorithms include Background Subtraction for extracting the foreground of thermal images from thermal videos generated by Thermal Cameras through the Thermal Imaging process and the Convolutional Neural Network for detecting people infected with the virus. This automated prototype works in a real-time scenario that helps identify people with the disease and will try to trace it while separating them from having any other contact. This proposal intends to achieve a satisfying growth in determining the real cases of COVID-19 and minimize the spreading rate of this virus to the max, ultimately avoiding more deaths.","Peddinti, Bharati; Shaikh, Amir; K R, Bhavya; K C, Nithin Kumar",Biomed Signal Process Control,,253

Many classes were converted into e-learning formats. But not all learning content and outcomes can readily be transferred into digital space. Project outline: Emergency medicine teaching relies on hands-on simulation training. Therefore, we had to devise a catalogue of measures, that would enable us to offer simulation training for Advanced Life Support. Summary of work: Strict hygienic rules including disinfection of hands, wearing personal protective gear at all times and disinfection of equipment were implemented. Group size and number of staff was reduced, introducing fixed student teams accompanied by the same teacher. Only large rooms with good ventilation were used. Under these conditions, we were allowed to carry out core Advanced Life Support simulations. Other content had to be transferred to online platforms. Discussion: Heeding general hygiene advise and using personal protective gear, a central cluster of simulations was carried out. Students and staff adhered to rules without complaint. No infections within faculty or student body were reported. Conclusion: It seems feasible to conduct core simulations under strict hygienic protocol.","Gintrowicz, Robert; Pawloy, Klemens; Degel, Antje",GMS J Med Educ,,253

374662,A two-step vaccination technique to limit COVID-19 spread using mobile data,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The majority of patients with COVID-19 infection do not progress to pneumonia. We report emergency department (ED)-specific variables and evaluate their predictive performance on diagnosis of pneumonia, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centre cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a Singapore tertiary hospital. Primary outcome was diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission and/or death. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse the predictive performance of ED-specific variables. Accuracy of continuous variables was measured by area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: 294 patients were included. Patients with pneumonia were older (52.0 years, p < 0.001) and had higher C-reactive protein (CRP; 33.8 mg/L, p < 0.001). Patients with indeterminate chest radiograph (CRX) findings were at risk of pneumonia vs. patients with normal CRX (37.5% vs. 4.3%, p < 0.001). Patients admitted to ICU were older (60.0 years, p < 0.001) and had higher CRP (40.0 mg/L, p < 0.001). Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with ICU admission and death (30.0% vs 0.39%, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (aOR 1.07, p = 0.049), CRP (aOR 1.05, p = 0.006) and CRX findings (aOR 50.00, p < 0.001) had increased odds of pneumonia. ROC curve analysis showed that CRP of 23.3 mg/L was the optimal cut-off for predicting pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Older age, higher CRP and CRX findings are associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, ICU admission and death. Prospective studies should be undertaken to validate these findings.","Tan, Hann-Yee; Yeo, Mathew; Tay, Xin-Ying; Fung, Michael; Kumar, Ranjeev; Ooi, Say-Tat; Amirah, Lina; Ubeynarayana, Chalani Udhyami; Mao, Desmond",Singap. med. j,,253

METHODS: Overall hospital blood use and medical records of adult patients with COVID-19 were extracted for two institutions. Multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to estimate associations between the outcomes transfusion and mortality and patient factors. RESULTS: Daily blood use decreased compared to pre-COVID-19 levels; the effect was more significant for platelets (29% and 34%) compared to red blood cells (25% and 20%) at the two institutions, respectively. Surgical and oncologic services had a decrease in average daily use of platelets of 52% and 30%, and red blood cells of 39% and 25%, respectively. A total of 128 patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized, and 13 (10%) received at least one transfusion due to anemia secondary to chronic illness (n = 7), recent surgery (n = 3), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 3). Lower baseline platelet count and admission to the intensive care unit were associated with increased risk of transfusion. The blood group distribution in patients with COVID-19 was 37% group O, 40% group A, 18% group B, and 5% group AB. Non-type O was not associated with increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic included changes in routine hospital operations that allowed for the provision of a sufficient level of care for patients with and without COVID-19. Although blood type may play a role in COVID-19 susceptibility, it did not seem to be associated with patient mortality.","Pagano, Monica B; Cataife, Guido; Fertrin, Kleber Yotsumoto; Gernsheimer, Terry; R Hess, John; Staley, Elizabeth; Clark, Christine; Senn, Nina; Tuott, Erin; C Tsang, Hamilton",Transfusion,,253

Antibodies used show pronounced differences in cross-reactivities with these circulating fragments, which still need to be better characterized on a molecular level. To pave the way for advanced quantitative assays in the future, it is critical to fully understand these circulating forms. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 8 heart failure (HF) patients and 2 healthy controls. NT-proBNP and proBNP were purified by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by nano-flow liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Fragments formed during proteolysis in solution digestion were distinguished from naturally occurring peptides by using an 18O stable isotope labeling strategy. RESULTS: We detected 16 previously unknown circulating fragments of proBNP peptides (9 of which are located in the N-terminal and 7 in the C-terminal region), revealing a more advanced state of degradation than previously known. Two of these fragments are indicative of either unidentified processing modes or a far-reaching C-terminal degradation (or a combination thereof) of the precursor proBNP. CONCLUSIONS: Our results further restrict ideal target epitopes for immunoassay antibodies and expand the current thinking of diversity, degradation, and processing of proBNP, as well as the distribution of circulating forms.","Amplatz, Benno; Sarg, Bettina; Faserl, Klaus; Hammerer-Lercher, Angelika; Mair, Johannes; Lindner, Herbert H",Clin. chem,,253
376251,Re: Links between air pollution and COVID-19 in England,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The recent Sars-Cov-2 pandemic (COVID-19) has led to growing research to explain the poor clinical prognosis in some patients. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: While early observational studies highlighted the role of the virus in lung failure, in a second moment thrombosis emerged as a possible explanation of the worse clinical course in some patients. Despite initial difficulties in management of such patients, the constant increase of literature in the field is to date clarifying some questions from clinicians. However, several other questions need answer. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A novel disease (Covid-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was responsible for thousands of hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory syndrome, with several cases of thrombotic complications due to excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. Covid-19 and hospitalizations for Covid-19 may carry several potential risk factors for thrombosis. Severe coagulation abnormalities may occur in almost all of the severe and critical ill COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a strong pathophysiological rationale, the evidences in literature are not enough to recommend an aggressive antithrombotic therapy in COVID- 19. However, it is our opinion that an early use, even at home at the beginning of the disease, could improve the clinical course.","Casale, Matteo; Dattilo, Giuseppe; Imbalzano, Egidio; Gigliotti De Fazio, Marianna; Morabito, Claudia; Mezzetti, Maurizio; Busacca, Paolo; Signorelli, Salvatore S; Brunetti, Natale D; Correale, Michele",Panminerva med,,253

378072,COVID-19 as a catalyst for educational change,2020,A recent outbreak of endemic disease speeded by a virus whose genome is similar to that of SARS and MERS which outbreak in 2002 and 2012 respectively. All these are zoonotic infection which means these has transmitted from animal to human. Another similarity amongst these infections is that bat is supposed to be primary reservoir for these viruses. 2019-nCoV was reported by WHO on 31 December 2020 which is spreading with alarming rate. WHO has considered this infection as pandemic which means that if the infection is misled then it will spread fear and will cause unnecessary suffering and death. The onset of infection shows general symptoms of flu which later on develops to pneumonia. The main challenge of the infection is that a defined vaccine or medicine is still under trial. Treatment is done on the basis of symptoms and recovery is dependent on the immune response of the patients. This review article is based on meta-analysis of the data where the relation between reproduction number (R0) and infection rate is well depicted. Most of the countries has R0 > 1 which says the infection is epidemic. Symptoms and possible treatment till date is well defined in this paper. Though the COVID-19 virus has changed its strain and came up with asymptomatic infection which is more challenging.

Most of the literature show that the elevated liver enzymes in COVID-19 are of little clinical significance. Lower albumin level is seen in severe COVID-19 and is not parallel to the changes in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels. We aimed to explore the impact of hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19. This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. The relationship between hypoalbuminemia and death was studied using binary logistic analysis. A total of 299 adult patients were included, 160 (53.5%) were males and the average age was 53.4 ± 16.7 years. The median time from the onset of illness to admission was 3 days (interquartile ranges, 2-5). Approximately one-third of the patients had comorbidities. Hypoalbuminemia (<35 g/L) was found in 106 (35.5%) patients. The difference in albumin was considerable between survivors and non-survivors (37.6 ± 6.2 vs 30.5 ± 4.0, P < .001). Serum albumin level was inversely correlated to white blood cell (r = -.149, P = .01) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (r = -.298, P < .001). Multivariate analysis showed the presence of comorbidities (OR, 6.816; 95% CI, 1.361-34.133), lymphopenia (OR, 13.130; 95% CI, 1.632-105.658) and hypoalbuminemia (OR, 6.394; 95% CI, 1.315-31.092) were independent predictive factors for mortality. In conclusion, hypoalbuminemia is associated with the outcome of COVID-19. The potential therapeutic value of albumin infusion in COVID-19 should be further explored at the earliest.","Huang, Jiaofeng; Cheng, Aiguo; Kumar, Rahul; Fang, Yingying; Chen, Gongping; Zhu, Yueyong; Lin, Su",J. med. virol,,253

This study aimed to investigate Twitter use during natural hazards and pandemics. The included studies reported the role of Twitter in disasters triggered by natural hazards. Electronic databases were used for a comprehensive literature search to identify the records that match the mentioned inclusion criteria published through May 2020. Forty-five articles met the selection criteria and were included in the review. These indicated ten functions of Twitter in disasters, including early warning, dissemination of information, advocacy, assessment, risk communication, public sentiment, geographical analysis, charity, collaboration with influencers and building trust. Preventing the spread of misinformation is one of the most important issues in times of disaster, especially pandemics. Sharing accurate, transparent and prompt information from emergency organizations and governments can help. Moreover, analyzing Twitter data can be a good way to understand the mental state of the community, estimate the number of injured people, estimate the points affected by disasters and model the prevalence of epidemics. Therefore, various groups such as politicians, government, nongovernmental organizations, aid workers and the health system can use this information to plan and implement interventions.","Seddighi, Hamed Salmani Ibrahim Seddighi Saeideh",Journalism and Media,,253

Health policies and systems need to be aligned with the values, principles and strategies of health promotion and investment made in strengthening essential health promotion functions. This paper considers how transformative health promotion can be advanced, by reflecting critically on what progress needs to be made and the structures and processes that are required to strengthen health promotion at a systems level. Progress in implementing health promotion is variable, and there is a general lack of investment in developing the necessary health promotion systems for substantive progress to be made. Key enablers and system requirements for comprehensive health promotion are examined, including the following critical elements: (i) effective advocacy for the concept and practice of health promotion; (ii) enabling policy structures for universal health promotion actions on a cross-sectoral basis; (iii) effective implementation systems, support mechanisms and workforce capacity for multisectoral health promotion action; (iv) investment in innovative research methods and knowledge translation to inform transformative health promotion approaches. In strengthening capacity to implement transformative health promotion actions, political will needs to be mobilized to ensure that dedicated and sustainable funding is made available, and the organizational and workforce capacity to deliver effective health promotion interventions is in place. The International Union for Health Promotion and Education (IUHPE) plays a central role in advancing transformative health promotion through mobilising and supporting its global members and partners in strengthening health promotion systems.","Barry, Margaret M",Glob Health Promot,,253
382524,Coronavirus in the era of digital connectivity: Opportunities and challenges,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus causing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), with an estimated 22 million people infected worldwide so far although involving primarily the respiratory tract, has a remarkable tropism for the liver and the biliary tract. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and no antecedent liver disease may display evidence of cytolytic liver damage, proportional to the severity of COVID-19 but rarely of clinical significance. The mechanism of hepatocellular injury is unclear and possibly multifactorial. The clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with underlying chronic liver disease, a cohort whose global size is difficult to estimate, has been assessed appropriately only recently and data are still evolving. Patients with cirrhosis are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and worse liver-related outcomes as compared to those with non-cirrhotic liver disease. OLT patients have an intermediate risk. Specific interventions in order to reduce the risk of transmission of infection among this high-risk population have been outlined by international societies, together with recommendations for modified treatment and follow-up regimens during the COVID-19 pandemic. When a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 becomes available, patients with fibrotic liver disease and those with OLT should be considered as prime targets for prophylaxis of COVID-19, as all other highly susceptible subjects.","Cabibbo, Giuseppe; Rizzo, Giacomo Emanuele Maria; Stornello, Caterina; Craxì, Antonio",J. viral hepat,,253

We use the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, as a case to show the use of social media as a key mechanism in shaping the actions of the central government in its coordination with the local governments during the pandemic response. The Chinese government effectively collaborated with a social media platform to not only create a dedicated channel to allow citizens to post information about the pandemic to accelerate the speed of relief but also mobilize citizens and nonprofit organizations to support government response and recovery efforts. This suggests that social media can provide a venue for the government to not only tackle the information overload but also mitigate the friction among levels of governments.","Li, Yiran; Chandra, Yanto; Kapucu, Naim",Am.

Myocarditis from other viral pathogens can evolve into overt or subclinical myocardial dysfunction, and sudden death has been described in the convalescent phase of viral myocarditis. This raises concerns for patients recovering from COVID-19. Some patients will have subclinical and possibly overt cardiovascular abnormalities. Patients with ostensibly recovered cardiac function may still be at risk of cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias. Screening for residual cardiac involvement in the convalescent phase for patients recovered from COVID-19-associated cardiac injury is needed.

To identify characteristics of workers and industries where particular concerns are more common. Method Prospective cohort study of 1063 employed Australian adults, enrolled at the start of the pandemic. Data on attitudes to workplaces reopening were collected 1 July-30 September 2020. The frequency of concerns describes infection risk and changes to work and impact on home life. Regression models examined associations between demographic and industry factors with reopening concerns. Results More than four in five (82.4%) of workers reported concerns about workplace infection risk. Just over half (53.4%) reported concerns about impacts to work and home life. Concerns were more prevalent for workers reporting psychological distress, financial stress, and among those exclusively working from home. Concerns regarding infection risk were common for workers in health care (IRR 1.16, 95% CI [1.01, 1.33]), retail (IRR 1.31, 95% CI [1.06, 1.61]), and accommodation/food service industries (IRR 1.25, 95% CI [1.01, 1.55]). Concerns regarding changes to work and home life were more common for female workers (IRR 1.24, 95% CI [1.07, 1.43]), and partners/spouses with dependent children (IRR 1.44, 95% CI [1.16, 1.79]). Conclusion Concerns of COVID-19 infection in the workplace are common. Many workers are also concerned about changes to their work and home life. The prevalence of concerns is related to the nature of work and responsibilities at home. Actions that reduce risk of workplace transmission, coupled with effective communication of infection controls, may alleviate worker concerns whilst recognising workers' family and social circumstances.","Griffiths, Daniel; Sheehan, Luke; van Vreden, Caryn; Whiteford, Peter; Collie, Alex",J. occup. rehabil,,253

Brazil concentrates now the largest number of cases in the continent and, as the disease speedily progressed throughout the country, prompt and challenging operational strategies had to be taken by institutions caring for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients in order to assure optimal workflows, triage, and management. Although hospitals in the USA, Europe and Asia have shared their experience on this subject, little has been discussed about such strategies in South America or by the perspective of outpatient centers, which are paramount in the radiology field. This article shares the guidelines adopted early in the pandemic by a nationwide outpatient healthcare center composed by a network of more than 200 patient service centers and nearly 2,000 radiologists in Brazil, discussing operational and patient management strategies, staff protection, changes adopted in the fellowship program, and the effectiveness of such measures.","Torres, Ulysses S; Kerbauy, Daniella M B; Barrancos, Janaína T G; D039,; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Lázari, Carolina S; Granato, Celso Francisco H; Rizzatti, Edgar Gil; Meirelles, Gustavo S P",Medicine (Baltimore),,253

Given the rapid acceleration of new cases and the common sense of global urgency, COVID-19 is subject to thorough measurement on a country-by-country basis. The world is witnessing an increasing demand for reliable data and impactful information on the novel disease. Can we trust the data on the COVID-19 spread worldwide? This study aims to assess the reliability of COVID-19 global data as disclosed by local authorities in 202 countries. It is commonly accepted that the frequency distribution of leading digits of COVID-19 data shall comply with Benford's law. In this context, the author collected and statistically assessed 106,274 records of daily infections, deaths, and tests around the world. The analysis of worldwide data suggests good agreement between theory and reported incidents. Approximately 69% of countries worldwide show some deviations from Benford's law. The author found that records of daily infections, deaths, and tests from 28% of countries adhered well to the anticipated frequency of first digits. By contrast, six countries disclosed pandemic data that do not comply with the first-digit law. With over 82 million citizens, Germany publishes the most reliable records on the COVID-19 spread. In contrast, the Islamic Republic of Iran provides by far the most non-compliant data. The author concludes that inconsistencies with Benford's law might be a strong indicator of artificially fabricated data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by local authorities. Partially consistent with prior research, the United States, Germany, France, Australia, Japan, and China reveal data that satisfies Benford's law. Unification of reporting procedures and policies globally could improve the quality of data and thus the fight against the deadly virus.","Farhadi, Noah",Sci Prog,,253

Approach: We built a predictive model based on a supervised hybrid neural network utilizing a three-dimensional convolutional neural network to perform volume analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and integration of nonimaging clinical data at the fully connected layer of the architecture. The experiments are conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Results: Experimental results confirm that there is a correlation between cognitive decline and the data obtained at the first visit. The system achieved an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.70 for cognitive decline class prediction. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts ""slowly deteriorating/stable"" or ""rapidly deteriorating"" classes by processing routinely collected baseline clinical and demographic data [baseline MRI, baseline mini-mental state examination (MMSE), scalar volumetric data, age, gender, education, ethnicity, and race]. The training data are built based on MMSE-rate values.

387615,How to prevent a global food and nutrition security crisis under COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to phthalate esters may be linked to the risk of high blood pressure (HBP), but limited evidence is available in Chinese children. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between nine phthalate metabolites (mPAEs) and systolic/diastolic BP, pulse pressure (PP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and the risk of HBP. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 1044 primary school children (6-8 years old) were enrolled from Shenzhen, China, between 2016 and 2017. Nine mPAEs were analyzed from urine using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. A multivariable linear regression model was used to explore the associations between phthalate exposure and systolic/diastolic BP, PP, and MAP. A binary logistic regression model was used to examine the associations between phthalate exposure and the risk of HBP. RESULTS: Monomethyl phthalate (MMP) concentrations were significantly higher in HBP children than normal BP children. MMP, monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobutyl phthalate (MnBP), mono(5-carboxy-2-ethylpentyl) phthalate, mono-[(2-carboxy methyl)hexyl] phthalate (MCMHP), the sum of four short-chain mPAEs (&#8721;LMW), and the sum of all nine mPAEs (&#8721;9mPAEs) were significantly positively associated with increases in systolic BP z-score, while only MMP was significantly positively associated with diastolic BP z-score. MMP, MiBP, MnBP, MCMHP, &#8721;LMW, and &#8721;9mPAEs were significantly associated with increases in PP, while MMP and MnBP were significantly associated with increases in MAP. MMP was significantly associated with the risk of HBP, with an odds ratio of 1.87 (95% CI: 1.23, 2.85). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that dimethyl phthalate exposure increases the risk of HBP. And some types of phthalates are associated with elevations in systolic/diastolic BP z scores, PP, and MAP in Chinese children.","Yao, Yao; Chen, Ding-Yan; Yin, Jiang-Wei; Zhou, Li; Cheng, Jin-Quan; Lu, Shao-You; Li, Hong-Hua; Wen, Ying; Wu, Yu",Environ Int,,253

A review of prior research and data trends after the great financial crisis,2020,"PURPOSE: To identify differences in the radiological findings of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) among patients classified by severity of neutropenia, and differences in underlying disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed computed tomography (CT) scans from the time of the diagnosis of IPA in 83 hematological malignancy patients with probable or proven IPA according to the EORTC-MSG criteria. We evaluated CT findings (radiological pattern, number of lesions, distribution, and presence of low attenuation area [LAA]), and compared the radiological findings of patients classified by degree of neutropenia with two different indicators (neutrophil count at the onset, and c-d-index) and underlying disease. RESULTS: Neutropenia at the onset of IPA was associated with an increased frequency of LAA (p < 0.05), especially in FN (p < 0.01). Cases with a c-d-index of â§5500 showed an increased incidence of the angio-invasive pattern. In contrast, cases with a c-d-index of 0 showed an increased incidence of the airway-invasive pattern (p < 0.05). The airway-invasive pattern was more frequent in cases with MM, while the angio-invasive pattern was more frequent in cases with AML (p < 0.01). Lower-predominant distribution was more frequent and random distribution was less frequent in cases with AML, random distribution was more frequent and lower-predominant distribution was less frequent in cases with ALL, and upper-predominant distribution was more frequent in cases with MDS (p < 0.05).

388177,Informative Contagion: The Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Italian journalism,2020,"BACKGROUND: Rapid spread of COVID-19 forced the public to turn to community pharmacies as the most accessible points of primary healthcare, overloading pharmacy services. The objectives of this research were to detect and describe the changes in work environment of community pharmacists in Vojvodina during the state of emergency due to COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic effects on job related stress were assessed. METHODS: Community pharmacists from Vojvodina completed an online questionnaire on work environment changes related to COVID-19 (cross-sectional study). RESULTS: Out of the 1574 licenced pharmacists in Vojvodina, 392 completed the survey. Workload increase, reported by 90.8% of pharmacists, was caused mostly by higher demand for safety equipment, antiseptics and disinfectants, dietary products and medicines. Most pharmacists (93.1%) considered pharmacy workflow to be more complex than before the pandemic. Clients' behavior was described as less pleasant since the start of the pandemic by 67.6% of the community pharmacists. Many were concerned for their health and the health of their families (68.9%). Community pharmacists rated their stress levels higher if they i) were working in larger chains, ii) experienced clients' behavior as less pleasant or/and iii) were concerned for their/their family health. CONCLUSIONS: Current research pointed out the need for a more robust healthcare system which would allow rapid introduction of new activities and roles for community pharmacists that could possibly decrease job-related stress. Legal steps to improve the work environment in community pharmacies are necessary and urgent in order to fully utilize their skills and knowledge.","Jovicic-Bata, Jelena; Pavlovic, Nebojsa; Milosevic, Natasa; Gavaric, Neda; Golocorbin-Kon, Svetlana; Todorovic, Nemanja; Lalic-Popovic, Mladena",BMC Health Serv Res,,253
388513,Multivocality of Saudi COVID-19 discourse in social media posts: A socio-semiotic multimodal perspective,2020,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic infection in March 2020. As of December 2020, two COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but there are no effective drugs to treat COVID-19, and pandemic mitigation efforts like physical distancing have had acute social and economic consequences. In this perspective, we discuss how the proteomic research community can leverage technologies and expertise to address the pandemic by investigating four key areas of study in SARS-CoV-2 biology. Specifically, we discuss how (1) mass spectrometry-based structural techniques can overcome limitations and complement traditional structural approaches to inform the dynamic structure of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, complexes, and virions; (2) virus-host protein-protein interaction mapping can identify the cellular machinery required for SARS-CoV-2 replication; (3) global protein abundance and post-translational modification profiling can characterize signaling pathways that are rewired during infection; and (4) proteomic technologies can aid in biomarker identification, diagnostics, and drug development in order to monitor COVID-19 pathology and investigate treatment strategies. Systems-level high-throughput capabilities of proteomic technologies can yield important insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology that are urgently needed during the pandemic, and more broadly, can inform coronavirus virology and host biology.","Haas, Paige; Muralidharan, Monita; Krogan, Nevan J; Kaake, Robyn M; Hüttenhain, Ruth",J Proteome Res,,253

Sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 cases in Mexico began after the confirmation of the first patient with community transmission. Methods: This epidemiologic, cross-sectional study includes all clinically suspected, and laboratory-confirmed cases nationwide from the beginning of the outbreak to 21 April 2020. State-cluster demographic data and health indicators were analyzed in reference to epidemiologic measures, with logistic regressions for the dependent variables of incidence, confirmation, and lethality. Results: The national incidence was 13.89/100,000 inhabitants with a 6.52% overall lethality and a confirmed-case mortality of 11.1%. The incidence variation significantly correlated with migration, but not urbanization. Pediatric patients were less prone to be tested (OR = -3.92), while geriatric individuals were a priority. State lethality positively correlated with the proportion of the population assisted at public hospitals and correlated inversely to the number of hospitals and clinics in the state. Conclusions: Migration strongly correlated with incidence; elderly patients had lower odds of being hospitalized but were likely to die. Patients aged <15 were less prone to be laboratory-confirmed. Case confirmation was not performed in all hospitalized patients, but 72.15% of hospitalized patients had favorable outcomes to date.","Mendez-Dominguez, Nina; Alvarez-Baeza, Alberto; Carrillo, Genny",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,253

METHODS: Eighty cases of COVID-19 diagnosed from January 24 to February 17, 2020 in Beijing YouAn Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University were retrospectively analyzed. All 80 patients received symptomatic and supportive treatment. Among them, 44 patients took Jinhua Qinggan granules (treatment group) within 24 h of admission, and the remaining 36 patients either did not take Jinhua Qinggan granules or took the granules for less than 2 d (control group). In this study, we compared the duration of viral nucleic acid detection and of pneumonia absorption improvement between the two groups. RESULTS: Among the 80 cases, 37 were male (46%) and 43 were female (54%) with age ranging from 15 to 86 years, with an average age of 51.19 years. The average duration of viral nucleic acid detection was (7 ± 4) d in the Jinhua Qinggan administration group and (10 ± 4) d for the control group (P = 0.010), following which, nucleic acid tests were negative. Of the two groups, 56.82% in the Jinhua Qinggan treatment group and 27.78% in the control group demonstrated negative nucleic acid tests within 7 d or less. The 7-day viral clearance rate was significantly higher in the Jinhua Qinggan group compared with the control group (P = 0.009). Furthermore, the pneumonia recovery time indicated by chest CT was (8 ± 4) d in the Jinhua Qinggan group, which was significantly shorter than the control group, at (10 ± 5) d (P = 0.021). No adverse reactions were found in the treatment group after taking this medicine. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, Jinhua Qinggan granules can effectively shorten the duration of nucleic acid detection and promote the absorption of pneumonia inflammatory exudate without obvious adverse reactions.","Liu, Zengli; Li, Xiuhui; Gou, Chunyan; Li, Li; Luo, Xiaolan; Zhang, Chun; Zhang, Yin; Zhang, Jiaying; Jin, Aihua; Li, Hongyan; Zeng, Yuan; Li, Tongzeng; Wang, Xiaoju",J Tradit Chin Med,,253

In the absence of a cure or vaccine of COVID-19, the national governments and public health authorities have been aggressively utilizing digital technologies to mitigate the pandemic spread. Given the urgency caused by COVID-19, this study highlights the importance of considering a country's national culture in evaluating the efficacy of a given digital technology, despite how promising or groundbreaking it may sound, in combating the spread of an infectious disease. Relying on the two critical dimensions of national culture, power distance and individualism/collectivism, this study proposes a framework that describes how people from different countries, depending on their prevalent national cultural values, would be receptive (or intolerant) to using government-run technology solutions meant for curbing the pandemic spread.","Gupta, Manjul; Shoja, Amin; Mikalef, Patrick",Ann Oper Res,,253

AutoDock Vina is used for molecular docking. Through our research, the binding affinity of saquinavir and raltegravir to the protein is higher than other candidate drugs in molecular docking; they are -9.1 kcal/mol and -9 kcal/mol, respectively. Among them remdesivir performance was mediocre, only -7.9 kcal/mol. In our study, ultimately, these systems are also basically stable. The overall contraction of the protein structure is most obvious after the combination of remdesivir. In the remdesivir-protein system, the structure of the terminal end has undergone relatively large changes. And the total number of hydrogen bonds formed in the remdesivir-protein system is larger. The hydrogen bonds can be maintained for a longer time, and the final interaction energy is stronger than other systems. These amino acid sequence fragments have high affinity with the remdesivir molecule. Remdesivir can change the structure of the protein to make it stronger in binding with itself through the interaction with the protein. The simulation study of drug screening for new coronaviruses can provide further support for new coronavirus effective drugs and provide powerful support to defeat the virus.","Zhao, Xiaomeng; Liu, Ruixia; Miao, Zhi; Ye, Nan; Lu, Wenyu",J. comput. biol,,253

Lack of vaccine and specific anti-viral drugs started a global health disaster. For a sustained control and protection, development of potential anti-viral drugs is one of the targeted approach. Although, designing and developing a panel of new drugs molecules are always encouraged. However, in the current emergency, drug repurposing study is one of the most effective and fast track option. The crystal structure of a SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) has recently been deciphered through X-ray crystallography. The single-chain of core RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase relies on virus-encoded cofactors nsp7 and two units of nsp8 for its optimum function. This study explored the FDA approved database of 7922 molecules and screened against the core polymerase along with cofactors. Here we report a panel of FDA approved drugs that show substantial interactions with key amino acid residues of the active site. Interestingly, some of the identified drugs (Ornipressin, Lypressin, Examorelin, Polymyxin B1) bind strongly within the binding pockets of both forms of RdRp. Besides, we found strong candidates for the complex form as well which include Nacortocin, Cistinexine, Cisatracurium (among others).

Notably, COVID-19 is characterized by systemic inflammation. However, the potential mechanisms of the ""cytokine storm"" of COVID-19 are still limited. In this study, fourteen peripheral blood samples from COVID-19 patients (n = 10) and healthy donors (n = 4) were collected to perform the whole-transcriptome sequencing. Lung tissues of COVID-19 patients (70%) presenting with ground-glass opacity. Also, the leukocytes and lymphocytes were significantly decreased in COVID-19 compared with the control group (p < 0.05). In total, 25,482 differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DE mRNA), 23 differentially expressed microRNAs (DE miRNA), and 410 differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs (DE lncRNAs) were identified in the COVID-19 samples compared to the healthy controls. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the upregulated DE mRNAs were mainly involved in antigen processing and presentation of endogenous antigen, positive regulation of T cell mediated cytotoxicity, and positive regulation of gamma-delta T cell activation. The downregulated DE mRNAs were mainly concentrated in the glycogen biosynthetic process. We also established the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of up/downregulated DE mRNAs and identified 4 modules. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that these module targets were associated with positive regulation of cytokine production, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, leukocyte differentiation, and migration. A total of 6 hub genes were selected in the PPI module networks including AKT1, TNFRSF1B, FCGR2A, CXCL8, STAT3, and TLR2. Moreover, a competing endogenous RNA network showed the interactions between lncRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNAs. Our results highlight the potential pathogenesis of excessive cytokine production such as MSTRG.119845.30/hsa-miR-20a-5p/TNFRSF1B, MSTRG.119845.30/hsa-miR-29b-2-5p/FCGR2A, and MSTRG.106112.2/hsa-miR-6501-5p/STAT3 axis, which may also play an important role in the development of ground-glass opacity in COVID-19 patients. This study gives new insights into inflammation regulatory mechanisms of coding and noncoding RNAs in COVID-19, which may provide novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic avenues for COVID-19 patients.","Li, Cai-Xia; Chen, Jian; Lv, Shu-Kai; Li, Jin-Hui; Li, Lei-Lei; Hu, Xiao",Mediators Inflamm,,253

This retrospective study was aimed at determining the efficacy of pre-TACE CT or MR imaging findings in predicting survival outcomes in patients with small HCC upon being treated with TACE. Besides, the study proposed to build a risk prediction model for these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Altogether, 750 patients with functionally good hepatic reserve who received TACE as the first-line treatment for single small HCC between 2004 and 2014 were included in the study. These patients were randomly assigned into training (n = 525) and validation (n = 225) sets. RESULTS: According to the results of a multivariable Cox analysis, three pre-TACE imaging findings (tumor margin, tumor location, enhancement pattern) and two clinical factors (age, serum albumin level) were selected and scored to create predictive models for overall, local tumor progression (LTP)-free, and progression-free survival in the training set. The median overall survival time in the validation set were 137.5 months, 76.1 months, and 44.0 months for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves of the predictive models for overall, LTP-free, and progression-free survival applied to the validation cohort showed acceptable areas under the curve values (0.734, 0.802, and 0.775 for overall survival; 0.738, 0.789, and 0.791 for LTP-free survival; and 0.671, 0.733, and 0.694 for progression-free survival at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pre-TACE CT or MR imaging findings could predict survival outcomes in patients with small HCC upon treatment with TACE. Our predictive models including three imaging predictors could be helpful in prognostication, identification, and selection of suitable candidates for TACE in patients with single small HCC.","Park, Chan; Kim, Jin Hyoung; Kim, Pyeong Hwa; Kim, So Yeon; Gwon, Dong Il; Chu, Hee Ho; Park, Minho; Hur, Joonho; Kim, Jin Young; Kim, Dong Joon",Korean j. radiol,,253

We make use of ubiquitous and commonly free services and platforms, so that our workflow is inclusive for all educators and provides polished experiences for students. Our learning materials provide for each lecture: 1) a recorded video, uploaded on YouTube, with exact slide timestamp indices, which enables an enhanced navigation UI; and 2) a high-quality flow-text automated transcript of the narration with proper punctuation and capitalization, improved with a student participation workflow on GitHub. All these results could be created by hand in a time consuming and costly way. However, this would generally exceed the time available for creating course materials. Our main contribution is to automate the transformation and post-production between raw narrated slides and our published materials with a custom toolchain. Furthermore, we describe our complete workflow: from content creation to transformation and distribution. Our students gave us overwhelmingly positive feedback and especially liked our use of ubiquitous platforms. The most used feature was YouTube's chapter UI enabled through our automatically generated timestamps. The majority of students, who started using the transcripts, continued to do so. Every single transcript was corrected by students, with an average word-change of 6%. We conclude with the positive feedback that our enhanced content formats are much appreciated and utilized.

It compares greenhouse gas emission estimations from both the production-based and consumption-based perspectives with two large-scale administrative datasets: the vehicle odometer readings from individual vehicle annual inspection, and the road inventory data containing road segment level geospatial and traffic information. Based on spatial econometric models that examine socioeconomic and built environment factors contributing to the vehicle miles traveled at the census tract level, it offers insights to help cities reduce VMT and carbon footprint for passenger vehicle travel. Finally, it recommends a pathway for cities and towns in the Boston metropolitan area to curb VMT and mitigate carbon emissions to achieve climate goals of carbon neutrality.","Aslanyan, Tigran; Jiang, Shan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06677v1.pdf,253

It is the first attempt to describe and characterize the consequences of the global pandemic as reflected through the traditional culture of the Udmurt people. Materials used for the analysis were internet posts, data from informants, articles from district newspapers, and the observations of the authors. The presented materials allow us to speak about changes in the form of the Udmurt traditional ritual events and people’s ability to adapt to a crisis situation. Self-isolation has caused concern among many villagers because of the inability to hold festivals in real time and space. A study of internet posts has shown that the Udmurts willingly share their preparations for the festivals and send greetings to each other that reflect both joyful and sad emotions. Udmurt songs and chastushkas with humorous content uploaded on websites help them to overcome the difficult situation caused by the coronavirus. © 2021, FB and Media Group of Estonian Literary Museum.

397755,Impact on the Virtual Learning Environment Due to COVID-19,2021,"Objective: Acute SarsCoV2 infection is associated with endothelial dysfunction and endothelitis which might explain systemic microvascular impairment. The presence of endothelial damage can promote vasoconstriction with consequent organ ischemia, inflammation, tissue edema and a procoagulant state resulting in an increase in the incidence of cardio-and cerebrovascular events. Microvascular thrombosis has been demonstrated in post-mortem autopsy of COVID19 patients;however no data are available about skin capillary alterations in these patients. Design and method: We evaluated skin microvascular alterations in 14 patients admitted to our hospital with SarsCov2 infection. Basal capillary density was performed by capillaroscopy bedside in the nailfold and in the dorsum of the 4th finger. Results: Fourteen patients (9 males, 5 females) were evaluated: average age was 66±1 years, BMI 26±3. Nine patients were hypertensive (64%), 4 diabetic (29%), 3 were dyslipidemic (21%), 3 with cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease history (21%). Seven patients were treated with ev steroid (50%), 3 with tocilizumab (21%) and 7 were treated with non-invasive ventilation (50%). During the hospitalisation all patients presented interstitial pneumonia SarsCov2 associated whereas vascular complication (ischaemic stroke or pulmonary embolism) were observed in 3 patients (21%) with SarsCov2 infection. Nine patients showed skin capillary alterations (5 thrombosis, 5 haemorrhage/ microbleeding, 4 neoangiogenesis). Interestingly, capillary alterations were present only in patients treated with non-invasive ventilation and/or with cardio-or cerebrovascular complications. These alterations were not detected after 2 month from the discharge. Conclusions: This is the first in vivo evidence of skin capillary thrombosis, microhaemorragia and angiogenesis in patients with acute SARS-CoV2 infection which support the presence of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. Capillary alterations might reflect systemic vascular effects of viral infection.","De Ciuceis, C.; Rosei, C. A.; Brami, V.; Rossini, C.; Gaggero, A.; Fama, F.; Muiesan, M.

Patients who fail to keep scheduled medical appointments experience a negative impact on care. The aim of this study is to investigate the psychosocial factors contributing to the cancellation of medical appointments during the pandemic by patients with pre-existing health conditions. Data were collected in eleven Italian hospitals during the last week of lockdown, and one month later. In order to assess the emotional impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the subject's degree of psychological flexibility, we developed an ad hoc questionnaire (ImpACT), referring to the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) model. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ) were also used. Pervasive dysfunctional use of experiential avoidance behaviours (used with the function to avoid thought, emotions, sensations), feelings of loneliness and high post-traumatic stress scores were found to correlate with the fear of COVID-19, increasing the likelihood of cancelling medical appointments. Responding promptly to the information and psychological needs of patients who cancel medical appointments can have positive effects in terms of psychological and physical health.","Deledda, Giuseppe; Riccardi, Niccolò; Gori, Stefania; Poli, Sara; Giansante, Matteo; Geccherle, Eleonora; Mazzi, Cristina; Silva, Ronaldo; Desantis, Nicoletta; Giovannetti, Ambra Mara; Solari, Alessandra; Confalonieri, Paolo; Grazzi, Licia; Sarcletti, Elena; Biffa, Gabriella; Biagio, Antonio Di; Sestito, Carlo; Keim, Roland; Gangi Hermis, Alida M R Di; Mazzoldi, Mariantonietta; Failo, Alessandro; Scaglione, Anna; Faldetta, Naida; Dorangricchia, Patrizia; Moschetto, Maria; Soto Parra, Hector Josè; Faietti, Jennifer; Profio, Anna Di; Rusconi, Stefano; Giacomelli, Andrea; Marchioretto, Fabio; Alongi, Filippo; Marchetta, Antonio; Molon, Giulio; Bisoffi, Zeno; Angheben, Andrea",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,253

These immunological parameters in homologous or heterologous vaccination boosts have thus far been studied for mRNA and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines, but knowledge on individuals who received a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is lacking. We studied Spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals (n=55) who were either primed with Ad26.COV2.S only (n=13), or boosted with a homologous (Ad26.COV2.S, n=28) or heterologous (BNT162b2, n=14) second dose. We compared our findings with the results found in individuals vaccinated with a single (n=16) or double (n=44) dose of BNT162b2. We observed that a strategy of heterologous vaccination enhanced the quantity and breadth of both, Spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated. In contrast, the impact of homologous boost was quantitatively minimal in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated and Spike-specific antibodies and T cells were narrowly focused to the S1 region. Although a direct association between quantity and quality of immunological parameters and in vivo protection has not been demonstrated, the immunological features of Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses support the utilization of a heterologous strategy of vaccine boost in individuals who received Ad26.COV2.S vaccination.","Khoo, Nicholas Kim Huat; Lim, Joey Ming Er; Gill, Upkar Singh; Alwis, Ruklanthi de; Tan, Nicole; Toh, Justin Zhen Nan; Abbott, Jane E; Usai, Carla; Ooi, Eng Eong; Low, Jenny Guek Hong; Bert, Nina Le; Kennedy, Patrick TF; Bertoletti, Antonio",,,253
399168,Student Voice in Administrative Decision-Making: Inclusive Planning during the Pandemic,2021,"We report the case of a 52-year-old hyperglycemic woman with type 2 diabetes and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia, possibly involving the subcutaneous insulin resistance (SIR) syndrome. After admission for pneumonia, her average daily blood glucose (BG) levels remained at 300-400 mg/dL, although the required dosage of subcutaneous insulin markedly increased (~ 150 units/day; ~ 2.63 units/kg/day). Furthermore, the patient had generalized edema along with hypoalbuminemia, developed extensive abdominal purpuras, and had increased plasma D-dimer levels during treatment, suggestive of coagulation abnormalities. Therefore, intravenous infusion of regular insulin was initiated. The BG level subsequently decreased to < 200 mg/dL 2 days after administering 18 units/day of insulin infusion and 118 units/day of subcutaneous insulin, suggesting that subcutaneous insulin alone might have been ineffective in reducing hyperglycemia, which is clinically consistent with the characteristics of an SIR syndrome. Impaired skin microcirculation arising from coagulation abnormalities, subcutaneous edema associated with inflammation-related hypoalbuminemia or vascular hyperpermeability, and/or reduction in subcutaneous blood flow due to COVID-19-induced downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 might be associated with the development of pathological conditions that resemble SIR syndrome, leading to impaired subcutaneous insulin absorption.

Systemic dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV was previously postulated to be due to ACE2/angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7)/Mas axis downregulation; increased ACE2 activity was shown to mediate disease protection. Because angiotensin II receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease; thus, they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. Based on the anti-inflammatory benefits of the upregulation of the ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis and previously demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement in SARS-CoV infections, it has been hypothesized that the benefits of treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 may outweigh the risks and at the very least should not be withheld.","Brojakowska, Agnieszka; Narula, Jagat; Shimony, Rony; Bander, Jeffrey",J Am Coll Cardiol,,253

Unfortunately, the blockades have entailed hefty socioeconomic costs. In order to contrast the spread of the virus, states have used contact tracing technology, in the form of mobile phone applications designed to track close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. Recent research has shown the effectiveness of this solution, particularly when used in conjunction with manual tracking. Nonetheless, the contact tracing app raises concerns due to the potential privacy implications. The authors have delved into the European legislation that protects privacy through the principles of proportionality and minimization, arguing that in order to quickly resolve the pandemic caused by COVID-19, one cannot blindly trust the exclusive help of technology. Instead, we need the involvement of health personnel, scientists, and no less importantly, the citizenry's sense of solidarity and the duty to abide by the rules of social distancing, the use of protective devices and hygiene rules to protect public health.","Montanari Vergallo, G; Zaami, S; Marinelli, E",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,253

This highly responsive T-cell type was termed NK-like CD8+ T cells due to their capability to act in an innate immune fashion in mice similar to NK cells. However, KIR+NKG2A + CD8+ T cells that are Eomes- represent a small proportion of unconventional T cells that have not been described until now. METHODS: We compare the distribution of the memory phenotypes and senescence-associated markers of two T-cell subsets by multicolor flow cytometry in 10 cord blood samples and 105 healthy individuals (HIs) ranging from 6 to 84 years of age. RESULTS: We found that the Eomes+ population has a higher differentiation degree than the Eomes- population. T cells in the Eomes- subset show proportionally less TEMRA phenotypes while instead preferentially displaying a more naïve and TCM phenotype. Furthermore, the Eomes- population was shown to linearly decrease with age, while the Eomes+ population exhibited more senescence-associated characteristics, such as CD57 expression and loss of CD28. CONCLUSION: Overall, the KIR+NKG2A + Eomes- CD8+ T-cell population shares similar characteristics with the Eomes+ population, although with a lower degree of differentiation, lower senescence marker expression, and a proportional decrease with age. Thus, we suspect that KIR+NKG2A + Eomes-CD8+ T cells may represent a less differentiated stage of the NK-like CD8+ T-cell subset.","Kasakovski, Dimitri; Zeng, Xiangbo; Lai, Jing; Yu, Zhi; Yao, Danlin; Chen, Shaohua; Zha, Xianfeng; Li, Yangqiu; Xu, Ling","Cytometry, Part B Clin. cytom",,253

Antibody tests enable detection of individuals past the initial phase of infection and help examine vaccine responses. The major targets of human antibody response in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the spike glycoprotein (SP) and nucleocapsid protein (NP). We have developed a rapid homogenous approach for antibody detection termed LFRET (protein L-based time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer immunoassay). In LFRET, fluorophore-labeled protein L and antigen are brought to close proximity by antigen-specific patient immunoglobulins of any isotype, resulting in TR-FRET signal. We set up LFRET assays for antibodies against SP and NP and evaluated their diagnostic performance using a panel of 77 serum/plasma samples from 44 individuals with COVID-19 and 52 negative controls. Moreover, using a previously described SP and a novel NP construct, we set up enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 SP and NP. We then compared the LFRET assays with these ELISAs and with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization test (MNT). We found the LFRET assays to parallel ELISAs in sensitivity (90-95% vs. 90-100%) and specificity (100% vs. 94-100%). In identifying individuals with or without a detectable neutralizing antibody response, LFRET outperformed ELISA in specificity (91-96% vs. 82-87%), while demonstrating an equal sensitivity (98%). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the applicability of LFRET, a 10-min ""mix and read"" assay, to detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Rusanen, Juuso; Kareinen, Lauri; Levanov, Lev; Mero, Sointu; Pakkanen, Sari H; Kantele, Anu; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Hedman, Klaus; Vapalahti, Olli; Hepojoki, Jussi",Viruses,,253

407253,Student Experiences of the Covid-19 Lockdown,2020,"In December, 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China and quickly spread globally. As of May 7, 2020, there were 3 672 238 confirmed infections and 254 045 deaths attributed to COVID-19. Evidence has shown that there are asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 who can transmit the disease to others. The virus incubation time shows a wide range (0–24 days) and the virus displays a high infectivity. It is therefore urgent to develop an effective therapy to treat patients with COVID-19 and to control the spread of the causative agent, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Repurposing of approved drugs is widely adopted to fight newly emerged diseases such as COVID-19, as these drugs have known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. As pathological examination has confirmed the involvement of immune hyperactivation and acute respiratory distress syndrome in fatal cases of COVID-19, several disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS), such as hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab, have been proposed as potential therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. In this Review, we discuss the immunological aspects of COVID-19 and the potential implication of DMARDs in treating this disease.","Zhong, Jixin; Tang, Jungen; Ye, Cong; Dong, Lingli",Lancet Rheumat.,,253
407925,Healthcare information technology convergence to effectively cope with the COVID- 19 crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Myeloperoxidase-specific ANCA (MPO-ANCA) are implicated in the pathogenesis of vasculitis and GN. Kinins play a major role during acute inflammation by regulating vasodilatation and vascular permeability and by modulating adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Kinin system activation occurs in patients with ANCA vasculitis. Previous studies in animal models of GN and sclerosing kidney diseases have demonstrated protective effects of bradykinin receptor 1 (B1R) blockade via interference with myeloid cell trafficking. METHODS: To investigate the role of B1R in a murine model of MPO-ANCA GN, we evaluated effects of B1R genetic ablation and pharmacologic blockade. We used bone marrow chimeric mice to determine the role of B1R in bone marrow-derived cells (leukocytes) versus nonbone marrow-derived cells. We elucidated mechanisms of B1R effects using in vitro assays for MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation, endothelial adherence, endothelial transmigration, and neutrophil adhesion molecule surface display. RESULTS: B1R deficiency or blockade prevented or markedly reduced ANCA-induced glomerular crescents, necrosis, and leukocyte influx in mice. B1R was not required for in vitro MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Leukocyte B1R deficiency, but not endothelial B1R deficiency, decreased glomerular neutrophil infiltration induced by MPO-ANCA in vivo. B1R enhanced ANCA-induced neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration in vitro. ANCA-activated neutrophils exhibited changes in Mac-1 and LFA-1, important regulators of neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration: ANCA-activated neutrophils increased surface expression of Mac-1 and increased shedding of LFA-1, whereas B1R blockade reduced these effects. CONCLUSIONS: The leukocyte B1R plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MPO-ANCA-induced GN in a mouse model by modulating neutrophil-endothelial interaction. B1R blockade may have potential as a therapy for ANCA GN and vasculitis.","Hu, Peiqi; Su, Hua; Xiao, Hong; Gou, Shen-Ju; Herrera, Carolina A; Alba, Marco A; Kakoki, Masao; Falk, Ronald J; Jennette, J Charles",J Am Soc Nephrol,,253

409226,Eliminating Indefiniteness of Clinical Spectrum for Better Screening COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant barriers to timely donor evaluation, cell collection, and graft transport for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT). To ensure availability of donor cells on the scheduled date of infusion, many sites now collect cryopreserved grafts before the start of pretransplantation conditioning. Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (ptCY) is an increasingly used approach for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, but the impact of graft cryopreservation on the outcomes of allo-HCT using ptCY is not known. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database, we compared the outcomes of HCT using cryopreserved versus fresh grafts in patients undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancy with ptCY. We analyzed 274 patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing allo-HCT between 2013 and 2018 with cryopreserved grafts and ptCY. Eighteen patients received bone marrow grafts and 256 received peripheral blood stem cell grafts. These patients were matched for age, graft type, disease risk index (DRI), and propensity score with 1080 patients who underwent allo-HCT with fresh grafts. The propensity score, which is an assessment of the likelihood of receiving a fresh graft versus a cryopreserved graft, was calculated using logistic regression to account for the following: disease histology, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), HCT Comorbidity Index, conditioning regimen intensity, donor type, and recipient race. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression and disease-free survival (DFS). Because of multiple comparisons, only P values <.01 were considered statistically significant. The 2 cohorts (cryopreserved and fresh) were similar in terms of patient age, KPS, diagnosis, DRI, HCT-CI, donor/graft source, and conditioning intensity. One-year probabilities of OS were 71.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.3% to 73.8%) with fresh grafts and 70.3% (95% CI, 64.6% to 75.7%) with cryopreserved grafts (P = .81). Corresponding probabilities of OS at 2 years were 60.6% (95% CI, 57.3% to 63.8%) and 58.7% (95% CI, 51.9% to 65.4%) (P = .62). In matched-pair regression analysis, graft cryopreservation was not associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] for cryopreserved versus fresh, 1.05; 95% CI, .86 to 1.29; P = .60). Similarly, rates of neutrophil recovery (HR, .91; 95% CI, .80 to 1.02; P = .12), platelet recovery (HR, .88; 95% CI, .78 to 1.00; P = .05), grade III-IV acute GVHD (HR, .78; 95% CI, .50 to 1.22; P = .27), NRM (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, .86 to 1.55; P = .32) and relapse/progression (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, .97 to 1.50; P = .09) were similar with cryopreserved grafts versus fresh grafts. There were somewhat lower rates of chronic GVHD (HR, 78; 95% CI, .61 to .99; P = .04) and DFS (HR for treatment failure, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.29; P = .04) with graft cryopreservation that were of marginal statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Overall, our data indicate that graft cryopreservation does not significantly delay hematopoietic recovery, increase the risk of acute GVHD or NRM, or decrease OS after allo-HCT using ptCY.","Hamadani, Mehdi; Zhang, Mei-Jie; Tang, Xiao-Ying; Fei, Mingwei; Brunstein, Claudio; Chhabra, Saurabh; D039,; Souza, Anita; Milano, Filippo; Phelan, Rachel; Saber, Wael; Shaw, Bronwen E; Weisdorf, Daniel; Devine, Steven M; Horowitz, Mary M",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,,253

Here, with a focus on Israel, we sequence 212 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and use them to perform a comprehensive analysis to trace the origins and spread of the virus. We find that travelers returning from the United States of America significantly contributed to viral spread in Israel, more than their proportion in incoming infected travelers. Using phylodynamic analysis, we estimate that the basic reproduction number of the virus was initially around 2.5, dropping by more than two-thirds following the implementation of social distancing measures. We further report high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 2-10% of infected individuals resulting in 80% of secondary infections. Overall, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of social distancing measures for reducing viral spread.","Miller, Danielle; Martin, Michael A; Harel, Noam; Tirosh, Omer; Kustin, Talia; Meir, Moran; Sorek, Nadav; Gefen-Halevi, Shiraz; Amit, Sharon; Vorontsov, Olesya; Shaag, Avraham; Wolf, Dana; Peretz, Avi; Shemer-Avni, Yonat; Roif-Kaminsky, Diana; Kopelman, Naama M; Huppert, Amit; Koelle, Katia; Stern, Adi",Nat Commun,,253

414525,Bursting the Auto Loan Bubble in the Wake of COVID-19,2021,"The scaling down of meta-atoms or metamolecules (collectively denoted as metaunits) is a long-lasting issue from the time when the concept of metamaterials was first suggested. According to the effective medium theory, which is the foundational concept of metamaterials, the structural sizes of meta-units should be much smaller than the working wavelengths (e.g., << 1/5 wavelength). At relatively low frequency regimes (e.g., microwave and terahertz), the conventional monolithic lithography can readily address the materialization of metamaterials. However, it is still challenging to fabricate optical metamaterials (metamaterials working at optical frequencies such as the visible and near-infrared regimes) through the lithographic approaches. This serves as the rationale for using colloidal self-assembly as a strategy for the realization of optical metamaterials. Colloidal self-assembly can address various critical issues associated with the materialization of optical metamaterials, such as achieving nanogaps over a large area, increasing true 3D structural complexities, and cost-effective processing, which all are difficult to attain through monolithic lithography. Nevertheless, colloidal self-assembly is still a toolset underutilized by optical engineers. Here, the design principle of the colloidally self-assembled optical metamaterials exhibiting unnatural refractions, the practical challenge of relevant experiments, and the future opportunities are critically reviewed.","Huh, Ji-Hyeok; Kim, Kwangjin; Im, Eunji; Lee, Jaewon; Cho, YongDeok; Lee, Seungwoo",Adv Mater,,253

Transmission from asymptomatic persons, healthcare transmission, and interfamily transmission have been well documented. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 possesses powerful pathogenicity and transmissibility. It is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets and close contact. The most probable transmission pathway is definitely the inter-human one. Asymptomatic patients seem to play a crucial role in spreading the infection. Because of COVID-19 infection pandemic potential, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaptation, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity in order to gain an effective vaccine and flock immunity and reduce mortality as soon and as much as it is possible.","Vella, F; Senia, P; Ceccarelli, M; Vitale, E; Maltezou, H; Taibi, R; Lleshi, A; Venanzi Rullo, E; Pellicanò, G F; Rapisarda, V; Nunnari, G; Ledda, C",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,253
417649,It Is All About Location: Smartphones and Tracking the Spread of COVID-19,2020,"Malaria continues to be one of the top infectious agents contributing to morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Annually, Botswana accounts only for a small proportion of cases (<<1%). Despite significantly reduced incidence rate, the country still experiences sporadic outbreaks that hamper the goal of malaria elimination. This review evaluated previous and current biological factors that impact malaria in Botswana, specifically focussing on the vectors, the parasite and the host. This was accomplished via a literature review evaluating these variables in Botswana. Current literature suggests that Anopheles arabiensis is the main malaria vector in the country. Several other potential vectors have been found widely distributed throughout Botswana in high numbers, yet remain largely unstudied with regards to their contribution to the country's malaria burden. We also report the most up to date list of all Anopheles species that have been found in Botswana. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of symptomatic malaria in the country and some drug resistance markers have been documented for this species. Plasmodium vivax has been reported in asymptomatic subjects, even though a large proportion of the Botswana population appears to be Duffy antigen negative. Very little is known about the true distribution of P. vivax and no point of care testing infrastructure for this species exists in Botswana, making it difficult to tailor treatment to address possible recrudescence or relapse. Due to a genetically diverse population with a substantial Khoisan contribution into the Bantu genetic background, several phenotypes that potentially impact prevalence and severity of malaria exist within the country. These include sickle cell trait, Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, and Duffy negativity. This review highlights the information that currently exists on malaria in Botswana. It also postulates that a comprehensive understanding of these aforementioned biological factors may help to explain malaria persistence in Botswana.","Bango, Zackary Austin; Tawe, Leabaneng; Muthoga, Charles Waithaka; Paganotti, Giacomo Maria",Infect Genet Evol,,253

419835,Regime Type and COVID-19 Response,2020,"The pandemic is here to stay- evident from the second wave that is severely affecting global population. Though vaccination is now available, the population size restricts its efficacy, especially in the third world countries. Therefore, to avoid a third wave, natural preventive therapeutics are the need of the hour. In this work the efficiency of phytochemicals from &lt;i&gt;Withania somnifera&lt;/i&gt; to bind to a total of six SARS-CoV-2 targets have been shown.1 µs molecular dynamics simulations and essential dynamic analyses shed light on the changes induced by the phytochemicals and highlights their multipotent capabilities- 27-Hydroxywithanolide B was able to bind to three targets. Relative free energy of binding for all the phytochemicals were calculated by MM/PBSA. Minimum energy structures were extracted from their free energy landscapes and were subjected to PSN-ENM-NMA and network centrality analysis. Results showed that the phytochemical binding changes the residue-residue interaction network. Network communities increase while hubs and links decrease. Metapath rewiring occurs through residues Phe456 in spike protein, Thr26 and Tyr118 in main protease, Val49 and Phe156 in NSP3, Leu98 in NSP9, Leu4345 in NSP10, Phe440 and Phe843 in NSP12. This work tries to understand the mechanism of possible inhibition by the phytochemicals to combat SARS-CoV-2 with their capability of targeting multiple proteins. The insight from this study can be of great relevance to explore the changes in network properties induced by reported potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 targets.","Pratap Kumar, Parida Dipak Paul Debamitra Chakravorty",,,253

421085,Spatial distribution dynamics and prediction of COVID‐19 in Asian countries: spatial Markov chain approach,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has imposed considerable restrictions on people's mobility, which affects the referral of chronically ill patients to health care structures. The emerging need for alternative ways to follow these patients up is leading to a wide adoption of telemedicine. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of this approach for our cohort of patients with CTDs, investigating their attitude to adopting telemedicine, even after the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a telephonic survey among consecutive patients referred to our CTD outpatients' clinic, evaluating their capability and propensity for adopting telemedicine and whether they would prefer it over face-to-face evaluation. Demographical and occupational factors were also collected, and their influence on the answers has been evaluated by a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients answered our survey (M/F = 28/147), with a median age of 62.5 years [interquartile range (IQR) 53-73]. About 80% of patients owned a device allowing video-calls, and 86% would be able to perform a tele-visit, either alone (50%) or with the help of a relative (36%). Telemedicine was considered acceptable by 78% of patients and 61% would prefer it. Distance from the hospital and patient's educational level were the strongest predictive factors for the acceptance of telemedicine (P < 0.05), whereas age only affected the mastering of required skills (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Telemedicine is a viable approach to be considered for routine follow-up of chronic patients, even beyond the pandemic. Our data showed that older patients would be willing to use this approach, although a proper guide for them would be required.","Cavagna, Lorenzo; Zanframundo, Giovanni; Codullo, Veronica; Pisu, Maria Grazia; Caporali, Roberto; Montecucco, Carlomaurizio",Rheumatology (Oxford),,253
421224,Delayed hemodialysis in COVID-19: Case series with literature review,2021,"The pandemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent data showed that hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, data indicate that hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are important risk factors for progression and unfavorable outcome in COVID-19 patients. There is only limited amount of data regarding follow-up of these patients, and they provided conflicting results. The main limitation is a small number of participants and particularly those who experienced primary composite outcome (admission in intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death). Additionally, the limited number of patients was essential obstacle for performing analysis that would include many confounding factors such as advanced age, smoking status, and obesity and potentially change conclusion. So far, there is no study that demonstrated independent predictive value of diabetes on mortality in COVID-19 patients, but there are many speculations about the association between diabetes and susceptibility to novel coronavirus, as well as its impact on progression and prognosis of COVID-19. The aim of this review article was to summarize the current knowledge about the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 and its role in outcome in these patients.","Tadic, Marijana; Cuspidi, Cesare; Sala, Carla",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),,253
421430,Introducing a mobility on demand system beyond COVID-19: Evidences from users' perspective,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Objective of this case report is to draw attention to a less known thrombotic complication associated with COVID-19, i.e., thrombosis of both radial arteries, with possible (long-term) consequences. THE CASE: In our COVID-19 ICU a 49-year-old male patient was admitted, with past medical history of obesity, smoking and diabetes, but no reported atherosclerotic complications. The patient had been admitted with severe hypoxemia and multiple pulmonary emboli were CT-confirmed. ICU-treatment included mechanical ventilation and therapeutic anticoagulation. Preparing the insertion of a new radial artery catheter for invasive blood pressure measurement and blood sampling, we detected that both radial arteries were non-pulsating and occluded: (a) Sonography showed the typical anatomical localization of both radial and ulnar arteries. However, Doppler-derived flow-signals could only be obtained from the ulnar arteries. (b) To test collateral arterial supply of the hand, a pulse-oximeter was placed on the index finger. Thereafter, the ulnar artery at the wrist was compressed. This compression caused an immediate loss of the finger's pulse-oximetry perfusion signal. The effect was reversible upon release of the ulnar artery. (c) To test for collateral perfusion undetectable by pulse-oximetry, we measured regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the thenar muscle by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Confirming our findings above, ulnar arterial compression demonstrated that thenar rSO2 was dependent on ulnar artery flow. The described development of bilateral radial artery occlusion in a relatively young and therapeutically anticoagulated patient with no history of atherosclerosis was unexpected. CONCLUSIONS: Since COVID-19 patients are at increased risk for arterial occlusion, it appears advisable to meticulously check for adequacy of collateral (hand-) perfusion, avoiding the harm of hand ischemia if interventions (e.g., catheterizations) at the radial or ulnar artery are intended.","Bouwhuis, Anne; Schober, Patrick; Heunks, Leo M A; Schwarte, Lothar A",J. clin. monit. comput,,253

METHODS: A retrospective multicenter cohort study conducted between 18 January and 20 March 2020 including people with confirmed COVID-19 from 56 hospitals officially designated in three Chinese regions; data were extracted from medical records. New-onset neurologic events as assessed by neurology consultants based on manifestations, clinical examination and investigations, in which critical events included disorders of consciousness, stroke, CNS infection, seizures and status epilepticus. RESULTS: We enrolled 917 people with average age 48.7 years and 55% were male. The frequency of new onset critical neurologic events was 3.5% (32/917) overall and 9.4% (30/319) among those with severe or critical COVID-19. These were impaired consciousness (n=25) or/and stroke (n=10). The risk of critical neurologic events was highly associated with age above 60 years and previous history of neurological conditions. Non-critical events were seen in less than 1% (7/917), including muscle cramp, unexplained headache, occipital neuralgia, tic and tremor. Brain CT in 28 people led to new findings in nine. Findings from lumbar puncture in three with suspected CNS infection, unexplained headache or severe occipital neuralgia were unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS: People with COVID-19 aged over 60 and neurologic comorbidities were at higher risk of developing critical neurologic impairment, mainly impaired consciousness and cerebrovascular accidents. Brain CT should be considered when new-onset brain injury is suspected, especially in people under sedation or showing an unexplained decline in consciousness. Evidence of direct acute insult of SARS-COV-2 to the CNS is still lacking.","Xiong, Weixi; Mu, Jie; Guo, Jian; Lu, Lu; Liu, Dan; Luo, Jianfei; Li, Nian; Liu, Jing; Yang, Dan; Gao, Hui; Zhang, Yingying; Lin, Mintao; Shen, Sisi; Zhang, Hesheng; Chen, Lei; Wang, Gang; Luo, Fengming; Li, Weimin; Chen, Shengli; He, Li; Sander, Josemir W; Zhou, Dong",Neurology,,253

423711,Recovery during a crisis: facing the challenges of risk assessment and resilience management of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The current US context is marked by extreme right-left partisanship, which means that state policies tend to bundle together and are not experienced in isolation. While prior work has leveraged abrupt shifts in single policies to examine the effects of state policy on birth outcomes, we examined a holistic measure that captures political polarisation. METHODS: Data were drawn from national birth certificates for 2003-2017 (N=56 770 470). Outcomes included preterm birth, low birth weight, small-for-gestational age and other perinatal health measures. The primary exposure was a composite index of right-left state policy orientation, generated from historical data on 135 state policies. Multivariable regressions were used to estimate the association between state policy orientation and each outcome, adjusting for relevant covariates. RESULTS: Compared with infants born in states with right-leaning policy orientations, those born in left-leaning states had lower odds of adverse birth outcomes (eg, low birth weight: OR 0.95 (0.93, 0.97), preterm birth: OR 0.94 (0.92, 0.95)). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations for US-born and White mothers. With the inclusion of state fixed effects, left-leaning policy orientation was no longer associated with lower odds of adverse birth outcomes. Models were otherwise robust to alternative specifications. CONCLUSION: While left-leaning state policy orientation has protective associations with a range of birth outcomes, the associations may be explained by stable characteristics of states, at least during the study period. Future studies should examine state policy orientation in association with other health outcomes and study periods.","Riley, Alicia R; Collin, Daniel; Grumbach, Jacob M; Torres, Jacqueline M; Hamad, Rita",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,253
423712,Recovery during a crisis: facing the challenges of risk assessment and resilience management of COVID-19,2020,"Environmental factors, such as humidity, precipitation, and temperature, have significant impacts on the spread of the new strain coronavirus COVID-19 to humans. In this paper, we use a stochastic epidemic SIRC model, with cross-immune class and time-delay in transmission terms, for the spread of COVID-19. We analyze the model and prove the existence and uniqueness of positive global solution. We deduce the basic reproduction number R 0 s for the stochastic model which is smaller than R 0 of the corresponding deterministic model. Sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution, using the stochastic Lyapunov function, and conditions for the extinction of the disease are obtained. Our findings show that white noise plays an important part in controlling the spread of the disease; When the white noise is relatively large, the infectious diseases will become extinct; Re-infection and periodic outbreaks can occur due to the existence of feedback time-delay (or memory) in the transmission terms.","Rihan, F A; Alsakaji, H J; Rajivganthi, C",Adv Differ Equ,,253

The initial design of the system is inspired on RoboAO with modifications in order to operate in natural guide star (NGS) mode. KalAO was built to search for binarity in planet hosting stars by following-up candidates primarily from the TESS satellite survey. The optical design is optimised for the 450-900 nm wavelength range and is fitted with SDSS \emph{g,r,i,z} filters. The system is designed for wavefront control down to $I$-magnitude 11 stars in order to probe the same parameter space as radial velocity instruments such as HARPS and NIRPS. The principal components of the system are an 11x11 10.9 cm sub-apertures Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, a 140 actuators Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) deformable mirror, a fast tip/tilt mirror, and a graphics processing unit (GPU) powered glycol cooled real-time computer. It is designed to run at up to 1.8kHz in order to detect companions as close as the 150mas visible-light diffraction limit. The real-time adaptive optics control is using the CACAO software running on GPUs.

Methods: Postmortem needle autopsies from the spleen were carried out on 10 patients who died from COVID-19 in Wuhan. Routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the pathological changes. The changes of lymphocytes were studied further with immunohistochemistry.RT-PCR was used to detect 2019-nCoV RNA in the spleen. In addition,the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected by in situ hybridization, and coronavirus particles were detected by transmission electron microscopy in 2 cases. Results: There were 7 males and 3 females, with an average age of 68.3 years.Of the 10 cases, 4 had cancer history and another 4 had other underlying diseases respectively.Cough, fever, malaise and dyspnea were the main clinical symptoms.The time from onset to death was 15-45 days.Ten cases patients had normal or slight increase in peripheral blood leukocyte count in the early stage of the disease, 6 cases had significant increase before death. Five patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased in the early stage of the disease, and 10 patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased significantly before the disease progressed or died. Seven cases were treated with corticosteroid (methylprednisolone &#8804;40 mg/d, not more than 5 days). Histopathological examination showed that the cell composition of the spleen decreased, white pulp atrophied at different levels, meanwhile lymphoid follicles decreased or absent;in addition, the ratio of red pulp to white pulp increased with varying degrees. In 7 cases, more neutrophil infiltration was found, and in 5 cases, scattered plasma cell infiltration was found. Macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytic phenomena in a few cells were found in a case. Meanwhile, necrosis and lymphocyte apoptosis were detected in 2 cases, small artery thrombosis and spleen infarction in 1 case, and fungal infection in 1 case. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the T and B lymphocyte components of the spleen in all cases decreased in varying degrees. CD20(+) B cells were found to accumulate in the lymphoid sheath around the splenic artery in 8 cases. However, CD20 and CD21 immunostaining in 2 cases showed that the number of white pulp was almost normal, and splenic nodules were atrophic. CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+)T cells were decreased. In 9 cases,CD68(+) macrophages were no significant changes in the distribution and quantity. While more CD68(+) cells were found in the medullary sinuses of 1 case (related to fungal infection). Few CD56(+) cells were found. EBV was negative by in situ hybridization. RT-PCR was used to detect the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. One of 10 cases was positive, 39 years old,who was the youngest patient in this group, and the other 9 cases were negative. Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of macrophage under electron microscope in 2 cases. Conclusions: The death of COVID-19 occurs mainly in the elderly, and some cases have no underlying diseases. Spleen may be one of the organs directly attacked by the virus in some patients who died from COVID-19. T and B lymphocyte in the spleen decrease in varying degrees, lymphoid follicles are atrophied, decreased or absent, and the number of NK cells do not change significantly. And the pathological changes of the spleen are not related to the use of low dose corticosteroid, which may be related to the direct attack of virus and the attack of immune system on its own tissues.","Xu, X; Chang, X N; Pan, H X; Su, H; Huang, B; Yang, M; Luo, D J; Weng, M X; Ma, L; Nie, X",Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,,253

425305,The Value of Adapting Clinical Reasoning Teaching Methods,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the shortcomings in the deployment of state-of-the-art diagnostics platforms. Although several polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques have been rapidly developed to meet the growing testing needs, such techniques often need samples collected through a swab, the use of RNA extraction kits, and expensive thermocyclers in order to successfully perform the test. Isothermal amplification-based approaches have also been recently demonstrated for rapid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection by minimizing sample preparation while also reducing the instrumentation and reaction complexity. In addition, there are limited reports of saliva as the sample source, and some of these indicate inferior sensitivity when comparing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with PCR-based techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate an improved sensitivity assay from saliva using a two-step RT-LAMP assay, where a short 10 min RT step is performed with only B3 and backward inner primers before the final reaction. We show that while the one-step RT-LAMP demonstrates satisfactory results, the optimized two-step approach allows detection of only few molecules per reaction and performs significantly better than the one-step RT-LAMP and conventional two-step RT-LAMP approaches with all primers included in the RT step. We show control measurements with RT-PCR, and importantly, we demonstrate RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP-based assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from viral transport media and saliva clinical samples.","Ganguli, Anurup; Mostafa, Ariana; Berger, Jacob; Lim, Jongwon; Araud, Elbashir; Baek, Janice; Stewart de Ramirez, Sarah A; Baltaji, Ali; Roth, Kelly; Aamir, Muhammad; Aedma, Surya; Mady, Mohamed; Mahajan, Pranav; Sathe, Sanjivani; Johnson, Mark; White, Karen; Kumar, James; Valera, Enrique; Bashir, Rashid",Anal. chem,,253

Our goal is twofold: first, we propose a novel spatial econometric model of the epidemic spread across NUTS-3 regions to identify the role played by commuting-to-work patterns for spatial disease transmission. Second, we explore if the imposed containment (lockdown) measures during the first pandemic wave in spring 2020 have affected the strength of this transmission channel. Our results from a spatial panel error correction model indicate that, without containment measures in place, commuting-to-work patterns were the first factor to significantly determine the spatial dynamics of daily COVID-19 cases in Germany. This indicates that job commuting, particularly during the initial phase of a pandemic wave, should be regarded and accordingly monitored as a relevant spatial transmission channel of COVID-19 in a system of economically interconnected regions. Our estimation results also provide evidence for the triggering role of local hot spots in disease transmission and point to the effectiveness of containment measures in mitigating the spread of the virus across German regions through reduced job commuting and other forms of mobility.

However, it is possible that even with an optimal use of the increased resources, these will not suffice for all patients in need. Therefore, recommendations for the allocation of intensive care resources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed by a multidisciplinary group of authors with the support of eight scientific medical societies. The recommendations for procedures and criteria for prioritisations in case of resource scarcity are based on scientific evidence, ethicolegal considerations and practical experience. Medical decisions must always be based on the need and the treatment preferences of the individual patient. In addition to this patient-centred approach, prioritisations in case of resource scarcity require a supraindividual perspective. In such situations, prioritisations should be based on the criterion of clinical prospect of success in order to minimize the number of preventable deaths due to resource scarcity and to avoid discrimination based on age, disabilities or social factors. The assessment of the clinical prospect of success should take into account the severity of the current illness, severe comorbidities and the patient's general health status prior to the current illness.","Marckmann, Georg; Neitzke, Gerald; Schildmann, Jan; Michalsen, Andrej; Dutzmann, Jochen; Hartog, Christiane; Jöbges, Susanne; Knochel, Kathrin; Michels, Guido; Pin, Martin; Riessen, Reimer; Rogge, Annette; Taupitz, Jochen; Janssens, Uwe",Med.

430570,Toward a critical race analysis of the COVID-19 crisis in US carceral institutions,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised important universal public health challenges. Conceiving ethical responses to these challenges is a public health imperative but must take context into account. This is particularly important in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this paper, we examine how some of the ethical recommendations offered so far in high-income countries might appear from a SSA perspective. We also reflect on some of the key ethical challenges raised by the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income countries suffering from chronic shortages in health care resources, and chronic high morbidity and mortality from non-COVID-19 causes. A parallel is drawn between the distribution of severity of COVID-19 disease and the classic ""Fortune at the bottom of the pyramid"" model that is relevant in SSA. Focusing allocation of resources during COVID-19 on the 'thick' part of the pyramid in Low-to-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) could be ethically justified on utilitarian and social justice grounds, since it prioritizes a large number of persons who have been economically and socially marginalized. During the pandemic, importing allocation frameworks focused on the apex of the pyramid from the global north may therefore not always be appropriate. In a post-COVID-19 world, we need to think strategically about how health care systems can be financed and structured to ensure broad access to adequate health care for all who need it. The root problems underlying health inequity, exposed by COVID-19, must be addressed, not just to prepare for the next pandemic, but to care for people in resource poor settings in non-pandemic times.","Moodley, Keymanthri; Rennie, Stuart; Behets, Frieda; Obasa, Adetayo Emmanuel; Yemesi, Robert; Ravez, Laurent; Kayembe, Patrick; Makindu, Darius; Mwinga, Alwyn; Jaoko, Walter",,,253

METHODS: We studied consecutive symptomatic patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 admitted to a university hospital in Milan, Italy (13.02.2020-10.04.2020). The primary outcome was any thromboembolic complication, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/myocardial infarction (MI). Secondary outcome was overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). RESULTS: We included 388 patients (median age 66 years, 68% men, 16% requiring intensive care [ICU]). Thromboprophylaxis was used in 100% of ICU patients and 75% of those on the general ward. Thromboembolic events occurred in 28 (7.7% of closed cases; 95%CI 5.4%-11.0%), corresponding to a cumulative rate of 21% (27.6% ICU, 6.6% general ward). Half of the thromboembolic events were diagnosed within 24 h of hospital admission. Forty-four patients underwent VTE imaging tests and VTE was confirmed in 16 (36%). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed in 30 patients, corresponding to 7.7% of total, and pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 10 (33% of CTPA). The rate of ischemic stroke and ACS/MI was 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Overt DIC was present in 8 (2.2%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The high number of arterial and, in particular, venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24 h of admission and the high rate of positive VTE imaging tests among the few COVID-19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific VTE diagnostic strategies and investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.","Lodigiani, Corrado; Iapichino, Giacomo; Carenzo, Luca; Cecconi, Maurizio; Ferrazzi, Paola; Sebastian, Tim; Kucher, Nils; Studt, Jan-Dirk; Sacco, Clara; Bertuzzi, Alexia; Sandri, Maria Teresa; Barco, Stefano",Thromb Res,,253

432505,Visualizing the effect of COVID-19 pandemic in India using python,2020,"Acute lung injury (ALI), a devastating illness induced by systemic inflammation e.g., sepsis or local lung inflammation e.g., COVID-19 mediated severe pneumonia, has an unacceptably high mortality and has no effective therapy. ALI is associated with increased pulmonary microvascular hyperpermeability and alveolar flooding. The small Rho GTPases, RhoA and Rac1 are central regulators of vascular permeability through cytoskeleton rearrangements. RhoA and Rac1 have opposing functional outcome: RhoA induces an endothelial contractile phenotype and barrier disruption, while Rac1 stabilizes endothelial junctions and increases barrier integrity. In ALI, RhoA activity is increased while Rac1 activity is reduced. We have shown that the activation of RhoA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated ALI, is dependent, at least in part, on a single nitration event at tyrosine (Y)34. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if the inhibition of Rac1 is also dependent on its nitration. Our data show that Rac1 inhibition by LPS is associated with its nitration that mass spectrometry identified as Y32, within the switch I region adjacent to the nucleotide-binding site. Using a molecular modeling approach, we designed a nitration shielding peptide for Rac1, designated NipR2 (nitration inhibitor peptide for the Rho GTPases 2), which attenuated the LPS-induced nitration of Rac1 at Y32, preserves Rac1 activity and attenuates the LPS-mediated disruption of the endothelial barrier in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). Using a murine model of ALI induced by intratracheal installation of LPS we found that NipR2 successfully prevented Rac1 nitration and Rac1 inhibition, and more importantly attenuated pulmonary inflammation, reduced lung injury and prevented the loss of lung function. Together, our data identify a new post-translational mechanism of Rac1 inhibition through its nitration at Y32. As NipR2 also reduces sepsis induced ALI in the mouse lung, we conclude that Rac1 nitration is a therapeutic target in ALI.","Wang, Ting; Yegambaram, Manivannan; Gross, Christine; Sun, Xutong; Lu, Qing; Wang, Hui; Wu, Xiaomin; Kangath, Archana; Tang, Haiyang; Aggarwal, Saurabh; Black, Stephen M",Redox Biol,,253

Whereas primary variants are thought to be underpinned by insufficient arousal to emotional cues, secondary variants are thought to develop as a coping mechanism in response to trauma exposure. Compared with adult samples, research on primary and secondary variants in children and adolescents under the age of 18 has only emerged in the past decade, and there is ongoing debate with regards to the identification, defining characteristics, and distinct correlates of these variants. The present systematic review synthesizes the current literature on primary and secondary variants in relation to: (1) constructs used to distinguish and define primary and secondary variants; (2) study population characteristics; (3) data analytic techniques to differentiate variants; and (4) differential associations with theoretically relevant indices related to emotional processing, maltreatment, biomarkers, and behavioral outcomes (e.g., substance use, aggression). This is the first systematic review to examine the growing literature on primary and secondary CU and psychopathy variants among youth. Findings support the distinction between youth with primary versus secondary variants and demonstrate that this distinction is related to unique clinical correlates.

Although several antiviral drugs are widely tested, none of them has been approved as specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Accumulating evidence established a hyperinflammatory states or cytokine storm in COVID-19. Among these cytokines, IL-6 plays a key role in cytokine storm and can predict the adverse clinical outcomes and fatality in these patients. Based on the evidence of the significant role of IL-6 in cytokine storm, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases as principal comorbidities, it seems that anti-cytokine therapy may be useful in patients with severe COVID-19 to reduce mortality. Recent studies demonstrated that herbal-derived natural products had immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties and exhibited exceptional act on mediators of inflammation. Parthenolide is the principal sesquiterpene lactones and the main biologically active constituent Tanacetum parthenium (commonly known as feverfew) which has could significantly reduce IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#945; production pathways established in several human cell line models in vitro and in vivo studies.

Wearing of masks and social distancing can significantly decrease transmission and spread, however, due to circumstances such as medical or dental intervention and personal choice these practices have not been universally adopted. Additional strategies are required to lessen transmission. Nasal rinses and mouthwashes, which directly impact the major sites of reception and transmission of human coronaviruses (HCoV), may provide an additional level of protection against the virus. Common over-the-counter nasal rinses and mouthwashes/gargles were tested for their ability to inactivate high concentrations of HCoV using contact times of 30 s, 1 min, and 2 min. Reductions in titers were measured by using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50 ) assay. A 1% baby shampoo nasal rinse solution inactivated HCoV greater than 99.9% with a 2-min contact time. Several over-the-counter mouthwash/gargle products including Listerine and Listerine-like products were highly effective at inactivating infectious virus with greater than 99.9% even with a 30-s contact time.

The molecular mechanisms regulating the balance between NSC self-renewal and neurogenesis are not fully understood. Using mouse in utero electroporation (IUE) technique and in vitro human NSC differentiation models including cerebral organoids (hCOs), we show here that regulator of cell cycle (RGCC) modulates NSC self-renewal and neuronal differentiation by affecting cell cycle regulation and spindle orientation. RGCC deficiency hampers normal cell cycle process and dysregulates the mitotic spindle, thus driving more cells to divide asymmetrically. These modulations diminish the NSC population and cause NSC pre-differentiation that eventually leads to brain developmental malformation in hCOs. We further show that RGCC might regulate NSC spindle orientation by affecting the organization of centrosome and microtubules. Our results demonstrate that RGCC is essential to maintain the NSC pool during cortical development and suggest that RGCC defects could have etiological roles in human brain malformations.","Guo, Zhenming; Chen, Mengxia; Chao, Yiming; Cai, Chunhai; Liu, Liangjie; Zhao, Li; Li, Linbo; Bai, Qing-Ran; Xu, Yanxin; Niu, Weibo; Shi, Lei; Bi, Yan; Ren, Decheng; Yuan, Fan; Shi, Shuyue; Zeng, Qian; Han, Ke; Shi, Yi; Bian, Shan; He, Guang",EMBO Rep,,253

Following the recognition of this syndrome, multiple consensus guidelines have been released to risk stratify patients presenting with possible symptoms after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. All guidelines rapidly identify VITT in patients with the complete triad of thrombocytopenia, thrombosis and elevated D-dimers after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. However, with earlier recognition of the associated symptoms, the clinical manifestations are likely to be more heterogeneous and represent an evolving spectrum of disease. In this setting, current guidelines may lack the sensitivity to detect early cases of VITT and risk missed or delayed diagnoses. The broad clinical phenotype and challenges associated with diagnosis of VITT are highlighted in our present case series of four patients with confirmed VITT. Dependent on the guidance used, each patient could have been classified as a low probability of VITT at presentation. The present study highlights the issues associated with the recognition of VITT, the limitations of current guidance and the need for heightened clinical vigilance as our understanding of the pathophysiology of this novel condition evolves.","Lavin, Michelle; Elder, Patrick T; O039,; Keeffe, Denis; Enright, Helen; Ryan, Eileen; Kelly, Anna; El Hassadi, Ezzat; McNicholl, Feargal P; Benson, Gary; Le, Giao N; Byrne, Mary; Ryan, Kevin; Connell, Niamh M; Donnell, James S",Br. j. haematol,,253

The history of the random growth process is often unobserved but contains important information such as the source of the infection. We consider the problem of statistical inference on aspects of the latent history using only a single snapshot of the final tree. Our approach is to apply random labels to the observed unlabeled tree and analyze the resulting distribution of the growth process, conditional on the final outcome. We show that this conditional distribution is tractable under a shape-exchangeability condition, which we introduce here, and that this condition is satisfied for many popular models for randomly growing trees such as uniform attachment, linear preferential attachment and uniform attachment on a $D$-regular tree. For inference of the root under shape-exchangeability, we propose computationally scalable algorithms for constructing confidence sets with valid frequentist coverage as well as bounds on the expected size of the confidence sets. We also provide efficient sampling algorithms that extend our methods to a wide class of inference problems.","Crane, Harry; Xu, Min",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08794v2.pdf,253

The interrelation with age and the presence of chronic non-communicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking) seems to go further than what would be explained by the prevalence and distribution of both. The drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are in many cases the backbone for the management of these diseases, it has been known for a long time that these drugs significantly increase the expression of receptors for angiotensin conversion enzyme type 2 in the lung tissue. This fact, together with the knowledge that the route of entry of the virus into the cell is precisely the ACE-2 receptor, initiated a hypothesis, based on very low-quality evidence, which quickly became generalized in the media, that the use of these drugs could be negative and that they should be interrupted immediately. The response of practically all Scientific Societies was almost immediate, with the precise indication that treatment with these drugs should not be discontinued, since the evidence of their usefulness is based on very solid and high-quality evidence. Simultaneously, a different hypothesis also appeared, also based on very preliminary evidence, that these drugs are not only harmful but also beneficial, however these medicaments are not yet accepted as agents for the prevention or treatment of this disease or its complications.

PTOX derivatives (PTOXs) could arrest the cell cycle, block the transitorily generated DNA/RNA breaks, and blunt the growth-stimulation by targeting topoisomerase II, tubulin, or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. Since 1983, etoposide (VP-16) is being used in frontline cancer therapy against various cancer types, such as small cell lung cancer and testicular cancer. Surprisingly, VP-16 (ClinicalTrials NTC04356690) was also redeveloped to treat the cytokine storm in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in phase II in April 2020. The treatment aims at dampening the cytokine storm and is based on etoposide in the case of central nervous system. However, the initial version of PTOX was far from perfect. Almost all podophyllotoxin derivatives, including the FDA-approved drugs VP-16 and teniposide, were seriously limited in clinical therapy due to systemic toxicity, drug resistance, and low bioavailability. To meet this challenge, scientists have devoted continuous efforts to discover new candidate drugs and have developed drug strategies. This review focuses on the current clinical treatment of PTOXs and the prospective analysis for improving druggability in the rational design of new generation PTOX-derived drugs.","Zhao, Wei; Cong, Ying; Li, Hong-Mei; Li, Shengying; Shen, Yuemao; Qi, Qingsheng; Zhang, Youming; Li, Yue-Zhong; Tang, Ya-Jie",Nat. prod. rep,,253

It started in China in December 2019, and it rapidly spread throughout Italy, which has been the most affected country after China. The pandemia touched all countries with similarly negative effects on population, countries and healthcare structures. OBJECTIVE: Evolution of the Covid-19 infection as well as the way such a phenomena can be characterized in terms of resources and planning, has to be considered. One of the most critical resource items has been the less of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) places with respect to the infection trend and critical hospitalization. METHODS: We propose a model to estimate the needed number of places in ICUs during the most acute phase of the infection. We also define a scalable geographic model to plan emergency and future Covid-19 patients management by planning their reallocation in health structures of other region. RESULTS: We apply and assess the prediction method both at national and regional scale. ICU beds prediction has been tested with respect to real data provided by the Italian gouvernement. We show that our model is able to predict with a reliable error in terms of complexity of resources related to estimation parameters used for healthcare structures. Also, the proposed method is scalable at geographic level. This is relevant for pandemic phenomena as Covid-19 that have shown their different incidence even among northern and southern Italian regions. CONCLUSIONS: The contribution can be useful for decision-makers to plan resources to guarantee patients management, but it can be considered a reference model for the potential upcoming and feared virus increasing phase as well as for similar coronavirus diffusion.","Guzzi, Pietro H; Tradigo, Giuseppe; Veltri, Pierangelo",,,253

The objective of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the role of preoperative computed tomography (CT) screening for COVID-19 in a population of COVID-19 asymptomatic patients scheduled for cardiac surgery. Between the 29th of March and the 26th of May 2020, patients asymptomatic for COVID-19 underwent a CT-scan the day before surgery, with reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) reserved for abnormal scan results. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of abnormal scans, which was evaluated using the CO-RADS score, a COVID-19 specific grading system. In a secondary analysis, the rate of abnormal scans was compared between the screening cohort and matched historical controls who underwent routine preoperative CT-screening prior to the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak. Of the 109 patients that underwent CT-screening, an abnormal scan result was observed in 7.3% (95% confidence interval: 3.2-14.0%). One patient, with a normal screening CT, was tested positive for COVID-19, with the first positive RT-PCR on the ninth day after surgery. A rate of preoperative CT-scan abnormalities of 8% (nâ¯=â¯8) was found in the unexposed historical controls (P > 0.999). In asymptomatic patients undergoing cardiac surgery, preoperative screening for COVID-19 using computed tomography will identify pulmonary abnormalities in a small percentage of patients that do not seem to have COVID-19. Depending on the prevalence of COVID-19, this results in an unfavorable positive predictive value of CT screening. Care should be taken when considering CT as a screening tool prior to cardiac surgery.","Knol, Wiebe G; Thuijs, Daniel J F M; Odink, Arlette E; Maurovich-Horvat, Pál; de Jong, Pim A; Krestin, Gabriel P; Bogers, Ad J J C; Budde, Ricardo P J",Semin. thorac. cardiovasc. surg,,253
439399,"Integrating online and offline data for crisis management: Online geolocalized emotion, policy response, and local mobility during the COVID crisis",2021,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the medical education platform for students in the United States of America (USA). In that light, medical schools had to rapidly rearrange the dynamics of their educational curricula from the traditional platforms, to incorporate telemedicine. The telemedicine platform is supported in many specialties, allowing students various options to continue their education without interruption during the COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond. Telemedicine platforms are projected to grow exponentially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing a segue for medical schools to modify their curricula by incorporating telemedicine programs. These distant-, e-learning (tele-education) programs align with the recommendations and guidelines for practicing social distancing. In this article, we surveyed fourth-year medical students to better understand their views on multiple aspects of e-learning, and its impact on their medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed the medical students' experiences, satisfaction, insight and knowledge with e-learning, tele-education, telehealth, and their related modalities during COVID-19. We provide an organized overview and analysis of the main factors that influence medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic, while bringing forth the main challenges, limitations, and emerging approaches in the field of telemedicine and its application as it relates to medical education and e-learning across medical specialties. We outline the main themes and ideas that the medical students voiced, as to how their medical education is being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and how they will incorporate telemedicine and tele-education in their future career. A cross-sectional, mixed-method survey was developed and distributed via Google Surveys to 181 University at Buffalo, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, United States of America, 4th year medical students, in December 2020. Results were compiled and analyzed after a 6-day open period for responses to be submitted. The survey instrument consisted of questions that inquire about the students' perspectives as it relates to their rapid switch from their traditional method of learning to the on-line version of medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 65 students responded to the survey, of which 63 completed the survey. More than half of the students (n = 63, 57%) indicated that both their specialty of interest, and (n = 21, 33%) their sub-internships were impacted by the temporary lockdown, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students also indicated that the top three specialties that were affected included surgery, internal medicine and obstetrics and gynecology. When the students were asked if they were satisfied with the use of aquifer for their health care e-learning, only 35% of the students were satisfied. The students expressed that the school's administration team did a good job in developing the new tele-education curriculum for those in clinical training. In addition, responses indicated that students were open to case-based video learning and readings, when combined with the abbreviated clinical exposure during the make-up ""clinical immersions periods"" allowed for adequate learning. Overall, the survey responses show that more than half, approximately 54% of the medical students utilized telemedicine platforms during their clerkships that were impacted by COVID-19. The 4th-year medical students did not find tele-education and e-learning to be as effective as traditional medical education that combines in-person didactic classroom instructions and in-person face-to-face in hospital clerkships. Students felt that the telemedicine program that was rapidly set up due to the COVID-19 'lockdown' was fragmented, since it was not a formal integration of a telemedicine E-learning program. Students would have preferred more 'real' cases to follow, instead of the ready-made, aquifer type of cases. Telemedicine has significant potential to address many of the challenges facing the medical education environment today. We believe now that people have become comfortable with this method of teaching, that even after the pandemic ends, we will continue to see tele-education used as a platform for medical education.","Franklin, Gillian; Martin, Clare; Ruszaj, Marc; Matin, Maliyat; Kataria, Akaash; Hu, Jinwei; Brickman, Arlen; Elkin, Peter L",,,253

The various pandemics are connected; they exacerbate and intensify existing conditions of colonial inequality and injustice. The political and economic marginalisation of Māori and Pasifika within Aotearoa New Zealand ensures that Covid-19 will have disproportionate impacts upon them. Covid-19’s impacts will be felt in the academy as everywhere else. The immediate issue will be the culling of less popular ‘uneconomic’ courses, and of precarious instructors (where Māori and Pacific teachers are over-represented). Colonisation never ended. Ongoing domination is secured through the reproduction of social life, including via social institutions like the university. While sociology likes to think of itself as the critical edge, it often fails to be so in relation to its own assumptions. In order for sociology to be part of the solution, instead of simply perpetuating the problem of racism as it is wont to do, its practitioners must recognise our place in the world, must speak to our ways of knowing and being, and must validate the aspirations of Māori and Pacific communities, Māori and Pacific students and Māori and Pacific staff.","Barber, Simon; Naepi, Sereana",J.

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 starts with the bonding of the virus to ACE2 receptors expressed in many tissues, and the triggered excessive immune response plays a critical role in the course of the disease. The cytokine storm that occurs upon excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is considered responsible for the severe progression of the disease and the organ damage. However, the accurate pathophysiological mechanism of the disease, which progresses with various clinical presentations, is still substantially unknown. While various studies have been conducted on the effect of genetic polymorphism on the course and severity of the disease, the presence of a significant effect has not been proven yet. The clinical course of the disease is variable, with clinical representation ranging from 81% mild course to 14% severe course along with 5% critical course in patients. Asymptomatic course is considered to be higher than expected, although its frequency is not known exactly. Older adults and those with comorbidities are exposed to a more severe disease course. The disease progress with various symptoms, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, malaise, myalgia, taste and smell dysfunctions, diarrhea, and headache. A range of complications (acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolic conditions, arrhythmia and cardiac events, secondary infections) could be seen during the course of the disease.

440636,The Food and COVID-19 NYC Archive: Mapping the Pandemic's Effect on Food in Real Time,2020,"A pneumonia-like disease of unknown origin caused a catastrophe in Wuhan city, China. This disease spread to 215 countries affecting a wide range of people. World health organization (WHO) called it a pandemic and it was officially named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2 (SARS CoV-2), also known as Corona virus disease (COVID-19). This pandemic compelled countries to enforce a socio-economic lockdown to prevent its widespread. This paper focuses on how the particulate matter pollution was reduced during the lockdown period (23 March to April 15, 2020) as compared to before lockdown. Both ground-based and satellite observations were used to identify the improvement in air quality of Pakistan with primary focus on four major cities of Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar. Both datasets have shown a substantial reduction in PM2.5 pollution levels (ranging from 13% to 33% in case of satellite observations, while 23%-58% in ground-based observations) across Pakistan. Result shows a higher rate of COVID-19 spread in major cities of Pakistan with poor air quality conditions. Yet more research is needed in order to establish linkage between COVID-19 spread and air pollution. However, it can be partially attributed to both higher rate of population density and frequent exposure of population to enhanced levels of PM2.5 concentrations before lockdown period.","Ali, Syeda Mahnoor; Malik, Fatima; Anjum, Muhammad Shehzaib; Siddiqui, Ghazanfar Farooq; Anwar, Muhammad Naveed; Lam, Su Shiung; Nizami, Abdul-Sattar; Khokhar, Muhammad Fahim",Environ Res,,253

The development of targeted drugs is held back due to a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the perturbation of cell physiology observed after viral infection. Recently, several approaches, aimed at identifying cellular proteins that may contribute to COVID-19 pathology, have been reported. Albeit valuable, this information offers limited mechanistic insight as these efforts have produced long lists of cellular proteins, the majority of which are not annotated to any cellular pathway. We have embarked in a project aimed at bridging this mechanistic gap by developing a new bioinformatic approach to estimate the functional distance between a subset of proteins and a list of pathways. A comprehensive literature search allowed us to annotate, in the SIGNOR 2.0 resource, causal information underlying the main molecular mechanisms through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and related coronaviruses affect the host-cell physiology. Next, we developed a new strategy that enabled us to link SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins to cellular phenotypes via paths of causal relationships. Remarkably, the extensive information about inhibitors of signaling proteins annotated in SIGNOR 2.0 makes it possible to formulate new potential therapeutic strategies. The proposed approach, which is generally applicable, generated a literature-based causal network that can be used as a framework to formulate informed mechanistic hypotheses on COVID-19 etiology and pathology.","Perfetto, Livia; Micarelli, Elisa; Iannuccelli, Marta; Lo Surdo, Prisca; Giuliani, Giulio; Latini, Sara; Pugliese, Giusj Monia; Massacci, Giorgia; Vumbaca, Simone; Riccio, Federica; Fuoco, Claudia; Paoluzi, Serena; Castagnoli, Luisa; Cesareni, Gianni; Licata, Luana; Sacco, Francesca",,,253

A global health emergency demands an urgent development of rapid diagnostic tools and advanced therapeutics for the mitigation of COVID-19. To cope with the current crisis, nanotechnology offers a number of approaches based on abundance and versatile functioning. Despite major developments in early diagnostics and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is still a need to find effective nanomaterials with low cost, high stability and easy use. Nanozymes are nanomaterials with innate enzyme-like characteristics and exhibit great potential for various biomedical applications such as disease diagnosis and anti-viral agents. Overall the potential and contribution of nanozymes in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection i.e., rapid detection, inhibition of the virus at various stages, and effective vaccine development strategies, is not fully explored. This paper discusses the utility and potential of nanozymes from the perspective of COVID-19. Moreover, future research directions and potential applications of nanozymes are highlighted to overcome the challenges related to early diagnosis and therapeutics development for the SARS-CoV-2. We anticipate the current perspective will play an effective role in the existing response to the COVID-19 crisis.","Ali, Jafar Elahi Saira Naveed Ali Asghar Waseem Hassan Abid Rameesha Mohamed Mohamed M.",Nanomaterials,,253

There has been little investigation into its influence on the multifaceted aspects of postgraduate medical training, which feeds into how trainees consider themselves professionally and the concept of professional identity or 'being a doctor'. A review of the medical, socio-political and educational literature reveals that the impact on the professional identity development of trainees is influenced by several perspectives from the trainee, trainer and the public. Gross reduction in working hours has no doubt decreased the raw volume of clinical experiences. However, to counteract this, smarter learning processes have evolved, including narrative reflection, supervised learning events, and a greater awareness of coaching and training among trainers.","Mukherjee, Soumya; Meacock, James; Kissane, Eleanor; Pal, Debasish",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),,253
441412,‘Nigeria is fighting Covid-419’: A multimodal critical discourse analysis of political protest in Nigerian coronavirus-related internet memes,2021,"BACKGROUND: Intraurban sociodemographic risk factors for COVID-19 have yet to be fully understood. We investigated the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and sociodemographic factors in Barcelona at a fine-grained geography. METHODS: This cross-sectional ecological study is based on 10 550 confirmed cases of COVID-19 registered during the first wave in the municipality of Barcelona (population 1.64 million). We considered 16 variables on the demographic structure, urban density, household conditions, socioeconomic status, mobility and health characteristics for 76 geographical units of analysis (neighbourhoods), using a lasso analysis to identify the most relevant variables. We then fitted a multivariate Quasi-Poisson model that explained the COVID-19 incidence by neighbourhood in relation to these variables. RESULTS: Neighbourhoods with: (1) greater population density, (2) an aged population structure, (3) a high presence of nursing homes, (4) high proportions of individuals who left their residential area during lockdown and/or (5) working in health-related occupations were more likely to register a higher number of cases of COVID-19. Conversely, COVID-19 incidence was negatively associated with (6) percentage of residents with post-secondary education and (7) population born in countries with a high Human Development Index. CONCLUSION: Like other historical pandemics, the incidence of COVID-19 is associated with neighbourhood sociodemographic factors with a greater burden faced by already deprived areas. Because urban social and health injustices already existed in those geographical units with higher COVID-19 incidence in Barcelona, the current pandemic is likely to reinforce both health and social inequalities, and urban environmental injustice all together.","López-Gay, Antonio; Spijker, Jeroen; Cole, Helen V S; Marques, Antonio G; Triguero-Mas, Margarita; Anguelovski, Isabelle; Marí-Dell039,; Olmo, Marc; Módenes, Juan A; Álamo-Junquera, Dolores; López-Gallego, Fernando; Borrell, Carme",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,253

The aim was ""to ascertain the characteristics of patients, uncertainty over diagnosis, or features of the emergency response to the pandemic that could be modified to mitigate against future excess deaths"". METHODS: Review of the entire pathway of care of patients whose death was registered in Salford during the 8 week period of the first wave (primary care, secondary care, 111 and 999 calls) in order to create a single record of healthcare prior to death. An expert panel judged avoidability of death against the National Mortality Case Record Review Programme scale. The panel identified themes using a structured judgement review format. RESULTS: There were 522 deaths including 197 in hospital, and 190 in care homes. 51% of patients were female, 81% Caucasian, age 79 ± 9 years. Dementia was present in 35%, COVID-19 was cause of death in 44%. Healthcare contact prior to death was most frequently with primary care (81% of patients). Forty-six patients (9%) had healthcare appointments cancelled (median 1 cancellation, range 1-9). Fewer than half of NHS 111 calls were answered during this period. 18% of deaths contained themes consistent with some degree of avoidability. In people aged &#8805;75 years who lived at home this was 53%, in care home residents 29% and in patients with learning disability 44% (n = 9). Common themes were; delays in patients presenting to care providers (10%), delays in testing (17%), avoidable exposure to COVID-19 (26%), delays in provider response (5%), and sub-optimal care (11%). For avoidability scores of 2 or 3 (indicating more than 50% chance of avoidability), 44% of cases had > 2 themes. CONCLUSIONS: The initial emergency response had unforeseen consequences resulting in late presentation, sub-optimal assessments, and delays in receiving care. Death in more vulnerable groups was more likely to display avoidability themes.","Tankel, Jeremy W; Ratcliffe, David; Smith, Martin; Mullarkey, Andrew; Pover, Jennifer; Marsden, Zoe; Bennett, Paula; Green, Darren",BMC Emerg Med,,253

441980,"Comparison of land surface temperature before, during and after the COVID-19 lockdown using landsat imagery: A case study of Casablanca city, Morocco",2021,"BACKGROUND: Antifungal drug resistance in dermatophytes was first reported shortly after the turn of the millennium and has today been reported in Trichophyton and occasionally in Microsporum, but not in Epidermophyton species. Although drug resistance in dermatophytes is not routinely investigated, resistance in Trichophyton spp. is increasingly reported worldwide. The highest rates are observed in India (36% and 68% for terbinafine (MIC &#8805;4 mg/L) and fluconazole (MICs &#8805;16â¯mg/L), respectively), and apparently involve the spread of a unique clade related to the T. mentagrophytes/T. interdigitale complex. OBJECTIVES: The EUCAST-AFST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Subcommittee on Antifungal Susceptibility Testing) has released a new method (E.Def 11.0) for the antifungal susceptibility testing against microconidia-forming dermatophytes including tentative MIC ranges for QC control strains and tentative breakpoints against T. rubrum and T. interdigitale. Here, the details of the new procedure E.Def 11.0 are described. SOURCES: This technical note is based on the multicentre validation of the EUCAST dermatophyte AFST method, the mould testing method (E.Def 9.3.2) and the updated QC tables for antifungal susceptibility testing document, v 5.0 (available on the EUCAST website). CONTENTS: The method is based on the EUCAST microdilution method for moulds but significant differences include: a) an altered test medium selective for dermatophytes; b) an altered incubation time and temperature; and c) a different endpoint criterion (spectrophotometric determination) of fungal growth. It can easily be implemented in laboratories already performing EUCAST microdilution methods and has been validated for terbinafine, voriconazole, itraconazole and amorolfine against T. rubrum and T. interdigitale. IMPLICATIONS: This standardised procedure with automated endpoint reading will allow broader implementation of susceptibility testing of dermatophytes and thus facilitate earlier appropriate therapy. This is important, as resistance is rapidly emerging and largely underdiagnosed.","Arendrup, Maiken Cavling; Kahlmeter, Gunnar; Guinea, Jesus; Meletiadis, Joseph",Clin. microbiol. infect,,253

The aim of this study was to identify changes in the subjective sleepiness of pupils during the 1.5-year period and to elucidate factors associated with changes in sleepiness. Questionnaire surveys about pupils' sleep habits and the Japanese version of the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS-J) were conducted longitudinally at one elementary school in June 2019, January 2020, and June 2020. The average &#8710;PDSS score was 0.94 ± 5.51 (mean ± standard deviation) from June 2019 to January 2020 and -1.65 ± 5.71 (t[498] = 6.13, p < 0.01) from January 2020 to June 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that decreasing social jetlag was associated with decreasing PDSS scores (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.96, p = 0.02) during the school closure. A less restrictive school schedule secondary to a COVID-19-related school closure decreased sleepiness in children and was associated with decreasing social jetlag.","Komada, Yoko; Ishibashi, Yoshiki; Hagiwara, Shunta; Kobori, Mariko; Shimura, Akiyoshi",,,253

443450,Leadership influence on the relationship between communication satisfaction and job satisfaction in computer-mediated communication environments,2021,"Background: Breast reconstruction has a well-documented positive impact on the psychosocial well-being of women recovering from breast cancer. Rates of breast cancer diagnoses are rising, and more women are seeking mastectomy as treatment and as prophylaxis. Methods: Postmastectomy breast reconstruction often begins at the time of mastectomy in coordination with the oncologic breast surgeons. Immediate breast reconstruction increases complication rate (11% vs 4%) and unplanned reoperation rate (7% vs 4%), requiring more personnel and resources used during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of patient care. Discussion: In the setting of global pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), breast reconstruction demands a unique and nuanced approach, as most forms of breast reconstruction can occur successfully in a delayed fashion. While this may prolong the overall time until completion of reconstruction, other factors come into play in the setting of a communicable (potentially deadly) illness. Factors that must be considered include allocation of essential resources and protection of patients and families from disease transmission. Conclusions: Plastic surgeons performing breast reconstruction must take these factors into account when counseling their patients, colleagues, and institutions and be proactive in determining which procedures are time-critical and which should be postponed until the disaster situation has relieved.","Chetta, Matthew D; Schoenbrunner, Anna R; Lee, Clara N",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,,253

In France, teachers and radiography students in initial training, not specially prepared for this, had to adapt. An evaluation of the system was proposed to the students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire with 4 main sections (pedagogy, communication, learning and concerns) was sent to 91 students at the end of the semester. RESULTS: 91 responses were received. The slideshows with sound or presented during a virtual class are appreciated by the students. Online quizzes are ideal for learning/reviewing. For assessments, individual assignments and online questionnaires are appreciated. Teacher/student interaction via e-mail or video conferencing was considered satisfactory by the large majority of students. Student-student interactions via social networks, for course explanations or document exchange, are very suitable. The majority of students felt they were working a lot and much more compared to face-to-face teaching. Less than half of the students worked more than 20 h per week. Their motivation varied widely. Organizational habits were disrupted, but the autonomy granted was appreciated. The students were mainly concerned about the health of their loved ones and not about their own health. DISCUSSION: The use of distance education tools requires teacher commitment and technical skills. The frequency of communication by e-mail and/or videoconference between members of the teaching team and students must be adapted to the situation. Exchanges by e-mail allow for traceability, while videoconferencing allows direct interaction and a way out of isolation. Autonomy, appreciated by the students, was nevertheless combined with a strong variation in motivation; the anxiety-provoking period in which pedagogical continuity was built up may explain this contradictory observation. CONCLUSION: The results obtained largely confirm the data in the literature. The experience gained through this survey should lead teachers to continue their reflection by test/integrating and evaluating distance education systems, while continuing face-to-face activities.","Zorn, Claudine; Feffer, Marie-Laurence; Bauer, Éric; Dillenseger, Jean-Philippe",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences (Online),,253

445385,Regional drivers’ effects and policies of COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest global health threats facing humanity in recent memory. This study aimed to explore influences on hygienic practices, a set of key transmission behaviours, in relation to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour change (Michie et al., 2011). DESIGN: Data from the first wave of a longitudinal survey study were used, launched in the early stages of the UK COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were 2025 adults aged 18 and older, representative of the UK population, recruited by a survey company from a panel of research participants. Participants self-reported motivation, capability, and opportunity to enact hygienic practices during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Using regression models, we found that all three COM-B components significantly predicted good hygienic practices, with motivation having the greatest influence on behaviour. Breaking this down further, the subscales psychological capability, social opportunity, and reflective motivation positively influenced behaviour. Reflective motivation was largely driving behaviour, with those highest in reflective motivation scoring 51% more on the measure of hygienic practices compared with those with the lowest scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have clear implications for the design of behaviour change interventions to promote hygienic practices. Interventions should focus on increasing and maintaining motivation to act and include elements that promote and maintain social support and knowledge of COVID-19 transmission. Groups in particular need of targeting for interventions to increase hygienic practices are males and those living in cities and suburbs.","Gibson Miller, Jilly; Hartman, Todd K; Levita, Liat; Martinez, Anton P; Mason, Liam; McBride, Orla; McKay, Ryan; Murphy, Jamie; Shevlin, Mark; Stocks, Thomas V A; Bennett, Kate M; Bentall, Richard P",Br J Health Psychol,,253

446592,Group dynamics when battling a pandemic,2020,"SESSION TITLE: Critical Care Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: Concerns about world-wide ventilator shortages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to multiple projects at major academic institutions that seek to find alternative means for emergency ventilation The goal of these projects has been to come up with a functional emergency ventilator that can be built and supplied to hospitals on short notice Some of the mechanical devices being designed require specialized or 3D printed parts, and many use PLC boards that must be programmed This isn't necessarily a disadvantage, but we wondered if we could come up with an equally reliable design that did not require any special parts or PLC programming We wanted something that was easy to build, easy to operate, and easy to maintain, and we wanted it to be made from only a few parts that are very easy to source The idea to use pneumatic air to power our ventilator arose from my experience working as an engineer on ships I found shipboard automation systems that were controlled by compressed air to be reliable and easy to operate Conveniently, most hospitals already have medical air supplies METHODS: Our e-ventilator design consists of an air pressure regulator, a simple 12 VDC circuit that operates a 5 way/2 position solenoid valve, 2 fine control manual regulating valves to adjust RR and the I/E ratio, and an air motor with induction sensors to monitor piston position (for adjusting tidal volume) RESULTS: Preliminary testing of our pneumatic e-ventilator has been successful Our design allows for simple, manual control of tidal volume (0-1000ml), RR, and I/E ratio PEEP can be set by the adjustable spring-controlled valve located on the breathing apparatus We are now preparing for more extensive tests to determine constant-use reliability against simulated lung pressure CONCLUSIONS: Our e-ventilator design costs approximately $200/unit in parts These parts are easy to source and the ventilator is easy to assemble and operate Additionally, many of the parts are interchangeable with alternative options CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: If a pandemic similar to COVID-19 were to strike a remote region of an underdeveloped county, we believe that an ICU center serving the local population could be supplied a ""kit” consisting of 10-20 pneumatic e-ventilator units, 2 air compressors (one for back up), an air receiver, a pressure regulating valve, and an air filter/dryer Each ventilator unit would consist of the parts and instructions necessary to quickly assemble a simple, functioning pneumatic ventilator The ventilators could be pre-assembled, but because there are few parts and assembly is quite easy, we believe assembly on site might be beneficial for transportation purposes, and also because it would help those on site better understand the set-up The air compressors could provide additional benefits–compressed air can be used to operate other medical devices and tools, as well as to pump water DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Faiz Baqai, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by John Harman, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by UMER Khan, source=Web Response","Harman, J.; Baqai, F.; Khan, U.",Chest,,253

447510,Food security and Canada's agricultural system challenged by COVID-19,2020,"This article reflects on the dissenting act of mobility as articulated by migrant workers in India, who, during the nationwide lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, are walking back home, hundreds of miles away, in lieu of public transport. Their mobility—precisely, the act of walking—has thus acquired a metaphoric status, and laid bare the ideological practices of territorializing the city-space. This article argues that the migrant worker's mobility, from within the axiomatic of the prevalent ""mobility regime,"" can be read as a powerful metaphor of our tensions within the global political-economic order that the pandemic has so starkly exposed. The article provokes less literal, but more literary, understandings of mobilities in general, in order to come to grips with the manifold contradictions, paradoxes, and counteractions in the way the world moves.

Researches are ongoing to develop vaccines and traditional methods of Medicine and Biology have been applied in diagnosis and treatment. Though there are success stories of recovered cases as of November 10, 2020, there are no approved treatments and vaccines for COVID-19. As the pandemic continues to spread, current measures rely on prevention, surveillance, and containment. In light of this, emerging technologies for tackling COVID-19 become inevitable. Emerging technologies including geospatial technology, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, telemedicine, blockchain, 5G technology, smart applications, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), robotics, and additive manufacturing are substantially important for COVID-19 detecting, monitoring, diagnosing, screening, surveillance, mapping, tracking, and creating awareness. Therefore, this study aimed at providing a comprehensive review of these technologies for tackling COVID-19 with emphasis on the features, challenges, and country of domiciliation. Our results show that performance of the emerging technologies is not yet stable due to nonavailability of enough COVID-19 dataset, inconsistency in some of the dataset available, nonaggregation of the dataset due to contrasting data format, missing data, and noise. Moreover, the security and privacy of people's health information is not totally guaranteed. Thus, further research is required to strengthen the current technologies and there is a strong need for the emergence of a robust computationally intelligent model for early differential diagnosis of COVID-19.","Mbunge, Elliot; Akinnuwesi, Boluwaji; Fashoto, Stephen G; Metfula, Andile S; Mashwama, Petros",,,253

From low-skilled, low-paid services (such as passenger transport) to highly skilled and high-paying project-based work (such as the development of artificial intelligence algorithms), a broad range of tasks can be carried out through a variety of digital platforms. Our paper discusses the platform-based content, working conditions, employment status, and advocacy problems. Terminological and methodological problems are dealt with in-depth in the course of the literature review, together with the 'gray areas' of work and employment regulation. To examine some of the complex dynamics of this fast-evolving arena, we focus on the unsuccessful market entry of the digital platform company Uber in Hungary 2016 and the relationship to institutional-regulatory platform-based work standards. Dilemmas relevant to the enforcement of labor law regarding platform-based work are also paid special attention to the study. Employing a digital workforce is a significant challenge not only for labor law regulation but also for stakeholder advocacy.","Mako, Csaba; Illessy, Miklos; Pap, Jozsef; Nosratabadi, Saeed",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05651v1.pdf,253

A standardized guideline on isolation technique for exposed HD patients is not available. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of different isolation strategies on the prevention of secondary viral transmission and clinical outcomes among exposed HD patients.During the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea, 116 patients in 3 HD units were incidentally exposed to individuals with confirmed MERS-CoV infection and underwent different types of isolation, which were as follows: single-room isolation (nâ=â54, 47%), cohort isolation (nâ=â46, 40%), and self-imposed quarantine (nâ=â16, 13%). The primary outcome was rate of secondary viral transmission. The secondary outcome measures were changes in clinical and biochemical markers during the isolation period, difference in clinical and biochemical markers according to the types of isolation practice, and effect of isolation practice on patient survival.During a mean isolation period of 15 days, no further cases of secondary transmission were detected among HD patients. Plasma hemoglobin, serum calcium, and serum albumin levels and single-pool Kt/V decreased during the isolation period but normalized thereafter. Patients who were subjected to self-imposed quarantine had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lower total cholesterol level, and lower Kt/V than those who underwent single-room or cohort isolation. During the 24-month follow-up period, 12 patients died. However, none of the deaths occurred during the isolation period, and no differences were observed in patient survival rate according to different isolation strategies.Although 116 participants in 3 HD units were incidentally exposed to MERS-CoV during the 2015 outbreak in Korea, strict patient surveillance and proper isolation practice prevented secondary transmission of the virus. Thus, a renal disaster protocol, which includes proper contact surveillance and isolation practice, must be established in the future to accommodate the needs of HD patients during disasters or outbreaks.","Park, Hayne Cho; Lee, Sang-Ho; Kim, Juhee; Kim, Do Hyoung; Cho, AJin; Jeon, Hee Jung; Oh, Jieun; Noh, Jung-Woo; Jeong, Da-Wun; Kim, Yang-Gyun; Lee, Chang-Hee; Yoo, Kyung Don; Lee, Young-Ki",Medicine (Baltimore),,253

451922,"Use apps to stay focused and reduce stress while working from home, meeting virtually",2020,"BACKGROUND: Posaconazole-induced pseudohyperaldosteronism (PIPH) has been associated with elevated posaconazole serum concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the difficult task of managing patients with PIPH while maintaining the efficacy of antifungal therapy. Commonly, modifications to posaconazole therapy are utilized in managing PIPH, including dosage reduction of posaconazole or switch to an alternative antifungal. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the management of patients diagnosed with PIPH and their response to various therapeutic interventions. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 20 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with PIPH. Patient data collected included blood pressure, electrolytes, endocrine laboratory values and posaconazole serum concentrations collected before and after therapeutic intervention. RESULTS: Of 20 patients included, 17 patients (85%) underwent therapeutic modification, with posaconazole dose reduction (n = 11) as the most common change. Other modifications included discontinuation (n = 3), switch to an alternative antifungal (n = 2) and addition of spironolactone (n = 1). Clinical improvement (decrease in systolic blood pressure and increase in serum potassium) was observed in 9 of 17 patients (52.9%). An average decrease in systolic blood pressure of 7.1 mmHg and increase in serum potassium of 0.22 mmol/L was observed following therapeutic modification. CONCLUSIONS: We report our experience with PIPH management, for which there is no universally effective strategy. We utilized a stepwise approach for management, starting with posaconazole dose reduction and repeat assessment of clinical and laboratory parameters. If resolution of PIPH is not achieved, an alternative triazole antifungal or the addition of an aldosterone antagonist are additional potential interventions. It is possible for PIPH to persist after therapeutic modification despite these interventions. Thus, early diagnosis and continuous monitoring is warranted.","Davis, Matthew R; Nguyen, Minh-Vu H; Gintjee, Thomas J; Odermatt, Alex; Young, Brian Y; Thompson, George R",J. antimicrob. chemother,,253

(Special Issue: Climate change, COP26 and the crucible of crisis.)",2020,"OBJECTIVES: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an unprecedented need for rapid large-scale diagnostic testing to prompt clinical and public health interventions. Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays recommended by the World Health Organization are being used by clinical and public health laboratories and typically target regions of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) coding region. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. This study aimed to clarify the clinical performances of the primers/probe sets designed by US CDC and Charité/Berlin to help clinical laboratories in assay selection for SARS-CoV-2 routine detection METHODS: We compared the clinical performances of the recommended primers/probe sets using one hundred nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients who were clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. An additional 30 ""pre-intervention screening"" samples from patients who were not suspected of COVID-19 were also included in this study. We also performed sequence alignment between 31064 European SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern genomes and the recommended primer/probe sets. RESULTS: The present study demonstrates substantial differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection sensitivity among the primer/probe sets recommended by the World Health Organization especially for low-level viral loads. The alignment of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences reveals that the genetic diversity remains relatively low at the primer/probe binding sites. However, multiple nucleotide mismatches might contribute to false negatives. CONCLUSION: An understanding of the limitations depending on the targeted genes and primer/probe sets may influence the selection of molecular detection assays by clinical laboratories.","Anantharajah, Ahalieyah; Helaers, Raphael; Defour, Jean-Philippe; Olive, Nathalie; Kabera, Florence; Croonen, Luc; Deldime, Francoise; Vaerman, Jean-Luc; Barbée, Cindy; Bodéus, Monique; Scohy, Anais; Verroken, Alexia; Rodriguez-Villalobos, Hector; Kabamba-Mukadi, Benoit",J Virol Methods,,253
453790,How Indian agriculture should change after COVID-19,2020,"Understanding azo dye degrading enzymes and the encoding of their functional genes is crucial for the elucidation of their molecular mechanisms. In this study, a thermophilic strain capable of degrading azo dye was isolated from the soil near a textile dye manufacturing factory. Based on its morphological, physiological and biochemical properties, as well as 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the strain was identified as Anoxybacillus sp. PDR2. The decolorization ratios of 100-600 mg/L Direct Black G (DBG) by strain PDR2 reached 82.12-98.39% within 48 h of dyes. Genome analysis revealed that strain PDR2 contains a circular chromosome of 3791144 bp with a G + C content of 42.48%. The genetic basis of azo dye degradation by strain PDR2 and its capacity to adapt to harsh environments, were further elucidated through bioinformatics analysis. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR technology confirmed that NAD(P)H-flavin reductase, 2Fe-2S ferredoxin and NAD(P)-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase genes expressed by strain PDR2, were the key genes involved in DBG degradation. The combination of genome and transcriptome analysis was utilized to explore the key genes of strain PDR2 involved in azo dye biodegradation, with these findings providing a valuable theoretical basis for the practical treatment of azo dye wastewater.","Chen, Guotao; An, Xuejiao; Feng, Linlin; Xia, Xiang; Zhang, Qinghua",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,253

453989,The COVID-19 crisis: Opportunities for sustainable and proximity tourism,2020,"Background: Accumulating evidence has revealed that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may be complicated with myocardial injury during hospitalization. However, data regarding persistent cardiac involvement in patients who recovered from COVID-19 are limited. Our goal is to further explore the sustained impact of COVID-19 during follow-up, focusing on the cardiac involvement in the recovered patients. Methods: In this prospective observational follow-up study, we enrolled a total of 40 COVID-19 patients (20 with and 20 without cardiac injury during hospitalization) who were discharged from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University for more than 6 months, and 27 patients (13 with and 14 without cardiac injury during hospitalization) were finally included in the analysis. Clinical information including self-reported symptoms, medications, laboratory findings, Short Form 36-item scores, 6-min walk test, clinical events, electrocardiogram assessment, echocardiography measurement, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was collected and analyzed. Results: Among 27 patients finally included, none of patients reported any obvious cardiopulmonary symptoms at the 6-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences in terms of the quality of life and exercise capacity between the patients with and without cardiac injury. No significant abnormalities were detected in electrocardiogram manifestations in both groups, except for nonspecific ST-T changes, premature beats, sinus tachycardia/bradycardia, PR interval prolongation, and bundle-branch block. All patients showed normal cardiac structure and function, without any statistical differences between patients with and without cardiac injury by echocardiography. Compared with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury exhibited a significantly higher positive proportion in late gadolinium enhancement sequences [7/13 (53.8%) vs. 1/14 (7.1%), p = 0.013], accompanied by the elevation of circulating ST2 level [median (interquartile range) = 16.6 (12.1, 22.5) vs. 12.5 (9.5, 16.7);p = 0.044]. Patients with cardiac injury presented higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, high-sensitivity troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide than those without cardiac injury, although these indexes were within the normal range for all recovered patients at the 6-month follow-up. Among patients with cardiac injury, patients with positive late gadolinium enhancement presented higher cardiac biomarker (high-sensitivity troponin I) and inflammatory factor (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) on admission than the late gadolinium enhancement-negative subgroup. Conclusions: Our preliminary 6-month follow-up study with a limited number of patients revealed persistent cardiac involvement in 29.6% (8/27) of recovered patients from COVID-19 after discharge. Patients with cardiac injury during hospitalization were more prone to develop cardiac fibrosis during their recovery. Among patients with cardiac injury, those with relatively higher cardiac biomarkers and inflammatory factors on admission appeared more likely to have cardiac involvement in the convalescence phase.","Wu, X.; Deng, K.

454002,Fallout of Lead over Paris from the 2019 Notre-Dame Cathedral Fire,2020,"As the sustained and devastating extent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic becomes apparent, a key focus of public scrutiny in the UK has centred on the novel legal and regulatory measures introduced in response to the virus. When those measures were first implemented in March 2020 by the UK Government, it was thought that human rights obligations would limit excesses of governmental action and that the public had more to fear from unwarranted intrusion into civil liberties. However, within the first year of the pandemic's devastation in the UK, a different picture has emerged: rather than through action, it is governmental inaction that has given rise to greater human rights concerns. The UK Government has been roundly criticized for its inadequate response, including missteps in decision-making, delayed implementation and poor enforcement of lockdown measures, abandonment of testing, shortages of critical resources and inadequate test and trace methods. In this article, we analyse the UK Government's missteps and compare them with published international guidance; we also contrast the UK's decisions with those taken by several other countries (including the devolved administrations within the UK) to understand how its actions and inactions have contributed to unfavourable outcomes. Using an analytical perspective that demonstrates how human rights are both a protection from the power of the state and a requirement that governmental powers are used to protect the lives, health and wellbeing of citizens, we argue that the UK Government's failure to exercise their powers competently allowed the virus to spread without ensuring the country had the means to manage a high case load. This abject failure has led to one of the highest rates of deaths per capita worldwide. We offer several lessons that can be learnt from this unfortunate, but preventable, situation.","Frowde, Rhiannon; Dove, Edward S; Laurie, Graeme T",Asian Bioeth Rev,,253

454462,Ordinary Patterns in an Extraordinary Crisis: How International Relations Makes Sense of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was widespread and uncontrolled until recently. Patients vulnerable to severe COVID-19 are at risk of hydroxychloroquine interactions with co-morbidities and co-medications contributing to detrimental, including fatal, adverse treatment effects. METHODS: A retrospective survey was undertaken of health conditions and co-medications of patients with COVID-19 who were pre-screened for enrolment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled hydroxychloroquine multi-centre trial. RESULTS: The survey involved 305 patients [median age 71 (interquartile range 59-81) years]. The majority of patients (n = 279, 92%) considered for inclusion in the clinical trial were not eligible, mainly due to safety concerns caused by health conditions or co-medications. The most common were QT-prolonging drugs (n = 188, 62%) and haematologic/haemato-oncologic diseases (n = 39, 13%) which prohibited the administration of hydroxychloroquine. In addition, 165 (54%) patients had health conditions and 167 (55%) patients were on co-medications that did not prohibit the use of hydroxychloroquine but had a risk of adverse interactions with hydroxychloroquine. The most common were diabetes (n = 86, 28%), renal insufficiency (n = 69, 23%) and heart failure (n = 58, 19%). CONCLUSION: The majority of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had health conditions or took co-medications precluding safe treatment with hydroxychloroquine. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine should be administered with extreme caution in elderly patients with COVID-19, and only in clinical trials.","Gabor, Julian J; Kreidenweiss, Andrea; Weber, Stefan; Salama, Moaaz; Sulyok, Mihaly; Sulyok, Zita; Koehne, Erik; Esen, Meral; Kreuels, Benno; Shamsrizi, Parichehr; Biecker, Erwin; Mordmüller, Benjamin; Berg, Christoph P; Fusco, Stefano; Köhler, Carsten; Kubicka, Stefan; Leitlein, Jens; Addo, Marylyn; Ramharter, Michael; Schwab, Matthias; Bissinger, Alfred Lennart; Velavan, Thirumalaisamy P; Krishna, Sanjeev; Kremsner, Peter G",Int J Infect Dis,,253
455175,Online food delivery portals during COVID-19 times: an analysis of changing consumer behavior and expectations,2020,"Receptor Tyrosine Kinases are critical regulators of signal transduction that support cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Dysregulation of normal Receptor Tyrosine Kinase function by mutation or other activity-altering event can be oncogenic or can impact the transformed malignant cell so it becomes particularly resistant to stress challenge, have increased proliferation, become evasive to immune surveillance, and may be more prone to metastasis of the tumor to other organ sites. The TAM family of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) is emerging as important components of malignant cell survival in many cancers. The TAM kinases are important regulators of cellular homeostasis and proper cell differentiation in normal cells as receptors for their ligands GAS6 and Protein S. They also are critical to immune and inflammatory processes. In malignant cells, the TAM kinases can act as ligand independent co-receptors to mutant Receptor Tyrosine Kinases and in some cases (e.g. FLT3-ITD mutant) are required for their function. They also have a role in immune checkpoint surveillance. At the time of this review, the Covid-19 pandemic poses a global threat to world health. TAM kinases play an important role in host response to many viruses and it is suggested the TAM kinases may be important in aspects of Covid-19 biology. This review will cover the TAM kinases and their role in these processes.","Post, Sean M; Andreeff, Michael; DiNardo, Courtney; Khoury, Joseph D; Ruvolo, Peter P",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,,253

A resource-based and resource dependence perspective,2020,"We use a concepts and categories research perspective to explore how prior conceptual knowledge influences thinking about a novel disease, namely COVID-19. We collected measures of how similar people thought COVID-19 was to several existing concepts that may have served as other possible comparison points for the pandemic. We also collected participants' self-reported engagement in pandemic-related behaviors. We found that thinking the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to other serious disease outbreaks predicted greater social distancing and mask-wearing, whereas likening COVID-19 to the seasonal flu predicted engaging in significantly fewer of these behaviors. Thinking of COVID-19 as similar to zombie apocalypse scenarios or moments of major societal upheaval predicted stocking-up behaviors, but not disease mitigation behaviors. These early category comparisons influenced behaviors over a six-month span of longitudinal data collection. Our findings suggest that early conceptual comparisons track with emergent disease categories over time and influence the behaviors people engage in related to the disease. Our research illustrates how early concept formation influences behaviors over time, and suggests ways for public health experts to communicate with the public about emergent diseases.","Marsh, Jessecae K; Ungson, Nick D; Packer, Dominic J",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,253

In this study, data of SARS coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors; a key drug target in the coronavirus genome was retrieved from CHEMBL database. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) studies, Molecular docking, Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion-Toxicity (ADMET) and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) were carried out using these 3CLpro inhibitors. QSAR model constructed using the data had correlation coefficient R2 value of 0.907; cross-validated correlation coefficient Q2 value of 0.866 and test set predicted correlation coefficient R2pred value of 0.517. Variance inflation factor (VIF) values for descriptors contained in the model ranged from 1.352 to 1.68, hence, these descriptors were orthogonal to one another. Therefore, the model was statistically significant and can be used to screen and design new molecules for their inhibitory activity against 3CLpro. Molecular docking showed that seven of the compounds (inhibitors) used in the study had a remarkable binding affinity (-9.2 to -10.3 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro. ADMET study revealed that five (CHEMBL Accession IDs 19438, 196635, 377150, 208763, and 210097) of the seven compounds with good binding ability obeyed Lipinski's rule of five. Hence, they were compounds with drug-like properties. MDS analysis revealed that 3CLpro-compound 21, 3CLpro-compound 22, 3CLpro-compound 40 complexes are very stable as compared to the reference 3CLpro-X77 complex. Therefore, this study identified three potent inhibitors of 3CLpro viz. CHEMBL194398, CHEMBL196635, and CHEMBL210097 that can be further explored for the treatment of COVID-19.","Ishola, Ahmed Adebayo; Adedirin, Oluwaseye; Joshi, Tanuja; Chandra, Subhash",Comput Biol Med,,253

In this study, we sought to evaluate whether youth reported a greater frequency of suicide-related behaviors during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic as compared with 2019. We hypothesized that rates of suicide-related behaviors would be elevated between the months of March and July 2020 as compared with 2019, corresponding to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Routine suicide-risk screening was completed with youth aged 11 to 21 in a pediatric emergency department. Electronic health records data for suicide-risk screens completed between January and July 2019 and January and July 2020 were evaluated. A total of 9092 completed screens were examined (mean age 14.72 years, 47.7% Hispanic and/or Latinx, 26.7% non-Hispanic white, 18.7% non-Hispanic Black). RESULTS: Rates of positive suicide-risk screen results from January to July 2020 were compared with corresponding rates from January to July 2019. Results indicated a significantly higher rate of suicide ideation in March and July 2020 and higher rates of suicide attempts in February, March, April, and July 2020 as compared with the same months in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of suicide ideation and attempts were higher during some months of 2020 as compared with 2019 but were not universally higher across this period. Months with significantly higher rates of suicide-related behaviors appear to correspond to times when COVID-19-related stressors and community responses were heightened, indicating that youth experienced elevated distress during these periods.","Hill, Ryan M; Rufino, Katrina; Kurian, Sherin; Saxena, Johanna; Saxena, Kirti; Williams, Laurel",Pediatrics,,253

The inverse opal hydrogel structure features well-defined, interconnected pores with high similarity to human alveolar sacs. By populating the sacs with primary human alveolar epithelial cells, functional epithelial monolayers are readily formed. Cyclic strain is integrated into the device to allow biomimetic breathing events of the alveolar lung, which, in addition, makes it possible to investigate pathological effects such as those incurred by cigarette smoking and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pseudoviral infection.

458468,What Can We Estimate from Fatality and Infectious Case Data? A case Study of Covid-19 Pandemic,2020-04-27,"In the absence of an effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 it is important to be able to track community infections to inform public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread and therefore reduce pressures on health-care, improve health outcomes and reduce economic uncertainty. Wastewater surveillance has rapidly emerged as a potential tool to effectively monitor community infections through measuring trends of RNA signal in wastewater systems. In this study SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA N1 and N2 gene regions are quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids (PGS) and primary clarified sludge (PCS) in two water resource recovery facilities (WRRF) serving Canada's national capital region, i.e., the City of Ottawa, ON (pop. &#8776; 1.1M) and the City of Gatineau, QC (pop. &#8776; 280K). PCS samples show signal inhibition using RT-ddPCR compared to RT-qPCR, with PGS samples showing similar quantifiable concentrations of RNA using both assays. RT-qPCR shows higher frequency of detection of N1 and N2 gene regions in PCS (92.7, 90.6%, n = 6) as compared to PGS samples (79.2, 82.3%, n = 5). Sampling of PCS may therefore be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral quantification, especially during periods of declining and low COVID-19 incidence in the community. The pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) is determined to have a less variable RNA signal in PCS over a three month period for two WRRFs, regardless of environmental conditions, compared to Bacteroides 16S rRNA or human 18S rRNA, making PMMoV a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of SARS-CoV-2 signal. PMMoV-normalized PCS RNA signal from WRRFs of two cities correlated with the regional public health epidemiological metrics, identifying PCS normalized to a fecal indicator (PMMoV) as a potentially effective tool for monitoring trends during decreasing and low-incidence of infection of SARS-Cov-2 in communities.","D039,; Aoust, Patrick M; Mercier, Elisabeth; Montpetit, Danika; Jia, Jian-Jun; Alexandrov, Ilya; Neault, Nafisa; Baig, Aiman Tariq; Mayne, Janice; Zhang, Xu; Alain, Tommy; Langlois, Marc-André; Servos, Mark R; MacKenzie, Malcolm; Figeys, Daniel; MacKenzie, Alex E; Graber, Tyson E; Delatolla, Robert",Water Res,,253

The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the first cases of COVID-19 to make further improvements in health policies and prevention measurements in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a search in PubMed, the CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Web of Science and the WHO database of publications on COVID-19 for peer-reviewed papers from 1 December 2019 to 9 July 2020. We analysed the demographics, epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, signs and symptoms of the disease at the onset. RESULTS: We identified the first cases of COVID-19 in 16 different countries/regions from Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Of these 16 cases, 8 (50.0%) were male, with a mean of age 43.38 ± 15.19 years. All the cases had a history of travel or exposure. Twelve cases (75.0%) occurred in January, eight patients were Chinese, two patients were international students in Wuhan, one patient had a history of travelling in Wuhan, and one patient was in contact with Chinese patient. The longest hospital stay was 24 days (1 patient), and the shortest was 5 days (1 patient). The usual hospital stay was 9 days (4 patients).

Background: This paper focuses on the case study of a patient in the UK who showed - as far as we know today - all typical symptoms of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 but without dyspnoea. The diagnose was made on the basis of the symptoms, which were described by the patient, and confirmed by an antibody test in August 2020. Aim: Due to the public interest in knowing more about the cluster of symptoms and their implications for nursing, the patient and the author of this paper decided to present this case study to the professional audience. Methods: For the anamnesis, the patient's COVID-19 diary and an essay by her about her experiences with the National Health Service (NHS) were analysed and completed by information collected during a structured interview. Results: It became apparent that the nursing diagnoses ""Acute pain"" and ""Chronic pain"" stand at the forefront. These nursing diagnoses have not been discussed in the context of COVID-19 yet. Conclusions: This leads to the conclusion that nursing diagnoses, which are orientated towards an alleged lung disease, might not be complete when it comes to the complex disease process of COVID-19.

Metadata of 408,493 SARS-CoV-2 genomes submitted to GISAID database were analyzed with respect to genomic clades and their geographic, age, and gender distributions. Of the currently known SARS-CoV-2 clades, clade GR was the most prevalent worldwide followed by GV then GH. Chronological analysis revealed expansion in SARS-CoV-2 clades carrying D614G mutations with the predominance of the newest clade, GV, in the last three months. D614G clades prevail in countries with more COVID-19 cases. Of them, the clades GH and GR were more frequently recovered from severe or deceased COVID-19 cases. In contrast, G and GV clades showed a significantly higher prevalence among asymptomatic patients or those with mild disease. Metadata analysis showed higher (p < 0.05) prevalence of severe/deceased cases among males than females and predominance of GR clade in female patients. Furthermore, severe disease/death was more prevalent (p < 0.05) in elderly than in adults/children. Higher prevalence of the GV clade in children compared to other age groups was also evident. These findings uniquely provide a statistical evidence on the adaptation-driven evolution of SARS-CoV-2 leading to altered infectivity, virulence, and mortality.","Hamed, Samira M; Elkhatib, Walid F; Khairalla, Ahmed S; Noreddin, Ayman M",Sci Rep,,253

This article focuses on such crisis-driven policy learning, examining how the experiences of China and South Korea as early responder states influenced the subsequent coronavirus crisis management in Germany. The first reaction of the German core executive was the quick concentration of decision-making power at the top of the political hierarchy. Asserting the prerogatives of the executive included the radical simplification of the relationship between politics, law and science. State actors took emergency measures by recourse to a single piece of legislation-the 'infection protection law' (Infektionsschutzgesetz)-overriding other elements of the legal order. They also limited the government's use of scientific expertise to a small number of advisors, thereby cutting short debates about the appropriateness or otherwise of the government's crisis measures. Finally, German actors failed to understand that some of the earlier Chinese and Korean responses required a precondition-namely public willingness to sacrifice privacy for public health-that is absent in the German case.","Dostal, Jörg Michael",Political quarterly,,253

This paper uses administrative corporate tax records from 10 low- and middle- income countries around the world to provide plausible estimates. Modeling the lockdown-triggered revenue shock with simple and transparent assumptions, the analysis predicts that less than half of all firms will remain profitable by the end of 2020, about 5-10 percent of the formal aggregate annual payroll will be lost, and firm exit rates will double. As a result, it is expected that tax revenue remitted by the corporate sector will fall by at least 1.5 percent of baseline gross domestic product. Differences in sectoral composition and firms' cost structures generate heterogeneity in the results across countries: wage subsidies are less effective in low-income countries and government revenue losses are smaller.","Bachas, P.; Brockmeyer, A.; Semelet, C.",Policy Research Working Paper - World Bank|2020.

With the emergence of COVID-19, this requirement has been even greater. This review was undertaken to determine the impact of the pandemic on safety and surveillance of opioids in the United Kingdom. RECENT FINDINGS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the surveillance of opioids in the United Kingdom continued, although primary research was often conducted with data prior to the pandemic. Of those studies that were conducted while the pandemic was ongoing, access to opioids (or opioid substitution therapy) and the subsequent effect on patient safety was the main theme. SUMMARY: In the United Kingdom, changes in accessibility to the healthcare system and how healthcare providers operated during the COVID-19 pandemic may have had unintended consequences on use and safety of opioids, due to the shift in focus to preventing COVID-19 from overwhelming the healthcare system. The findings from this review support the need to continue surveillance in the United Kingdom, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on opioid utilization and safety.","Osborne, Vicki",Curr Opin Psychiatry,,253

As of February 26, 2020, COVID-19 has been recognized in 34 countries, with a total of 80,239 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,700 deaths. Infection control measures are necessary to prevent the virus from further spreading and to help control the epidemic situation. Due to the characteristics of dental settings, the risk of cross infection can be high between patients and dental practitioners. For dental practices and hospitals in areas that are (potentially) affected with COVID-19, strict and effective infection control protocols are urgently needed.

The purpose of this literature review was to compile and analyze brain MR imaging findings in patients with COVID-19-related illness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature searches of PubMed, publicly available Internet search engines, and medical journal Web sites were performed to identify articles published before May 30, 2020 that described MR imaging brain findings in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were included in the analysis: 5 investigational studies, 6 case series, and 11 case reports, encompassing MR imaging of the brain in 126 patients. The articles originated from 7 different countries and were published in 14 medical journals. MR imaging brain findings included specific diagnoses (such as acute infarct, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) or specific imaging features (such as cortical FLAIR signal abnormality, microhemorrhages). CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent diagnoses made on brain MR imaging in patients with COVID-19 were acute and subacute infarcts. Other common findings included a constellation of leukoencephalopathy and microhemorrhages, leptomeningeal contrast enhancement, and cortical FLAIR signal abnormality.","Gulko, E; Oleksk, M L; Gomes, W; Ali, S; Mehta, H; Overby, P; Al-Mufti, F; Rozenshtein, A",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,253

468689,The story of the pandemic: navigating our way between optimism and pessimism,2020,"INTRODUCTION: A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 present with a rapidly progressing severe acute respiratory failure (ARF). OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the therapeutic success of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in severe ARF in the course of COVID-19 in a noncritical care setting as well as to identify predictors of HFNO failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted between March and December 2020. We enrolled all consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in whom HFNO therapy was used. The primary outcome measure was death or endotracheal intubation within 30 days from admission. RESULTS: Of the 380 patients with COVID-19, 116 individuals (30.5%) requiring HFNO due to severe pneumonia were analyzed. The primary outcome, defined as death or endotracheal intubation within 30 days from admission, occurred in 54 patients (46.6%). The overall 30-day mortality was 30.2% (35/116) in the entire cohort and 64.7% (34/51) among patients requiring endotracheal intubation. A multivariable analysis revealed that the ROX index measured within the first 12 hours of therapy below 3.85 was related to increased mortality (hazard ratio, 5.86; 95% CI, 3.03-11.35) compared with the ROX index of 4.88 or higher. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that nearly half of patients treated with HFNO due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia will require mechanical ventilation. The ROX index is a useful tool for predicting HFNO failure in this population.","Celejewska-Wójcik, Natalia; Polok, Kamil; Górka, Karolina; Stachura, Tomasz; Kania, Aleksander; Nastalek, Pawel; Licholai, Sabina; Krawczyk, Jacek; Wójcik, Krzysztof; Sladek, Krzysztof",Pol.

We sought to describe EEG findings observed from local experience in a typical case series of patients with severe Covid-19. Methods: Ten cases of Covid-19 were identified in whom EEG recordings had been made during the course of admissions to Bristol hospitals which had required intensive care. Electro-clinical correlation between the EEG and available medical history, imaging and laboratory investigation results was explored. Results: The predominant EEG features in severe Covid-19 are of generalised symmetrical slowing, consistent with encephalopathy. Conclusions: The presence of focal disturbances or irritative abnormalities may be a pointer away from a pure encephalopathy and warrant further investigation. Significance: A growing range of neurological sequelae from Covid-19 are now recognised to be common amongst patients hospitalised by with this condition, being seen to affect approximately one third of such cases. Electroencephalography has a unique place in the diagnostic work-up of impaired consciousness, a frequent feature of severe Covid-19.

DISCUSSION: We argue that opportunities should be expanded for nurses to attain education for these roles through increased investments in the Doctor of Nursing Practice model to prepare nurses for advanced public health specialty practice.","Bekemeier, Betty; Kuehnert, Paul; Zahner, Susan J; Johnson, Kathleen H; Kaneshiro, Jasmine; Swider, Susan M",Nurs. outlook,,253
471027,A review on covid-19: A global pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To perform a comprehensive clinic, laboratory, and instrumental evaluation of children affected by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: Children with a positive result of nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) underwent laboratory tests, anal and conjunctival swab, electrocardiography, lung, abdomen, and cardiac ultrasound. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed if abnormal basal blood pressure. Patients were followed-up for 6 months. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixteen children were evaluated; 15 were finally included. Confirmed family member SARS-CoV-2 infection was present in all. Twenty-seven percent were asymptomatic. Anal and conjunctival swabs tests resulted negative in all. Patients with lower body mass index (BMI) presented significantly higher viral loads. Main laboratory abnormalities were: lactate dehydrogenase increasing (73%), low vitamin D levels (87%), hematuria (33%), proteinuria (26%), renal hyperfiltration (33%), and hypofiltration (13%). Two of the patients with hyperfiltration exhibited high blood pressure levels at diagnosis, and persistence of prehypertension at 6-month follow-up. No abnormalities were seen at ultrasound, excepting for one patient who exhibited B-lines at lung sonography. Immunoglobulin G seroconversion was observed in all at 1-month. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirm that intra-family transmission is important. The significant higher viral loads recorded among patients with lower BMI, together with low vitamin D levels, support the impact of nutritional status on immune system. Renal involvement is frequent even among children with mild COVID-19, therefore prompt evaluation and identification of patients with reduced renal function reserve would allow a better stratification and management of patients.

471397,"Face touching in the time of COVID-19 in Shiraz, Iran",2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused great difficulties in providing healthcare services worldwide. Accurate and useful indicators are needed for the effective use of resources. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also produced endogenously without exogenous exposure. Studies confirm that endogenous CO increases in conditions such as pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. This study aimed to compare patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and healthy people to reveal whether endogenous carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels differ. It was also to determine whether it could be a helpful indicator for the clinician in predicting disease severity in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study included 72 patients admitted to the hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and a control group of 75 healthy people. The research data was collected retrospectively in a tertiary emergency department. The patients' demographic data, pneumonia severity index (PSI) score, CURB-65 score, 30-day mortality, hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation (MV), and COHb levels were recorded. RESULTS: While the COHb level was 0.9% (min-max, 0.1 - 4.0) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, it was 1% (min-max, 0.1 - 2.6) in the control group. No significant difference was found between the patients and the control group in terms of COHb levels (p = 0.341). Also, there was no correlation between COHb levels and PSI and CURB-65 scores. No significant difference was detected between COHb levels and patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia in terms of mortality, need for MV, or hospitalization (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that COHb levels alone could not be used to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia or predict disease severity. Besides, in COVID-19 pneumonia, the COHb level was not a useful indicator of mortality, need for MV, or hospitalization decision. Further studies are needed to find useful indicators to assist clinicians in their decision-making process in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Demir, Mehmet C; Akpinar, Guleser; Sultanoglu, Hasan; Yildiz-Gulhan, Pinar; Caliskan, Emel; Guclu, Derya; Karakoyun, Salih; Ince, Nevin",Clin. lab,,253

473059,"Modeled changes in source contributions of particulate matter during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Yangtze River Delta, China",2021,"Polarization of macrophages to different functional states is important for mounting responses against pathogen infections. Macrophages are the major target cells of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), which is the primary causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) leading to immense economic losses in the global swine industry. Clinically, PCV2 is often found to increase risk of other pathogenic infections yet the underlying mechanisms remain to be elusive. Here we found that PCV2 infection skewed macrophages toward a M1 status through reprogramming expression of a subset of M1-associated genes and M2-associated genes. Mechanistically, induction of M1-associated genes by PCV2 infection is dependent on activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways whereas suppression of M2-associated genes by PCV2 is via inhibiting expression of jumonji domain containing-3 (JMJD3), a histone 3 Lys27 (H3K27) demethylase that regulates M2 activation of macrophages. Finally, we identified that PCV2 capsid protein (Cap) directly inhibits JMJD3 transcription to restrain expression of interferon regulatory factor (IRF4) that controls M2 macrophage polarization. Consequently, sustained infection of PCV2 facilitates bacterial infection in vitro. In summary, these findings showed that PCV2 infection functionally modulated M1 macrophage polarization via targeting canonical signals and epigenetic histone modification, which contributes to bacterial coinfection and virial pathogenesis.","Zhang, Wen; Fu, Zhendong; Yin, Hongyan; Han, Qingbing; Fan, Wenhui; Wang, Fangkun; Shang, Yingli",Front Immunol,,253
474541,Planning for the temporary: temporary urbanism and public space in a time of COVID-19,2021,"Alveolar type II (ATII) cells are a key structure of the distal lung epithelium, where they exert their innate immune response and serve as progenitors of alveolar type I (ATI) cells, contributing to alveolar epithelial repair and regeneration. In the healthy lung, ATII cells coordinate the host defense mechanisms, not only generating a restrictive alveolar epithelial barrier, but also orchestrating host defense mechanisms and secreting surfactant proteins, which are important in lung protection against pathogen exposure. Moreover, surfactant proteins help to maintain homeostasis in the distal lung and reduce surface tension at the pulmonary air-liquid interface, thereby preventing atelectasis and reducing the work of breathing. ATII cells may also contribute to the fibroproliferative reaction by secreting growth factors and proinflammatory molecules after damage. Indeed, various acute and chronic diseases are associated with intensive inflammation. These include oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, fibrosis and numerous interstitial lung diseases, and are characterized by hyperplastic ATII cells which are considered an essential part of the epithelialization process and, consequently, wound healing. The aim of this review is that of revising the physiologic and pathologic role ATII cells play in pulmonary diseases, as, despite what has been learnt in the last few decades of research, the origin, phenotypic regulation and crosstalk of these cells still remain, in part, a mystery.","Ruaro, Barbara; Salton, Francesco; Braga, Luca; Wade, Barbara; Confalonieri, Paola; Volpe, Maria Concetta; Baratella, Elisa; Maiocchi, Serena; Confalonieri, Marco",Int. j. mol. sci.

Although preventive measures such as masking, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and improved ventilation are commonly used in schools to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and support in-person instruction (3-6), routine school-based COVID-19 testing has not been as widely implemented. In addition to these types of standard preventive measures, Utah health and school partners implemented two high school testing programs to sustain extracurricular activities and in-person instruction and help identify SARS-CoV-2 infections: 1) Test to Play,* in which testing every 14 days was mandated for participation in extracurricular activities; and 2) Test to Stay, which involved school-wide testing to continue in-person instruction as an alternative to transitioning to remote instruction if a school crossed a defined outbreak threshold (3).

They caused a large number of casualties and a wider psychological crisis, which might cause severe consequences such as post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide. AIMS: To reveal the law of formation of public psychological crisis in public health emergencies, and draw lessons from it. To provide ideas for effectively deal with these psychological crisis problems and fundamentally curbing the occurrence of public health emergencies. METHOD: Through the method of literature research, 'public health incidents', 'psychological crisis', 'mental health', 'psychological intervention', 'SARS', 'H1N1', 'MERS', 'EVD', and 'COVID-19' were used to search literatures in the databases such as PubMed, Springer, and Sciencedirect, and the literatures were summarized, sorted, and studied. RESULTS: (1) The public health emergencies caused a universal psychological crisis. The main manifestations were depression, compulsion, despair, etc. The people involved mainly include patients, suspected isolated patients, medical staff, and the general public in the epidemic situation. (2) People's psychological state often experienced stress stage, shock stage, acceptance, and reorganization. Only some susceptible individuals couldn't complete effective psychological reconstruction, resulting in serious psychological disorders. Individual susceptibility is related to genetic factors, adversity, and traumatic stimuli experienced in early life. CONCLUSION: To reduce these psychological crisis problems, we should establish and improve the psychological crisis intervention or rescue system of public health emergencies, it was still necessary to live in harmony with nature, get rid of the inappropriate habit of preying on wild animals, in order to prevent the cross-species transmission of the virus between wild animals and humans, and to fundamentally avoid the occurrence of major infectious diseases.","Wang, Zhifeng; Wang, Dongmei",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,253

Before the COVID 19 pandemic urban parks, as healthy places, were of the most favorable places for urban citizens, but nowadays no vitality is found in urban parks due to the absence of people. The perceived risk seems to affect peoples' decision-making for the visit to urban parks. This study aims to examine the impact of COVID 19 perceived severity and vulnerability on peoples' visit to the urban parks and further exercise avoidance. It is expected that the result of this study would shed light on the people's perception of healthy urban parks to exercise during COVID 19. Design/methodology/approach The participants were recruited from a neighborhood with the greenest and largest parks in Iran that were selected for the study. It was to assure that participants have access to the urban parks within their walkable distance. The mixed-method approach was applied to achieving the research goals. A total of 404 participants attended the survey. A series of semi-structured interviews were conducted to examine the strategies that reduce peoples' worries about using urban parks during the COVID 19. Data were analyzed using SmartPLS. Findings The study hypothesized that peoples' awareness of COVID 19 affects their perceived risk and disease prevention efficiency. Besides, it was hypothesized that perceived risk and efficacy effects outdoor activities worries exercise avoidance and behavioral avoidance in the urban parks. The result of the study supported the research hypothesis. The more knowledge people acquire of COVID 19 and the lack of efficacy of treatments, the higher they will avoid outdoor activities and exercise. The means of knowledge and perceived risk were higher than previously reported studies. Originality/value The result of this study is very important, as it statistically proves that peoples' priorities and factors that affect their willingness to use public spaces are very much affected by their perception of a healthy environment. It also canonizes the role of facility managers in bringing peoples' trust in the use of public spaces and more specifically urban parks during pandemic disease distributions.","Khozaei, F.; Kim, M.

Tonsillectomy was performed 2 weeks after the swab; the tonsil specimen was analysed through RT-PCR and revealed amplification of the N2 and RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. According to both results, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 gene remains to be detected in tonsil and/or detritus after 2-3 weeks after recovery. Hence, it is suggested that it is necessary to use adequate protection when performing tonsillectomy on early recovered patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, tonsillectomy would be more advisable to be performed after the fourth week after recovery from COVID-19.","Kadriyan, Hamsu; Dirja, Bayu Tirta; Suryani, Dewi; Yudhanto, Didit",BMJ case reports,,253

Upstream process intensification combining perfusion technologies, the avian suspension cell line AGE1.CR.pIX and the virus strain MVA-CR19 is an option to obtain very high MVA yields. Here the authors compare different options for cell retention in perfusion mode using conventional stirred-tank bioreactors. Furthermore, the authors study hollow-fiber bioreactors and an orbital-shaken bioreactor in perfusion mode, both available for single-use. Productivity for the virus strain MVA-CR19 is compared to results from batch and continuous production reported in literature. The results demonstrate that cell retention devices are only required to maximize cell concentration but not for continuous harvesting. Using a stirred-tank bioreactor, a perfusion strategy with working volume expansion after virus infection results in the highest yields. Overall, infectious MVA virus titers of 2.1-16.5 × 109 virions/mL are achieved in these intensified processes. Taken together, the study shows a novel perspective on high-yield MVA virus production in conventional bioreactor systems linked to various cell retention devices and addresses options for process intensification including fully single-use perfusion platforms.","Gränicher, Gwendal; Tapia, Felipe; Behrendt, Ilona; Jordan, Ingo; Genzel, Yvonne; Reichl, Udo",Biotechnol J,,253

The Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min were 9 and 10 points, respectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The mother of the newborn was exposed to a patient with COVID-19 five days before delivery. The newborn had nausea and vomiting after birth, with feeding intolerance, and full enteral feeding was given on the 6th day after birth. The newborn was in good general condition during the period of hospitalization. RESULTS: The two 2019-nCoV nucleic acid tests of the newborn were negative on the 5th and 7th days after birth. On the 1st and 8th days after birth, typical pulmonary lesions were detected in the newborn by chest CT. Our study supports that chest imaging examination should be actively performed in the newborn even with a negative 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test in cases where a pregnant woman is exposed to a patient with COVID-19 or is confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection. CONCLUSIONS: For newborns with typical pulmonary lesions, strict quarantine measures are suggested if the possibility of COVID-19 cannot be excluded.","Li, H-Y; Zhang, C-M; Lv, Y-Y; Dai, W-Q; Xu, B; Qi, X-M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,253

This paradigm shift is occurring because these sophisticated AI techniques are guaranteeing the optimality of performance metrics. However, this adoption is currently under scrutiny due to various concerns such as fairness, and how does the fairness of an AI algorithm affects user's trust is much legitimate to pursue. In this regard, we aim to understand the relationship between induced algorithmic fairness and its perception in humans. In particular, we are interested in whether these two are positively correlated and reflect substantive fairness. Furthermore, we also study how does induced algorithmic fairness affects user trust in algorithmic decision making. To understand this, we perform a user study to simulate candidate shortlisting by introduced (manipulating mathematical) fairness in a human resource recruitment setting. Our experimental results demonstrate that different levels of introduced fairness are positively related to human perception of fairness, and simultaneously it is also positively related to user trust in algorithmic decision making. Interestingly, we also found that users are more sensitive to the higher levels of introduced fairness than the lower levels of introduced fairness. Besides, we summarize the theoretical and practical implications of this research with a discussion on perception of fairness.","Zhou, Jianlong; Verma, Sunny; Mittal, Mudit; Chen, Fang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14345v1.pdf,253

The COVID-19 epidemic preventions have significantly reduced the emissions of NO2, which provided an opportunity to disentangling the contributions to global emissions in major epidemic regions. Here we quantified the influences of lockdown measures on the NO2 concentration at a global scale during the two waves of the COVID-19 epidemic, and disentangled the relative contributions of the major epidemic regions (i.e., China, Europe and USA) on the global NO2 densities due to the lockdown measures. Our results revealed that there are an evident decrease of global NO2 in 2020, especially in China, Europe and USA. The global mean NO2 densities decreased approximately 2.1 and 3.9 mol/m2 in the first and second waves of the epidemic. While in the Northern Hemisphere, NO2 densities decreased 6.6 mol/m2 on average during the first stage of the epidemic, and a slight increase (i.e., 1.7 mol/m2) in the second wave of the epidemic. The magnitudes and durations of the second wave were much smaller than the first wave of the coronavirus infections. The strict lockdown measures implemented in China significantly decreased the NO2 concentration, which therefore the largest contributor in the first wave decreases of global average NO2 densities. Intervention at an early stage would be beneficial to the preventions of epidemic situation.

Much has been developed on its potential to include groups marginalized by capitalism in new development schemes, but to date there has been no work regarding immigrants? participation specifically. This research aims to fill this gap. Purpose The article investigates the importance of the partnership between institutions in the host country and immigrants to their insertion in the Solidarity Economy Fairs in Florianópolis. It questions to what extent it has furthered income generation, the formation of social identity, and the construction of community ties. Methods and approach The approach is anchored in intervention?research, proposing a socio-analytical intervention (Aguiar & Rocha, 2007). To pursue qualitative research, an online form was distributed to participants at the Immigrant Fair. The form comprised semi-structured interviews, with the possibility of giving free answers. Findings The data analysis reveals the nuances of the life trajectory of recent immigrants in Brazil: people, mostly of Latin American origin, over 30 years of age, seeking economic insertion in another country. For them, the Solidarity Economy has offered a possibility for social and economic insertion in Brazil. The opportunity for marginalized populations to engage with the Solidarity Economy offers an effective tool against systemic competition. The Fair operates as an alternative to the insertion into the capitalist market for outsider groups, enabling new ways to conduct economic life within the capitalist economy. Policy implications Our findings suggest that the Fair has provided immigrants both the means to obtain a weekly (although unstable) financial income and their social integration?it requires interaction with other immigrants, state agents, tourists, and the local community. The social isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardized both outcomes. In order to consolidate solidarity ventures and immigrants? enterprises, there is an urgent need to implement a public policy regarding immigrants? social and economic rights in Santa Catarina State.","Annoni, Danielle de Souza Silva Karine Martini dos Santos Gabriela",Development Policy Review,,253

484483,Searching for the bright spots in a time of crisis,2020,"The thoracic diaphragm is the muscle that drives the respiratory cycle of a human being. Using a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that models linear elasticity we compute displacements and stresses in a two-dimensional cross section of the diaphragm in its contracted state. The boundary data consists of a mix of displacement and traction conditions. If these are imposed as they are, and the conditions are not compatible, this leads to reduced smoothness of the solution. Therefore, the boundary data is first smoothed using the least-squares radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) framework. Then the boundary conditions are reformulated as a Robin boundary condition with smooth coefficients. The same framework is also used to approximate the boundary curve of the diaphragm cross section based on data obtained from a slice of a computed tomography (CT) scan. To solve the PDE we employ the unfitted least-squares RBF-FD method. This makes it easier to handle the geometry of the diaphragm, which is thin and non-convex. We show numerically that our solution converges with high-order towards a finite element solution evaluated on a fine grid. Through this simplified numerical model we also gain an insight into the challenges associated with the diaphragm geometry and the boundary conditions before approaching a more complex three-dimensional model.","Tominec, Igor; Villard, Pierre-Frederic; Larsson, Elisabeth; Bayona, Victor; Cacciani, Nicola",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03673v1.pdf,253

In particular, a group of sulfated polysaccharides, which were isolated from the cell walls of red algae, gained a large amount of attention due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities. Within that group, carrageenans (CGs) were expected to be the first clinically applicable microbicides that could prevent various viral infections due to their superior antiviral potency and desirable safety profiles in subclinical studies. However, their anticipated beneficial effects could not be validated in human studies. To assess the value of a second attempt at pharmacologically developing CGs as a new class of preventive microbicides, all preclinical and clinical development processes of CG-based microbicides need to be thoroughly re-evaluated. In this review, the in vitro toxicities; in vivo safety profiles; and in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo antiviral activities of CGs are summarized according to the study volume of their target viruses, which include human immunodeficiency virus, herpesviruses, respiratory viruses, human papillomavirus, dengue virus, and other viruses along with a description of their antiviral modes of action and development of antiviral resistance.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence of MI in patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to identify variables associated with its occurrence. The secondary objective was to assess high-sensitivity troponin I as a predictor of in-hospital mortality. METHODS: Retrospective, observational study conducted between March and April 2020 with cases of confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. Numerical variables were compared by using Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The chi-square test was used for categorical variables. Multivariate analysis was performed with variables associated with MI and p<0.2 to determine predictors of MI. The ROC curve was used to determine the troponin value capable of predicting higher in-hospital mortality. Survival functions were estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method from the cut-off point indicated in the ROC curve. RESULTS: This study assessed 61 patients (63.9% of the male sex, mean age of 66.1±15.5 years). Myocardial injury was present in 36% of the patients.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19. A control group was used to compare the cumulative incidence and case-fatality rate (CFR). The main outcomes of the study were cumulative incidence, defined as number of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19 admitted to an emergency department divided by the total number of patients with epilepsy at risk, and CFR based on the number of deaths during the enrollment period. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for fatality in patients with active epilepsy. RESULTS: Of the 1,537 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 21 (1.3%) had active epilepsy. The cumulative incidence (95% confidence interval [CI]) of COVID-19 in patients with epilepsy was higher (1.2% [0.6-2.4]) compared to the population without epilepsy (0.5% [0.5-0.5]). In reverse transcription PCR-positive patients, there were no significant differences in CFR in patients with active epilepsy compared to patients without epilepsy (33.3% vs 8.3%; p = 0.266). Of the 21 patients with active epilepsy, 5 (23%) died. In multivariate analysis, the factor associated with fatality in patients with active epilepsy was hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 2.8 [95% CI 1.3-21.6]). In another model, age (OR 1.0 [95% CI 1.0-1.1]) and epilepsy (OR 5.1 [95% CI 1.3-24.0]) were associated with fatality during hospitalization.

To aid in alleviating that demand, a survey of commercially available filter media was conducted to determine whether any could serve as a substitute for an N95 FFR while held in a 3D-printed mask (Stopgap Surgical Face Mask from the NIH 3D Print Exchange). Fourteen filter media types and eight combinations were evaluated for filtration efficiency, breathing resistance (pressure drop), and liquid penetration. Additional testing was conducted to evaluate two filter media disinfection methods in the event that the filters were reused in a hospital setting. Efficiency testing was conducted in accordance with the procedures established for approving an N95 FFR. One apparatus used a filter-holding device and another apparatus employed a manikin head to which the 3D-printed mask could be sealed. The filter media and combinations exhibited collection efficiencies varied between 3.9% and 98.8% when tested with a face velocity comparable to that of a standard N95 FFR at the 85 L min-1 used in the approval procedure. Breathing resistance varied between 10.8 to >637 Pa (1.1 to > 65 mm H2O). When applied to the 3D-printed mask efficiency decreased by an average of 13% and breathing resistance increased 4-fold as a result of the smaller surface area of the filter media when held in that mask compared to that of an N95 FFR. Disinfection by dry heat, even after 25 cycles, did not significantly affect filter efficiency and reduced viral infectivity by > 99.9%. However, 10 cycles of 59% vaporized H2O2 significantly (p < 0.001) reduced filter efficiency of the media tested. Several commercially available filter media were found to be potential replacements for the media used to construct the typical cup-like N95 FFR. However, their use in the 3D-printed mask demonstrated reduced efficiency and increased breathing resistance at 85 L min-1.","O039,; Shaughnessy, Patrick T; Strzelecki, Brian; Ortiz-Hernandez, Monica; Aubin, Patrick; Jing, Xuefang; Chang, Qing; Xiang, Jinhua; Thorne, Peter S; Stapleton, Jack T",J Occup Environ Hyg,,253

This novel coronavirus is phylogenetically similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that caused SARS outbreak in 2002.Objective: To describe a case of a COVID-19 patient in a hospital in Indonesia.Case Report: A 55-year-old male was admitted to the Emergency Department of Arifin Achmad Hospital on 31 March 2020. He was transferred from a private hospital after three days of hospitalization. Previously, he came to another hospital complaining palpitation, cough, having difficulty of breathing, and intermittent fever. He then was advised to be admitted and tested for a COVID-19 test. At first, he did not admit to having traveled recently. After three days, the pharyngeal swab test was received confirming that he was contracted with COVID-19. The patient was then transferred to our hospital and hospitalized for ten days.Discussion: The patient was fully recovered after ten days of treatment with antiviral drug namely Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day and chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice a day orally. The combination of both drugs showed an immune-modulating activity which might increase its antiviral effects. Therefore, the use of this agent in COVID-19 patients might be worthwhile. During hospitalization, reducing patient anxiety was also one of our main goals as many studies has found that anxiety is associated with poor immune system.Conclusion: This case report demonstrated the current situation in Indonesia where people become reluctant to fully disclose their symptoms or travel history to the health care workers, which may put many others on the risk of being transmitted with the virus. Although the proven efficacy of chloroquine is still lacking, it has become the favorable choice at this moment as indicated in our study. Reducing the patient?s anxiety towards the disease may help to speed the patient?s recovery. Also, we need to educate public that COVID-19 might be a life-threatening disease but it is also a treatable disease.","Dilaruri, Ade; Rahmawati, Ira",Belitung Nursing Journal,,253
491767,Alone on an island: A mixed-methods investigation of salesperson social isolation in general and in times of a pandemic,2021,"There is currently no curative drug therapy for COVID-19. The spread of the virus seems relentless despite the unprecedented epidemiological measures. Prevention remains the only feasible option to stop the pandemic; without population-level vaccination, we are unlikely to regain the quality of social life and the unrestricted economy/commerce we enjoyed before. Anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists are seemingly oblivious to the detrimental effect of COVID-19 both at an individual and societal level. These groups have (and probably will) continue to attempt to undermine efforts to eradicate the virus despite the fact that the major reduction in morbidity/and mortality of infectious diseases of the past century was achieved through the development of vaccines and improved hygiene. Conspiracy theories are directly associated with reduced vaccine uptake and unfortunately neither anti-vaxxers nor vaccine hesitants cannot be persuaded (debunked) with logical arguments; hence, prescribers must not only be aware of the truth underlying the dense web of misinformation but must fully understand the psychological aspects as well to be able to efficiently counsel about the potential benefits and harms. Such knowledge is pivotal to help the lay public to make informed decisions about SARS CoV-2 in general and vaccination in particular; as the COVID-19 situation can probably be best controlled with mass inoculation and novel immune therapies. The lessons learnt regarding the importance of efficient communication and the adherence to the proven epidemiological measures hopefully would be leaving us better prepared for the future if challenged by novel communicable diseases of pandemic potential.","Xantus, Gabor Zoltan; Burke, Derek; Kanizsai, Peter",Postgrad. med. j,,253
491972,Data analysis and modeling of Covid-19,2021,"Semi-arid regions often face severe drought events that reduce agricultural and livestock production. In recent years, some international studies have used multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches combined with geographic information systems (GIS-MCDA) to support decision-makers in assessing the suitability of agricultural land for irrigation in semi-arid regions. Unlike previous studies, which have only considered a single source of water for crop irrigation, this study proposes a GIS-MCDA approach that considers all potentially available local water sources (e.g., groundwater, surface water, and wastewater) as possible alternatives for better multisource water resource management (MWRM) in regions facing water shortages. The geospatial multicriteria evaluation implemented in this study considers a series of technical, environmental, and agricultural productivity criteria using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. Three independent baseline maps were generated, showing the spatial distribution of suitable areas for crop irrigation for each considered water source in the studied area. Surface water, groundwater, and wastewater offered suitable crop irrigation for 83%, 70%, and 26% of the study area, respectively. Overlapping these areas produced a final map showing all the feasible areas for each crop irrigation alternative at the same time. The MWRM approach considering all water sources increased the coverage of suitable areas to be irrigated in the study area by 2.2%, 20.4%, and more than 225% compared to considering surface water, groundwater, and wastewater, respectively, independently. The GIS-MCDA framework proposed in this study provides better support for decision-makers and stakeholders, favouring a reduction in possible conflicts over water scarcity, the diversification of irrigated crops, and an improvement in the quality-quantitative management of water resources in semi-arid regions.","da S Alves, Suênio Anderson F; Coelho, Victor Hugo R; Tsuyuguchi, Bárbara Barbosa; de O Galvão, Carlos; Rêgo, Janiro C; Almeida, Cristiano das N; Abels, Anna; Pinnekamp, Johannes; Rufino, Iana A A",J Environ Manage,,253

492718,Factors Affecting the Development Policies of Digital Deposit Accounts for the Bank in Taiwan,2021,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer in the USA, and African Americans experience disproportionate CRC diagnosis and mortality. Early detection could reduce CRC incidence and mortality, and reduce CRC health disparities, which may be due in part to lower screening adherence and later stage diagnosis among African Americans compared to whites. Culturally tailored interventions to increase access to and uptake of CRC stool-based tests are one effective strategy to increase benefits of screening among African Americans. The objectives of this study were to obtain feedback from African Americans on CRC educational materials being developed for a subsequent behavioral clinical trial and explore participants' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about CRC and CRC screening. Seven focus groups were conducted between February and November 2020. Participants were African Americans recruited through community contacts. Four focus groups were held in-person and three were conducted virtually due to Covid-19 restrictions. Participants ranked CRC educational text messages and provided feedback on a culturally tailored educational brochure. A focus group guide with scripted probes was used to elicit discussion and transcripts were analyzed using traditional content analysis. Forty-two African Americans participated. Four themes were identified from focus group discussions: (1) knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs on CRC and CRC screening; (2) reliable sources of cancer education information; (3) cultural factors affecting perspectives on health; and (4) community insights into cancer education. Participant input on the brochure was incorporated in content creation. Engaging African American community members to qualitatively examine cancer prevention has value in improving implementation strategy and planning for behavioral clinical trials.","Luque, John S; Vargas, Matthew; Wallace, Kristin; Matthew, Olayemi O; Tawk, Rima; Ali, Askal A; Kiros, Gebre-Egziabher; Harris, Cynthia M; Gwede, Clement K",J. cancer educ,,253

Nasopharyngeal specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses collected in universal viral transport (UVT) medium were pre-processed by several commercial and laboratory-developed methods and tested by RT-qPCR assays without RNA extraction using different RT-qPCR master mixes. The results were compared to that of standard approach that involves RNA extraction. Incubation of specimens at 65°C for 10 minutes along with the use of TaqPath&#8482; 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix provides higher analytical sensitivity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA than many other conditions tested. The optimized direct RT-qPCR approach demonstrated a limit of detection of 6.6x103 copy/ml and high reproducibility (co-efficient of variation = 1.2%). In 132 nasopharyngeal specimens submitted for SARS-CoV-2 testing, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our optimized approach were 95%, 99% and 98.5%, respectively, with reference to the standard approach. Also, the RT-qPCR CT values obtained by the two methods were positively correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.6971, p = 0.0013). The rate of PCR inhibition by the direct approach was 8% compared to 9% by the standard approach. Our simple approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR may help laboratories continue testing for the virus despite reagent shortages or expand their testing capacity in resource limited settings.","Hasan, Mohammad Rubayet; Mirza, Faheem; Al-Hail, Hamad; Sundararaju, Sathyavathi; Xaba, Thabisile; Iqbal, Muhammad; Alhussain, Hashim; Yassine, Hadi Mohamad; Perez-Lopez, Andres; Tang, Patrick",PLoS One,,253

Materials and Methods: The clinical data of older adults with COVID-19 admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center during January 20, 2020 to March 16, 2020 were collected. The possible risk factors of severe or critical illness were investigated with Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression models for univariate and multivariate analyses to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For the prediction indicators, optimum cut-off points were determined by calculating Youden's index. The efficacy of risk prediction of severe or critical illness was examined through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: A total of 110 older adults with COVID-19 were included, in which 21 (19.1%) patients had severe or critical illness of COVID-19. Multivariable regression analysis showed that CD4 cells and D-dimer were independent risk factors. D-dimer, CD4 cells, and CD cells/D-dimer ratio with cut-off values of 0.65 (mg/L), 268 (cell/µL) and 431 were in the prediction of severe or critical illness of older adults with COVID-19. The AUC value of D-dimer, CD4 cells, CD4 cells/D-dimer ratio, the tandem combination and the parallel combination to predict severe or critical illness of the older adults with COVID-19 were 0.703, 0.804, 0.794, 0.812 and 0.694, respectively. Conclusion: D-dimer and CD4 cells either by themselves or in combination have demonstrated predictive value in risk stratification as well as established the prognosis of severe or critical illness in older adults with COVID-19.","Zhang, Xiao-Yu; Zhang, Lin; Zhao, Yang; Chen, Liang",Clin Interv Aging,,253
494383,Sub-prime Crisis or COVID-19: A Comparative Analysis of Volatility in Indian Banking Sectoral Indices,2020,"The implementation of deep learning based computer aided diagnosis systems for the classification of mammogram images can help in improving the accuracy, reliability, and cost of diagnosing patients. However, training a deep learning model requires a considerable amount of labeled images, which can be expensive to obtain as time and effort from clinical practitioners is required. A number of publicly available datasets have been built with data from different hospitals and clinics. However, using models trained on these datasets for later work on images sampled from a different hospital or clinic might result in lower performance. This is due to the distribution mismatch of the datasets, which include different patient populations and image acquisition protocols. The scarcity of labeled data can also bring a challenge towards the application of transfer learning with models trained using these source datasets. In this work, a real world scenario is evaluated where a novel target dataset sampled from a private Costa Rican clinic is used, with few labels and heavily imbalanced data. The use of two popular and publicly available datasets (INbreast and CBIS-DDSM) as source data, to train and test the models on the novel target dataset, is evaluated. The use of the semi-supervised deep learning approach known as MixMatch, to leverage the usage of unlabeled data from the target dataset, is proposed and evaluated. In the tests, the performance of models is extensively measured, using different metrics to assess the performance of a classifier under heavy data imbalance conditions. It is shown that the use of semi-supervised deep learning combined with fine-tuning can provide a meaningful advantage when using scarce labeled observations. We make available the novel dataset for the benefit of the community.","Calderon-Ramirez, Saul; Murillo-Hernandez, Diego; Rojas-Salazar, Kevin; Elizondo, David; Yang, Shengxiang; Molina-Cabello, Miguel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11696v1.pdf,253

This reduced capacity, along with public reluctance to undergo endoscopy during the pandemic, might result in excess mortality from delayed cancer diagnosis. Using the UK's National Endoscopy Database (NED), we performed the first national analysis of the impact of the pandemic on endoscopy services and endoscopic cancer diagnosis. DESIGN: We developed a NED COVID-19 module incorporating procedure-level data on all endoscopic procedures. Three periods were designated: pre-COVID (6 January 2020 to 15 March), transition (16-22 March) and COVID-impacted (23 March-31 May). National, regional and procedure-specific analyses were performed. The average weekly number of cancers, proportion of missing cancers and cancer detection rates were calculated. RESULTS: A weekly average of 35 478 endoscopy procedures were performed in the pre-COVID period. Activity in the COVID-impacted period reduced to 12% of pre-COVID levels; at its low point, activity was only 5%, recovering to 20% of pre-COVID activity by study end. Although more selective vetting significantly increased the per-procedure cancer detection rate (pre-COVID 1.91%; COVID-impacted 6.61%; p<0.001), the weekly number of cancers detected decreased by 58%. The proportion of missing cancers ranged from 19% (pancreatobiliary) to 72% (colorectal). CONCLUSION: This national analysis demonstrates the remarkable impact that the pandemic has had on endoscopic services, which has resulted in a substantial and concerning reduction in cancer detection. Major, urgent efforts are required to restore endoscopy capacity to prevent an impending cancer healthcare crisis.","Rutter, Matthew D; Brookes, Matthew; Lee, Thomas J; Rogers, Peter; Sharp, Linda",Gut,,253

While the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19 within routine laboratory parameters are emerging, the impact of sex and age on these profiles is still unknown. METHODS: A multidimensional analysis was performed involving millions of records of laboratory parameters and diagnostic tests for 178 887 individuals from Brazil, of whom 33 266 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Analyzed data included those relating to complete blood cell count, electrolytes, metabolites, arterial blood gases, enzymes, hormones, cancer biomarkers, and others. FINDINGS: COVID-19 induced similar alterations in laboratory parameters in males and females. CRP and ferritin were increased, especially in older men with COVID-19, whereas abnormal liver function tests were common across several age groups, except for young women. Low peripheral blood basophils and eosinophils were more common in the elderly with COVID-19. Both male and female COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units displayed alterations in the coagulation system, and higher values for neutrophils, CRP, and lactate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered the laboratory profiles of a large cohort of COVID-19 patients, which formed the basis of discrepancies influenced by aging and biological sex. These profiles directly linked COVID-19 disease presentation to an intricate interplay between sex, age, and immune activation.","Ten-Caten, Felipe; Gonzalez-Dias, Patrícia; Castro, Ícaro; Ogava, Rodrigo L T; Giddaluru, Jeevan; Silva, Juan Carlo S; Martins, Felipe; Gonçalves, André N A; Costa-Martins, André G; Araujo, José D; Viegas, Ana Carolina; Cunha, Fernando Q; Farsky, Sandra; Bozza, Fernando A; Levin, Anna S; Pannaraj, Pia S; de Silva, Thushan I; Minoprio, Paola; Pinheiro da Silva, Fabiano; Andrade, Bruno B; Nakaya, Helder I",Int J Infect Dis,,253
495858,Characteristics of 2020 stock market crash: The COVID-19 induced extreme event,2021,"COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by a coronavirus, designed as SARS CoV-2, whose clinical presentation is widely variable, with most patients having mild or no symptoms, but others developing a malign disease with multi-organ failure and even death. Accumulating data from different populations have shown that obesity is a risk factor for a severe evolution of the disease, however, the mechanisms that explain this association are not clearly understood. An ominous evolution of COVID-19 has been attributed to an exacerbated inflammatory response, designed as ""cytokine storm"" with augmented production of cytokines/chemokines through the activation of toll-like receptors (TLR) by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, that triggers an inflammatory downstream response, mediated in part by the adaptor molecule, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). Previous studies have reported an increased expression of MyD88 and TLRs in people with obesity, mainly in those with metabolic complications. Therefore, we hypothesize, that an underlying increased Myd88/TLR signaling may predispose to patients with obesity to develop an exaggerated and dangerous inflammatory reaction against SARS CoV-2 infection, explaining at least in part, the higher severity of COVID-19. In addition, MyD88/TLR signaling in people with obesity could have a role in the development of several chronic diseases.","Cuevas, Ada M; Clark, Jeanne M; Potter, James J",Int J Obes (Lond),,253

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, is highly contagious and has rapidly expanded worldwide since its discovery. Quantitative nucleic acid testing has become the gold standard for diagnosis and guiding clinical decisions regarding the use of antiviral therapy. However, the RT-qPCR assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 have a number of challenges, especially in terms of primer design. Primers are the pivotal components of a RT-qPCR assay. Once virus mutation and recombination occur, it is difficult to effectively diagnose viral infection by existing RT-qPCR primers. Some primers and probes have also been made available on the WHO website for reference. However, no previous review has systematically compared the previously reported primers and probes and described how to design new primers in the event of a new coronavirus infection. This review focuses on how primers and probes can be designed methodically and rationally, and how the sensitivity and specificity of the detection process can be improved. This brief review will be useful for the accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of the new coronavirus pneumonia.","Li, Dandan; Zhang, Jiawei; Li, Jinming",Theranostics,,253

To better devise control strategies, policymakers should adjust policies based on scientific evidence in hand. Several countries have limited the epidemics of COVID-19 by prioritizing containment strategies to mitigate the impacts on public health and healthcare systems. However, asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 complicated traditional symptom-based approaches for disease control. In addition, drastic population-based interventions usually have significant societal and economic impacts. Therefore, in Taiwan, the containment strategies consisted of the more extended case-based interventions (e.g., case detection with enhanced surveillance and contact tracing with active monitoring and quarantine of close contacts) and more targeted population-based interventions (e.g., face mask use in recommended settings and risk-oriented border control with corresponding quarantine requirement).

499787,Impact of lean six sigma at pharmacy unit on hospital profitability before and during Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"Purpose of Review: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by the development of a deleterious hyperinflammatory response, in which the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 plays a pivotal role. The administration of immunomodulatory therapies has been proposed to revert the tissue damage induced by COVID-19-related cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The present review summarizes the biological rationale and available clinical experience with this therapeutic strategy in the specific scenario solid organ transplantation (SOT). Recent Findings: A number of case reports, case series, and non-controlled cohort studies have assessed the efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-6-receptor monoclonal tocilizumab in SOT (namely kidney transplantation) recipients with COVID-19 pneumonia and CRS. Although the heterogeneity in patient management and the lack of a control group limit the interpretation of these results, tocilizumab therapy appears to provide some clinical benefit in post-transplant COVID-19 and to be reasonably safe in terms of bacterial superinfection. A large randomized clinical trial (RCT) has shown survival benefit with adjuvant corticosteroids in non-transplant patients, but supporting evidence is scarce for SOT recipients and confounded by the variable adjustment of baseline immunosuppression. Anecdotal experiences have been reported with the use of the anti-IL-1 agent anakinra and the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor colchicine in this population. Summary: Immunomodulation has emerged as a promising option for SOT recipients with COVID-19-related CRS, with available experience mainly restricted to the anti-IL-6 agent tocilizumab. However, the supporting evidence is scarce and of low quality. In the absence of RCT, observational studies including well-matched control groups should be designed in future.","Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; Aguado, José María",Curr Transplant Rep,,253

501331,Leading and Working From Home in Times of COVID-19: On the Perceived Changes in Leadership Behaviors,2021,"INTRODUCTION: A serious patient safety incident at a cancer centre in Ontario, Canada, saw a patient fall from an elevated treatment couch. A regional investigation recommended the use of a securing safety strap. The authors evaluate the value of the strap through the experiences of the radiation therapists' who use it. A secondary aim is to explore the potential for using a securing safety strap with UK therapeutic radiographers. METHODS: A two-stage design was guided by an evidence-based practice framework. Stage one used a questionnaire to capture treating radiation therapists' experiences and opinions of the strap at a single cancer centre. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively and free-text data via a content analysis. Stage two used semistructured interviews with thematic analysis to explore views of three UK therapeutic radiographers. RESULTS: Twenty-five of approximately 130 eligible staff responded to the Canadian questionnaire. Of the respondents, 24% (n = 6) 'strongly disagreed', 28% (n = 7) 'agreed' and 48% (n = 12) 'neither agreed nor disagreed' that they would recommend the strap to other departments. Most of the respondents think strap use should be at the staffs' discretion, with patients with dementia/cognitive impairment ranked as the group benefiting most. Ninety-two percent (n = 23) of respondents confirmed that patients sometimes refuse the strap. Themes arising from stage two interviews are as follows: patient benefit (use for select patients only); patient safety versus control (restraint); and practical implementation issues. CONCLUSION: The policy of universal use of the strap should be reviewed. Those who use it are equivocal about its value and feel it should be reserved for select patients at the treating professional's discretion. Full evaluation of the effectiveness and acceptability of the device for different patients may promote both staff enthusiasm towards the device and evidence-based practice. Adequate resources are required to evaluate implementation of such safety initiatives.","Judge, Annabelle; Feuz, Carina; Evans, David; Courtier, Nicholas",,,253

The assessment methods of disease activity and response to therapy are limited and mainly rely on colonoscopy. This meta-analysis reviews the effectiveness of using faecal calprotectin as a marker for mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel disease. Two meta-analyses were conducted in parallel. The analysis on the use of faecal calprotectin in monitoring mucosal healing in colonic Crohn's disease is based on 16 publications (17 studies). The data set for diagnostic values of faecal calprotectin in ulcerative colitis is composed of 35 original publications (total 49 studies). The DOR for the use of faecal calprotectin in Crohn's disease is estimated to be 11.20 and the area under the sROCis 0.829. In cases of ulcerative colitis, the DOR is 14.48, while the AUC sROC is 0.858. Heterogeneity of the studies was moderatetosubstantial. Collected data show overall good sensitivity and specificity of the faecal calprotectin test, as well as a good DOR.

502222,"COVID 19 Crisis: Economic Stimulus, International Trade and Environmental Sustainability",2020,"BACKGROUND: In a densely populated country like Bangladesh, mental health-related burden and associated adverse outcomes are quite prevalent. However, exploration of sleep-related issues in general, and more specifically of insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic has been scarce and restricted to a single location. The present study investigated the prevalence of insomnia and its predictive factors in the general population, and included Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to identify regional heterogeneities of insomnia in Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Information related to socio-demographics, knowledge of COVID-19, behaviors related to COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, and insomnia were included in a questionnaire, and coupled with GIS-based spatial analysis to identify regional susceptibility to insomnia. RESULTS: Approximately 30.4%, 13.1% and 2.8% of participants reported sub-threshold, moderate, and severe forms of insomnia, respectively. Independent predictive risk factors of insomnia symptoms included female gender, college education, urban residence, presence of comorbidities, using social media, taking naps during daytime, and fear of COVID-19. District-wide variations in the spatial distribution of fear of COVID-19 and insomnia were significantly associated. CONCLUSION: Insomnia is frequently present during a pandemic, and exhibits regional variability along with multifactorial determinants. These analytic approaches should enable improved detection and targeting of at-risk sectors of the population, and enable implementation of appropriate measures to ensure improved sleep quality.","Al Mamun, Firoj; Gozal, David; Hosen, Ismail; Misti, Jannatul Mawa; Mamun, Mohammed A",Sleep medicine,,253

502884,Measuring the effect of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) on mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic using global mobility data,2021,"Early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is essential to control the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. We develop a rapid and accurate one-step multiplex TaqMan probe-based real-time RT-PCR assay, along with a computational tool to systematically analyse the data. Our assay could detect to a limit of 15 copies of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts—based on experiments performed by spiking total human RNA with in vitro synthesized viral transcripts. The assay was evaluated by performing 184 validations for the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid gene and human RNase P as an internal control reference gene with dilutions ranging from 1-100 ng for human RNA on a cohort of 26 clinical samples. 5 of 26 patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, while 21 tested negative, consistent with the standards. The accuracy of the assay was found to be 100% sensitive and 100% specific based on the 26 clinical samples that need to be further verified using a large number of clinical samples. In summary, we present a rapid, easy to implement real-time PCR based assay with automated analysis using a novel COVID qPCR Analyzer tool with graphical user interface (GUI) to analyze the raw qRT-PCR data in an unbiased manner at a cost of under $3 per reaction and turnaround time of less than 2h, to enable in-house SARS-CoV-2 testing across laboratories.Infectious disease; Microbial genomics; Genomics; Molecular biology; Virology; Diagnostics; SARS-CoV-2; Real-time RT- PCR; COVID-19 detection assay; COVID qPCR analyzer; Graphical user interface (GUI)","Dharavath, Bhasker; Yadav, Neelima; Desai, Sanket; Sunder, Roma; Mishra, Rohit; Ketkar, Madhura; Bhanshe, Prasanna; Gupta, Anurodh; Redhu, Archana Kumari; Patkar, Nikhil; Dutt, Shilpee; Gupta, Sudeep; Dutt, Amit",Heliyon,,253
503511,L’afrique des pauvretés à l’heure du COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the global COVID-19 pandemic, has severely impacted Central Asia; in spring 2020, high numbers of cases and deaths were reported in this region. The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is currently breaching the borders of Central Asia. Public health surveillance is necessary to inform policy and guide leaders; however, existing surveillance explains past transmissions while obscuring shifts in the pandemic, increases in infection rates, and the persistence of the transmission of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide enhanced surveillance metrics for SARS-CoV-2 transmission that account for weekly shifts in the pandemic, including speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence, to better understand the risk of explosive growth in each country and which countries are managing the pandemic successfully. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 60 days of COVID-19-related data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the Central Asia region as a function of the prior number of cases, level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: COVID-19 transmission rates were tracked for the weeks of September 30 to October 6 and October 7-13, 2020, in Central Asia. The region averaged 11,730 new cases per day for the first week and 14,514 for the second week. Infection rates increased across the region from 4.74 per 100,000 persons to 5.66. Russia and Turkey had the highest 7-day moving averages in the region, with 9836 and 1469, respectively, for the week of October 6 and 12,501 and 1603, respectively, for the week of October 13. Russia has the fourth highest speed in the region and continues to have positive acceleration, driving the negative trend for the entire region as the largest country by population. Armenia is experiencing explosive growth of COVID-19; its infection rate of 13.73 for the week of October 6 quickly jumped to 25.19, the highest in the region, the following week. The region overall is experiencing increases in its 7-day moving average of new cases, infection, rate, and speed, with continued positive acceleration and no sign of a reversal in sight. CONCLUSIONS: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic requires novel dynamic surveillance metrics in addition to static metrics to effectively analyze the pandemic trajectory and control spread. Policy makers need to know the magnitude of transmission rates, how quickly they are accelerating, and how previous cases are impacting current caseload due to a lag effect. These metrics applied to Central Asia suggest that the region is trending negatively, primarily due to minimal restrictions in Russia.","Post, Lori Ann; Benishay, Elana T; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert Leo; Achenbach, Chad J; Ison, Michael G; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren Nadya; White, Janine; Chaudhury, Azraa S; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James Francis",J Med Internet Res,,253
503553,The Environmental Story During the COVID-19 Lockdown: How Human Activities Affect PM2.5 Concentration in China?,2020,"Objective: To understand the mental health status and its risk factors among discharged COVID-19 patients during the first month of centralized quarantine and the subsequent home isolation. Methods: The scales of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to measure the symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression in 782 COVID-19 patients during the first month of centralized quarantine (March 16 to 26, 2020) and then during home isolation (April 3 to 10, 2020). Results: During the centralized quarantine, the prevalence rates of insomnia, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were 44.37, 31.59, and 27.62%, respectively, and those during the home isolation decreased significantly at 27.11, 17.26, and 16.11%, respectively. In both waves, women showed a higher prevalence of symptoms of poor mental health compared to men, and middle-aged (40-59 years old) and elderly (&#8805;60 years old) showed a higher risk of symptoms of poor mental health compared to the younger. In addition, the severity of COVID-19 revealed no significant relationship to symptoms of poor mental health, whereas, the interaction analysis revealed that those with other underlying diseases showed more symptoms of poor mental health during the centralized quarantine and a greater decrease during the follow-up home isolation. Conclusion: The discharged COVID-19 patients suffered from mental health problems such as, insomnia, depression, and anxiety, and this was especially so for women, the middle-aged and elderly, and those with underlying diseases, but along with the rehabilitation and the environmental change from centralized quarantine to home isolation, all the mental symptoms were significantly alleviated. Based on a follow-up investigation, the current results provide critical evidence for mental health and early rehabilitation upon the discharged COVID-19 patients.","Li, Li; Wu, Michael Shengtao; Tao, Junxiu; Wang, Weijun; He, Jing; Liu, Ru; Guo, Juan; Chen, Yun; Li, Kejian; Li, Shilong; Qi, Bo; Han, Buxin",Front Public Health,,253

METHODS: Detailed clinical data including clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, imaging features and treatments of 1190 cases of adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Associations between sex and clinical outcomes were identified by multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: There were 635 (53.4%) male and 555 (46.6%) female patients in this study. Higher rates of acute kidney injury (5.5% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.026), acute cardiac injury (9.1% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (2.5% vs. 0.7%, P = 0.024) were observed in males. Compared with female patients, male patients with COVID-19 had a higher inhospital mortality rate (15.7% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.005). However, Cox regression analysis showed that sex did not influence inhospital mortality of COVID-19 patients.

Soluble interleukin 2 receptors (sIL2R) have been suspected as being prognostic markers for infectious diseases. This study validated the usefulness of sIL2R as a marker for deaths related to COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled participants who showed positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA admitted to the current hospital between 01 April and 30 September 2020. Of the 102 patients enrolled in this study, sIL2R levels were measured in 87 patients. For comparisons between survival and non-survival groups, potential confounding variables were entered into univariate models, and variables showing significant correlations (p < 0.05) in those models were added to a multivariate model. RESULTS: Being aged &#8805;60 years and sIL2R levels &#8805;1060 U/ml were significantly associated with mortality on univariate analyses; only sIL2R levels significantly correlated with mortality on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Further, sequential sIL2R levels in three patients were increased at progression or death.

We present the SEIR-Net model, for a network of social group interactions, as a development of the classic mathematical model of SEIR epidemics (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic)-Removed). In the SEIR-Net model, we can simulate social contacts between groups divided by age groups and analyze different strategies of social distancing. In the vertical distancing policy, only older people are distanced, whereas in the horizontal distancing policy all age groups adhere to social distancing. These two scenarios are compared to a control scenario in which no intervention is made to distance people. The vertical distancing scenario is almost as bad as the control, both in terms of people infected and in the acceleration of cases. On the other hand, horizontal distancing, if applied with the same intensity in all age groups, significantly reduces the total infected people ""flattening the disease growth curve"".

Background: Most existing studies measured trust by administering questionnaires at the end of an experiment. Only a limited number of studies viewed trust as a dynamic variable that can strengthen or decay over time. Method: Seventy-five participants took part in an aided memory recognition task. In the task, participants viewed a series of images and later on performed 40 trials of the recognition task to identify a target image when it was presented with a distractor. In each trial, participants performed the initial recognition by themselves, received a recommendation from an automated decision aid, and performed the final recognition. After each trial, participants reported their trust on a visual analog scale. Results: Outcome bias and contrast effect significantly influence human operators' trust adjustments. An automation failure leads to a larger trust decrement if the final outcome is undesirable, and a marginally larger trust decrement if the human operator succeeds the task by him-/her-self. An automation success engenders a greater trust increment if the human operator fails the task. Additionally, automation failures have a larger effect on trust adjustment than automation successes. Conclusion: Human operators adjust their trust in automation as a result of their moment-to-moment interaction with automation. Their trust adjustments are significantly influenced by decision-making heuristics/biases. Application: Understanding the trust adjustment process enables accurate prediction of the operators' moment-to-moment trust in automation and informs the design of trust-aware adaptive automation.","Yang, X.

The purpose of our article is to demonstrate how the interRAI LTC facility (LTCF) assessment can inform clinical care and evaluate the effect of strategies to mitigate worsening mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a supporting analysis of the effects of lockdown in homes without COVID-19 outbreaks on depression, delirium, and behavior problems in a network of 7 LTC homes in New Brunswick, Canada, where mitigative strategies were deployed to minimize poor mental health outcomes (eg, virtual visits and increased student volunteers). This network meets regularly to review performance on risk-adjusted quality of care indicators from the interRAI LTCF and share learning through a community of practice model. We included 4209 assessments from 765 LTC residents between January 2017 to June 2020 and modeled the change within and between residents for depression, delirium, and behavioral problems over time with longitudinal generalized estimating equations. Though the number of residents who had in-person visits with family decreased from 73.2% before to 17.9% during lockdown (chi square, P < .001), the number of residents experiencing delirium (4.5%-3.5%, P = .51) and behavioral problems (35.5%-30.2%, P = .19) did not change. The proportion of residents with indications of depression decreased from 19.9% before to 11.5% during lockdown (P < .002). The final multivariate models indicate that the effect of lockdown was not statistically significant on depression, delirium, or behavioral problems. Our analyses demonstrate that poor mental health outcomes associated with lockdown can be mitigated with thoughtful intervention and ongoing evaluation with clinical information systems. Policy makers can use outputs to guide resource deployment, and researchers can examine the data to identify better management strategies for when pandemic strikes again.","McArthur, Caitlin; Saari, Margaret; Heckman, George A; Wellens, Nathalie; Weir, Julie; Hebert, Paul; Turcotte, Luke; Jbilou, Jalila; Hirdes, John P",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,253
510060,"Global Economic Crisis, Energy Use, CO2 Emissions, and Policy Roadmap Amid COVID-19",2020,"Mosquito borne diseases are a group of infections that affect humans. Emerging or reemerging diseases are those that (re)occur in regions, groups or hosts that were previously free from these diseases: dengue virus; chikungunya virus; Zika virus; West Nile fever and malaria. In Europe, these infections are mostly imported; however, due to the presence of competent mosquitoes and the number of trips both to and from endemic areas, these pathogens are potentially emergent or re-emergent. Present and future climatic conditions, as well as meteorological, environmental and demographic aspects are risk factors for the distribution of different vectors and/or diseases. This review aimed to identify and analyze the existing literature on the transmission of mosquito borne diseases and those factors potentially affecting their transmission risk of them in six southern European countries with similar environmental conditions: Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In addition, we would identify those factors potentially affecting the (re)introduction or spread of mosquito vectors. This task has been undertaken with a focus on the environmental and climatic factors, including the effects of climate change. We undertook a systematic review of the vectors, diseases and their associations with climactic and environmental factors in European countries of the Mediterranean region. We followed the PRISMA guidelines and used explicit and systematic methods to identify, select and critically evaluate the studies which were relevant to the topic. We identified 1302 articles in the first search of the databases. Of those, 160 were selected for full-text review. The final data set included 61 articles published between 2000 and 2017.39.3% of the papers were related with dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus or their vectors. Temperature, precipitation and population density were key factors among others. 32.8% studied West Nile virus and its vectors, being temperature, precipitation and NDVI the most frequently used variables. Malaria have been studied in 23% of the articles, with temperature, precipitation and presence of water indexes as the most used variables. The number of publications focused on mosquito borne diseases is increasing in recent years, reflecting the increased interest in that diseases in southern European countries. Climatic and environmental variables are key factors on mosquitoes' distribution and to show the risk of emergence and/or spread of emergent diseases and to study the spatial changes in that distributions.","Brugueras, Silvia; Fernández-Martínez, Beatriz; Martínez-de la Puente, Josué; Figuerola, Jordi; Porro, Tomas Montalvo; Rius, Cristina; Larrauri, Amparo; Gómez-Barroso, Diana",Environ Res,,253
510284,Managing in a Post-COVID-19 World,2020,"Networks, representing attitudinal survey data, expose the structure of opinion-based groups. We make use of these network projections to identify the groups reliably through community detection algorithms and to examine social-identity-based groups. Our goal is to present a method for revealing polarisation and opinion-based in attitudinal surveys. This method can be broken down into the following steps: data preparation, construction of similarity-based networks, algorithmic identification of opinion-based groups, and identification of important items for community structure. We assess the method's performance and possible scope for applying it to empirical data and to a broad range of synthetic data sets. The empirical data application points out possible conclusions (i.e. social-identity polarisation), whereas the synthetic data sets mark out the method's boundaries. Next to an application example on political attitude survey, our results suggest that the method works for various surveys but is also moderated by the efficacy of the community detection algorithms. Concerning the identification of opinion-based groups, we provide a solid method to rank the item's influence on group formation and as a group identifier. We discuss how this network approach for identifying polarisation can classify non-overlapping opinion-based groups even in the absence of extreme opinions.","Dinkelberg, Alejandro; O'Sullivan, David JP; Quayle, Michael; MacCarron, P'adraig",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14427v4.pdf,253
510318,"Introduction to the Symposium on COVID-19, Global Mobility and International Law (preprint)",2020,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill COVID-19 patients have a clear pattern of inflammation and hypercoagulable state. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome of severe COVID-19 patients basing on prothrombotic risk factors (i.e. D-dimer). We also evaluated the impact of different doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on the incidence of bleedings. METHODS: The data of forty-two patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were retrospectively analyzed. On ICU admission, patients with D-dimerâ¯<â¯3000â¯ng/mL (Group 1) received enoxaparin 4000 UI (6000 UI, if body mass index >35) subcutaneously b.i.d. and patients with D-dimerâ¯&#8805;â¯3000â¯ng/mL (Group 2) received enoxaparin 100â¯UI/kg every 12â¯h. Aspirin was administered to all patients once a day. RESULTS: Both groups presented a high incidence of perivascular thrombosis (40.9% in Group 1 and 30% in Group 2). Patients of Group 2 suffered a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than Group 1 (65% vs 13.6%, pâ¯=â¯0.001). One patient (4.5%) of Group 1 and three patients (15%) of Group 2 suffered from minor bleeding; no patient had major bleeding. Group 2 had a longer ICU and hospital stay than Group 1 (11.5â¯±â¯5.6 vs 9.0â¯±â¯4.8 and 30â¯±â¯4.9 vs 21â¯±â¯2.3, pâ¯<â¯0.05, respectively) as well as increased ICU mortality (25% vs 9.1%). CONCLUSIONS: More severe critically ill COVID-19 patients have a high incidence of VTE and worse outcome, despite the use of heparin at the therapeutic dose. However, the use of heparin did not increase the incidence of bleeding complications.","Pavoni, Vittorio; Gianesello, Lara; Pazzi, Maddalena; Stera, Caterina; Meconi, Tommaso; Frigieri, Francesca Covani",Thromb Res,,253

511295,The impact of social distancing on COVID19 spread: State of Georgia case study,2020,"Following the detection of the new coronavirus1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In response, many European countries have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as the closure of schools and national lockdowns. Here we study the effect of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of the COVID-19 epidemics in February 2020 until 4 May 2020, when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks previously, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries, with both individual and shared effects on the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). Pooling allows for more information to be used, helps to overcome idiosyncrasies in the data and enables more-timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters (such as the infection fatality rate), does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in Rt are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behaviour. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that are incomplete, show systematic biases in reporting and are subject to future consolidation. We estimate that-for all of the countries we consider here-current interventions have been sufficient to drive Rt below 1 (probability Rt < 1.0 is greater than 99%) and achieve control of the epidemic. We estimate that across all 11 countries combined, between 12 and 15 million individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4 May 2020, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions-and lockdowns in particular-have had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.","Flaxman, Seth; Mishra, Swapnil; Gandy, Axel; Unwin, H Juliette T; Mellan, Thomas A; Coupland, Helen; Whittaker, Charles; Zhu, Harrison; Berah, Tresnia; Eaton, Jeffrey W; Monod, Mélodie; Ghani, Azra C; Donnelly, Christl A; Riley, Steven; Vollmer, Michaela A C; Ferguson, Neil M; Okell, Lucy C; Bhatt, Samir",Nature,,253
511589,Understanding changes in park visitation during the COVID-19 pandemic: A spatial application of big data,2021,"COVID-19 restrictions necessitated wholescale conversion of curricula to online learning environments globally. We used a mixed-methods study design to evaluate the conversion of a large foundational interprofessional course, at our university, to an asynchronous online learning environment. A survey was used to gauge if students learned interprofessionally and about interprofessional collaborative practice (IPCP). A COVID-19 discussion board was used to assess learner knowledge of their own and other health professions and value for IPCP. Survey results indicated students perceived the online session as effective as it would have been in person. The COVID-19 discussion board presented evidence that students met all Interprofessional Education Collaborative core competencies for IPCP, shared knowledge of their and other health professions, and expressed the value and essentiality of IPCP. Findings support social context as a main requisite for interprofessional education, and within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, students were able to heighten their connection to the global interprofessional community. Circumstances surrounding COVID-19 highlight the need for increasing IPCP education. One unforeseen positive that has emerged in spite of this global catastrophe is enhanced student awareness of IPCP and interprofessional comradery as evidenced through student discussions in this course.","Jones, Tobie A; Vidal, Graciela; Taylor, Cynthia",J Interprof Care,,253

The main manifestations were fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, normal or leukopenia in peripheral blood and changes in chest CT and in severe cases, multiple organ failure might occur. The National Health Commission, PRC has revised the consensus on diagnosis and treatment seven times in a short period of time, indicating the growing understanding of the disease. Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia usually had history of travelling or living in the epidemic area including Wuhan within 14 days before onset, or have been exposed to patients who had fever or respiratory symptoms from the epidemic area, or had clustering diseases. However, novel coronavirus pneumonia was becoming more and more blurred after vanishing epidemic. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia were challenges not only because of large number of tourists increasing dramatically after the relieving of epidemic, but also patients with other diseases from different areas to search for medical care. In this article, the clinical and chest imaging features of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were reviewed and compared with other infections and non-infectious diffuse pulmonary diseases. We try to find the similarities and differences among them, and to identify clues to the diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia, so as to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.","Tian, X L; Peng, M; Wang, H P; Cai, B Q; Xu, W B; Zhu, Y J; Li, T S; Zhu, H D; Song, L; Wang, M Z; Zhang, L; Shi, J H",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,,253

Three haze stages were identified: the pre-pollution period (PPP), pollution accumulation period (PAP) and pollution dissipation period (PDP). The dominant source of PM2.5 in the PPP was biomass burning (BB) (40.4%), followed by secondary inorganic sources (28.1%) and motor vehicle exhaust (11.7%). The PAP was characterized by a large abundance of secondary inorganic sources, which contributed 56.1% of the total PM2.5 concentration, followed by BB (17.4%). The absorption Ångström exponent (2.2) in the PPP was higher than that in the other two periods. Analysis of fire spots monitored by remote satellite sensing indicated that open BB in regions around Nanning City could be one of the main factors. A planetary boundary layer-relative humidity-secondary particle matter-particulate matter positive feedback mechanism was employed to elucidate the atmospheric processes in this study. This study highlights the importance of understanding the role of BB, secondary inorganic sources and meteorology in air pollution formation and calls for policies for emission control strategies.","Mo, Zhaoyu; Huang, Jiongli; Chen, Zhiming; Zhou, Bin; Zhu, Kaixian; Liu, Huilin; Mu, Yijun; Zhang, Dabiao; Wang, Shanshan",Sci Rep,,253

515125,Responding to the climate crisis: The importance of virtual conferencing post-pandemic,2020,"Social motivation accounts of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) posit that individuals with ASD find social stimuli less rewarding than neurotypical (NT) individuals. Behaviorally, this is proposed to manifest in reduced social orienting (individuals with ASD direct less attention towards social stimuli) and reduced social seeking (individuals with ASD invest less effort to receive social stimuli). In two meta-analyses, involving data from over 6000 participants, we review the available behavioral studies that assess social orienting and social seeking behaviors in ASD. We found robust evidence for reduced social orienting in ASD, across a range of paradigms, demographic variables and stimulus contexts. The most robust predictor of this effect was interactive content - effects were larger when the stimulus involved an interaction between people. By contrast, the evidence for reduced social seeking indicated weaker evidence for group differences, observed only under specific experimental conditions. The insights gained from this meta-analysis can inform design of relevant task measures for social reward responsivity and promote directions for further study on the ASD phenotype.","Hedger, Nicholas; Dubey, Indu; Chakrabarti, Bhismadev",Neurosci. biobehav. rev,,253

It responds to the absence in research of the voices of people with dementia living in care homes during the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a single case study design applied thematic analysis to semi-structured interview data to discover the experiences of one person living with dementia in a care home during a period of lockdown. Findings: Five themes reveal how the participant responded to the practical and emotional challenges of the pandemic: autonomy;fears;keeping connected;keeping safe and other people living with dementia. These themes highlight the participant’s ability to adapt, accept and dispute lockdown restrictions, revealing considerable insight into their situation. Research limitations/implications: The pandemic has restricted access to care homes, which informed the single case study design. This approach to the research may restrict the generalisability of the findings. Other researchers are encouraged to include the voices of people with dementia living in care homes in further studies. Practical implications: Implications for practice, presented in this paper, promote quality psychosocial approaches when health-care workers engage with people living with dementia during periods of restricted activity.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study carried out on patients over 80 years admitted for COVID-19 in a Geriatrics Service. Sociodemographic, clinical, functional, mental, analytical, radiological, therapeutic and healthcare variables were collected. The factors associated with in-hospital lethality were analyzed by bivariate analysis. RESULTS: 58 cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included, mean age 88.3 ± 5.4 years, 69% women, 65.5% moderate-severe cognitive impairment and previous Barthel index 40.66 ± 36. The main symptoms were fever (60,3%), dyspnea (53.4%) and deterioration of functional condition (50%). The most frequent comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (75.9%), hypertension (HT) (74.1%) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (50%). A mortality rate of 41,4% was detected and the associated factors were: severe functional dependence (OR = 3.8 [1.2-12.2]), moderate-severe cognitive impairment (OR = 4.9 [1-25.4]) and CKD (OR = 3.2 [1.1-9.7]). CONCLUSION: High mortality rates are observed in older patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with a higher risk of dying in those with severe functional dependence or cognitive impairment. These findings reinforce the value of Geriatric Assessment to develop strategies to adapt diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making and to optimize care for elderly patients in the event of a new epidemic outbreak.","Gutiérrez Rodríguez, José; Montero Muñoz, Javier; Jiménez Muela, Francisco; Guirola García-Prendes, Cristina; Martínez Rivera, Marta; Gómez Armas, Laura",Rev. esp. geriatr. gerontol.

The goal of this study is to project the number of COVID19 infections and resulting severe outcomes, and the need for hospital capacity under social distancing, particularly, shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine for the State of Georgia. We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread. The model utilizes COVID19-specific parameters and data from Georgia on population interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a seven and a half-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The following outcomes are compared at the state and community levels: the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. The results suggest that shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from approximately 180K under no intervention and 113K under school closure, respectively, to below 53K, and delayed the peak from April to July or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 2-9% and 3-11% decrease in cumulative infection and deaths, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 53K to 25K, and decreased cumulative infections by about 50%. The cumulative number of deaths ranged from 6,660 to 19,430 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 6 days. Overall, shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine substantially reduced COVID19 infections, healthcare resource needs, and severe outcomes.","Keskinocak, Pinar; Oruc, Buse Eylul; Baxter, Arden; Asplund, John; Serban, Nicoleta",PLoS One,,253

For this reason, a detailed evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains currently circulating in different geographic regions of the world was performed. A compositional analysis as well as a Bayesian coalescent analysis of complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains recently isolated in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia was performed. The results of these studies revealed a diversification of SARS-CoV-2 strains in three different genetic clades. Co-circulation of different clades in different countries, as well as different genetic lineages within different clades were observed. The time of the most recent common ancestor was established to be around 1st November 2019. A mean rate of evolution of 6.57 × 10-4 substitutions per site per year was found. A significant migration rate per genetic lineage per year from Europe to South America was also observed. The results of these studies revealed an increasing diversification of SARS-CoV-2 strains. High evolutionary rates and fast population growth characterizes the population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 strains.","Castells, Matías; Lopez-Tort, Fernando; Colina, Rodney; Cristina, Juan",J Med Virol,,253

We investigated whether implementation of an oral care protocol for general practitioners (GPs [family physicians]) can improve patient-centered outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Twenty-four GP offices were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group (12 offices each). In the experimental group, GPs and nurse practitioners implemented an oral care protocol. No extra attention was given to oral health in the control group. The primary outcome parameter was oral health-related quality of life (QoL) assessed with the 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile at baseline and 1 year later. Other outcomes were self-reported oral health complaints and general health-related QoL (36-item Short Form Health Survey). RESULTS: Of 764 patients with type 2 diabetes, 543 (71.1%) completed the 1-year follow-up. More patients reported improved oral health-related QoL in the experimental group (35.2%) compared to the control group (25.9%) (P = .046; P adj = .049). In a secondary post hoc analysis including GP offices with &#8805;60% patient follow-up (n = 18), improvement was 38.3% and 24.9%, respectively (P and P adj = .011). Improvement of self-reported oral health complaints did not differ between groups. The intervention had no effect on general health-related QoL, with the exception of the concept scale score for changes in health over time (P adj = .033). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an oral care protocol in primary diabetes care improved oral health-related QoL in patients with type 2 diabetes.","Verhulst, Martijn J L; Teeuw, Wijnand J; Gerdes, Victor E A; Loos, Bruno G",Ann Fam Med,,253

521935,The road to more sustainable firms in the face of a pandemic: Changes needed in employment relationships,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It appeared in China in late 2019 and rapidly spread to most countries of the world. Cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at higher risk of developing severe infection and death. This risk increases further in the presence of lymphopenia affecting the lymphocytes count. Here, we develop a delayed within-host SARS-CoV-2/cancer model. The model describes the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients and its effect on the functionality of immune responses. The model considers the time delays that affect the growth rates of healthy epithelial cells and cancer cells. We provide a detailed analysis of the model by proving the nonnegativity and boundedness of the solutions, finding steady states, and showing the global stability of the different steady states. We perform numerical simulations to highlight some important observations. The results indicate that increasing the time delay in the growth rate of cancer cells reduced the size of tumors and decreased the likelihood of deterioration in the condition of SARS-CoV-2/cancer patients. On the other hand, lymphopenia increased the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 particles and cancer cells, which worsened the condition of the patient.","Al Agha, Afnan Alshehaiween Safiya Elaiw Ahmed Alshaikh Matuka",Mathematics,,253
522015,Home gardening and urban agriculture for advancing food and nutritional security in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"With mounting evidence and notable cases of large clustered infections, airborne transmission via droplets and particles has been recently acknowledged as an effective mode of transmission for COVID-19. How droplets and aerosol particles disperse are being transported into the human breathing zone-the last few inches for airborne transmission to effectuate-remains a key question which has been widely overlooked. Human thermal plume refers to the constantly rising airflows around the boundary layer of human body due to persisting temperature gradients between the body surfaces and the ambient air. Ample evidence indicated that the thermal plume controls the dispersion and transport of aerosols in the human microenvironment. Given that in calm indoor environments most air inhaled by human comes from the boundary layer where thermal plume flows through constantly, the role of thermal plume needs to be scrutinized to predict the diffusion of droplets, aerosols and other airborne carriers of the novel coronavirus around the human body for prioritizing infection control strategies. Here, we assessed the potential influences of the thermal plume on the transmission of COVID-19 and other airborne pathogens by reviewing the most pertinent evidence and analyzing key variables in the formation of thermal plume in indoor environments, e.g., ambient temperature, human posture and type of clothing. Our reviewed evidence and data indicate that the human thermal plume should facilitate the airborne transmission of COVID-19 in enclosed spaces by elevating small droplets and airborne particles into the breathing zone from lower regions and ascending respiratory droplets from the sources into the upper atmosphere. By drawing attention to aerosol transport dynamics in the human microenvironment, these insights may be useful for understanding COVID-19 transmission in enclosed spaces, especially those intended for public use.","Sun, Shiyi; Li, Jing; Han, Jie",Environ Chem Lett,,253
522590,Sustainable design of courtyard environment: From the perspectives of airborne diseases control and human health,2020,"Background: Diarrhea is the most common illness in children under 5 years of age, accounting for a financial burden for families in developing countries. Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the out-of-pocket health expenditure for the management of diarrhoeal illness among the under-five children in in-patient and out-patient cases. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during January-April 2018 among 60 under-five children with diarrheal illness reporting to pediatric outpatient department (OPD) and 60 under-five children admitted to pediatric ward of a tertiary care teaching hospital. For determining the out-of-pocket health expenditure, both direct and indirect costs for the management of diarrheal illness were estimated both for out-patient and in-patient cases. The cost of the treatment has been presented as the cost of prehospital visits, during a hospital visit and posthospital visit. Results: Overall, median out-of-pocket health expenditure for the management of diarrheal illness for out-patient and in-patient cases were Rs. 1186 (interquartile range [IQR]: Rs. 510) and Rs. 6385 (IQR: Rs. 5889), respectively. The median direct expenditure for OPD cases was Rs. 778.50 (IQR: Rs. 263) and indirect expenditure for OPD cases were Rs. 407.50 (IQR: Rs. 336) The median direct and indirect expenditure for inpatient cases were Rs. 3823 (IQR: Rs. 1942) and Rs. 2237 (IQR: Rs. 4256) respectively. Only 13% of in-patient cases had some kind of medical insurance. Conclusion: A considerable economic burden is faced by the families for treating diarrhea in under-five children. Improved access to safe drinking water and sanitation, promotion of hand hygiene, exclusive breastfeeding, rotavirus vaccination, and use of oral rehydration therapy will reduce hospitalization and out-of-pocket expenditure. The study findings recommend for appropriate policy for provision of financial protection while seeking health care services.","Pradhan, Himanshu Sekhar; Mohakud, Nirmal Kumar; Kavitha, A K; Nayak, Manas Kumar; Satpathy, Sudhir Kumar",Indian J Public Health,,253

How to form an effective food supply chain in pandemic conditions is the one of the most important questions nowadays. The agro-food system is becoming not only a tool for solving many economic and social problems that arise in the context of a pandemic, but itself is experiencing a serious impact from consumers, business, and the state. The pandemic negatively affected the agri-food system of different countries. Among the main problems, we will single out the reduction in demand for fresh food, disruptions in the supply of incoming resources, both for the production of products and for their sales, a shortage of labour, especially seasonal. The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food supply chains in Russia. Using the example of supply chains in St. Petersburg, we show that the food supply chain tends to be shorter because of the consumer’s willingness to buy food direct from farmers avoiding risks to be infected with COVID-19. Another change in food supply chain is the increasing role of government in regulation of food security in region.","Nesterenko, N.; Vetrova, M.; Ivanova, D.",IOP Conference Series.

Intraoperative findings, including irregularity of the ossicles, facial nerve, or chorda tympani; size of the TM and EAC on computed tomography; and pre- and postoperative hearing level, were collected. RESULTS: We included 7 and 18 patients with and without CEACS, respectively. The malleus handle defect, anterior deviation of the chorda tympani, and small TM (&#8804;7 mm) (p-values 0.015, <0.001, and 0.003, respectively; Fisher's exact test) had significantly higher prevalence in patients with CEACS than in those without. The mean postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) in patients with CEACS was not significantly different from that in patients with normal-sized EAC (20.6 dB and 19.5 dB, respectively; p-value, 0.121; Mann-Whitney U test). No difference was observed in mean postoperative ABG between patients with small TM and those with normal-sized TM (19.2 dB and 20.0 dB, respectively; p-value, 0.469; Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSION: Patients with CEACS were more likely to have malleus handle defect, anterior deviation of the chorda tympani, and small TM than those without CEACS. Hearing outcome of patients with CEACS and a malformed malleus and/or incus might be equivalent to that of patients without CEACS following tympanoplasty and/or canalplasty, regardless of the EAC or TM size.","Nakajima, Takahiro; Fukami, Satoru; Motegi, Masaomi; Kanaya, Hiroaki; Kojima, Hiromi; Haruna, Shinichi",Auris nasus larynx,,253

524197,Transience and hope: A return to Freud in a time of pandemic,2021,"Computational models for the simulation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic evolution would be extremely useful to support authorities in designing healthcare policies and lockdown measures to contain its impact on public health and economy. In Italy, the devised forecasts have been mostly based on a pure data-driven approach, by fitting and extrapolating open data on the epidemic evolution collected by the Italian Civil Protection Center. In this respect, SIR epidemiological models, which start from the description of the nonlinear interactions between population compartments, would be a much more desirable approach to understand and predict the collective emergent response. The present contribution addresses the fundamental question whether a SIR epidemiological model, suitably enriched with asymptomatic and dead individual compartments, could be able to provide reliable predictions on the epidemic evolution. To this aim, a machine learning approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to automatically identify the model parameters based on a training set of data of progressive increasing size, considering Lombardy in Italy as a case study. The analysis of the scatter in the forecasts shows that model predictions are quite sensitive to the size of the dataset used for training, and that further data are still required to achieve convergent -- and therefore reliable -- predictions.","Paggi, Marco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08207v1.pdf,253

Staff may feel that they, or other people, have acted wrongly and be distressed by this. This represents moral injury, which has been linked with significant mental ill health. This survey asked essential workers in County Durham and Darlington about their experiences during the first wave of the pandemic and anything they felt would help. Wellbeing and moral injury were rated using sliders. There were 566 responses. A majority of respondents reported feeling troubled by other people's actions they felt were wrong (60% scored over 40, where 0 is 'not at all troubled' and 100 'very troubled', median score=52.5). Respondents were generally less troubled by their own actions (median score=3). Wellbeing and moral injury scores varied by employment sector (e.g. NHS staff were more troubled by the actions of others than non-NHS staff). Staff suggestions included regular supervisor check-ins, ensuring kindness from everyone, fair rules and enforcement and improving communication and processes. Respondents offered simple, practical actions that could be taken by leaders at team, organisation, societal and government policy levels to tackle moral injury and the underlying causes of moral injurious environments. Using these findings to develop a strategy to address moral injury is important, not only for staff wellbeing, but staff retention and continued delivery of vital services in these challenging times. Working together, we can seek to reduce and mitigate 'moral injury' the same way we do for other physical 'injuries' in the workplace.","Guy, C.

However, few studies have evaluated the impact on the access to mental health services during COVID-19. Our aim was to analyze temporal trends and prediction of appointments held in Brazil's public health system, to compare the observed and expected number of mental healthcare appointments during the COVID-19 pandemics. METHODS: An ecological time-series study was performed, analyzing mental health appointments before and during the pandemic (from 2016 and 2020) from the Brazilian governmental database. The structural break in the data series was assessed using the Chow test, with the break considered in March 2020. Bayesian structural time-series models were used to estimate current average appointments and the predicted expectation if there was no pandemic. FINDINGS: Compared to the expected, between March and August 2020 about 28% less outpatient appointments in mental health were observed, totaling 471,448 individuals with suspended assistance. Group appointments and psychiatric hospitalizations were also severely impacted by the pandemic (decreased of 68% and 33%, respectively). On the other hand, mental health emergency consultations and home care increased during this period (36% and 52%, respectively). INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate a dramatic change in mental health assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, which corroborates a recent WHO survey. This phenomenon can aggravate the mental health crisis and generate a parallel pandemic that may last for a longer time than the COVID-19 pandemic. FUNDING: This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.","Ornell, Felipe; Borelli, Wyllians Vendramini; Benzano, Daniela; Schuch, Jaqueline Bohrer; Moura, Helena Ferreira; Sordi, Anne Orgler; Kessler, Felix Henrique Paim; Scherer, Juliana Nichterwitz; von Diemen, Lisia",Lancet Reg Health Am,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518824/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X21000570; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100061; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667193X21000570,253

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), adapts and evolves rapidly in nature. With the availability of 16,092 SARS‐CoV‐2 full genomes in GISAID as of 13 May, we removed the poor‐quality genomes and performed mutational profiling analysis for the remaining 11,183 viral genomes. Global analysis of all sequences identified all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome and critical SNPs with high mutation frequency that contributes to five‐clade classification of global strains. A total of 119 SNPs were found with 74 non‐synonymous mutations, 43 synonymous mutations and two mutations in intergenic regions. Analysis of geographic pattern of mutational profiling for the whole genome reveals differences between each continent. A transition mutation from C to T represents the most mutation types across the genome, suggesting rapid evolution and adaptation of the virus in host. Amino acid (AA) deletions and insertions found across the genome results in changes in viral protein length and potential function alteration. Mutational profiling for each gene was analysed, and results show that nucleocapsid gene demonstrates the highest mutational frequency, followed by Nsp2, Nsp3 and Spike gene. We further focused on non‐synonymous mutational distributions on four key viral proteins, spike with 75 mutations, RNA‐dependent‐RNA‐polymerase with 41 mutations, 3C‐like protease with 22 mutations and Papain‐like protease with 10 mutations. Results show that non‐synonymous mutations on critical sites of these four proteins pose great challenge for development of anti‐viral drugs and other countering measures. Overall, this study provides more understanding of genetic diversity/variability of SARS‐CoV‐2 and insights for development of anti‐viral therapeutics.","Yuan, Fangfeng; Wang, Liping; Fang, Ying; Wang, Leyi",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207070/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13931,253

The absence of a standardized, emergency general surgery transfer algorithm creates the potential for unnecessary transfers. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical reasoning prompting emergency general surgery transfers and to initiate a discussion for optimal emergency general surgery use. METHODS: Consecutive emergency general surgery transfers (December 2018 to May 2019) to 2 tertiary centers were prospectively enrolled in an institutional review board–approved protocol. Clinical reasoning prompting transfer was obtained prospectively from the accepting/consulting surgeon. Patient outcomes were used to create an algorithm for emergency general surgery transfer. RESULTS: Two hundred emergency general surgery transfers (49% admissions, 51% consults) occurred with a median age of 59 (18 to 100) and body mass index of 30 (15 to 75). Insurance status was 25% private, 45% Medicare, 21% Medicaid, and 9% uninsured. Weekend transfers (Friday to Sunday) occurred in 45%, and 57% occurred overnight (6:00 pm to 6:00 am). Surgeon-to-surgeon communication occurred with 22% of admissions. Pretransfer notification occurred with 10% of consults. Common transfer reasons included no surgical coverage (20%), surgeon discomfort (24%), or hospital limitations (36%). A minority (36%) underwent surgery within 24 hours; 54% did not require surgery during the admission. Median length of stay was 6 (1 to 44) days. CONCLUSION: Conditions prompting emergency general surgery transfers are heterogeneous in this rural state review. There remains an unmet need to standardize emergency general surgery transfer criteria, incorporating patient and hospital factors and surgeon availability. Well-defined requirements for communication with the accepting surgeon may prevent unnecessary transfers and maximize resource allocation.","Bruenderman, Elizabeth H.; Block, Stacy B.; Kehdy, Farid J.; Benns, Matthew V.; Miller, Keith R.; Motameni, Amirreza; Nash, Nicholas A.; Bozeman, Matthew C.; Martin, Robert C.G.",Surgery,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039606020305547; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039606020305547; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33012562/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2020.08.022,253

While health experts urge citizens to adopt preventative measures such as social distancing and wearing a mask, these recommended behaviors are not always followed by the public. To find a way to promote preventative measures, the present study examined the role of gain-loss framing of COVID-19 related messages on social distancing and mask wearing compliance. Moreover, the study also tested potential moderating effects on framing with three individual characteristics: political ideology, subjective numeracy, and risk attitude. A sample of 375 U.S. adult residents were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each participant read either a gain or loss-framed message related to practicing protective behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants also completed scales of preventative behaviors, risk attitude, subjective numeracy, political ideology, and other demographic variables. It was found that those who were more liberal, risk-averse and had greater subjective numeracy were more likely to wear a mask and/or follow social distancing. Furthermore, in the presence of demographic and psychological factors, the study found participants in the loss-framed condition than in the gain-framed condition were more likely to adopt both preventative measures, supporting the notion of loss aversion. Additionally, the framing effect was also moderated by political ideology on mask-wearing, with the effect being stronger in liberals than in conservatives. Collectively, the study implies message framing may be a useful means to promote preventative measures in the current pandemic.","Steffen, Jordan; Cheng, Jiuqing",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341651/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02148-x,253
594020,The future of commodity prices and the pandemic-driven global recession: Evidence from 150 years of data,2020-09-09,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to respiratory failure due to severe immune response. Treatment targeting this immune response might be beneficial but there is limited evidence on its efficacy. The aim of this study was to determine if early treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with tocilizumab and/or steroids was associated with better outcome. METHODS: This observational single-center study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were not intubated and received either standard of care (SOC, controls) or SOC plus early (within 3 days from hospital admission) anti-inflammatory treatment. SOC consisted of hydroxychloroquine 400mg bid plus, in those admitted before March 24(th), also darunavir/ritonavir. Anti-inflammatory treatment consisted of either tocilizumab (8mg/kg intravenously or 162mg subcutaneously) or methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg for 5 days or both. Failure was defined as intubation or death, and the endpoints were failure-free survival (primary endpoint) and overall survival (secondary) at day 30. Difference between the groups was estimated as Hazard Ratio by a propensity score weighted Cox regression analysis (HR(OW)). RESULTS: Overall, 196 adults were included in the analyses. They were mainly male (67.4%), with comorbidities (78.1%) and severe COVID-19 pneumonia (83.7%). Median age was 67.9 years (range, 30–100) and median PaO(2)/FiO(2) 200 mmHg (IQR 133–289). Among them, 130 received early anti-inflammatory treatment with: tocilizumab (n = 29, 22.3%), methylprednisolone (n = 45, 34.6%), or both (n = 56, 43.1%). The adjusted failure-free survival among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC treated patients vs. SOC was 80.8% (95%CI, 72.8–86.7) vs. 64.1% (95%CI, 51.3–74.0), HR(OW) 0.48, 95%CI, 0.23–0.99; p = 0.049. The overall survival among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC patients vs. SOC was 85.9% (95%CI, 80.7–92.6) vs. 71.9% (95%CI, 46–73), HR(OW) 0.41, 95%CI: 0.19–0.89, p = 0.025. CONCLUSION: Early adjunctive treatment with tocilizumab, methylprednisolone or both may improve outcomes in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Mikulska, Malgorzata; Nicolini, Laura Ambra; Signori, Alessio; Di Biagio, Antonio; Sepulcri, Chiara; Russo, Chiara; Dettori, Silvia; Berruti, Marco; Sormani, Maria Pia; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Vena, Antonio; De Maria, Andrea; Dentone, Chiara; Taramasso, Lucia; Mirabella, Michele; Magnasco, Laura; Mora, Sara; Delfino, Emanuele; Toscanini, Federica; Balletto, Elisa; Alessandrini, Anna Ida; Baldi, Federico; Briano, Federica; Camera, Marco; Dodi, Ferdinando; Ferrazin, Antonio; Labate, Laura; Mazzarello, Giovanni; Pincino, Rachele; Portunato, Federica; Tutino, Stefania; Barisione, Emanuela; Bruzzone, Bianca; Orsi, Andrea; Schenone, Eva; Rosseti, Nirmala; Sasso, Elisabetta; Da Rin, Giorgio; Pelosi, Paolo; Beltramini, Sabrina; Giacomini, Mauro; Icardi, Giancarlo; Gratarola, Angelo; Bassetti, Matteo",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817707/,253

Digital health technology may increase the accessibility to and personalization of care, whereas remote biosensors could optimize the collection of vital clinical parameters, irrespective of patients' ability to visit the clinic. To facilitate the wide-scale adoption of digital health care technology and to align current initiatives, we outline a road map that will identify clinically relevant digital parameters; mediate the development of benefit-to-burden criteria for innovative technology; and direct the validation, harmonization, and adoption of digital health care technology in real-world settings. We define two key end products of the road map: (1) a set of reliable digital parameters to capture data collected under free-living conditions that reflect patient-centric measures and facilitate clinical decision making and (2) an integrated, open-source system that provides personalized feedback to patients, health care providers, clinical researchers, and caregivers and is linked to a flexible and adaptable platform that integrates patient data in real time. Given the ever-changing care needs of patients and the relentless progression rate of motor neuron disease, the adoption of digital health care technology will significantly benefit the delivery of care and accelerate the development of effective treatments.","van Eijk, Ruben P A; Beelen, Anita; Kruitwagen, Esther T; Murray, Deirdre; Radakovic, Ratko; Hobson, Esther; Knox, Liam; Helleman, Jochem; Burke, Tom; Rubio Pérez, Miguel Ángel; Reviers, Evy; Genge, Angela; Steyn, Frederik J; Ngo, Shyuan; Eaglesham, John; Roes, Kit C B; van den Berg, Leonard H; Hardiman, Orla; McDermott, Christopher J",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/28766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34550089/,253

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective audit of triage coding and ICD-10-AM coding for all patient presentations to four Australian EDs from March 29 to May 31 in 2019 and 2020 (the COVID-19 lockdown period and the corresponding period in 2019), and from June 1 to July 31 in 2019 and 2020 (the post-lockdown period and the corresponding period in 2019). Number of ophthalmic presentations triaged per day and number of seven common and/or time-sensitive, vision threatening ophthalmic diagnoses were examined. Differences in mean daily presentation numbers were assessed with non-paired Student’s t-test with Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Total ophthalmic presentations per day during COVID-19 lockdowns fell by 16% compared to the corresponding period in 2019 (13.0 ± 4.0 in 2019 vs 10.8 ± 3.3 in 2020, mean ± standard deviation; p=0.01). There was also a significant decrease in presentations of atraumatic retinal detachment, conjunctivitis, and eye pain. In the two months following easing of lockdown restrictions, total ophthalmic presentations per day returned to the same level as that of the corresponding period in 2019 (12.2 ± 4.3 in 2019 vs 12.3 ± 4.1 in 2020, p=0.97). CONCLUSION: Total ophthalmic presentations and presentations of atraumatic retinal detachment, conjunctivitis and, eye pain to EDs fell during the lockdowns associated with the first wave of COVID-19 in Australia.

In literature, alternative protocols for treating cavities are always of interest in terms of reducing pain and preserving tissue. In this case report, the use of a new gel-based on papain, which has a chemical effect on bacteria and allows the consistency of the altered tissue to be modified, leads to a less traumatic removal of the infected tissue. In this case report, BRIX3000, a gel with papain as its main ingredient, was used to treat an interproximal cavity on an upper premolar of a 35-year-old man frightened of the turbine. After a clinical check of all the systematic conditions and a first view of the oral cavity, the protocol was explained to the patient, and informed consent was obtained. The protocol involved applying the papain gel directly to the cavity, and after 2.5–3 minutes, it was removed. The complete removal of the infected tissue was achieved in three steps. The patient reported no discomfort, and the cavity was completely treated and ready to be restored. In conclusion, BRIX3000 seems to be a good alternative to the turbine in cavity treatment, particularly in patients who have discomfort during traditional treatments and are frightened of the turbine.","Mancini, Leonardo; Pisaneschi, Alessia; Mancini, Vincenzo; Ginoble, Marino; Quinzi, Vincenzo; Marchetti, Enrico; Marzo, Giuseppe",Case Rep Dent,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6624825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194848/,253
602071,Maintaining Student Engagement during an Abrupt Instructional Transition: Lessons Learned from COVID-19,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected millions of people and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. METHOD: The rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The E2SFCA has two major steps. First, it calculates a bed-to-population ratio for each hospital location. Second, it sums these ratios for residential locations where hospital locations overlap. RESULTS: The comparison of the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of population at risk identifies which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. This study also identified vulnerable population residing in the areas with low spatial accessibility in Chicago. CONCLUSION: Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of healthcare resources provides an improved understanding of how well the healthcare infrastructure is equipped to save people’s lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.","Kang, Jeon-Young; Michels, Alexander; Lyu, Fangzheng; Wang, Shaohua; Agbodo, Nelson; Freeman, Vincent L.; Wang, Shaowen",Int J Health Geogr,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-020-00229-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32928236/,253
602447,Digital media and misinformation: An outlook on multidisciplinary strategies against manipulation,2021-05-27,"On the basis of Covid-19-induced pulmonary pathological and vascular changes, we hypothesized that the anti-VEGF drug bevacizumab might be beneficial for treating Covid-19 patients. We recruited 26 patients from 2-centers (China and Italy) with confirmed severe Covid-19, with respiratory rate [≥]30 times/min, oxygen saturation [≤]93% with ambient air, or partial arterial oxygen pressure to fraction of inspiration O2 ratio (PaO2/FiO2) >100mmHg and [≤]300 mmHg, and diffuse pneumonia confirmed by chest radiological imaging. This trial was conducted from Feb 15 to April 5, 2020, and followed up for 28 days. Relative to comparable control patients with severe Covid-19 admitted in the same centers, bevacizumab showed clinical efficacy by improving oxygenation and shortening oxygen-support duration. Among 26 hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19 (median age, 62 years, 20 [77%] males), bevacizumab plus standard care markedly improved the PaO2/FiO2 ratios at days 1 and 7 (elevated values, day 1, 50.5 [4.0,119.0], p<0.001; day 7, 111.0 [85.0,165.0], p<0.001). By day 28, 24 (92%) patients showed improvement in oxygen-support status, 17 (65%) patients were discharged, and none showed worsen oxygen-support status nor died. Significant reduction of lesion areas and ratios were shown in chest CT or X-ray analysis within 7 days. Of 14 patients with fever, body temperature normalized within 72 hours in 13 (93%) patients. Lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood were significantly increased and CRP levels were markedly decreased as shown in available data. Our findings suggested bevacizumab plus standard care was highly beneficial for treating patients with severe Covid-19.

Summary Introduction In November 2002 an epidemic of atypical pneumonia appeared in the Chinese region of Guandong. It was subsequently given the name “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome” (SARS) following the occurrence of further outbreaks in Hanoi and Hong Kong in February 2003. Five cases related to the same patient source have been reported in France. Case report We report the case of a patient of 52 years who had direct contact with a probable case of SARS. On admission the patient presented with pyrexia associated with lymphopenia and liver cell necrosis but no respiratory symptoms. The chest x-ray was normal. The thoracic CT scan showed a sub pleural ground glass appearance. Early (36 hours) PCR studies of naso-pharyngeal washings were negative for the coronavirus associated with SARS. The diagnosis was confirmed serologically. Conclusions This observation demonstrates the existence of incomplete clinical presentations of SARS. The infectivity of this asymptomatic form is unknown. Serological analyses will allow better identification. The continuing danger of seasonal recurrence, particularly in the winter, cannot be ignored. In this context the recognition of probably infectious asymptomatic forms is essential.","André, M.; Talarmin, F.; Le Guen, P.; Nicolas, X.; Garcia, J.-F.; Natali, F.",Revue des Maladies Respiratoires,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842505854440; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842505854440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15968766/,253

607471,The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the air quality in China: Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment,2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19’s precise impact on cancer patients and their oncologic care providers remains poorly understood. This study aims at comparatively analyzing COVID-19’s effect on cancer care from both patient and provider perspectives. METHODS: A multi-institutional survey was developed to assess COVID-19-specific concerns regarding treatment, safety, and emotional stress through 5-point Likert-type prompts and open-ended questions before and during the pandemic. Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests were used to analyze before/during answers for providers and patients independently. Open-ended responses were assessed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 104 (69.3%) patients and 50 (50%) providers. Patients demonstrated a significant change in only 1 of 15 Likert prompts. Most significant were increased concern regarding susceptibility to infection [z = 2.536, p = 0.011] and concerns regarding their cancer outcome [z = 4.572, p < 0.001]. Non-physician providers demonstrated significant change in 8 of 13 Likert prompts, whereas physicians had all 13 Likert prompts change in the COVID-19 setting. Physicians believed care to be more poorly planned [z = −3.857, p ≤ 0.001], availability of protective personal equipment to be more limited [z = −4.082, p < 0.001], and were significantly concerned infecting family members [z = 4.965, p < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: While patients had more difficulty coping with their cancer, they did not perceive significant differences in their actual treatment. This suggests the need for a renewed focus on patients coping with cancer. Among providers, physicians more than any other provider group had a strong negative perception of COVID-19’s impact on healthcare, suggesting the need for novel approaches to target physician burnout.","Salehi, Omid; Alarcon, Sylvia V.; Vega, Eduardo A.; Kutlu, Onur C.; Kozyreva, Olga; Chan, Jennifer A.; Kazakova, Vera; Harz, Dominique; Conrad, Claudius",J Gastrointest Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-021-05032-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027579/,253

Knowledge, attitude, and practice of hand hygiene have been extensively studied suggesting adequate knowledge but poor compliance. Similar data on aprons, mobile phone and stethoscope disinfection practices are lacking. This becomes an extensively important topic of discussion in current COVID-19 pandemic where inadequacy in hygiene practices is devastating. AIM: To study the knowledge, attitude, and infection prevention practices of HCWs aprons, electronic devices, stethoscopes, and hands. METHODS: A cross sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted among HCWs of Medicine ward and ICU. RESULTS: Sixty-six HCWs responded to the survey. Awareness that hands, aprons, mobile phones, stethoscopes could cause cross transmission and knowledge of correct practices was present in majority of the respondents. Hand hygiene was performed by 65.2% of the respondents before touching a patient and 54.5% after touching the patient surroundings while 13.6% performed only when it was visibly soiled. Mobile phones and stethoscopes were disinfected by 13.6 and 30.3% of the respondents after each patient encounter, respectively. Aprons were washed after using them at a stretch for a median duration of 5 days (1-30 days). Forgetfulness, lack of reinforcement, lack of time, inadequate awareness on standard disinfection practices and fear of damaging electronic devices from disinfectants use were reasons for poor compliance. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to spread awareness and formulate standard guidelines on disinfection practices especially for mobile phones, stethoscopes, and aprons in addition to reinforcing hand hygiene practices.","KUMAR, ARVIND; KERI, VISHAKH C.; KHAN, MAROOF AHMAD; RANJAN, PIYUSH; RASTOGI, NEHA; SAHU, MONALISA; WIG, NAVEET",J Prev Med Hyg,https://doi.org/10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2021.62.1.1742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322624/,253

Key parameters affecting the amplification of full antibody repertoires includes the availability of primers that can amplify as many V genes as possible; however the strategy used to design these primers and programs used to make the necessary alignments have not been well studied and clearly detailed in the literature. Here, we present a set of primers computationally designed by iCODEHOP based on a database of human germline Ig sequences. We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols that would recognize the V(H) genes from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We identified the most highly conserved region in framework 1 and framework 4 of the Ig cDNA, and designed a set of degenerated 5′ primers. The V(H) genes were successfully amplified by RT-PCR. This new primer has facilitated the creation of more diverse V(H) libraries than has been previously possible. Moreover, iCODEHOP improved the primer design efficiency and was found useful both for cloning unknown genes in gene families and for building V(H) gene libraries.","Sun, Ying; Liu, Hong-Yan; Mu, Ling; Luo, En-Jie",World J Microbiol Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11274-011-0830-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22806814/,253

To advance research on the social, behavioral, and contextual factors that influence rural young adult development, this study conducted a scoping review. The review sought to identify how researchers defined rural and how/which theories guided their work; how they integrated the rural context into the research design and methods; and how they used variables, concepts, and outcomes to measure rural experiences. Included articles were published between January 2009 and November 2020, included young adults ages 18–29, measured adult role achievement and/or behavioral health outcomes and reported on these outcomes for young adults, and focused on a rural sample within the United States. A systematic search of four databases resulted in 25 empirical articles for the inductive, qualitative analysis. Most studies used atheoretical approaches focusing on outcomes related to adult social roles, substance use, and mental health. Five themes emerged focused on the definitions of rural, the level of integration into the research design and method, and variables salient to the rural experience. These results reveal that future research should clearly define the rural context and better integrate the rural context into the conceptualization, design, methods, and implications of the empirical research.","Fenton, Melissa Pearman; Forthun, Larry F.; Aristild, Saprina; Vasquez, Katherine B.",Adolesc Res Rev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40894-021-00161-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127948/,253

While most medical resources are allocated to treat COVID-19 patients, fractures still need to be treated, as some patients with non-deferrable pathologies. The aim of this paper is to report the early experience of an integrated team of orthopaedic surgeons during this period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a mono-geographic, observational, retrospective, descriptive study. We collected data from the beginning of the epidemic (1 March 2020), during the pandemic lockdown period (declared in the country on March 16, 2020) until the end of our study period on April 15, 2020. All the 140 patients presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital during this period with a diagnosis of fracture, or trauma (sprains, dislocations, wounds) were included in the cohort. In addition, 12 patients needing hospitalization for planning a non-deferrable elective surgical treatment were included. A group of patients from the two same hospitals and treated during the same period (1(st) March 2018 to April 15, 2018) but previously was used as control. RESULTS: Of these 152 patients (mean age 45.5 years; range 1 to 103), 100 underwent a surgical procedure and 52 were managed non-operatively. Twenty-eight were children and 124 were adults. The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed for four patients. The frequency of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis among this population treated in emergency was ten fold higher (2.6%; 4 among 152) than in the general population (0.30%) of the country. The mortality rate for patients with surgery was 2% (2 of 100 patients) and 50% (2 of 4) for those older than 60 years with COVID-19; it was null for patients who were managed non-operatively. As compared to the year 2018, the number of patients seen with trauma had decreased of 32% during the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased trauma frequency of 32%. The structural organization in our hospital allowed us to reduce the time to surgery and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched medical resources available to treat all the patients who needed orthopedic care during this period.","Hernigou, Jacques; Morel, Xavier; Callewier, Antoine; Bath, Olivier; Hernigou, Philippe",Int Orthop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32451655/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04619-5,253

614780,Machine Learning Forecast of Growth in COVID-19 Confirmed Infection Cases with Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions and Cultural Dimensions: Algorithm Development and Validation,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Pre-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in mink, also known as “sticky kits”, is a frequently occurring syndrome in suckling mink kits on commercial mink farms. Outbreaks of PWD result in weakened kits, increased mortality and reduced growth and welfare as well as considerable economic losses for the farmers. The syndrome is regarded as multifactorial with a complex etiology, and studies have focused on associations with environment, management and dam characteristics. The present study was conducted from May to June 2015 and included 70 dams with mink litters with and without PWD. The aims were to examine associations between PWD and mastitis (bacterial infection and histological signs of inflammation or other lesions in the mammary gland), and to examine associations between PWD and other dam-related characteristics (age, litter size, body mass index, and weight and number of active mammary glands of the dam). RESULTS: Using multivariable mixed logistic regression analyses with farm id as a random intercept, we found that the odds for PWD in the litter were significantly higher in 1 year old dams versus > 1 year old (OR = 13.3, CI 2.0–90.2, P = 0.01), higher if litter size observed after birth was > 5 kits versus ≤ 5 kits (OR = 16.5, CI 2.2–123.7, P = 0.01), higher if the number of active mammary glands per kit was ≤ 1.5 versus > 1.5 glands per kit (OR = 6.5, CI 1.2–36.0), P = 0.03), and higher in farms with high prevalence of PWD versus low prevalence (OR = 16.8, CI 2.9–97.6, P = 0.002). There were no significant associations between PWD and bacterial infection, histological signs of inflammation or other lesions of the mammary gland, body mass index or weight of mammary gland per kit. CONCLUSION: Pre-weaning diarrhea had a statistically significant association with age of the dam, litter size and the number of active mammary glands per kit. However, PWD was not associated with mastitis, body mass index and weight of mammary gland tissue per kit.","Birch, Julie Melsted; Agger, Jens Frederik; Aalbæk, Bent; Struve, Tina; Hammer, Anne Sofie; Jensen, Henrik Elvang",Acta Vet Scand,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-018-0427-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30419935/,253

Staff testing is critical in identifying and isolating infected individuals while also reducing unnecessary workforce depletion. Tygerberg Hospital implemented an online pre-registration system to expedite staff and cluster testing. Objectives: We aimed to identify (1) specific presentations associated with a positive or negative result for SARS-CoV-2 and (2) staff sectors where enhanced strategies for testing might be required. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study involving all clients making use of the hospital's pre-registration system during May 2020. Results: Of 799 clients, most were young and female with few comorbidities. The most common occupation was nurses followed by administrative staff, doctors and general assistants. Doctors tested earlier compared to other staff (median: 1.5 vs 4 days). The most frequent presenting symptoms were headache, sore throat, cough and myalgia. Amongst those testing positive (n=105), fever, altered smell, altered taste sensation, chills and history of fever were the most common symptoms. Three or more symptoms was more predictive of a positive test, but 12/145 asymptomatic clients also tested positive. Conclusion: Staff coronavirus testing using an online pre-registration form is a viable and acceptable strategy. While some presentations are less likely to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, no symptom can completely exclude it. Staff testing should form part of a bundle of strategies to protect staff including wearing masks, regular hand washing, buddy screening, physical distancing, availability of PPE and special dispensation for COVID-19-related leave.","Moolla, M.

620021,COVID and crime: An early empirical look(),2021-01-22,"Background People with active cancer are recognised as at risk of COVID-19 complications, but it is unclear whether the much larger population of cancer survivors is at elevated risk. We aimed to address this by comparing cancer survivors and cancer-free controls for (i) prevalence of comorbidities considered risk factors for COVID-19; and (ii) risk of severe influenza, as a marker of susceptibility to severe outcomes from epidemic respiratory viruses. Methods We included survivors ([≥]1 year) of the 20 most common cancers, and age, sex and general practice-matched cancer-free controls, derived from UK primary care data linked to cancer registrations, hospital admissions and death registrations. Comorbidity prevalences were calculated 1 and 5 years from cancer diagnosis. Risk of hospitalisation or death due to influenza was compared using Cox models adjusted for baseline demographics and comorbidities. Findings 108,215 cancer survivors and 523,541 cancer-free controls were included. Cancer survivors had more asthma, other respiratory, cardiac, diabetes, neurological, renal, and liver disease, and less obesity, compared with controls, but there was variation by cancer site. There were 205 influenza hospitalisations/deaths, with cancer survivors at higher risk than controls (adjusted HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.04-3.80). Haematological cancer survivors had large elevated risks persisting for >10 years (HR overall 15.17, 7.84-29.35; HR >10 years from cancer diagnosis 10.06, 2.47-40.93). Survivors of other cancers had evidence of raised risk up to 5 years from cancer diagnosis only (HR 2.22, 1.31-3.74). Interpretation Risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes are likely to be elevated in cancer survivors. This should be taken into account in policies targeted at clinical risk groups, and vaccination for both influenza, and, when available, COVID-19, should be encouraged in cancer survivors.","Carreira, H.; Strongman, H.; Peppa, M.; McDonald, H.

620489,Lockdown Learnings: No Longer the Mirrored Room,2021-04-06,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 positive players and other players during rugby league matches and determine within-match SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. METHODS: Four Super League matches in which SARS-CoV-2 positive players were subsequently found to have participated were analysed. Players were identified as increased-risk contacts, and player interactions and proximities were analysed by video footage and global positioning system (GPS) data. The primary outcome was new positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 within 14 days of the match in increased-risk contacts and other players participating in the matches. RESULTS: Out of 136 total players, there were 8 SARS-CoV-2 positive players, 28 players identified as increased-risk contacts and 100 other players in the matches. Increased-risk contacts and other players were involved in 11.4±9.0 (maximum 32) and 4.0±5.2 (maximum 23) tackles, respectively. From GPS data, increased-risk contacts and other players were within 2 m of SARS-CoV-2 positive players on 10.4±18.0 (maximum 88) and 12.5±20.7 (maximum 121) occasions, totalling 65.7±137.7 (maximum 689) and 89.5±169.4 (maximum 1003) s, respectively. Within 14 days of the match, one increased-risk contact and five players returned positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) tests, and 27 increased-risk contacts and 95 other participants returned negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. Positive cases were most likely traced to social interactions, car sharing and wider community transmission and not linked to in-match transmission. CONCLUSION: Despite tackle involvements and close proximity interactions with SARS-CoV-2 positive players, in-match SARS-CoV-2 transmission was not confirmed. While larger datasets are needed, these findings suggest rugby presents a lower risk of viral transmission than previously predicted.","Jones, Ben; Phillips, Gemma; Kemp, Simon; Payne, Brendan; Hart, Brian; Cross, Matthew; Stokes, Keith A",Br J Sports Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33574043/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-103714,253

We develop a lesion-attention deep neural network (LA-DNN) to predict COVID-19 positive or negative with a richly annotated chest CT image dataset. The CT image dataset contains 746 public chest CT images of COVID-19 patients collected from over 760 preprints, and the data annotations are accompanied with the textual radiology reports. We extract two types of important information from these annotations: One is the flag of whether an image indicates a positive or negative case of COVID-19, and the other is the description of five lesions on the CT images associated with the positive cases. The proposed data-driven LA-DNN model focuses on the primary task of binary classification for COVID-19 diagnosis, while an auxiliary multi-label learning task is implemented simultaneously to draw the model's attention to the five lesions of COVID-19 during the training. The joint task learning process makes it a highly sample-efficient deep model that can learn COVID-19 radiology features effectively with very limited samples. The experimental results show that the area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity (recall) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients are 91.2% and 85.7% respectively, which reach the clinical standards for practical use.

623378,Continued influence of misinformation in times of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The flaviviridae family comprises single-stranded RNA viruses that enter cells via clathrin-mediated pH-dependent endocytosis. Although the initial events of the virus entry have been already identified, data regarding intracellular virus trafficking and delivery to the replication site are limited. The purpose of this study was to map the transport route of Zika virus and to identify the fusion site within the endosomal compartment. METHODS: Tracking of viral particles in the cell was carried out with confocal microscopy. Immunostaining of two structural proteins of Zika virus enabled precise mapping of the route of the ribonucleocapsid and the envelope and, consequently, mapping the fusion site in the endosomal compartment. The results were verified using RNAi silencing and chemical inhibitors. RESULTS: After endocytic internalization, Zika virus is trafficked through the endosomal compartment to fuse in late endosomes. Inhibition of endosome acidification using bafilomycin A1 hampers the infection, as the fusion is inhibited; instead, the virus is transported to late compartments where it undergoes proteolytic degradation. The degradation products are ejected from the cell via slow recycling vesicles. Surprisingly, NH(4)Cl, which is also believed to block endosome acidification, shows a very different mode of action. In the presence of this basic compound, the endocytic hub is reprogrammed. Zika virus-containing vesicles never reach the late stage, but are rapidly trafficked to the plasma membrane via a fast recycling pathway after the clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Further, we also noted that, similarly as other members of the flaviviridae family, Zika virus undergoes furin- or furin-like-dependent activation during late steps of infection, while serine or cysteine proteases are not required for Zika virus maturation or entry. CONCLUSIONS: Zika virus fusion occurs in late endosomes and is pH-dependent. These results broaden our understanding of Zika virus intracellular trafficking and may in future allow for development of novel treatment strategies. Further, we identified a novel mode of action for agents commonly used in studies of virus entry.

Hawaii is not spared from the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the local population, including high infection rates in racial and ethnic minorities. Early in the pandemic, we described in this journal various technologies used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Herein we characterize a 969-bp SARS-CoV-2 segment of the S gene downstream of the receptor-binding domain. At the John A. Burns School of Medicine Biocontainment Facility, RNA was extracted from an oropharyngeal swab and a nasal swab from two patients from Hawaii who were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 in August 2020. Following PCR, the two viral strains were sequenced using Sanger sequencing, and phylogenetic trees were generated using MEGAX. Phylogenetic tree results indicate that the virus has been introduced to Hawaii from multiple sources. Further, we decoded 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 13 unique SARS-CoV-2 genomes within this region of the S gene, with one non-synonymous mutation (P681H) found in the two Hawaii strains. The P681H mutation has unique and emerging characteristics with a significant exponential increase in worldwide frequency when compared to the plateauing of the now universal D614G mutation. The P681H mutation is also characteristic of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants from the United Kingdom and Nigeria. Additionally, several mutations resulting in cysteine residues were detected, potentially resulting in disruption of the disulfide bridges in and around the receptor-binding domain. Targeted sequence characterization is warranted to determine the origin of multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Hawaii.","Maison, David P.; Ching, Lauren L.; Shikuma, Cecilia M.; Nerurkar, Vivek R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.425497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33442699/,253

COVID-19 deaths are sometimes examined by forensic pathologists, often in the setting of an unknown diagnosis. We assessed the utility of postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) for use as a triage tool for these autopsy examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed PMCT findings in 14 and histopathology in 11 decedents who were positive for COVID-19. RESULTS The predominant imaging findings were bilateral mixed densities, in either a diffuse or peripheral distribution, with traction bronchiectasis, and/or crazy paving. In particular, traction bronchiectasis, ill-defined rounded consolidations, and reverse halo sign are useful when distinguishing from other postmortem changes.

Persons with disabilities face high risks of poverty, poor nutrition, limited inclusion in labor markets and poor mental health as a result. Stigma is likely to play a negative role in this regard and yet, no study has investigated the impact of stigma on depression and self-esteem of persons with disabilities. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted in June 2017 a random sample disability case control household study in Soweto, a township in Johannesburg, South Africa. Using propensity score analysis and structural equation modeling, we investigated the relationship between disability, stigma, depression and self-esteem controlling for socioeconomic covariates. Our main empirical results showed that stigma significantly mediates the association between disability and higher depression on the one hand and between disability and lower self-esteem on the other. This mediating effect exists even after controlling for age, gender, marital status, education, employment and wealth. We also found strong direct associations between disability and depressive mood, somatic indicators and negative feelings such as unhappiness and low self-esteem. Unemployment aggravates depression and low self-esteem while low education worsens self-esteem only. In addition, depression exacerbates low self-esteem. Both unemployment and low education are more common among persons with disabilities aggravating the disability, depression, poor self-esteem nexus. Similarly, persons with disabilities who are more likely to be depressed are also at higher risk of low self-esteem.These results point to a vicious reinforcing circle of exclusion from society, despair and self-deprecation, which could prove difficult to break. Substantial psycho-social support and anti-stigma policies anchored in local cultural values, engaging persons with disabilities and their communities, are required to break this vicious circle.","Trani, Jean-Francois; Moodley, Jacqueline; Anand, Paul; Graham, Lauren; Thu Maw, May Thu",Soc Sci Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33183862/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953620306687; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620306687?v=s5,253

628569,"COVID-19 and its impact on environment: Improved pollution levels during the lockdown period – A case from Ahmedabad, India",2020-08-25,"The notion of candidacy emerged three decades ago through Davison and colleagues’ exploration of people’s understanding of the causes of coronary heart disease. Candidacy was a mechanism to estimate one’s own or others risk of disease informed by their lay epidemiology. It could predict who would develop illness or explain why someone succumbed to it. Candidacy’s predictive ability, however, was fallible, and it was from this perspective that the public’s reticence to adhere to prevention messages could be explained, as ultimately anybody could be ‘at-risk’. This work continues to resonate in health research, with over 700 citations of Davison’s Candidacy paper. Less explored however, is the candidacy framework in its entirety in other illness spheres, where prevention efforts could potentially impact health outcomes. This paper revisits the candidacy framework to reconsider it use within prevention. In doing so, candidacy within coronary heart disease, suicide prevention, diabetes, and cancer will be examined, and key components of candidacy and how people negotiate their candidacy within differing disease contexts will be uncovered. The applicability of candidacy to address modifiable breast cancer risk factors or cancer prevention more broadly will be considered, as will the implications for public health policy.","Batchelor, Samantha; Miller, Emma R.; Lunnay, Belinda; Macdonald, Sara; Ward, Paul R.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639459/,253

A disaster such as a public health crisis has political consequences. COVID-19 is no exception. However, the direction of the effect is not easily determined. To properly understand this phenomenon, it is necessary to analyze how the media frames the crisis. Using Structural Topic Model, this study examines the Korean media's framing of COVID-19 and especially pays attention to international comparative framing. Based on our analysis results, we argue that expanded framing, which compared the quarantine performance of Korea and other countries, induced a positive change in people's attitudes toward the government, leading to a major political victory for the ruling party in the legislative election. Our research not only identifies the impact of international comparative framing on government support but also contributes to the development of methods for measuring media framing utilizing topic modeling methods.","Jo, Wonkwang; Chang, Dukjin",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32974260/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00425,253
629319,Introduction to the Online Nursing Education Best Practices Guide,2020-06-25,"Whether the increased risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization and death observed in Down syndrome (DS) are disease specific or also occur in individuals with DS and non-COVID-19 pneumonias is unknown. This retrospective cohort study compared COVID-19 cases in persons with DS hospitalized in Spain reported to the Trisomy 21 Research Society COVID-19 survey (n = 86) with admissions for non-COVID-19 pneumonias from a retrospective clinical database of the Spanish Ministry of Health (n = 2832 patients). In-hospital mortality rates were significantly higher for COVID-19 patients (26.7% vs. 9.4%), especially among individuals over 40 and patients with obesity, dementia, and/or epilepsy. The mean length of stay of deceased patients with COVID-19 was significantly shorter than in those with non-COVID-19 pneumonias. The rate of admission to an ICU in patients with DS and COVID-19 (4.3%) was significantly lower than that reported for the general population with COVID-19. Our findings confirm that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to higher mortality than non-COVID-19 pneumonias in individuals with DS, especially among adults over 40 and those with specific comorbidities. However, differences in access to respiratory support might also account for some of the heightened mortality of individuals with DS with COVID-19.","Real de Asua, Diego; Mayer, Miguel A.; Ortega, María del Carmen; Borrel, Jose M.; Bermejo, Teresa de Jesús; González-Lamuño, Domingo; Manso, Coral; Moldenhauer, Fernando; Carmona-Iragui, María; Hüls, Anke; Sherman, Stephanie L.; Strydom, Andre; de la Torre, Rafael; Dierssen, Mara",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10163748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442043/,253
630426,Reduction of surface radiative forcing observed from remote sensing data during global COVID-19 lockdown,2021-06-11,"INTRODUCTION: Social distancing measures and hospital preparations for the novel COVID-19 pandemic have been associated with a decline in elective and acute hospital encounters in March and April in several centres in different countries. Malta has one large acute general hospital, Mater Dei (MDH). This study retrospectively analysed these declines since soft lockdown commencing on the 13th March 2020 in a population-based study, the first of its kind. METHODS: Data was obtained as anonymised totals from MDH Clinical Performance Unit. Poisson regression was used to model the counts of weekly A&E attendances and hospital admissions. RESULTS: Outpatient attendances declined in March, stabilised in April 2020 and started to climb in May. April attendances fell to 18.8% in paediatrics and 23.4% in adults of the average of the previous January and February. A&E attendances showed the same pattern, down to 22.5% and all specialities registered a decline, paediatric > adult. Attendances dropped from circa 2600 to 588/month/100,000 population. These declines were abrupt after the second week of March. MDH admissions showed the same patterns, down from circa 1800 to 757/month/100,000 population. All declines were statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Many factors played a role in this unwilling experiment but the reduction in travel and physical human contact of all sorts (including school) contributed to a reduction in contagious diseases. Excess deaths of severely ill individuals who failed to go to hospital have yet to be formally quantified in Malta.","Grech, Victor; Borg, David; Agius, Steve; Scherb, Hagen",Early Hum Dev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378220307544?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378378220307544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33213969/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105250,253

We study whether early identified risk factors for COVID-19 persist one year later and through varying disease progression trajectories. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 6,731 COVID-19 patients presenting to Michigan Medicine between March 10, 2020 and March 10, 2021. We describe disease progression trajectories from diagnosis to potential hospital admission, discharge, readmission, or death. Outcomes pertained to all patients: rate of medical encounters, hospitalization-free survival, and overall survival, and hospitalized patients: discharge versus in-hospital death and readmission. Risk factors included patient age, sex, race, body mass index, and 29 comorbidity conditions. RESULTS: Younger, non-Black patients utilized healthcare resources at higher rates, while older, male, and Black patients had higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss anemia were risk factors for these outcomes. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss were associated with lower discharge and higher inpatient mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: This study found differences in healthcare utilization and adverse COVID-19 outcomes, as well as differing risk factors for short- and long-term outcomes throughout disease progression. These findings may inform providers in emergency departments or critical care settings of treatment priorities, empower healthcare stakeholders with effective disease management strategies, and aid health policy makers in optimizing allocations of medical resources.","Salerno, Stephen; Sun, Yuming; Morris, Emily L.; He, Xinwei; Li, Yajing; Pan, Ziyang; Han, Peisong; Kang, Jian; Sjoding, Michael W.; Li, Yi",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34614008/,253
632765,Method for Active Pandemic Curve Management (MAPCM),2020-04-13,"Background: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was the fourth country in the world to authorize the BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, which it rolled out on December 17, 2020 and first targeted at healthcare workers (HCWs). This study assesses vaccine uptake among this group during the first month of its availability. Methods: A national cross-sectional, pilot-validated, self-administered survey was conducted among HCWs in the KSA between December 27, 2020 and January 3, 2021. The survey included sociodemographic details, previous contact with COVID-19 patients, previous infection with COVID-19, receiving (or registering with the Ministry of Health website to receive) the COVID-19 vaccine, sources of HCWs information on vaccines, awareness of emerging variants of concern, and anxiety level using the 7 item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment. A descriptive bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic binary regression analysis were performed. The primary evaluated outcome was vaccine uptake. Results: Of the 1,058 participants who completed the survey, 704 (66.5%) were female, and 626 (59.2%) were nurses. Of all the respondents, 352 (33.27%) were enrolled to receive or had already received the vaccine, while 706 (66.73%) had not registered. In a bivariate analysis, not enrolling for vaccination was more likely in females than males (78.5% vs. 21.5%, P < 0.001), HCWs between the ages of 20 and 40 years than those > 40 years (70.4% vs. 29.6%, P = 0.005), Saudi HCWs than expatriates (78% vs 22%, P < 0.001), and among HCWs who used social media as a source of information than those who did not (69.8% vs. 38.6%, P < 0.001) . In a multivariate analysis, independent factors for not enrolling to receive the vaccine included being female (aOR = 0.287, 95%CI = 0.206, 0.401, P < 0.001), being less than 40 years of age (aOR = 1.021, 95%CI = 1.002,1.040, P = 0.032), and using social media as a source of information (aOR = 0.207, 95%CI = 0.132,1.354, P = 0.001 ). Factors associated with uptake were being a Saudi national (aOR = 1.918, 95%CI = 1.363,2.698, P < 0.001), working in an intensive care unit (aOR = 1.495, 95%CI = 1.083,2.063, P = 0.014), and working at a university hospital (aOR = 1.867, 95%CI = 1.380,2.525, P < 0.001). Conclusions: A low level of vaccine uptake was observed especially in female HCWs, those younger than 40 years old, and those who used social media as their source of vaccine information. This survey provides important information for public health authorities in order to scale up vaccination campaigns targeting these HCWs to increase vaccine enrollment and uptake.","Barry, M.; Temsah, M.-H.; Aljamaan, F.; Saddik, B.; Al-Eyadhy, A.; Alanazi, S.; Alamro, N.; Alhuzaimi, A.; Alhaboob, A.; Alsohime, F.; Alaraj, A.; Halwani, R.; Jamal, A.; Temsah, O.; Alzamil, F.; Alsomialy, A.; Al-Tawfiq, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250749v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250749,253

VP1 is major capsid protein that this region has a low homology in both amino acid and nucleotide sequences among Enteroviruses. Therefore we have chosen this region for designed a set of RT-LAMP primers for CVB3 detection. For this the total RNA was extracted from 24-h post infected-HeLa cells with complete cytopathic effect (CPE), and applied to a one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction (RT-LAMP) using CVB3-specific primers. The optimization of RT-LAMP reaction was carried out with three variables factors including MgSO(4) concentration, temperature and time of incubation. Amplification was analyzed by using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide and SYBR Green staining. Our results were shown the ladder-like pattern of the VP1 gene amplification. The LAMP reaction mix was optimized and the best result observed at 4 mM MgSO(4) and 60 °C for 90 min incubation. RT-LAMP had high sensitivity and specificity for detection of CVB3 infection. This method can be used as a rapid and easy diagnostic test for detection of CVB3 in clinical laboratories.","Monazah, A.; Zeinoddini, M.; Saeeidinia, A.R.",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416304384; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416304384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435073/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.04.006,253
634716,Optimal progressivity of personal income tax: a general equilibrium evaluation for Spain,2020-11-25,"BACKGROUND: Problematic substance use (SU) has increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. While studies have identified risk factors for problematic SU during the pandemic (e.g., anxiety, depression, using substances to cope), these studies have been predominately cross-sectional, rarely examined changes in SU contexts during the pandemic as potential risk factors, and neglected sexual and gender minorities (SGM) – a health disparity population disproportionately impacted by substance use disorders and the pandemic. METHOD: We utilized two waves of data collected one month apart from a sample of 212 SGM assigned female at birth who used alcohol and/or cannabis (18–25 years old) collected between August 2020-February 2021. We examined associations between potential risk factors (i.e., retrospectively reported changes in anxiety/depression and in using substances in different contexts since before the pandemic): and 1) retrospectively reported changes in alcohol and cannabis consumption; 2) coping motives for use and SU consequences; and 3) subsequent changes in coping motives and consequences. RESULTS: An increase in solitary SU was a robust risk factor for concurrent and prospective increases in SU, coping motives, and consequences. Increases in SU with romantic partners were associated with concurrent increases in alcohol/cannabis consumption and consequences. Increases in anxiety and depression were associated with concurrent increases in SU and higher coping motives and consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that solitary SU and increases in SU with romantic partners are robust risk factors for increases in SU and consequences in the context of the pandemic. Further, findings provide support for the self-medication theory of substance use.","Dyar, Christina; Morgan, Ethan; Kaysen, Debra; Newcomb, Michael E.; Mustanski, Brian",Drug Alcohol Depend,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037687162100510X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34492556/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037687162100510X,253

METHODS: We reviewed published studies/data on detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in contacts of COVID-19 cases, serological studies, and studies of infections in schools. RESULTS: Compared to younger/middle aged adults, susceptibility to infection for children aged under 10y is estimated to be significantly lower, while estimated susceptibility to infection in adults aged over 60y is higher. Serological studies suggest that younger adults (particularly those aged under 35y) often have high cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. There is some evidence that given limited control measures, SARS-CoV-2 may spread robustly in secondary/high schools, and to a lesser degree in primary schools, with class size possibly affecting that spread. There is also evidence of more limited spread in schools when some mitigation measures are implemented. Several potential biases that may affect these studies are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Mitigation measures should be implemented when opening schools, particularly secondary/high schools. Efforts should be undertaken to diminish mixing in younger adults, particularly individuals aged 18-35y to mitigate the spread of the epidemic in the community.","Goldstein, E; Lipsitch, M; Cevik, M",J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119738/,253
636240,Incidence of COVID-19 and Connections with Air Pollution Exposure: Evidence from the Netherlands,2020-05-03,"Canine babesiosis is a serious disease among tick-borne haemoprotozoan diseases, globally. The present study was envisaged for carrying out thorough investigation of the disease among working dogs of organised kennels situated in different agro-climatic zones of India as comprehensive understanding of the disease from this country was pertinently lacking. During the study period of three years (2012–2014), 330 dogs suspected for babesiosis were examined for clinicopathology by their physical examination, haematological and biochemical parameters estimation, while the detection of apicomplexan parasites was confirmed by using various diagnostic techniques i.e. by conventional microscopy, by two different Babesia specific 18S rRNA based PCR protocols (conventional/simple PCR and nested PCR assays) followed by sequencing of obtained PCR amplicons for Babsesia spp. identification. Out of 330 clinical cases screened 5.15% (17/330), 9.09% (30/330) and 15.45% (51/330) were found to be positive in microscopic examination, simple- and nested- PCR assay, respectively. Comparative statistical analyses of these diagnostic assay results revealed that significant difference exists among the three diagnostic methodologies and thus it is recommended that the nested PCR technique be relied upon as a screening molecular assay and also for epidemiological studies of the disease in this country. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA depicted the monophyletic nature and clonal expansion among all the B. gibsoni, under study. Sequencing results of PCR amplicons revealed that B. gibsoni has predominantly established itself over B. vogeli as former was incriminated in 47 cases while latter was confirmed in only four animals. Based on the clinical severity, these 51 affected animals were classified into three main groups’ of 17 animals each viz., apparently healthy-, simple or uncomplicated babesiosis- and atypical or complicated babesiosis- group. Haematological and biochemical profiling of these dogs confirmed the characteristics findings of infection by both the Babesia spp. It was observed that the infection by small form of Babesia (B. gibsoni) is posing a significant therapeutic challenge and chemosterilization by commonly prescribed anti-protozoal drugs was not achieved as clinical relapses were often observed. The clinical signs, sequence based confirmation and severity of the infection suggested that there is a positive selection of B. gibsoni (smaller form) over B. vogeli (larger form) in this country and raises serious concerns as prognosis in former is considered to be poor compared to latter. Thus, these findings have opened new paradigms for planning of pragmatic control strategies against this emerging canine health problem.","Mittal, Mitesh; Kundu, Krishnendu; Chakravarti, Soumendu; Mohapatra, Jajati K.; Singh, V.K.; Raja Kumar, B.; Thakur, Vikas; Churamani, C.P.; Kumar, Anil",Prev Vet Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.104696; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587718308328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311632/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587718308328,253

The rate of first attempt success in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) is typically less than 90%. The bougie, a semirigid introducer that can be placed into the trachea to facilitate a Seldinger-like technique of tracheal intubation and is typically reserved for difficult or failed intubations, might improve first attempt success. Evidence supporting its use, however, is from a single academic ED with frequent bougie use. Validation of these findings is needed before widespread implementation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The BOugie or stylet in patients Undergoing Intubation Emergently trial is a prospective, multicentre, non-blinded randomised trial being conducted in six EDs and six ICUs in the USA. The trial plans to enrol 1106 critically ill adults undergoing orotracheal intubation. Eligible patients are randomised 1:1 for the use of a bougie or use of an endotracheal tube with stylet for the first intubation attempt. The primary outcome is successful intubation on the first attempt. The secondary outcome is severe hypoxaemia, defined as an oxygen saturation less than 80% between induction until 2 min after completion of intubation. Enrolment began on 29 April 2019 and is expected to be completed in 2021. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial protocol was approved with waiver of informed consent by the Central Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center or the local institutional review board at an enrolling site.

640580,COVID-19 as a catalyst for educational change,2020-06-11,"The role of obesity in the pathophysiology of respiratory virus infections has become particularly apparent during the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, where obese patients are twice as likely to suffer from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than healthy weight individuals. Obesity results in disruption of systemic lipid metabolism promoting a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. However, it remains unclear how these underlying metabolic and cellular processes promote severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Emerging data in SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus (IAV) infections show that viruses can further subvert the host’s altered lipid metabolism and exploit obesity-induced alterations in immune cell metabolism and function to promote chronic inflammation and viral propagation. In this review, we outline the systemic metabolic and immune alterations underlying obesity and discuss how these baseline alterations impact the immune response and disease pathophysiology. A better understanding of the immunometabolic landscape of obese patients may aid better therapies and future vaccine design.","Richter, Felix Clemens; Alrubayyi, Aljawharah; Teijeira Crespo, Alicia; Hulin-Curtis, Sarah",Oxf Open Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfimm/iqab001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192269/,253

640783,Comprehensive management of acute pulmonary embolism in primary care using telemedicine in the COVID-era,2021-06-10,"Satellite viruses, most commonly found in plants, rely on helper viruses to complete their replication cycle. The only known example of a human satellite virus is the hepatitis D virus (HDV), and it is generally thought to require hepatitis B virus (HBV) to form infectious particles. Until 2018, HDV was the sole representative of the genus Deltavirus and was thought to have evolved in humans, the only known HDV host. The subsequent identification of HDV-like agents in birds, snakes, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates indicated that the evolutionary history of deltaviruses is likely much longer than previously hypothesized. Interestingly, none of the HDV-like agents were found in coinfection with an HBV-like agent, suggesting that these viruses use different helper virus(es). Here we show, using snake deltavirus (SDeV), that HBV and hepadnaviruses represent only one example of helper viruses for deltaviruses. We cloned the SDeV genome into a mammalian expression plasmid, and by transfection could initiate SDeV replication in cultured snake and mammalian cell lines. By superinfecting persistently SDeV-infected cells with reptarenaviruses and hartmaniviruses, or by transfecting their surface proteins, we could induce production of infectious SDeV particles. Our findings indicate that deltaviruses can likely use a multitude of helper viruses or even viral glycoproteins to form infectious particles. This suggests that persistent infections, such as those caused by arenaviruses and orthohantaviruses used in this study, and recurrent infections would be beneficial for the spread of deltaviruses. It seems plausible that further human or animal disease associations with deltavirus infections will be identified in the future.","Szirovicza, Leonora; Hetzel, Udo; Kipar, Anja; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Vapalahti, Olli; Hepojoki, Jussi",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03250-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32184255/,253

This study aimed to explore the patient experience of inpatient care during COVID-19 pandemic. An electronic questionnaire was designed and distributed to inpatients treated at a large University Health Board over a 6-week period. It focused on hospital inpatients’ experience of being cared for by health care professionals wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), explored communication, and patients’ perceptions of the quality of care. A total of 704 patients completed the survey. Results demonstrated that patients believe PPE is important to protect the health of both patients and staff and does not negatively impact on their care. In spite of routine use of PPE, patients were still able to identify and communicate with staff. Although visiting restrictions were enforced to limit disease transmission, patients maintained contact with their relatives by using various electronic forms of communication. Overall, patients rated the quality of care they received at 9/10.

640962,Characteristics of effective online interventions: implications for adolescents with personality disorder during a global pandemic,2021-01-20,"Knowing the ability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and to enter cells via endocytosis paved the way for repositioning of old drugs as potential treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This paper highlights the potential of azithromycin and ambroxol to treat COVID-19. Azithromycin and ambroxol share lysosomotropic characteristics, i.e. they penetrate and accumulate inside the late endosomes and lysosomes and may possibly interfere with multiplication of the virus inside cells. In addition, both of these drugs have anti-inflammatory effects. Ambroxol has a proven antiviral effect and a unique stimulatory action on the secretion of surfactant by alveolar type II cells, the main target of SARS-CoV-2. Surfactant may form a fundamental defence mechanism against the virus. Involvement of nasal epithelial cells in SARS-CoV-2 entry suggested advantageous use of inhaled drug delivery of these two drugs over the use of systemic administration. Inhaled drug delivery could aid in targeting the drug to the exact site of action with little or no side effects. To conclude, administration of these two drugs using a special drug delivery system provides two kinds of drug targeting: (i) tissue targeting through using an inhaled drug delivery system to achieve high drug concentrations at the respiratory epithelial tissue that overexpress the ACE2 receptor for virus binding; and (ii) cellular targeting of the virus in the acidic vesicles (late endosomes and lysosomes), which represent the fate of endocytic viruses.","Alkotaji, Myasar",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920303988; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33045350/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920303988?v=s5,253

The novel coronavirus pandemic has increased the urgency of understanding a specific form of antisociality: behaviors that increase risk of disease transmission. Because disease transmission-linked behaviors tend to be interpreted and responded to differently than other antisocial behaviors, it is unclear whether general indices of antisociality predict contamination-relevant behaviors. In a pre-registered study using an online U.S. sample, we found that individuals reporting high levels of antisociality engage in fewer social distancing measures: they report leaving their homes more frequently (p = .024) and standing closer to others while outside (p < .001). These relationships were observed after controlling for sociodemographic variables, illness risk, and use of protective equipment. Independently, higher education and leaving home for work were also associated with reduced distancing behavior. Antisociality was not significantly associated with level of worry about the coronavirus. These findings suggest that more antisocial individuals may pose health risks to themselves and their community during the COVID-19 pandemic.","O’Connell, Katherine; Berluti, Kathryn; Rhoads, Shawn A.; Marsh, Abigail A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412567/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244974,253

Recent studies suggest that obesity might be associated with higher morbidity and mortality in respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 disease). Our objective was to evaluate the association between obesity and hospital mortality in critical COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary academic center located in Montréal between March and August 2020. We included all consecutive adult patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19-confirmed respiratory disease. Our main outcome was hospital mortality. We estimated the association between obesity, using the body mass index as a continuous variable, and hospital survival by fitting a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: We included 94 patients. Median [q1, q3] body mass index (BMI) was 29 [26–32] kg/m(2) and 37% of patients were obese (defined as BMI > 30 kg/m(2)). Hospital mortality for the entire cohort was 33%. BMI was significantly associated with hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.49 per 10 units BMI; 95% CI, from 1.69 to 3.70; p < 0.001) even after adjustment for sex, age and obesity-related comorbidities (adjusted HR = 3.50; 95% CI from 2.03 to 6.02; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity was prevalent in hospitalized patients with critical illness secondary to COVID-19 disease and a higher BMI was associated with higher hospital mortality.

The contagion spread and multiple death cases reveal the multiplicity of existence ways that cohabit the urban context, indicating that in many of these scenarios, access to decent housing, drinking water, and minimum income is not a reality and recommendations from international health agencies are challenging to implement. Against government technopolitics that drive different forms of death to the poorest, black communities, and slum dwellers, territorial insurgencies indicate other paths for the construction of a dignified life and access to fundamental rights, targeted solidarity practices, territorial political organization and the construction of specific public policies to deal with the effects of the virus which takes into account the particularities and distinct realities of the territory. The experiences of community organization around Crisis Offices in the favelas, led by social organizations and supporting institutions, have guaranteed (i) food and personal hygiene items distribution, (ii) sanitization of alleys, (iii) dissemination of information on the virus, and (iv) political articulation for disputes in defense of life preservation in the favelas, in opposition of genocidal processes carried out by the state power. Such local spaces represent practices of resistance to the death policies undertaken by the state policies, which most are not configured as spaces for collective construction and disregard inequalities and different needs in these territories. That way, community associations are presented as an inflection point, a deviation from the normal course of modulated subjectivities by the social principles and practices of neoliberalism, with the indication that the most efficient way to deal with social crises is through the strengthening of the collective and the popular organizations.","Fernandes, Luana Almeida de Carvalho; da Silva, Caíque Azael Ferreira; Dameda, Cristiane; de Bicalho, Pedro Paulo Gastalho",Front Sociol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869528/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2020.611990,253

Yet research into addressing social determinants of health has focused on larger, urban, integrated health systems. Our study sought to understand capacities, facilitators, and barriers related to addressing social health needs across a collaborative of independent provider organizations in rural Northeastern Minnesota and Northwestern Wisconsin. METHODS: We conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 37 key informants from collaborative members including 4 stand-alone critical access hospitals, 3 critical access hospitals affiliated with primary care, 1 multi-clinic system, and 1 integrated regional health system. FINDINGS: Barriers were abundant and occurred at the organizational, community and policy levels. Rural providers described a lack of financial, labor, Internet, and community-based social services resources, a limited capacity to partner with other organizations, and workflows that were less than optimal for addressing SDOH. State Medicaid and other payer policies posed challenges that made it more difficult to use available resources, as did misaligned incentives between partners. While specific payer programs and organizational innovations helped facilitate their work, nothing was systemic. Relationships within the collaborative that allowed sharing of innovations and information were helpful, as was the role leadership played in promoting value-based care. CONCLUSIONS: Policy change is needed to support rural providers in this work. Collaboration among rural health systems should be fostered to develop common protocols, promote value-based care, and offer economies of scale to leverage value-based payment. States can help align incentives and performance metrics across rural health care entities, engage payers in promoting value-based care, and bolster social service capacity.","Dauner, Kim Nichols; Loomer, Lacey",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06859-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429097/,253

The majority of COVID-19 patients either are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Yet, about 15% of the cases experience severe complications and require intensive care. Factors determining disease severity are not yet fully characterized. Aim: Here, we investigated the within-host virus diversity in COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations. Methods: We compared SARS-COV-2 genetic diversity in 19 mild and 27 severe cases. Viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal samples and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. This was followed by deep-sequencing analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes at both consensus and sub-consensus sequence levels. Results: Consensus sequences of all viruses were very similar, showing more than 99.8% sequence identity regardless of the disease severity. However, the sub-consensus analysis revealed significant differences in within-host diversity between mild and severe cases. Patients with severe symptoms exhibited a significantly (p-value 0.001) higher number of variants in coding and non-coding regions compared to mild cases. Analysis also revealed higher prevalence of some variants among severe cases. Most importantly, severe cases exhibited significantly higher within-host diversity (mean = 13) compared to mild cases (mean = 6). Further, higher within-host diversity was observed in patients above the age of 60 compared to the younger age group. Conclusion: These observations provided evidence that within-host diversity might play a role in the development of severe disease outcomes in COVID-19 patients; however, further investigations are required to elucidate this association.","Al Khatib, Hebah A.; Benslimane, Fatiha M.; Elbashir, Israa E.; Coyle, Peter V.; Al Maslamani, Muna A.; Al-Khal, Abdullatif; Al Thani, Asmaa A.; Yassine, Hadi M.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123498/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.575613,253

Public acceptance is therefore an important indicator to inform the communication activities that accompany the introduction of a new policy. The goal was to assess acceptance and relevant target groups for communication activities. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey embedded in the regular German COVID-19 monitoring. METHODS: Besides sociodemographic information, trust in institutions, knowledge about COVID-19 and protective behaviors, as well as risk perceptions, we assessed public acceptance of school-related mask policies of parents and non-parents (total N ​= ​957). RESULTS: In the absence of mandatory mask policies in schools in Germany in August 2020, the general agreement with mask wearing in school was low. Those living in bigger cities or communities – where class sizes are usually larger – agreed more with mask wearing in class; those who felt a greater risk, had greater trust in institutions, or felt higher self-efficacy in fighting the outbreak also wanted children to wear a mask in class. Women were more likely than men to disagree with mask wearing in class. Agreement was highest that policies should uniformly apply for all institutions within a state/province and should not be regulated at the school level or federal/country level. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing mask policies in school will require intense communication. Acceptance of these policies from teachers and pupils should be considered as well. Women seem to be an important target group as they supported mask wearing in class less than men.

Preventive aspects of infectious diseases and infections imported by immigrants are explicitly excluded here, since they have been dealt with in other SEIMC documents.

We compared ct-values for E-gene and ORF1ab and analysed variables reducing sensitivity of self-collecting procedures. RESULTS: The median ct-values for E-gene and ORF1ab obtained in cOP/NP samples were 20.7 and 20.2, in MS samples 22.6 and 21.8, in SN samples 23.3 and 22.3, and in GW samples 30.3 and 29.8, respectively. MS and SN samples showed sensitivities of 95.2% (95%CI, 86.5-99.0) and GW samples of 88.7% (78.1-95.3). Sensitivity was inversely correlated with ct-values, and became <90% for samples obtained more than 8 days after symptom onset. For MS and SN samples, false negativity was associated with language problems, sampling errors, and symptom duration. CONCLUSION: Conclusions from this study are limited to the sensitivity of self-sampling in mildly to moderately symptomatic patients. Still, self-collected oral/nasal/saliva samples can facilitate up-scaling of testing in early symptomatic COVID-19 patients if operational errors are minimized.","Gertler, Maximilian; Krause, Eva; van Loon, Welmoed; Krug, Niklas; Kausch, Franka; Rohardt, Chiara; Rössig, Heike; Michel, Janine; Nitsche, Andreas; Mall, Marcus A.; Nikolai, Olga; Hommes, Franziska; Burock, Susen; Lindner, Andreas K.; Mockenhaupt, Frank P.; Pison, Ulrich; Seybold, Joachim",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221006019?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34302962/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221006019; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.07.047,253
650041,Commentary: Estimating the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in Europe,2020-11-05,"The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 acts as the host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the other members of the Coronaviridae family SARS-CoV-1 and HCoV-NL63. Here, we report the biophysical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 spike variants D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 with affinities to the ACE2 receptor and infectivity capacity, revealing weaknesses in the developed neutralizing antibody approaches. Furthermore, we report a preclinical characterization package for a soluble receptor decoy engineered to be catalytically inactive and immunologically inert, with broad neutralization capacity, that represents an attractive therapeutic alternative in light of the mutational landscape of COVID-19. This construct efficiently neutralized four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The decoy also displays antibody-like biophysical properties and manufacturability, strengthening its suitability as a first-line treatment option in prophylaxis or therapeutic regimens for COVID-19 and related viral infections. IMPORTANCE Mutational drift of SARS-CoV-2 risks rendering both therapeutics and vaccines less effective. Receptor decoy strategies utilizing soluble human ACE2 may overcome the risk of viral mutational escape since mutations disrupting viral interaction with the ACE2 decoy will by necessity decrease virulence, thereby preventing meaningful escape. The solution described here of a soluble ACE2 receptor decoy is significant for the following reasons: while previous ACE2-based therapeutics have been described, ours has novel features, including (i) mutations within ACE2 to remove catalytical activity and systemic interference with the renin/angiotensin system, (ii) abrogated FcγR engagement, reduced risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, and reduced risk of hyperinflammation, and (iii) streamlined antibody-like purification process and scale-up manufacturability indicating that this receptor decoy could be produced quickly and easily at scale. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2-based therapeutics confer a broad-spectrum neutralization potency for ACE2-tropic viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in contrast to therapeutic MAb.","Ferrari, Mathieu; Mekkaoui, Leila; Ilca, F.

Evidence from Saudi Arabia,2021-04-23,"Background: COVID-19 is associated with increased risk of post-acute sequelae involving pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ systems - referred to as long COVID. However, a detailed assessment of kidney outcomes in long COVID is not yet available. Methods: We built a cohort of 1,726,683 US Veterans identified from March 01, 2020 to March 15, 2021 including 89,216 30-day COVID-19 survivors and 1,637,467 non-infected controls. We examined risks of AKI, eGFR decline, ESKD, and major adverse kidney events (MAKE) defined as eGFR decline ≥50%, ESKD, or all-cause mortality using inverse probability weighted survival regressions, adjusting for predefined demographic and health characteristics, and algorithmically selected high-dimensional covariates including diagnoses, medications, and laboratory tests. Linear mixed models characterized intra-individual eGFR trajectory. Results: Beyond the acute illness, 30-day survivors of COVID-19 exhibited a higher risk of AKI (aHR=1.94 (95%CI: 1.86,2.04)), eGFR decline ≥30% (1.25 (1.14,1.37)), eGFR decline ≥40% (1.44 (1.37,1.51)), eGFR decline ≥50% (1.62 (1.51,1.74)), ESKD (2.96 (2.49-3.51)), and MAKE (1.66 (1.58,1.74)). There was a graded increase in risks of post-acute kidney outcomes according to the severity of the acute infection (whether patients were non-hospitalized, hospitalized, or admitted to intensive care). Compared to non-infected controls, 30-day COVID-19 survivors exhibited excess eGFR decline of -3.26 (-3.58, -2.94), -5.20 (-6.24, -4.16), and -7.69 (-8.27, -7.12) mL/min/1.73m2/year in non-hospitalized, hospitalized, and those admitted to intensive care during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: COVID-19 survivors exhibited increased risk of kidney outcomes in the post-acute phase of the disease.

However, there are many open questions regarding their uptake and impact on cellular metabolism. In this study, lipid structures were assembled as a supported lipid bilayer on top of biopolymer-coated microcarriers based on the Layer-by-Layer assembly strategy. The functionalized microcarriers were then applied to various human and animal cell lines in addition to primary human macrophages (MΦ). Here, their influence on cellular metabolism and their intracellular localization were detected by extracellular flux analysis and immunofluorescence analysis, respectively. The impact of microcarriers on metabolic parameters was in most cell types rather low. However, lipid bilayer-supported microcarriers induced a decrease in oxygen consumption rate (OCR, indicative for mitochondrial respiration) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, indicative for glycolysis) in Vero cells. Additionally, in Vero cells lipid bilayer microcarriers showed a more pronounced association with microtubule filaments than polymer-coated microcarrier. Furthermore, they localized to a perinuclear region and induced nuclei with some deformations at a higher rate than unfunctionalized carriers. This association was reduced through the application of the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole. Thus, the effect of respective lipid structures as a drug delivery system on cells has to be considered in the context of the respective target cell, but in general can be regarded as rather low.","Claus, Claudia; Fritz, Robert; Schilling, Erik; Reibetanz, Uta",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13091441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575517/,253
651263,Simple Is Better for Local Beverage Tax Policy Diffusion,2020-08-11,"The third pandemic of coronavirus infection, called COVID-19 disease, was first detected in November 2019th. Various determinants of disease progression such as age, sex, virus mutations, comorbidity, lifestyle, host immune response, and genetic background variation have caused clinical variability of COVID-19. The causative agent of COVID-19 is an enveloped coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that invades host cells using an endocytic pathway. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the main viral protein that contributes to the fusion of the virus particle to the host cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The highly conserved expression of ACE2 is found in various animals, which indicates its pivotal physiological function. The ACE2 has a crucial role in vascular, renal, and myocardial physiology. Genetic factors contributing to the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown; however, variants in the specific sites of ACE2 gene could be regarded as a main genetic risk factor for COVID-19. Given that ACE2 is the main site for virus landing on host cells, the effect of amino acid sequences of ACE2 on host susceptibility to COVID-19 seems reasonable. It would likely have a substantial role in the occurrence of a wide range of clinical symptoms. Several ACE2 variants can affect the protein stability, influencing the interaction between spike protein and ACE2 through imposing conformational changes while some other variants are known to cause a decrease or an increase in the ligand-receptor affinity. The other variations are located at the proteolytic cleavage site, which can influence virus infection; because soluble ACE2 can act as a decoy receptor for virus and decrease virus intake by cell surface ACE2. Notably, polymorphisms of regulatory and non-coding regions such as promoter in ACE2, can play crucial role in different expression levels of ACE2 among different individuals. Many studies should be performed to investigate the involvement of ACE2 polymorphism with susceptibility to COVID-19. Herein, we discuss some reported associations between variants of ACE2 and COVID-19 in details. In addition, the mode of action of ACE2 and its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection are highlighted which is followed by addressing the effects of several ACE2 variants on its protein stability, viral tropism or ligand-receptor affinity, secondary and tertiary structure or protein conformation, proteolytic cleavage site, and finally inter-individual clinical variability in COVID-19. The polymorphisms of regulatory regions of ACE2 and their effect on expression levels of ACE2 are also provided in this review. Such studies can improve the prediction of the affinity of mutant ACE2 variations with spike protein, and help the biopharmaceutical industry to design effective approaches for recombinant hACE2 therapy and vaccination of COVID-19 disease.","Bakhshandeh, Behnaz; Sorboni, Shokufeh Ghasemian; Javanmard, Amir-Reza; Mottaghi, Seyed Saeed; Mehrabi, Mohammad-reza; Sorouri, Farzaneh; Abbasi, Ardeshir; Jahanafrooz, Zohreh",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134821000708?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134821000708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33607284/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104773,253

However, the effectiveness of AI applications is limited by doctors’ adoption of the results recommended by the personalized medical decision support system. Our primary purpose is to study the impact of external case characteristics (ECC) on the effectiveness of the personalized medical decision support system for breast cancer assisted diagnosis (PMDSS-BCAD) in making accurate recommendations. Therefore, we designed a novel comprehensive framework for case-based reasoning (CBR) that takes the impact of external features of cases into account, made use of the naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms (CBR-ECC), and developed a PMDSS-BCAD system by using the CBR-ECC model and external features as system components. Under the new case-based reasoning framework, the accuracy of the combined model of naive Bayes and KNN with an optimal K value of 2 is 99.40%. Moreover, in a real hospital scenario, users rated the PMDSS-BCAD system, which takes into account the external characteristics of the case, better than the original personalized system. These results suggest that PMDSS-BCD can not only provide doctors with more personalized and accurate results for auxiliary diagnosis, but also improve doctors’ trust in the results, so as to encourage doctors to adopt the results recommended by the personalized system.","Gu, Dongxiao; Zhao, Wang; Xie, Yi; Wang, Xiaoyu; Su, Kaixiang; Zolotarev, Oleg V.",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574018/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11091677,253

Given the importance of the senses to daily functioning and personal experience, the mental health consequences of these symptoms warrant further attention. METHODS: A cohort of Reddit users posting within the /r/covid19positive subforum (N=15,821) was leveraged to analyze instantaneous risk of transition to a state of suicidal ideation or depression using Cox proportional-hazards models. Risk transition was defined by posts made in suicide- or depression-related forums, or mentions of relevant phrases with and without mention of anosmia/ageusia in /r/covid19positive. Self-diagnosis of COVID-19 was also modeled as a separate and simultaneous predictor of mental health risk. RESULTS: Mention of anosmia/ageusia was significantly associated with transition to a risk state. Users with a history of anosmia/ageusia-related posts and who self-identified as COVID-19 positive had 30% higher instantaneous risk relative to others. The highest increase in instantaneous risk of suicidal ideation or depression occurred more than 100 days after first posting in /r/covid19positive. LIMITATIONS: Use of self-diagnosed disease as well as a broad array of anosmia/ageusia-related terminology may entail both information bias and overestimates of symptom incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The specific effects of COVID-19 on the senses may have long-term implications for patient mental health well-being beyond the primary recovery period.

653821,Invisible Enemies: Coronavirus and Other Hidden Threats,2020-08-25,"The SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. One unique structural feature of the SARS2 spike protein is the presence of a furin-like cleavage site (FLC) which is associated with both viral pathogenesis and host tropism. Specifically, SARS2 spike protein binds to the host ACE-2 receptor which in-turn is cleaved by furin proteases at the FLC site, suggesting that SARS2 FLC structural variations may have an impact on viral infectivity. However, this has not yet been fully elucidated. This study designed and analyzed a COVID-19 genomic epidemiology network for December 2019 to July 2020, and subsequently generated and analyzed representative SARS2 spike protein models from significant node clusters within the network. To distinguish possible structural variations, a model quality assessment was performed before further protein model analyses and superimposition of the protein models, particularly in both the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and FLC. Mutant spike models were generated with the unique (681)PRRA(684) amino acid sequence found within the deleted FLC. We found 9 SARS2 FLC structural patterns that could potentially correspond to nine node clusters encompassing various countries found within the COVID-19 genomic epidemiology network. Similarly, we associated this with the rapid evolution of the SARS2 genome. Furthermore, we observed that either in the presence or absence of the unique (681)PRRA(684) amino acid sequence no structural changes occurred within the SARS2 RBD, which we believe would mean that the SARS2 FLC has no structural influence on SARS2 RBD and may explain why host tropism was maintained.","Cueno, Marni E.; Ueno, Miu; Iguchi, Rinako; Harada, Tsubasa; Miki, Yoshifumi; Yasumaru, Kanae; Kiso, Natsumi; Wada, Kanta; Baba, Koki; Imai, Kenichi",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.613412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777970/,253

METHODS: We conducted a test-negative case–control study involving health care personnel across 25 U.S. states. Cases were defined on the basis of a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen-based test for SARS-CoV-2 and at least one Covid-19–like symptom. Controls were defined on the basis of a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, and were matched to cases according to the week of the test date and site. Using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for age, race and ethnic group, underlying conditions, and exposures to persons with Covid-19, we estimated vaccine effectiveness for partial vaccination (assessed 14 days after receipt of the first dose through 6 days after receipt of the second dose) and complete vaccination (assessed ≥7 days after receipt of the second dose). RESULTS: The study included 1482 case participants and 3449 control participants. Vaccine effectiveness for partial vaccination was 77.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.9 to 82.7) with the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech) and 88.9% (95% CI, 78.7 to 94.2) with the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna); for complete vaccination, vaccine effectiveness was 88.8% (95% CI, 84.6 to 91.8) and 96.3% (95% CI, 91.3 to 98.4), respectively. Vaccine effectiveness was similar in subgroups defined according to age (<50 years or ≥50 years), race and ethnic group, presence of underlying conditions, and level of patient contact. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness were lower during weeks 9 through 14 than during weeks 3 through 8 after receipt of the second dose, but confidence intervals overlapped widely. CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were highly effective under real-world conditions in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in health care personnel, including those at risk for severe Covid-19 and those in racial and ethnic groups that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

The goal of this pilot study was to accurately measure drug dose consumption rates (DCR) between two select populations, normalize the data and compare the DCRs to similar communities. To learn about patterns of drug abuse between the two disparate communities, we used the emergent field of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). A rapid, quantitative and systematic process for the determination of multiple classes of prescribed and illicit drugs was applied to influent wastewater samples. Influent samples were collected over the course of three months (April to June 2019) at two wastewater treatment plants representing a small urban and a rural community. Collection of sewage influent included 24-h composite samples and the use of polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS), time-weighted samplers. Using the results from the composite sampling data, DCRs per 1000 population could be calculated from the concentration data and the use of excretion correction factors. The following 18 compounds: amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, methadone, EDDP, codeine, benzoylecgonine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, noroxycodone, ketamine, fluoxetine, tramadol, and ritalinic acid; represent a subset of the targeted analytes that were consistently measured at detectable concentration levels, and present at both sites. Following normalization of the drug measurements to influent flow rates and per capita, the small urban community demonstrated greater collective excretion rates (CER) than the rural community, with the exceptions of amphetamine and methamphetamine.","Bishop, Nicholas; Jones-Lepp, Tammy; Margetts, Miranda; Sykes, Jordan; Alvarez, David; Keil, Deborah E.",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720342194; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140697; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720342194?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758738/,253

Simplified arithmetic models of COVID-19 transmission, control and elimination are presented in user-friendly Shiny and Excel formats that allow non-specialists to explore, query, critique and understand the containment decisions facing their country and the world at large. Although the predictive model is broadly applicable, the simulations presented are based on parameter values representative of the United Republic of Tanzania, which is still early enough in its epidemic cycle and response to avert a national catastrophe. The predictions of these models illustrate (1) why ambitious lock-down interventions to crush the curve represent the only realistic way for individual countries to contain their national-level epidemics before they turn into outright catastrophes, (2) why these need to be implemented so early, so stringently and for such extended periods, (3) why high prevalence of other pathogens causing similar symptoms to mild COVID-19 precludes the use of contact tracing as a substitute for lock down interventions to contain and eliminate epidemics, (4) why partial containment strategies intended to merely flatten the curve, by maintaining epidemics at manageably low levels, are grossly unrealistic, and (5) why local elimination may only be sustained after lock down ends if imported cases are comprehensively excluded, so international co-operation to conditionally re-open trade and travel between countries certified as free of COVID-19 represents the best strategy for motivating progress towards pandemic eradication at global level. The three sequential goals that every country needs to emphatically embrace are contain, eliminate and exclude. As recently emphasized by the World Health Organization, success will require widespread genuine national unity and unprecedented global solidarity.","Killeen, Gerry F.; Kiware, Samson S.",Infect Dis Model,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300208; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.06.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300208?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691016/,253

Employing the spillover index approach of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012); as well as developing a DCC-FIGARCH conditional correlation framework and using estimated spillover indices built on a generalised vector autoregressive framework in which forecast-error variance decompositions are invariant to the variable ordering, we examine the sectoral transmission mechanisms of volatility shocks and contagion throughout the energy sector. Among several results, we find positive and economically meaningful spillovers from falling oil prices to both renewable energy and coal markets. However, this result is only found for the narrow portion of our sample surrounding the negative WTI event. We interpret our results being directly attributed to a sharp drop in global oil, gas and coal demand, rather than because of a sudden increase in oil supply. While investors observed the US fracking industry losing market share to coal, they also viewed renewables as more reliable mechanism to generate long-term, stable and low-cost supply.","Corbet, Shaen; Goodell, John W.; Günay, Samet",Energy Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106713/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2020.104978; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140988320303182; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988320303182?v=s5,253

661539,Forecasting the dynamics of COVID-19 Pandemic in Top 15 countries in April 2020: ARIMA Model with Machine Learning Approach,2020-03-31,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a multi-system disorder resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected 5.0 million individuals in the United States (US) resulting in more than 160,000 deaths. There is currently no proven effective therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond supportive care. Convalescent plasma (CP), collected from individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been safely used to transfer virus-neutralizing antibodies to patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Herein we report on the clinical course and outcomes of patients who received CP for the treatment of COVID-19 across our health system. Methods: Hospitalized patients ≥ 18 years of age at 5 hospitals in the Yale-New Haven Health System with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe or life-threatening disease (Figure 1) were enrolled in the US COVID-19 Expanded Access Program (EAP) and transfused 1 unit of CP. Patient outcomes were assessed at 7, 14, and 28 days after CP transfusion. Furthermore, we sought to determine mortality predictors in this patient cohort. Results: 105 patients enrolled in the EAP were transfused CP from 4/12/2020 to 6/14/2020. Median age was 62 years (28-88 years). 62.9% of patients were male. Individuals of a non-white race comprised 56.2% of our cohort and 33.3% identified as Hispanic or Latinx. 47.6% of patients had a body mass index greater than 30, with 13.3% classified as extremely obese. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were highly prevalent in our population. Concomitant therapy for COVID-19 included hydroxychloroquine (79.0%), tocilizumab (79.0%), and remdesivir (23.8%) (Table 1). 91 patients required the intensive care unit (ICU) during their hospital course, with 87 patients in the ICU at the time of CP transfusion. 42.9% of patients had an improvement in their World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale score by day 7 post-CP transfusion (median 4 days to improvement), while 9.5% demonstrated an increase in their WHO score indicating worsening oxygenation during the 7 days following CP (Figure 2). Mortality was 10.48% at 7 days, 20.95% at 14 days, and 28.57% at 28 days post-CP transfusion (Figure 2). Of the patients in the ICU at the time of CP, 56 (64.4%) de-escalated to non-ICU care after a median of 8 days from transfusion and 55 (63.2%) were ultimately discharged from the hospital. The median time from CP transfusion to discharge in survivors was 14 days (2-103 days), while median time from CP to death in non-survivors was 10 days (1-76 days). The mean time in days both from hospital admission to CP and from positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to CP trended slightly longer in non-survivors when compared to survivors (8.6 vs 6.9 days, p=0.218 and 9.7 vs 7.3 days, p=0.85, respectively). D-dimer levels >5 milligrams per liter fibrinogen equivalent units (mg/L FEU) were associated with increased mortality at 24 (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.18-6.72), 48 (OR 3.64, 95% CI 1.44-9.70), and 72 hours (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.23-7.66) post-CP transfusion (Figure 3). Twelve patients (11.4%) on prophylactic or intermediate dose anticoagulation were subsequently escalated to therapeutic dosing during the 7 days after CP transfusion. Furthermore, a ferritin level of >3000 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) on the day of CP was associated with increased mortality (OR 5.14, 95% CI 1.34-19.68). Conclusions: CP therapy was administered through the EAP to COVID-19 patients with severe disease and with advanced age, high frequency of obesity, and extensive co-morbidity. In this COVID-19 population with high expected mortality, 42.9% of patients improved by WHO Ordinal Scale score within 7 days of CP transfusion and 52.4% were alive and discharged at 28 days. Baseline ferritin and d-dimer levels at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-CP were predictors of mortality, the latter raising the possibility that the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 may be exacerbated by administration of blood products from donors potentially in a residual procoagulant state. Further studies by our group are underway to assess hemostatic balance in donor CP, to estimate associations with outcomes by comparing patients who received CP with a matched control cohort of COVID-19 patients who did not receive CP, and to evaluate efficacy of CP in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Disclosures McLeod: Gilead Pharmaceuticals: Other: Medical Advisor . OffLabel Disclosure: We have described in this abstract patients across our health system who received investigational convalescent plasma therapy through enrollment in the “Expanded Access to Convalescent Plasma for the Treatment of Patients with COVID-19” protocol that is funded by BARDA and run by the Mayo Clinic, where primary IRB protocol is held. Previous guidance issued by the FDA regarding investigational use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma included recommendations for the expanded access program as a method by which to facilitate access to this blood product across the nation. Safety data reported thus far from the expanded access program has demonstrated no concerning findings, with a very low rate of serious adverse events. Therefore given the overall tolerability of convalescent plasma and the lack of other proven therapies for COVID-19, we believe it is important to report these findings even in the absence of current approval for convalescent plasma transfusion in the management of COVID-19.","Browning, Sabrina L.; Gormally, Michael; Briggs, Neima; Li, Muyi; Zakko, Alan; Laurent-Rolle, Maudry; Ladines-Lim, Joseph; Morrison, Alyssa; Kandel, Prakash; Khan, Mohammad; McLeod, Gavin X.; Buller, Gregory K.; Owusu, Kent A.; Treggiari, Miriam M.; Hendrickson, Jeanne E.; Tormey, Christopher A.; Desruisseaux, Mahalia S.",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2020-137352; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497118693231; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006497118693231,253
662656,Continuing Medical Education Questions: April 2021,2021,"BACKGROUND: Major hurdles for survival after lung transplantation are rejections and infectious complications. Adequate methods for monitoring immune suppression status are lacking. Here, we evaluated quantification of torque teno virus (TTV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as biomarkers for defining the net state of immunosuppression in lung-transplanted patients. METHODS: This prospective single-center study included 98 patients followed for 2 years after transplantation. Bacterial infections, fungal infections, viral respiratory infections (VRTI), cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, and acute rejections, as well as TTV and EBV levels, were monitored. RESULTS: The levels of torque teno virus DNA increased rapidly after transplantation, likely due to immunosuppressive treatment. A modest increase in levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA was also observed after transplantation. There were no associations between either TTV or EBV and infectious events or acute rejection, respectively, during follow-up. When Tacrolimus was the main immunosuppressive treatment, TTV DNA levels were significantly elevated 6–24 months after transplantation as compared with Cyclosporine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although replication of TTV, but not EBV, appears to reflect the functionality of the immune system, depending on the type of immunosuppressive treatment, quantification of TTV or EBV as biomarkers has limited potential for defining the net state of immune suppression.","Nordén, Rickard; Magnusson, Jesper; Lundin, Anna; Tang, Ka-Wei; Nilsson, Staffan; Lindh, Magnus; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Riise, Gerdt C; Westin, Johan",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29644247/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofy050,253

Currently, the predictive value of body temperature for acute infection is inhibited by failure to account for other readily available variables that affect temperature values. In this proof-of-concept study, we sought to improve COVID-19 pretest probability estimation by incorporating covariates known to be associated with body temperature, including patient age, sex, comorbidities, month, time of day. Methods: For patients discharged from an academic hospital emergency department after testing for COVID-19 in March and April of 2020, we abstracted clinical data. We reviewed physician documentation to retrospectively generate estimates of pretest probability for COVID-19. Using patient COVID-19 PCR test results as a gold standard, we compared AUCs of logistic regression models predicting COVID-19 positivity that used: 1) body temperature alone; 2) body temperature and pretest probability; 3) body temperature, pretest probability, and body temperature-relevant covariates. Calibration plots and bootstrap validation were used to assess predictive performance for model #3. Results: Data from 117 patients were included. The models AUCs were: 1) 0.69 2) 0.72, and 3) 0.76, respectively. The absolute difference in AUC was 0.029 (95%CI -0.057 to 0.114, p=0.25) between model 2 and 1 and 0.038 (95%CI -0.021 to 0.097, p=0.10) between model 3 and 2. Conclusions: By incorporating covariates known to affect body temperature, we demonstrated improved pretest probability estimates of acute COVID-19 infection. Future work should be undertaken to further develop and validate our model in a larger, multi-institutional sample.","Berdahl, C. T.; Nguyen, A. T.; Diniz, M. A.; Henreid, A. J.; Nuckols, T.

663375,How will COVID-19 affect an already fragile global economy?,2021-09-28,"Objective The aim of this study was to determine the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of birth and maternal and perinatal outcomes. Methods This is a population-based cohort study in England. The inclusion criteria were women with a recorded singleton birth between 29th May 2020 and 31st January 2021 in a national database of hospital admissions. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared between pregnant women with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection recorded in the birth episode and those without. Study outcomes were fetal death at or beyond 24 weeks’ gestation (stillbirth), preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation), small for gestational age infant (SGA; birthweight <10th centile), preeclampsia/eclampsia, induction of labor, mode of birth, specialist neonatal care, composite neonatal adverse outcome indicator, maternal and neonatal length of hospital stay following birth (3 days or more), 28-day neonatal and 42-day maternal hospital readmission. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection status and outcomes were calculated using logistic regression, adjusting for maternal age, ethnicity, parity, pre-existing diabetes, pre-existing hypertension and socioeconomic deprivation measured using Index of Multiple Deprivation 2019. Models were fitted with robust standard errors to account for hospital-level clustering. The analysis of the neonatal outcomes was repeated for those born at term (≥ 37 weeks’ gestation) since preterm birth has been reported to be more common in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results The analysis included 342,080 women, of whom 3,527 had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was more common in women who were younger, of non-white ethnicity, primiparous, residing in the most deprived areas, or had comorbidities. Fetal death (aOR, 2.21, 95% CI 1.58-3.11; P<0.001) and preterm birth (aOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.96-2.42; P<0.001) occurred more frequently in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection than those without. Risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.29-1.85; P<0.001), birth by emergency Cesarean delivery (aOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.51-1.76; P<0.001) and prolonged admission following birth (aOR 1.57, 95%CI 1.44-1.72; P<0.001) were significantly higher for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection than those without. There were no significant differences in the rate of other maternal outcomes. Risk of neonatal adverse outcome (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.27-1.66; P<0.001), need for specialist neonatal care (aOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51; P=0.03), and prolonged neonatal admission following birth (aOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.49-1.75; P<0.001) were all significantly higher for infants with mothers with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. When the analysis was restricted to pregnancies delivered at term (≥37 weeks), there were no significant differences in neonatal adverse outcome (P=0.78), need for specialist neonatal care after birth (P=0.22) or neonatal readmission within four weeks of birth (P=0.05). Neonates born at term to mothers with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to have prolonged admission following birth (21.1% compared to 14.6%, aOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.49-1.75; P<0.001). Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of birth is associated with higher rates of fetal death, preterm birth, preeclampsia and emergency Cesarean delivery. There were no additional adverse neonatal outcomes, other than those related to preterm delivery. Pregnant women should be counseled regarding risks of SARS-COV-2 infection and should be considered a priority for vaccination.","GUROL-URGANCI, Ipek; JARDINE, Jennifer E.; CARROLL, Fran; DRAYCOTT, Tim; DUNN, George; FREMEAUX, Alissa; HARRIS, Tina; HAWDON, Jane; MORRIS, Edward; MULLER, Patrick; WAITE, Lara; WEBSTER, Kirstin; VAN DER MEULEN, Jan; KHALIL, Asma",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937821005652; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2021.05.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023315/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937821005652?v=s5,253

We evaluated the association between ICS and COVID-19 related death using linked electronic health records in the UK. Methods: We conducted cohort studies on two groups of people (COPD and asthma) using the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse data from primary care practices linked to national death registrations. People receiving an ICS were compared to those receiving alternative respiratory medications. Our primary outcome was COVID-19 related death. Findings: We identified 148,588 people with COPD and 817,973 people with asthma receiving relevant respiratory medications in the four months prior to 01 March 2020. People with COPD receiving ICS were at a greater risk of COVID-19 related death compared to those receiving a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (adjusted HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.08 - 1.75). People with asthma receiving high dose ICS were at an increased risk of death compared to those receiving a short-acting beta agonist (SABA) only (adjusted HR = 1.52, 95%CI = 1.08 - 2.14); the adjusted HR for those receiving low-medium dose ICS was 1.10 (95% CI = 0.82 - 1.49). Quantitative bias analyses indicated that an unmeasured confounder of only moderate strength of association with exposure and outcome could explain the observed associations in both populations. Interpretation: These results do not support a major role of ICS in protecting against COVID-19 related deaths. Observed increased risks of COVID-19 related death among people with COPD and asthma receiving ICS can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.","The OpenSAFELY Collaborative,; Schultze, A.; Walker, A.

Due to its immune modulation properties, they are commonly used in the therapeutic approach of various retroviral infections, namely human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). In HIV infection, it has been shown that IFN therapy limits early viral replication, particularly useful on post-exposure prophylaxis. In veterinary medicine, recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN-ω) was the first interferon licensed for use in cats. Several studies have recently shown that this compound seems to stimulate the innate immunity, decreasing clinical signs and co-infections in naturally FIV-infected cats. More than summarizing the main conclusions about rFeIFN-ω in cats, this review emphasizes the immune-modulation properties of IFN therapy, opening new perspectives for its use in retroviral infections. Either in FIV-infected cats or in HIV individuals, type I IFNs seem to induce an innate immune-modulation and should not be overlooked as a therapeutic option in retroviral infections.","Leal, Rodolfo Oliveira; Gil, Solange",Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056740/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci3040032,253

However, as national variability has been observed, this study sought to describe PA, SB and eating patterns, and to explore their gender as well as other socio-demographic correlates and how they interrelate in a representative sample of Portuguese adults during the COVID-19 first mandatory social confinement. The survey was applied online and by telephone to 5856 adults (mean age = 45.8 years; 42.6% women). The majority reported high (46.0%) or moderate (20.5%) PA levels. Men, younger participants, those with higher education levels and a favourable perception of their financial situation reported higher PA levels, with the opposite pattern for SB. Physical fitness activities and household chores were more reported by women, with more strength training and running activities reported by men. Regarding eating behaviours, 45.1% reported changes, positive (58%) and negative (42%), with 18.2% reporting increases in consumption of fruit, vegetables, and fish and other seafood consumption, while 10.8% (most with lower educational level and less comfortable with their income) reported an increase in consumption of ready-to-eat meals, soft drinks, savoury snacks, and take-away and delivered meals. Two clusters—a health-enhancing vs. risky pattern—emerged through multiple correspondence analysis characterized by co-occurrence of high vs. low PA levels, positive vs. negative eating changes, awareness or not of the COVID-19 PA and dietary recommendations, perceived financial situation, higher vs. lower educational level and time in social confinement. In conclusion, while in social confinement, both positive and negative PA and eating behaviours and trends were displayed, highlighting the role of key sociodemographic correlates contributing to healthy vs. risky patterns. Results may inform future health interventions and policies to be more targeted to those at risk, and also advocate the promotion of PA and healthy eating in an integrated fashion.","Silva, Marlene Nunes; Gregório, Maria João; Santos, Rute; Marques, Adilson; Rodrigues, Bruno; Godinho, Cristina; Silva, Catarina Santos; Mendes, Romeu; Graça, Pedro; Arriaga, Miguel; Freitas, Graça",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444845/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13082685,253

Enzymatic treatment with O‐glycosidase of radiolabelled virions under different ionic conditions, to allow for possible alternative exposure of glycosidic enzyme cleavage sites, did not alter the specific infectivity of virions re‐isolated after rate‐zonal centrifugation in glycerol gradients. As an alternative method to assess the significance of carbohydrates in IPNV integrity, periodate oxidation in the presence of an aldehyde quencher was chosen. Following re‐isolation of viruses, a 3–5 (10)log‐unit reduction in specific infectivity was revealed and, at higher concentrations, a total disruption or virion aggregation was observed. The loss of infectivity of intact virions was not because of a lack of attachment to cells. Additionally, re‐evaluation of reading values from UV‐spectra of purified IPNV yielded a specific infectivity of 3 × 10(11) TCID(50)‐units mg(−1) of protein and a ratio of 40 virions per TCID(50)‐unit in the CHSE‐214 cell system.","Fridholm, H; Everitt, E",J Fish Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2011.01280.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21838710/,253
668870,Monitoring the global COVID-19 impact on tourism: The COVID19tourism index,2020-12-15,"To fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, much effort has been directed toward drug repurposing, testing investigational and approved drugs against several viral or human proteins in vitro. Here we investigate the impact of colloidal aggregation, a common artifact in early drug discovery, in these repurposing screens. We selected 56 drugs reported to be active in biochemical assays and tested them for aggregation by both dynamic light scattering and by enzyme counter screening with and without detergent; seventeen of these drugs formed colloids at concentrations similar to their literature reported IC50s. To investigate the occurrence of colloidal aggregators more generally in repurposing libraries, we further selected 15 drugs that had physical properties resembling known aggregators from a common repurposing library, and found that 6 of these aggregated at micromolar concentrations. An attraction of repurposing is that drugs active on one target are considered de-risked on another. This study suggests not only that many of the drugs repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 in biochemical assays are artifacts, but that, more generally, when screened at relevant concentrations, drugs can act artifactually via colloidal aggregation. Understanding the role of aggregation, and detecting its effects rapidly, will allow the community to focus on those drugs and leads that genuinely have potential for treating COVID-19.

Serodiagnostic methods, typically ELISA (with either native or recombinant antigens), are often used for early diagnosis. The use of native antigens, as in the MM3-SERO ELISA (commercialized as BIO K 211, BIO-X Diagnostics), continues to be beneficial in terms of sensitivity and specificity; however, there is interest in developing ELISA tests based on recombinant antigens to avoid the need to culture parasites. Of the antigens secreted by adult flukes, recombinant procathepsin L1 (rFhpCL1) is the most commonly tested in ELISA to date. However, although adult flukes produce three different clades of CLs (FhCL1, FhCL2, and FhCL5), to our knowledge, the diagnostic value of recombinant FhCL2 and FhCL5 has not yet been investigated. In the present study, we developed and tested three indirect ELISAs using rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 and evaluated their recognition by sera from sheep and cattle naturally infected with F. hepatica. Although the overall antibody response to these three rFhpCLs was similar, some animals displayed preferential recognition for particular rFhpCLs. Moreover, for cattle sera, the highest sensitivity was obtained using rFhpCL2 (97%), being equal for both rFhpCL1 and rFhpCL5 (87.9%), after adjusting cut-offs for maximum specificity. By contrast, for sheep sera, the sensitivity was 100% for the three rFhpCLs. Finally, the presence of truncated and/or partially unfolded molecules in antigen preparations is postulated as a possible source of cross-reactivity.","Martínez-Sernández, Victoria; Perteguer, María J.; Hernández-González, Ana; Mezo, Mercedes; González-Warleta, Marta; Orbegozo-Medina, Ricardo A.; Romarís, Fernanda; Paniagua, Esperanza; Gárate, Teresa; Ubeira, Florencio M.",Parasitol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29564626/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-018-5809-7,253

As certain regions later showed a downtrend in daily new cases, EDx laboratories have reopened under the guidance of the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM). In our reopening experience guided by the AANEM, we measured relevant outcomes to determine further workflow adaptations. We aimed to detail our experience and share the lessons learned. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical volumes, billing data, diagnosis distributions, and rates of COVID‐19 exposure and transmission among patients and staff in our EDx laboratory during the first 6 months of reopening, starting on June 1, 2020. For context, we detailed the recent AANEM guidelines we adopted at our laboratory, supplemented by other consensus statements. RESULTS: We completed 816 outpatient studies from June 1 to December 1, 2020, reaching 97% of the total volume and 97% of total billing compared with the same time period in 2019. The average relative value units per study were similar. There were no major shifts in diagnosis distributions. We completed 10 of 12 requested inpatient studies during this period. There were no known COVID‐19 transmissions between patients and staff. DISCUSSION: Our experience suggests that it is possible to safely operate an EDx laboratory under the guidance of the AANEM and other experts, with clinical volume and billing rates comparable to pre‐pandemic baselines.","Lau, K.

Assessing the impact of risk perception about virus infection and job instability,2021-09-30,"State and local health departments in the United States are using various indicators to identify differences in rates of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalizations and deaths. To inform mitigation efforts, on May 19, 2020, the Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) implemented a reporting system to monitor five indicators of state-level COVID-19 status to assess the ability to safely reopen: 1) composite syndromic surveillance data, 2) the number of new COVID-19 cases,* 3) the number of COVID-19-associated deaths,† 4) health care capacity data, and 5) public health capacity for contact tracing (contact tracing capacity). Using standardized methods, KDPH compiles an indicator monitoring report (IMR) to provide daily analysis of these five indicators, which are combined with publicly available data into a user-friendly composite status that KDPH and local policy makers use to assess state-level COVID-19 hazard status. During May 19-July 15, 2020, Kentucky reported 12,742 COVID-19 cases, and 299 COVID-19-related deaths (1). The mean composite state-level hazard status during May 19-July 15 was 2.5 (fair to moderate). IMR review led to county-level hotspot identification (identification of counties meeting criteria for temporal increases in number of cases and incidence) and facilitated collaboration among KDPH and local authorities on decisions regarding mitigation efforts. Kentucky's IMR might easily be adopted by state and local health departments in other jurisdictions to guide decision-making for COVID-19 mitigation, response, and reopening.","Varela, Kate; Scott, Benjamin; Prather, John; Blau, Erin; Rock, Peter; Vaughan, Adam; Halldin, Cara; Griffing, Sean; Pfeiffer, Heidi; Hines, Janine; Dirlikov, Emilio; Thoroughman, Doug",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6934e3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853188/,253

In response, the Federal Government expanded unemployment insurance benefits in both size ($600/week supplement) and scope (to include caregivers and self-employed workers). We assessed the relationship between unemployment insurance and food insecurity among people who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic in the period when the federal unemployment insurance supplement was in place. We analyzed data from the Understanding Coronavirus in America (UAC) cohort, a longitudinal survey collected by the University of Southern California Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) every two weeks between April 1 and July 8, 2020. We limited the sample to individuals living in households earning less than $75,000 in February 2020 who lost their jobs during COVID-19. Using difference-in-differences and event study regression models, we evaluated the association between receipt of unemployment insurance and self-reported food insecurity and eating less due to financial constraints. We found that 40.5% of those living in households earning less than $75,000 and employed in February 2020 experienced unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of those who lost their jobs, 31% reported food insecurity and 33% reported eating less due to financial constraints. Food insecurity peaked in April 2020 and declined over time, but began to increase again among people receiving unemployment insurance during the final wave of the survey ahead of the federal supplement to unemployment insurance ending. Food insecurity and eating less were more common among people who were non-White, lived in lower-income households, younger, and who were sexual or gender minorities. Receipt of unemployment insurance was associated with a 4.4 percentage point (95% CI: −7.8 to −0.9 percentage points) decline in food insecurity (a 30.3% relative decline compared to the average level of food insecurity during the study period). Receipt of unemployment insurance was also associated with a 6.1 percentage point (95% CI: −9.6 to −2.7 percentage point) decline in eating less due to financial constraints (a 42% relative decline). Estimates from event study specifications revealed that reductions in food insecurity and eating less were greatest in the four-week period immediately following receipt of unemployment insurance, with no evidence of differential pre-existing trends in either outcome. We conclude that receiving unemployment insurance benefits during the period when the $600/week federal supplement was in place was associated with large reductions in food insecurity.","Raifman, Julia; Bor, Jacob; Venkataramani, Atheendar",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.28.20163618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766606/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.28.20163618v1?rss=1,253

However, the variability of inactivation across farms and over time is unknown because most studies have examined pathogen inactivation under ideal laboratory conditions or have focused on only one or two full‐scale digesters at a time. In contrast, we sampled seven full‐scale digesters treating cattle manure in Wisconsin for 9 mo on a biweekly basis (n = 118 pairs of influent and effluent samples) and used real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to analyze these samples for 19 different microbial genetic markers. Overall, inactivation of pathogens and fecal indicators was highly variable. When aggregated across digester and season, log‐removal values for several representative microorganisms—bovine Bacteroides, Bacteroidales‐like CowM3, and bovine polyomavirus—were 0.78 ± 0.34, 0.70 ± 0.50, and 0.53 ± 0.58, respectively (mean ± SD). These log‐removal values were up to two times lower than expected based on the scientific literature. Thus, our study indicates that full‐scale anaerobic digestion of cattle manure requires optimization with regard to pathogen inactivation. Future studies should focus on identifying the potential causes of this suboptimal performance (e.g., overloading, poor mixing, poor temperature control). Our study also examined the fate of pathogens during manure separation and found that the majority of microbes we detected ended up in the liquid fraction of separated manure. This finding has important implications for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens through the environment to humans. CORE IDEAS: Pathogen inactivation is highly variable among full‐scale anaerobic digesters. Pathogen inactivation by full‐scale digesters on cattle farms needs optimization. Most microbes end up in the liquid fraction during solids separation of manure.","Burch, Tucker R.; Spencer, Susan K.; Borchardt, Spencer S.; Larson, Rebecca A.; Borchardt, Mark A.",J Environ Qual,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29634802/; https://doi.org/10.2134/jeq2017.07.0285,253
674172,A new era of health leadership.,2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Veterinary medicines have been widely used for the prevention and treatment of diseases, growth promotion, and to promote feeding efficacy in livestock. As the veterinary medicine industry has steadily grown, it is crucial to set up a baseline for the quality of medicine as well as the insufficiency or excessiveness of the active ingredients in drug products to ensure the compliance, safety and efficacy of these medicines. Thus, the 10 years data of post-marketing quality control study was summarized to determine the rate and extent of non-compliance of these medicines and to establish baseline data for future quality control measures of veterinary medicine. RESULTS: In this study, 1650 drugs for veterinary use were collected per year from each city and province in Korea and analysed for the quantity of active ingredients according to the “national post-market surveillance (NPMS) system” over the past decade. The NPMS assessment was performed using liquid and gas chromatography, titration, UV/Vis spectrophotometry, and bioassays. A total of 358 cases were deemed noncompliant, with the average noncompliance rate for all medicine types being 2.0%. The average noncompliance rates for antibiotics, biologics and other chemical drugs except antibiotics (OCD) were 1.1%, 1.2%, and 3.0%, respectively. The first leading cause for noncompliant products was insufficient quantity of major ingredients (283 cases), and the second leading cause was the existence of excess amount of active ingredients (60 cases). Tylosin, spiramycin, ampicillin, tetracyclines and penicillins were most frequently found to be noncompliant among antibiotics. Among the OCD, the noncompliance was found commonly in vitamin A. CONCLUSION: The overall trend presented gradually decreasing violation rates, suggesting that the quality of veterinary medicines has improved. Consistent application of the NPMS assessment and the establishment of the Korea Veterinary Good Manufacturing Practice (KVGMP) will help to maintain the good quality of medicine.","Kang, JeongWoo; Park, Hae-chul; Jang, Yang ho; Hossain, Md Akil; Jeong, Kyunghun; Jeong, Mi young; Yun, Seon-Jong; Park, Sung-won; Kim, Dae gyun; Lee, Kwang-jick",BMC Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1054-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28532461/,253

674328,How behavioural science data helps mitigate the COVID-19 crisis,2020-03-27,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a global epidemic affecting every country. Small countries, however, face distinctive challenges related to their health system governance and their ability to implement effective health systems’ reforms. The aim of this research was to perform a comparative assessment of existing diabetes management practices at the population level and explore governmental-related policy for Cyprus, Iceland, Luxembourg, Malta and Montenegro. This is the first time that such an evidence-based review study has been performed in the field of diabetes. The overall purpose was to set the agenda for health policy and inform strategic actions for small countries that can benefit from dealing with the diabetes epidemic at a country level. METHODS: We collected data and synthesized the evidence on dealing with diabetes for each of the five small European countries according to the (1) epidemiology of diabetes and other related metabolic abnormalities, (2) burden of diabetes status and (3) diabetes registers and national plans. We collected data by contacting Ministry representatives and other bodies in each state, and by searching through publicly available information from the respective Ministry of Health website on strategies and policies. RESULTS: Diabetes rates were highest in Cyprus and Malta. National diabetes registers are present in Cyprus and Montenegro, while national diabetes plans and diabetes-specific strategies have been established in Cyprus, Malta and Montenegro. These three countries also offer a free holistic healthcare service to their diabetes population. CONCLUSIONS: Multistakeholder, national diabetes plans and public health strategies are important means to provide direction on diabetes management and health service provision at the population level. However, political support is not always present, as seen for Iceland. The absence of evidence-based strategies, lack of funding for conducting regular health examination surveys, omission of monitoring practices and capacity scarcity are among the greatest challenges faced by small countries to effectively measure health outcomes. Nevertheless, we identified means of how these can be overcome. For example, the creation of public interdisciplinary repositories enables easily accessible data that can be used for health policy and strategic planning. Health policy-makers, funders and practitioners can consider the use of regular health examination surveys and other tools to effectively manage diabetes at the population level.","Cuschieri, Sarah; Pallari, Elena; Terzic, Natasa; Alkerwi, Ala’a; Sigurðardóttir, Árún Kristín",Health Res Policy Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781266/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-00665-y,253

Ambivalence regarding psychiatric intervention and labeling among young people with psychosis is a contributing factor. For these individuals, caregivers often facilitate the pathway to care and support ongoing engagement and adherence. Caregivers describe distress and burden associated with this role. This manuscript describes the development and pilot feasibility testing of a motivational interviewing-derived communication training for caregivers of individuals with untreated or under-treated early course psychosis. Individuals with lived experience were consulted in the intervention development process. The training consisted of four 60-min sessions teaching the philosophy and basic skills of motivational interviewing as well as two brief practice calls. Feasibility was assessed with regard to study enrollment, retention, and completion. Satisfaction was assessed through the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and qualitative feedback. Thirty-one caregivers consented to this pilot feasibility trial and participated via telehealth over the course of 5 months. Intervention completion and reported satisfaction were high, with 94% of consented participants completing at least three training sessions and 84% reporting that they would “definitely” recommend the training to a friend in similar circumstances. There were no between-clinician differences in MILO session attendance (F([2]) = 0.53, p = 0.596) or satisfaction total scores (F([2]) = 1.03, p = 0.371).

Unique challenges for pregnant and post-partum patients with substance use disorders includes some evidence of reduced access to medication to treat opioid use disorders and changes in delivery protocols that isolate birthing people from supports. Opportunities for all patients with substance use disorders include virtual platforms presenting positive opportunities for treatment. They are time efficient, eliminate transportation barriers, and potentially reduce childcare barriers. For pregnant and post-partum patients with substance use disorders, hybrid models of telemedicine and in-person visits reduced no-show visit rates and increased flexibility in medication dosing regimens.

678429,"Home-deliveries Before-During COVID-19 Lockdown: Accessibility, Environmental Justice, Equity, and Policy Implications",2021-02-25,"BACKGROUND: Although elective surgical procedures in the United States have been suspended because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, orthopaedic surgeons are being recruited to serve patients with COVID-19 in addition to providing orthopaedic acute care. Older individuals are deemed to be at higher risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19. Although previous studies have shown a high proportion of older providers nationwide across medical specialties, we are not aware of any previous study that has analyzed the age distribution among the orthopaedic workforce. Therefore, the purposes of the present study were (1) to determine the geographic distribution of U.S. orthopaedic surgeons by age, (2) to compare the distribution with other surgical specialties, and (3) to compare this distribution with the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic statistics from the most recent State Physician Workforce Data Reports published by the Association of American Medical Colleges were extracted to identify the 2018 statewide proportion of practicing orthopaedic surgeons ≥60 years of age as well as age-related demographic data for all surgical specialties. Geospatial data on the distribution of COVID-19 cases were obtained from the Environmental Systems Research Institute. State boundary files were taken from the U.S. Census Bureau. Orthopaedic workforce age data were utilized to group states into quintiles. RESULTS: States with the highest quintile of orthopaedic surgeons ≥60 years of age included states most severely affected by COVID-19: New York, New Jersey, California, and Florida. For all states, the median number of providers ≥60 years of age was 105.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 45.5 to 182.5). The median proportion of orthopaedic surgeons ≥60 years of age was higher than that of all other surgical subspecialties, apart from thoracic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the present report provides the first age-focused view of the orthopaedic workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. States in the highest quintile of orthopaedic surgeons ≥60 years old are also among the most overwhelmed by COVID-19. As important orthopaedic acute care continues in addition to COVID-19 frontline service, special considerations may be needed for at-risk staff. Appropriate health system measures and workforce-management strategies should protect the subset of those who are most potentially vulnerable. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

According to the results of multivariable regression adjusted for potential confounders, elevated BMI (OR = 2.49; 95% CI = 1.15–5.41), higher CRP levels (OR = 2.28; 95% CI = 1.08–4.78), increased FBS levels (OR = 2.88; 95% CI = 1.35–6.17), higher levels of total cholestrol (OR = 2.55; 95% CI = 1.19–5.45) and LDL (OR = 2.27; 95% CI = 1.07–4.79), elevated triglyceride (OR = 5.14; 95% CI = 2.28–11.56), and raised levels of D-dimer (OR = 5.68; 95% CI = 2.22–14.49) were identified as independent risk factors of COVID-19 mortality. No significant association was detected regarding HDL level, QTc interval or heart size, and COVID-19 fatality odds. CONCLUSION: The present findings demonstrated that obesity, higher levels of CRP, blood sugar, D-dimer, and lipid markers were likely to be predictive factors of COVID-19-related mortality odds.","Salari, Arsalan; Mahdavi-Roshan, Marjan; Ghorbani, Zeinab; Mortazavi, Seyede Sahere; Naghshbandi, Mona; Faraghnia, Farsima; Rahbar Taramsari, Morteza; Ahmadnia, Zahra",Ir J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02455-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449333/,253
679697,Who benefits from urban green spaces during times of crisis? Perception and use of urban green spaces in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-09-22,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The Covid-19 pandemic has clearly impacted the Italian healthcare system. The growing number of patients in critical conditions has required a reorganization of the hospitals wards and of other healthcare structures, by changing the working routines of health professionals. The aim of the study is to explore if and how the nursing care towards Covid-19 positive patients have changed during the pandemic. METHOD: Qualitative study with a phenomenological approach conducted through semi-structured interviews. Interviews have been carried out during the months of October and November 2020. Our research involved 21 nursing professionals attending post-graduate courses at the Department of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Parma (academic year 2019/2020) and who have worked during the pandemic period in health services structures and organizations. RESULTS: The interviews showed how, during the period of the pandemic emergency, the care relationship between nurses and patients has changed because of the priority given to clinical and technical practices, in some cases, “life-saving”. This happened due to different factors such as the nurses’ fear of being infected by the virus and the lack of a sufficient time to ensure an holistic and integrated approach towards an increasing number of patients in highly complex conditions. Thus, the dimension of caring has been consciously overshadowed. CONCLUSIONS: The health emergency that has hit Italy since the first months of 2020 has shown structural limits and gaps of public health policies, hospital settings and national health services organization that already existed in the pre-pandemic period. It also highlighted how, even before Covid-19, nursing was already in part denoted by a loss of caring, a missed nursing care.","Moretti, Chiara; Ceccaroni, Sara Elettra; Confortini, Riccardo; Roncaglio, Clelia Malvina; Lionetto, Valentina; Ndocaj, Kristine; Festa, Lucia; Calderone, Carlotta; Sarli, Leopoldo; Artioli, Giovanna",Acta Biomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328132/; https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v92is2.11944,253

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Canadian National Database (i.e., Statistics Canada) and Statista. PARTICIPANTS: Population-level data, and economic and consumer market data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suicide mortality data, population data and unemployment data were obtained from available statistical databases (e.g. Statistics Canada). We quantified suicide rate by dividing the total number of suicide deaths by the national population expressed as a rate per 100,000 population. RESULTS: Overall suicide mortality rate decreased in Canada from 10.82 deaths per 100,000 in the March 2019 - February 2020 period to 7.34 per 100,000 (i.e. absolute difference of 1300 deaths) in the March 2020 - February 2021 period. The overall Canadian unemployment rate changed from an average monthly rate of 5.7% in 2019 to 9.5% in 2020. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that for the first post-pandemic interval evaluated (i.e., March 2020 - February 2021), suicide rates in Canada decreased against a background of extraordinary public health measures intended to mitigate community spread of COVID-19. An externality of public health measures was a significant rise in national unemployment rates in population measures of distress. Our results suggest that government interventions that broadly aim to reduce measures of insecurity (i.e., economic, housing, health), and timely psychiatric services, should be prioritised as part of a national suicide reduction strategy, not only during but after termination of the COVID-19 pandemic.","McIntyre, Roger S; Lui, Leanna Mw; Rosenblat, Joshua D; Ho, Roger; Gill, Hartej; Mansur, Rodrigo B; Teopiz, Kayla; Liao, Yuhua; Lu, Ciyong; Subramaniapillai, Mehala; Nasri, Flora; Lee, Yena",J R Soc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34551280/; https://doi.org/10.1177/01410768211043186,253

As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization. Safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed.","Cortegiani, Andrea; Ingoglia, Giulia; Ippolito, Mariachiara; Giarratano, Antonino; Einav, Sharon",J Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32173110/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.03.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944120303907; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883944120303907,253

The scientific community has joined efforts to gain knowledge of the newly emerged virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the immunopathological mechanisms leading to COVID-19, and its significance for patients with allergies and asthma. METHODS Based on the current literature, recent advances and developments in COVID-19 in the context of allergic diseases were reviewed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS In this review, we discuss the prevalence of COVID-19 in subjects with asthma, attacks of hereditary angioedema, and other allergic diseases during COVID-19. Underlying mechanisms suggest a protective role of allergy in COVID-19, involving eosinophilia, SARS-CoV-2 receptors expression, interferon responses, and other immunological events, but further studies are needed to fully understand those associations. There has been significant progress in disease evaluation and management of COVID-19, and allergy care should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Academy of Allergy & Clinical Immunology (EAACI) launched a series of statements and position papers providing recommendations on the organization of the allergy clinic, handling of allergen immunotherapy, asthma, drug hypersensitivity, allergic rhinitis, and other allergic diseases. Treatment of allergies using biologics during the COVID-19 pandemic has also been discussed. Allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines, including severe anaphylaxis, have been reported. Vaccination is a prophylactic strategy that can lead to a significant reduction in the mortality and morbidity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in this review, we discuss the proposed culprit components causing rare adverse reactions and recommendations to mitigate the risk of anaphylactic events during the administration of the vaccines.","Ding, Mei; Dong, Xiang; Sun, Yuan-Li; Sokolowska, Milena; Akdis, Mübeccel; van de Veen, Willem; Azkur, Ahmet Kursat; Azkur, Dilek; Akdis, Cezmi A; Gao, Ya-Dong",Clinical and translational allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582102/; https://doi.org/10.1002/clt2.12065,253

As a response, a range of interventions for patients and populations have been implemented in health and preventive settings, or need to be implemented in the short and long term. Implementation science offers a multidisciplinary perspective and systematic approach for the design, evaluation and analysis of programmes and policies to enhance implementation. The emergence of Covid-19 provides an urgent need to develop new perspectives and approaches in implementation science, such as the addition of innovative and rigorous approaches to the collection, use and analysis of ‘real-world’ data. Above all, we hope that implementation scientists will focus on what they can contribute to manage Covid-19 and its consequences for people, healthcare and society.","Wensing, Michel; Sales, Anne; Armstrong, Rebecca; Wilson, Paul",Implement Sci,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-020-01006-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32513292/,253
687867,Contact tracing strategies for COVID-19 containment with attenuated physical distancing,2020-05-08,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments to take measures to contain the spread of the disease; however, the effects have varied significantly from one country to another contingent on governments' responses. Countries that have flattened their coronavirus curves prove that interventions can bring COVID-19 under control. These achievements hold lessons, such as the strict social distancing and coordinated efforts of all government levels in China and massive testing in South Korea, for other countries battling the coronavirus around the world. In this work, we attempt to estimate how many COVID-19 cases could have been prevented in the United States (US) when compared with the US's actual number of cases assuming that on a certain date, the US took China-like or South Korea-like interventions and that these interventions would have been as effective in the US as in China and South Korea. We found that if that date was at the early stage of the outbreak (March 10), more than 99% (1.15 million) fewer infected cases could be expected by the end of the epidemic. This number decreases to 66.03% and 73.06% fewer infected cases with the China-like scenario and the South Korea-like scenario, respectively, if actions were taken on April 1, highlighting the need to respond quickly and effectively to fight the virus. Furthermore, we found that although interventions in both China and South Korea allowed the COVID-19 outbreak to be managed, the epidemic could still oscillate without strict large-scale lockdown measures, as shown in South Korea. Our results demonstrate that early effective interventions can save considerably more people from infection and provide a worldwide alert regard the need for swift response.","Liu, K.; Song, Y.; Li, M.; Shen, Z.; Wang, M.; Wu, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.06.20092981v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092981,253
688393,"The static and dynamic connectedness of environmental, social, and governance investments: International evidence",2020-08-12,"The lifting of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) lockdown requires, in the short and medium terms, a holistic and evidence-based approach to population health management based on combining risk factors and bio-economic outcomes, including actors' behaviors. This dynamic and global approach to health control is necessary to deal with the new paradigm of living with an infectious disease, which disrupts our individual freedom and behaviors. The challenge for policymakers consists of defining methods of lockdown-lifting and follow-up (middle-term rules) that best meet the needs for resumption of economic activity, societal wellbeing, and containment of the outbreak. There is no simple and ready-to-use way to do this since it means considering several competing objectives at the same time and continuously adapting the strategy and rules, ideally at local scale. We propose a framework for creating a precision evidence-based health policy that simultaneously considers public health, economic, and societal dimensions while accounting for constraints and uncertainty. It is based on the four following principles: integrating multiple and heterogeneous information, accepting navigation with uncertainty, adjusting the strategy dynamically with feedback mechanisms, and managing clusters through a multi-scalar conception. The evidence-based policy intervention for COVID-19 obtained includes scientific background via epidemiological modeling and bio-economic modeling. A set of quantitative and qualitative indicators are used as feedback to precisely monitor the societal-economic-epidemiological dynamics, allowing tightening or loosening of measures before epidemic damage (re-)occurs. Altogether, this allows an evidence-based policy that steers the strategy with precision and avoids any political shock.","Raboisson, Didier; Lhermie, Guillaume",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32612973/,253

METHODS: MERS-CoV data were obtained from the Saudi Ministry of Health for the period 2012 to July 2015. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results regarding the risk factors and mortality of MERS-CoV infection. RESULTS: In this series, the risk factors and outcomes of 939 cases of MERS-CoV occurring in the last 3 years are described. The majority of the affected patients were aged ≥40 years (n = 657; 70%). Of the 657 patients aged ≥40 years, 377 (57.3%) died. CONCLUSIONS: The case-fatality ratio was found to increase significantly with age. It ranged from 12.5% in those aged ≤19 years to 86.2% in those aged ≥80 years. The results confirmed the association between severe MERS-CoV illness and patients with a pre-existing health morbidity.

690351,On the genetics and immunopathogenesis of COVID-19,2020-09-10,"The future prevalence and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. Some emerging pathogens become avirulent as populations approach herd immunity. Although not all viruses follow this path, the fact that the seasonal coronaviruses are benign gives some hope. We develop a general mathematical model to predict when the interplay among three factors, correlation of severity in consecutive infections, population heterogeneity in susceptibility due to age, and reduced severity due to partial immunity, will promote avirulence as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic. Each of these components has the potential to limit severe, high-shedding cases over time under the right circumstances, but in combination they can rapidly reduce the frequency of more severe and infectious manifestation of disease over a wide range of conditions. As more reinfections are captured in data over the next several years, these models will help to test if COVID-19 severity is beginning to attenuate in the ways our model predicts, and to predict the disease.","Beams, Alexander B.; Bateman, Rebecca; Adler, Frederick R.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067128/,253
