Innovative tools in cancer genomics can optimize decision-making concerning appropriate drugs (alone or in combination) to cure or prolong life. The genomic characterization of tumours can also give direction to the development of novel drugs. Next-generation tumour sequencing is increasingly becoming an essential part of clinical decision-making, and, as such, will require appropriate coordination for effective adoption and delivery. RECENT FINDINGS There are several challenges that will need to be addressed if we are to facilitate cancer genomics as part of routine community oncology practice. Recent research into this novel testing paradigm has demonstrated the barriers are at the individual level, while others are at the institution and societal levels. SUMMARY This article, based on the authors' experience in community oncology practice and summary of literature, describes these challenges so strategies can be developed to address these challenges to improve patient outcomes.","Ashbury, Fredrick D; Thompson, Keith; Williams, Casey; Williams, Kirstin",Current opinion in oncology,https://doi.org/10.1097/cco.0000000000000764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183492/,744
61820,Post-Treatment Head and Neck Cancer Care: National Audit and Analysis of Current Practice in the United Kingdom.,2020-07-30,"Le recours aux dons de lait maternel pasteurisé est la norme de soins dans les hôpitaux pour les nourrissons ayant un très faible poids à la naissance, afin de faire le pont en attendant que les mères puissent allaiter leur enfant. Le but de cette étude était de vérifier si la pasteurisation à l’aide de la méthode de Holder (à 62,5 °C pendant 30 min) serait suffisante pour inactiver le coronavirus du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère 2 (SRAS-CoV-2) dans des échantillons de lait maternel provenant de donneuses. MÉTHODES: Nous avons inoculé avec le SRAS-CoV-2 des échantillons de lait congelés provenant de 10 donneuses de la Rogers Hixon Ontario Human Milk Bank (la banque de lait maternel de l’Ontario) pour atteindre une concentration finale de 1 × 107 DICT50/mL (50 % de la dose infectante de la culture de tissus par mL). Les échantillons ont été pasteurisés à l’aide de la méthode de Holder ou laissés à la température du laboratoire pendant 30 minutes, puis nous avons mis en culture des dilutions en série sur des cellules Vero E6 durant 5 jours. Nous avons utilisé des échantillons témoins dans cette étude, soit des échantillons de lait provenant des mêmes donneuses, auxquels le virus n’a pas été ajouté (échantillons pasteurisés et non pasteurisés), de même que des réplicats de cellules Vero E6 directement inoculées avec le SRAS-CoV-2. Nous rapportons ici les effets cytopathologiques en DICT50/mL. RÉSULTATS: Nous n’avons détecté aucune activité cytopathologique dans l’ensemble des échantillons de lait contenant le SRAS-CoV-2 pasteurisés à l’aide de la méthode de Holder. Dans les échantillons contenant le SRASCoV-2 qui n’ont pas été pasteurisés, mais plutôt laissés à la température du laboratoire pendant 30 minutes, nous avons observé une réduction du titre infectieux d’environ 1 log. INTERPRÉTATION: La pasteurisation du lait maternel à l’aide de la méthode de Holder (à 62,5 °C pendant 30 min) inactive le SRAS-CoV-2. Ainsi, si du lait maternel provenant de donneuses contenait le virus à la suite d’une transmission par la glande mammaire ou d’une contamination, cette méthode de pasteurisation rendrait le lait sans danger pour la consommation par le nourrisson et la manipulation par les travailleurs de la santé.","Unger, Sharon; Christie-Holmes, Natasha; Guvenc, Furkan; Budylowski, Patrick; Mubareka, Samira; Gray-Owen, Scott D; O'Connor, Deborah L",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.201309-f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257336/,744
67145,Dissolvable intranasal haemostatic agents for acute epistaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-01-16,"Emilia sonchifolia (L.) DC is a plant used in traditional medicine to treat several viral and bacterial diseases. The antiviral activities of selected Sephadex LH-20 column fractions and HPLC subfractions of an acetone extract of E. sonchifolia leaves were determined in shrimp Penaeus merguiensis primary lymphoid cells infected with either white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) or yellow head virus (YHV). WSSV and YHV replication was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR tests targeted to the VP19 and ORF1b gene transcripts, respectively. In lymphoid organ cells exposed to 100 µg ml⁻¹ of either the Sephadex fraction F14 or the HPLC F14 subfraction SF4, both fractions caused reduced replication, but YHV replication was reduced only by SF4. In the asthiazolyl blue mitochondrial enzyme activity assays to assess extract cytotoxicity, >60% of primary lymphoid organ cells remained viable following exposure to 100 µg ml⁻¹ of either F14 or SF4. GC-MS analysis of the HPLC F14 subfraction SF4 showed that it contained 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol. This study is the first to show that E. sonchifolia leaf extracts might be useful as bioactive agents to protect shrimp against viruses such as WSSV and YHV.","Maikaeo, Lamai; Chotigeat, Wilaiwan; Mahabusarakam, Wilawan",Diseases of aquatic organisms,https://doi.org/10.3354/dao02891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26203887/,744

Containment measures such as lockdown and social distancing can drastically alter the growth dynamics of the outbreak. This is the case for the 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak, which is characterized by a power-law growth. Strikingly however, the power-law exponent is different across countries. Here I illustrate the relationship between these two extreme scenarios, exponential and power-law growth, based on the impact of superspreaders and lockdown strategies to contain the outbreak. The theory predicts a relationship between the power- law exponent and the time interval between the first case and lockdown that is validated by the observed COVID-19 data across different countries.","Vazquez, Alexei",Physical review.

88122,Droplet and Bone Dust Contamination from High-speed Drilling During Mastoidectomy.,2021-02-03,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes severe persistent arthralgia. To better understand the molecular details of CHIKV RNA synthesis and the mode of action of inhibitors, we have developed an in vitro assay to study CHIKV replication/transcription complexes isolated from infected cells. In this assay (32)P-CTP was incorporated into the CHIKV genome, subgenomic (sg) RNA and into a ~7.5 kb positive-stranded RNA, termed RNA II. We mapped RNA II, which was also found in CHIKV-infected cells, to the 5' end of the genome up to the start of the sgRNA promoter region. Most of the RNA-synthesizing activity, negative-stranded RNA and a relatively large proportion of nsP1 and nsP4 were recovered from a crude membrane fraction obtained by pelleting at 15,000 G: . Positive-stranded RNA was mainly found in the cytosolic S15 fraction, suggesting it was released from the membrane-associated replication/transcription complexes (RTCs). The newly synthesized RNA was relatively stable and remained protected from cellular nucleases, possibly by encapsidation. A set of compounds that inhibit CHIKV replication in cell culture was tested in the in vitro RTC assay. In contrast to 3'dNTPs, chain terminators that acted as potent inhibitors of RTC activity, ribavirin triphosphate and 6-aza-UTP did not affect the RNA-synthesizing activity in vitro. In conclusion, this in vitro assay for CHIKV RNA synthesis is a useful tool for mechanistic studies on the RTC and mode of action studies on compounds with anti-CHIKV activity.","Albulescu, Irina C; Tas, Ali; Scholte, Florine E M; Snijder, Eric J; van Hemert, Martijn J",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.069690-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135884/,744

Although the effect of exercise training on pain and function have been widely investigated, few studies have focused on the changes in shoulder kinematics and muscle activity after exercise training. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of rotator cuff and scapular strengthening exercises on shoulder kinematics and the activation of rotator cuff and scapular muscles in healthy subjects. Thirty-six healthy subjects were recruited and randomly assigned into either a training or control group. Subjects in the training group were trained with rotator cuff and scapular strengthening exercises for 4 weeks. Scapular kinematics and shoulder muscle activity during arm elevation were measured before and after exercise training. After the 4-week training protocol, there was an increase in strength and a decrease in upper trapezius activation in the training group, which is consistent with previous studies. However, no difference was found in scapular kinematics and activation of rotator cuff muscles between the control and training groups after the training protocol. Although the exercise protocol resulted in strength gains for the rotator cuff, these gains did not transfer to an increase in muscle activation during motion. These results demonstrate the difficulty in changing activation patterns of the rotator cuff muscles. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

96146,A simple method for dilating tracheostomal stenosis.,2010,"INTRODUCTION It is unknown which comorbidities and stroke characteristics are associated with elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) levels after stroke. The main objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the association of elevated cTn with preexisting cardiovascular comorbidities (eg, coronary artery disease, heart failure and structural heart disease), specific stroke characteristics (eg, infarct/haemorrhage size, stroke severity, insular cortex involvement) and renal failure after ischaemic stroke (IS) or intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). The secondary objective is to evaluate the association of elevated cTn with stroke recurrence and death. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will include all cross-sectional, case-control, cohort studies and clinical trials involving IS and ICH adult patients (≥18 years), published between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2020 in English or Spanish, reporting the proportion with elevated cTn. We will search PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science by applying predefined search terms. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, retrieve full texts, extract the data in a predesigned form, and assess the risk of bias. We will apply random-effects or fixed-effects meta-analyses to estimate the association between cardiovascular comorbidities, stroke characteristics and renal failure with cTn elevation. We will report results as risk ratios or ORs. We will perform sensitivity analyses for subtypes of cTn (cTn-I and cTn-T), regular versus high-sensitivity assays, and type of stroke (IS vs ICH). We will estimate heterogeneity by using t2 Q and I2 measures. We will use funnel plots, Rosenthal's Fail-Safe N, Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill procedure, and Egger's regression intercept to assess publication bias. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This review will be based on published data and does therefore not require ethical clearance. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

The authors discuss a coronavirus-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was detected in Hungary in 2005 and highlight its significance in 2013. In 2005 the patient was hospitalized and all relevant clinical and microbiological tests were performed. Based on the IgG antibody positivity of the serum samples, the patient was diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the past. The time and source of the infection remained unknown. The condition of the patient improved and he was discharged from the hospital. The case raises the possibility of infections in Hungary imported from remote areas of the world and the importance of thorough examination of patients with severe respiratory syndrome with unknown etiology.","Rókusz, László; Jankovics, István; Jankovics, Máté; Sarkadi, Júlia; Visontai, Ildikó",Orvosi hetilap,https://doi.org/10.1556/oh.2013.29763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24240525/,744

The study included 202 participants divided into two groups, one consisting of 133 patients with canal paresis CP > 19% and one of 69 healthy subjects. Participant was tested according to the standard protocol of static posturography (SP), and with head movements of 0.3 Hz (HS 40), 0.6 Hz (HS 70) in random order controlled by a metronome. HS-posturography revealed a similar repeatability and internal consistency as the standard posturography. In patients with UV, 4th condition revealed higher sensitivity (74%) and specificity (71%) in HS 40 than in the standard posturography (67%, 65% respectively) and HS 70 (54%, 70% respectively). Static posturography and HS- posturography revealed a high reliability of the testing method. The head movements added to static posturography improve the sensitivity and specificity of the method in group with vestibular impairment. The most important test for that purpose seems to be the one on unstable surface with the eyes closed, with low frequency of head movements.","Janc, Magdalena; Sliwinska-Kowalska, Mariola; Politanski, Piotr; Kaminski, Marek; Jozefowicz-Korczynska, Magdalena; Zamyslowska-Szmytke, Ewa",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85745-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737683/,744

It has also increased the suicide rate in vulnerable groups who cannot handle the social and psychological consequences of the pandemic and the measures in place to halt it. OBJECTIVE In this study, we compared the lethality of suicide attempts and the methods chosen between the three months before the COVID-19 pandemic and three months during curfew and lockdown in Saudi Arabia. METHODS This is a retrospective, causal-comparative study conducted at King Saud Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 62 suicide attempt cases between January 2020 and June 2020 were included in this study. The scale for assessment of the lethality of suicide attempts (SALSA) was used for comparison, and cross-tabulation was used for the data of suicide methods. RESULTS There was a significant difference (P = 0.003) in the total SALSA score before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. The scores of lethality of suicide attempts were high during the lockdown. No significant difference was found in the suicide methods selected between the two time periods. However, the use of psychotropic medication overdose and self-immolation were prominent during the lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely associated with increased lethality of suicide attempts as well as an increased suicide rate. The development of appropriate mental health services is required.","Almaghrebi, Asma H",Current pediatric reviews,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573396317666210528123059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34053428/,744

Study specimens were selected from community and hospitalized patients positive and negative for influenza A(H1N1) and tested by PCR for other respiratory viruses. A number of infections diagnosed as influenza during the summer influenza outbreak were found to be due to other virus infections (most commonly rhinovirus).

These mediators are transcriptionally regulated by the JAK-STAT signaling pathways, which can be disabled by small molecules. METHODS A group of subjects (n = 20) was treated with baricitinib according to an off-label use of the drug. The study was designed as an observational longitudinal trial and approved by the local ethical committee. The patients were treated with baricitinib 4 mg twice daily for 2 days, followed by 4 mg per day for the remaining 7 days. Changes in the immune phenotype and expression of pSTAT3 in blood cells were evaluated and correlated with serum-derived cytokine levels and antibodies anti-SARS-CoV-2. In a single treated patient, we evaluated also the alteration of myeloid cell functional activity. RESULTS We provided evidences that baricitinib-treated patients have a marked reduction in serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, a rapid recovery in circulating T and B cell frequencies, and increased antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which were clinically associated with a reduction in oxygen flow need and progressive increase in the P/F. CONCLUSION Baricitinib prevented the progression towards a severe/extreme form of the viral disease by modulating the patients' immune landscape and these changes were associated with a safer and favorable clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

OBJECTIVES We questioned whether the high prevalence rates of HRVs found in epidemiological studies is due to long-term individual continuity or a result of frequent infections with different HRV subtypes. STUDY DESIGN In a 6-month winter period 18 healthy controls, aged 0-7 years, were at least sampled every two weeks for HRV-PCR, irrespective of respiratory symptoms. All HRV positive samples were genotyped to determine HRV diversity. RESULTS In total 272 samples were collected. HRV was found in 101/272 (37%) samples. Genotyping revealed 27 different HRV subtypes. A median of 3.0 different HRV subtypes was found per child. Re-infections and continuity with identical HRV sequences were observed. The number of HRVs were higher in the youngest age group (p=0.01) and they had more different HRV subtypes (p=0.05) compared to oldest age group. CONCLUSIONS We found a high HRV exposition with a considerable diverse population of HRV subtypes in young children. These results have major implications for future research into the pathogenic role of HRV in respiratory diseases. Characterisation of subtypes will be necessary to discriminate between prolonged continuity and re-infections in patients with respiratory diseases.","van der Zalm, Marieke M; Wilbrink, Berry; van Ewijk, Bart E; Overduin, Pieter; Wolfs, Tom F W; van der Ent, Cornelis K",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2011.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21982210/,744

147693,Histological findings of tracheal samples from COVID-19 positive critically ill mechanically ventilated patients.,2021-10-04,"Respiratory viral infections are common respiratory diseases. Influenza viruses, RSV and SARS-COV2 have the potential to cause severe respiratory infections. Numerous studies have shown that unregulated immune response to these viruses can cause excessive inflammation and tissue damage. Therefore, regulating the antiviral immune response in the respiratory tract is of importance. In this regard, recent years studies have emphasized the importance of vitamin D in respiratory viral infections. Although, the most well-known role of vitamin D is to regulate the metabolism of phosphorus and calcium, it has been shown that this vitamin has other important functions. One of these functions is immune regulation. Vitamin D can regulate the antiviral immune response in the respiratory tract in order to provide an effective defense against respiratory viral infections and prevention from excessive inflammatory response and tissue damage. In addition, this vitamin has preventive effects against respiratory viral infections. Some studies during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with a higher risk of mortality and sever disease in patients with COVID-19. Since, more attention has recently been focused on vitamin D. In this article, after a brief overview of the antiviral immune response in the respiratory system, we will review the role of vitamin D in regulating the antiviral immune response comprehensively.

156346,Acute Paediatric Mastoiditis in the UK Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Observational Study.,2021-10-04,"PURPOSE To determine the extent of and reasons for hesitancy toward vaccination among adults at high-risk for pneumococcal disease. DESIGN Cross-sectional. SETTING Online survey in March-April 2019 via QuestionPro. SUBJECTS Tennessee adults (18-64 years) at high-risk of pneumococcal disease (n = 1,002). MEASURES Modified version of the validated Vaccine Hesitancy Scale assessed vaccine-related beliefs, reasons for hesitancy, external influences on vaccination, and prior vaccination. ANALYSIS Descriptive and inferential statistics provided an overview of the responses and comparisons among subgroups. Logistic regression determined the odds of being hesitant using the listed beliefs and influencers as predictors. Thematic analysis was performed on the qualitative data gathered from free response questions throughout the survey. RESULTS Analysis included 1,002 complete responses (12% response rate [total viewed = 8,331]) with 34.3% indicating hesitancy toward one or more recommended vaccinations, with 53% of which indicating hesitancy to the pneumococcal vaccine despite it being recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for all respondents. The odds of vaccine hesitancy or resistance were higher in minorities (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.19-2.11), those not believing others like them get vaccinated (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.262-2.613), and respondents recalling negative media about vaccines (OR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.797-3.643). CONCLUSIONS Patients at high-risk of pneumococcal disease lack awareness of the need for the recommended vaccine, and provider education may need improving to increase vaccination in this population.","Gatwood, Justin; McKnight, Madison; Frederick, Kelsey; Hohmeier, Kenneth; Kapan, Shiyar; Chiu, Chi-Yang; Renfro, Chelsea; Hagemann, Tracy",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,https://doi.org/10.1177/0890117121998141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657844/,744
614463,One year into the COVID-19 pandemic: What do we know so far from studies assessing risk and mitigation of droplet aerosolisation during endonasal surgery? A systematic review.,2021-09-02,"INTRODUCTION: The safety of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) among COVID-19 patients has been controversial since the onset of the pandemic. METHODS: Digital databases were queried to study the safety of RAASi in COVID-19. The primary outcome of interest was mortality. The secondary outcome was seropositivity improvement/viral clearance, clinical manifestation progression, and progression to intensive care units. A random-effect model was used to compute an unadjusted odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: A total of 49 observational studies were included in the analysis consisting of 83,269 COVID-19 patients (RAASi n = 34,691; non-RAASi n = 48,578). The mean age of the sample was 64, and 56% were males. We found that RAASi was associated with similar mortality outcomes as compared to non-RAASi groups (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.99–1.15; p > 0.05). RAASi was associated with seropositivity improvement including negative RT-PCR or antibodies, (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93–0.99; p < 0.05). There was no association between RAASi versus control with progression to ICU admission (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.79–1.23; p > 0.05) or higher odds of worsening of clinical manifestations (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.97–1.11; p > 0.05). Metaregression analysis did not change our outcomes for effect modifiers including age, sex, comorbidities, RAASi type, or study type on outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is not a contraindication to hold or discontinue RAASi as they are not associated with higher mortality or worsening symptoms. Continuation of RAASi might be associated with favorable outcomes in COVID-19, including seropositivity/viral clearance.

683568,Low incidence rate of diarrhoea in COVID-19 patients is due to integrin,2021-07-15,"Erosion and runoff from pastures may lead to degradation of surface water. A 2‐yr grazing study was conducted to quantify the effects of grazing management on sediment, phosphorus (P), and pathogen loading of streams in cool‐season grass pastures. Six adjoining 12.1‐ha pastures bisected by a stream in central Iowa were divided into three treatments: continuous stocking with unrestricted stream access (CSU), continuous stocking with restricted stream access (CSR), and rotational stocking (RS). Rainfall simulations on stream banks resulted in greater (P < 0.10) proportions of applied precipitation and amounts of sediment and P transported in runoff from bare sites than from vegetated sites across grazing treatments. Similar differences were observed comparing vegetated sites in CSU and RS pastures with vegetated sites in CSR pastures. Bovine enterovirus was shed by an average of 24.3% of cows during the study period and was collected in the runoff of 8.3 and 16.7% of runoff simulations on bare sites in CSU pastures in June and October of 2008, respectively, and from 8.3% of runoff simulations on vegetated sites in CSU pastures in April 2009. Fecal pathogens (bovine coronavirus [BCV], bovine rotavirus group A, and Escherichia coli O157:H7) shed or detected in runoff were almost nonexistent; only BCV was detected in feces of one cow in August of 2008. Erosion of cut‐banks was the greatest contributor of sediment and P loading to the stream; contributions from surface runoff and grazing animals were considerably less and were minimized by grazing management practices that reduced congregation of cattle by pasture streams.","Schwarte, Kirk A.; Russell, James R.; Kovar, John L.; Morrical, Daniel G.; Ensley, Steven M.; Yoon, Kyoung‐Jin; Cornick, Nancy A.; Cho, Yong Il",J Environ Qual,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21712600/; https://doi.org/10.2134/jeq2010.0524,744
