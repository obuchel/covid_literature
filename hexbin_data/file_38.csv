47,47,47,Local public health workers' perceptions toward responding to an influenza pandemic,20.83702,1.0751432,2006-04-18,"BACKGROUND: Current national preparedness plans require local health departments to play an integral role in responding to an influenza pandemic, a major public health threat that the World Health Organization has described as ""inevitable and possibly imminent"". To understand local public health workers' perceptions toward pandemic influenza response, we surveyed 308 employees at three health departments in Maryland from March – July 2005, on factors that may influence their ability and willingness to report to duty in such an event. RESULTS: The data suggest that nearly half of the local health department workers are likely not to report to duty during a pandemic. The stated likelihood of reporting to duty was significantly greater for clinical (Multivariate OR: 2.5; CI 1.3–4.7) than technical and support staff, and perception of the importance of one's role in the agency's overall response was the single most influential factor associated with willingness to report (Multivariate OR: 9.5; CI 4.6–19.9). CONCLUSION: The perceived risk among public health workers was shown to be associated with several factors peripheral to the actual hazard of this event. These risk perception modifiers and the knowledge gaps identified serve as barriers to pandemic influenza response and must be specifically addressed to enable effective local public health response to this significant threat.","Balicer, Ran D; Omer, Saad B; Barnett, Daniel J; Everly, George S",BMC Public Health,38,30
509,509,509,We should not be complacent about our population-based public health response to the first influenza pandemic of the 21(st )century,20.795837,1.0856329,2011-02-03,"BACKGROUND: More than a year after an influenza pandemic was declared in June 2009, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic to be over. Evaluations of the pandemic response are beginning to appear in the public domain. DISCUSSION: We argue that, despite the enormous effort made to control the pandemic, it is now time to acknowledge that many of the population-based public health interventions may not have been well considered. Prior to the pandemic, there was limited scientific evidence to support border control measures. In particular no border screening measures would have detected prodromal or asymptomatic infections, and asymptomatic infections with pandemic influenza were common. School closures, when they were partial or of short duration, would not have interrupted spread of the virus in school-aged children, the group with the highest rate of infection worldwide. In most countries where they were available, neuraminidase inhibitors were not distributed quickly enough to have had an effect at the population level, although they will have benefited individuals, and prophylaxis within closed communities will have been effective. A pandemic specific vaccine will have protected the people who received it, although in most countries only a small minority was vaccinated, and often a small minority of those most at risk. The pandemic vaccine was generally not available early enough to have influenced the shape of the first pandemic wave and it is likely that any future pandemic vaccine manufactured using current technology will also be available too late, at least in one hemisphere. SUMMARY: Border screening, school closure, widespread anti-viral prophylaxis and a pandemic-specific vaccine were unlikely to have been effective during a pandemic which was less severe than anticipated in the pandemic plans of many countries. These were cornerstones of the population-based public health response. Similar responses would be even less likely to be effective in a more severe pandemic. We agree with the recommendation from the World Health Organisation that pandemic preparedness plans need review.","Kelly, Heath A; Priest, Patricia C; Mercer, Geoffry N; Dowse, Gary K",BMC Public Health,38,30
2719,2719,2719,"Avian influenza A/H7N9 risk perception, information trust and adoption of protective behaviours among poultry farmers in Jiangsu Province, China",20.571945,1.531162,2017-05-18,"BACKGROUND: Poultry farmers are at high-risk from avian influenza A/H7N9 infection due to sustained occupational exposures to live poultry. This study examined factors associated with poultry farmers’ adoption of personal protective behaviours (PPBs) based on Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). METHODS: Totally, 297 poultry farmers in three cities of Jiangsu Province, China were interviewed during November 2013-January 2014. Data on PMT constructs, perceived trustworthiness of A/H7N9 information from mass media (formal sources), friends and family (informal sources), intention to adopt and actual adoption of PPBs and respondents’ demographics were collected. Structural equation modeling (SEM) identified associations between demographic factors and PMT constructs associated with A/H7N9-oriented PPB intention. Moderated mediation analysis examined how demographics moderated the effects of information trust on PPB intention via risk perceptions of A/H7N9. RESULTS: Respondents generally perceived low vulnerability to A/H7N9 infection. The SEM found that male respondents perceived lower severity of (β = −0.23), and lower vulnerability to (β = -0.15) A/H7N9 infection; age was positively associated with both perceived personal vulnerability to (β = 0.21) and perceived self-efficacy (β = 0.24) in controlling A/H7N9; education was positively associated with perceived response efficacy (β = 0.40). Furthermore, perceived vulnerability (β = 0.16), perceived self-efficacy (β = 0.21) and response efficacy (β = 0.67) were positively associated with intention to adopt PPBs against A/H7N9. More trust in informal information (TII) was only significantly associated with greater PPB intention through its positive association with perceived response efficacy. Age significantly moderated the associations of TII with perceived Self-efficacy and perceived response efficacy, with younger farmers who had greater TII perceiving lower self-efficacy but higher response efficacy. CONCLUSION: Poultry farmers perceive A/H7N9 as a personally-irrelevant risk. Interventions designed to enhance perceived response efficacy, particularly among lower educated respondents may effectively motivate adoption of PPBs. Informal information may be an important resource for enhancing response efficacy.

3324,3324,3324,Where backyard poultry raisers seek care for sick poultry: implications for avian influenza prevention in Bangladesh,20.88573,1.1074299,2018-08-03,"BACKGROUND: In Bangladesh, backyard poultry raisers lack awareness of avian influenza and infrequently follow government recommendations for its prevention. Identifying where poultry raisers seek care for their ill poultry might help the government better plan how to disseminate avian influenza prevention and control recommendations. METHODS: In order to identify where backyard poultry raisers seek care for their ill poultry, we conducted in-depth and informal interviews: 70 with backyard poultry raisers and six with local poultry healthcare providers in two villages, and five with government veterinary professionals at the sub-district and union levels in two districts during June–August 2009. RESULTS: Most (86% [60/70]) raisers sought care for their backyard poultry locally, 14% used home remedies only and none sought care from government veterinary professionals. The local poultry care providers provided advice and medications (n = 6). Four local care providers had shops in the village market where raisers sought healthcare for their poultry and the remaining two visited rural households to provide poultry healthcare services. Five of the six local care providers did not have formal training in veterinary medicine. Local care providers either did not know about avian influenza or considered avian influenza to be a disease common among commercial but not backyard poultry. The government professionals had degrees in veterinary medicine and experience with avian influenza and its prevention. They had their offices at the sub-district or union level and lacked staffing to reach the backyard raisers at the village level. CONCLUSIONS: The local poultry care providers provided front line healthcare to backyard poultry in villages and were a potential source of information for the rural raisers. Integration of these local poultry care providers in the government’s avian influenza control programs is a potentially useful approach to increase poultry raisers’ and local poultry care providers’ awareness about avian influenza.","Rimi, Nadia Ali; Sultana, Rebeca; Ishtiak-Ahmed, Kazi; Haider, Najmul; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Nahar, Nazmun; Luby, Stephen P.",BMC Public Health,38,30
3836,3836,3836,Arab world’s growing contribution to global leishmaniasis research (1998–2017): a bibliometric study,20.796852,1.0891042,2019-05-22,"BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by a protozoan of the Leishmania genus, and is considered a neglected tropical disease. It still remains a main public health concern at global level and in Arab world mainly in low-income countries. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the Arab world’s growing contribution to global leishmaniasis research. METHODS: This study describes a bibliometric review of all leishmaniasis research publications published between January 1998 and December 2017 indexed on the Scopus database. RESULTS: The total number of publications published at global level was 17,570 papers, which achieves an average annual productivity of 878.50 papers publications. Brazil was responsible for the greatest output with the total number of publications of 3865 followed by the Unites States (n = 2729), India (n = 2119), the United Kingdom (n = 1363), and Spain (n = 1274). By limiting the analysis to the publications that have been published by Arab world, the research productivity was 993 papers, which represents 5.65% of total research output at global level in research regarding leishmaniasis. Tunisia was responsible for the greatest output from Arab world with the total number of publications of 297 followed by Sudan (n = 192), Saudi Arabia (n = 131), Morocco (n = 119) and Egypt (n = 67). Since 1998, the growth of publications on leishmaniasis fluctuates, overall showing a rising trend in both global and Arab world. There is a highly significant correlation between publication productivity related to leishmaniasis at global level and the Arab world (r = 0.936; p-value< 0.001). Leishmaniasis treatment, intracellular mechanism of infection, and lifecycle of leishmania are the major current hot topics for the research in this subject at global level and the Arab world. CONCLUSIONS: The current study presents a novel review of the current Arab leishmaniasis-related research, and how these results are related to worldwide output. In comparison to the global research output, the Arab world produced less leishmaniasis research. The data presented in the current study by this innovative approach may serve relevant researchers to direct the global leishmaniasis research to Arab counties in which leishmaniasis is endemic.","Al-Jabi, Samah W.",BMC Public Health,38,30

The presence of HIV infection further aggravates this scenario, requiring a reliable collection method, with better performance in the microbiological/molecular techniques to be used. We evaluated the performance of two methods for sample collection, mini bronchoalveolar lavage (Mini-BAL) and endotracheal aspirate (ETA), for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in critically ill patients. METHODS: This prospective study involved 26 HIV positive ICU internalized patients, with presumptive PTB who required mechanical ventilation. Two samples were obtained prospectively from 26 HIV ICU patients with presumptive PTB by Mini-BAL and ETA. The samples were processed for smear microscopy, Löwenstein-Jensen medium and the BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube 960 system®. We define as confirmed PTB patients with positive MTB culture. Furthermore, all samples obtained through the Mini-BAL were analyzed by Xpert® MTB/RIF. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the respiratory samples obtained by Mini-BAL were able to increase MTB detection in critically ill patients with presumptive PTB. The Mini-BAL allowed 30% increased recovery and guaranteed enough sample volume for processing in all methods. In addition, the larger volume of the samples obtained with this technique enabled the Xpert® MTB/RIF molecular test for diagnosis of TB. CONCLUSIONS: The Mini-BAL showed be an acceptable alternative to ETA in this population, since these critically ill and often-immunocompromised patients are more likely to develop complications related to invasive procedures.","Neves, Cynthia Pessoa; Costa, Allyson Guimarães; Safe, Izabella Picinin; de Souza Brito, Alexandra; Jesus, Jaquelane Silva; Kritski, Afranio Lineu; Lacerda, Marcus Vinicius Guimarães; Viveiros, Miguel; Cordeiro-Santos, Marcelo",BMC Infect Dis,38,30

In contrast, infection of SJL/J mice results in acute encephalitis, virus persistence, and immune-mediated demyelination. These experiments examined the role of T-cell subsets in the in vivo immune response to Theiler's virus in resistant C57BL/10SNJ mice. Depletion of T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed at CD3 (pan-T-cell marker), CD4(+) (class II-restricted) or CD8(+) (class I-restricted) T cells resulted in increased frequency of paralysis and death as a result of acute encephalitis. Neuropathologic studies 10 days after infection demonstrated prominent necrosis, primarily in the pyramidal layer of hippocampus and in the thalamus of mice depleted of T-cell subsets. In immunosuppressed and infected C57BL/10SNJ mice, analysis of spinal cord sections 35 days after infection demonstrated small demyelinated lesions relatively devoid of inflammatory cells even though virus antigen could be detected by immunocytochemistry. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are important in the resistance to infection with Theiler's virus in C57BL/10SNJ mice. However, subsequent spinal cord demyelination, to the extent observed in susceptible mice, depends on the presence of virus antigen persistence and a competent cellular immune response.","Rodriguez, Moses; Lindsley, Mark D.; Pierce, Mabel L.",Microb Pathog,38,30

The precise mechanisms by which this can occur are mostly unknown. Viruses have been implicated in this process, among other etiological factors, such as genetic predisposition and cytokine activity. Several ways have been proposed by which a viral infection might break tolerance to self and trigger an autoreactive cascade that ultimately leads to the destruction of a specific cell type or an entire organ. The process termed ‘molecular mimicry’ and the use of transgenic models in which viral and host genes can be manipulated to analyze their effects in causing autoimmunity have been particular focuses for research. For example, there is a transgenic murine model of virus-induced autoimmune disease, in which a known viral gene is selectively expressed as a self-antigen in β cells of the pancreas. In these mice, insulin-dependent diabetes develops after either a viral infection, the release of a cytokine such as IFN-γ, or the expression of the costimulatory molecule B7.1 in the islets of Langerhans. Recent studies using this model have contributed to the understanding of the pathogenesis of virus-induced autoimmune disease and have furthered the design and testing of novel immunotherapeutic approaches.","Herrath, Matthias G von; Oldstone, Michael BA",Curr Opin Immunol,38,5
9656,9656,9656,Forecasting the 2017/2018 seasonal influenza epidemic in England using multiple dynamic transmission models: a case study,20.669333,1.2166972,2020-04-15,"CpG dinucleotides are suppressed in the genomes of many vertebrate RNA viruses, including HIV-1. The cellular antiviral protein ZAP (zinc finger antiviral protein) binds CpGs and inhibits HIV-1 replication when CpGs are introduced into the viral genome. However, it is not known if ZAP-mediated restriction is the only mechanism driving CpG suppression. To determine how CpG dinucleotides affect HIV-1 replication, we increased their abundance in multiple regions of the viral genome and analyzed the effect on RNA expression, protein abundance, and infectious-virus production. We found that the antiviral effect of CpGs was not correlated with their abundance. Interestingly, CpGs inserted into some regions of the genome sensitize the virus to ZAP antiviral activity more efficiently than insertions into other regions, and this sensitivity can be modulated by interferon treatment or ZAP overexpression. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the virus to endogenous ZAP was correlated with its sensitivity to the ZAP cofactor KHNYN. Finally, we show that CpGs in some contexts can also inhibit HIV-1 replication by ZAP-independent mechanisms, and one of these is the activation of a cryptic splice site at the expense of a canonical splice site. Overall, we show that the location and sequence context of the CpG in the viral genome determines its antiviral activity. IMPORTANCE Some RNA virus genomes are suppressed in the nucleotide combination of a cytosine followed by a guanosine (CpG), indicating that they are detrimental to the virus. The antiviral protein ZAP binds viral RNA containing CpGs and prevents the virus from multiplying. However, it remains unknown how the number and position of CpGs in viral genomes affect restriction by ZAP and whether CpGs have other antiviral mechanisms. Importantly, manipulating the CpG content in viral genomes could help create new vaccines. HIV-1 shows marked CpG suppression, and by introducing CpGs into its genome, we show that ZAP efficiently targets a specific region of the viral genome, that the number of CpGs does not predict the magnitude of antiviral activity, and that CpGs can inhibit HIV-1 gene expression through a ZAP-independent mechanism. Overall, the position of CpGs in the HIV-1 genome determines the magnitude and mechanism through which they inhibit the virus.","Ficarelli, Mattia; Antzin-Anduetza, Irati; Hugh-White, Rupert; Firth, Andrew E.; Sertkaya, Helin; Wilson, Harry; Neil, Stuart J.

Consequently, many EDs are in a situation where the number of patients in the ED is temporarily beyond the capacity for which the ED is designed and resourced to manage―a phenomenon called Emergency Department (ED) crowding. ED crowding can impair the quality of care delivered to patients and lead to longer patient waiting times for ED doctor’s consult (time to provider) and admission to the hospital ward. In Singapore, total ED attendance at public hospitals has grown significantly, that is, roughly 5.57% per year between 2005 and 2016 and, therefore, emergency physicians have to cope with patient volumes above the safe workload. The purpose of this study is to create a virtual ED that closely maps the processes of a hospital-based ED in Singapore using system dynamics, that is, a computer simulation method, in order to visualize, simulate, and improve patient flows within the ED. Based on the simulation model (virtual ED), we analyze four policies: (i) co-location of primary care services within the ED, (ii) increase in the capacity of doctors, (iii) a more efficient patient transfer to inpatient hospital wards, and (iv) a combination of policies (i) to (iii). Among the tested policies, the co-location of primary care services has the largest impact on patients’ average length of stay (ALOS) in the ED. This implies that decanting non-emergency lower acuity patients from the ED to an adjacent primary care clinic significantly relieves the burden on ED operations. Generally, in Singapore, there is a tendency to strengthen primary care and to educate patients to see their general practitioners first in case of non-life threatening, acute illness.","Ansah, John Pastor; Ahmad, Salman; Lee, Lin Hui; Shen, Yuzeng; Ong, Marcus Eng Hock; Matchar, David Bruce; Schoenenberger, Lukas",PLoS One,38,30

However, few studies have focused on this association in immunocompetent children. This study explored the association between adenovirus viremia and adenovirus pneumonia severity in immunocompetent children. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational study of immunocompetent children with adenovirus pneumonia admitted to Shenzhen Children’s Hospital in Shenzhen, China. Pneumonia was classified as severe or mild based on the Chinese guideline for the classification of pneumonia severity. Serum samples from all the children included in the study were tested for adenovirus DNA with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and disease severity were compared between children with severe and mild pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 111 immunocompetent children with adenovirus pneumonia (60 severe, 51 mild) were included. The median age was 40 months, and 64 patients were male. Five patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, and two underwent endotracheal intubation. All patients were discharged after recovery or improvement.

Using a mouse retroviral model, we showed that mAbs induce protective immunity (vaccinal effects). Here, we investigated the role of natural killer (NK) cells on this effect. NK cells are effector cells that are crucial to control viral propagation upon mAb treatment. However, their immunomodulatory activity during antiviral mAb immunotherapies has been little studied. Our data reveal that the mAb treatment of infected mice preserves the functional activation of NK cells. Importantly, functional NK cells play an essential role in preventing immune dysfunction and inducing antiviral protective immunity upon mAb therapy. Thus, NK cell depletion in mAb-treated, viral-infected mice leads to the upregulation of molecules involved in immunosuppressive pathways (i.e., PD-1, PD-L1 and CD39) on dendritic cells and T cells. NK cell depletion also abrogates the vaccinal effects induced by mAb therapy. Our data also reveal a role for IFNγ-producing NK cells in the enhancement of the B-cell responses through the potentiation of the B-cell helper properties of neutrophils. These findings suggest that preserved NK cell functions and counts might be required for achieving mAb-induced protective immunity.

Altoida’s Digital Neuro Signature (DNS), a longitudinal cognitive test consisting of two active digital biomarker metrics, alleviates these limitations. By comparison to conventional neuropsychological assessments, DNS results in faster evaluations (10 min vs 45–120 min), and generates higher test-retest in intraindividual assessment, as well as higher accuracy at detecting abnormal cognition. This study comparatively evaluates the performance of Altoida’s DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments in intraindividual assessments of cognition and function by means of two semi-naturalistic observational experiments with 525 participants in laboratory and clinical settings. The results show that DNS is consistently more sensitive than conventional neuropsychological assessments at capturing longitudinal individual-level change, both with respect to intraindividual variability and dispersion (intraindividual variability across multiple tests), across three participant groups: healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease. Dispersion differences between DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments were more pronounced with more advanced disease stages, and DNS-intraindividual variability was able to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. These findings are instrumental for patient monitoring and management, remote clinical trial assessment, and timely interventions, and will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of Alzheimer’s disease.","Meier, Irene B.; Buegler, Max; Harms, Robbert; Seixas, Azizi; Çöltekin, Arzu; Tarnanas, Ioannis",NPJ Digit Med,38,30

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two protocols with different proportions and orders of mCIMT/BIT within combined intensive home-therapy in children with USCP (6–8 years old) with high bimanual functional performance, applied by the family. METHODS: The protocols were performed on 20 children with an average age of 7.12 years [standard deviation (SD): 0.70], allocated to two different combined therapies. The protocols were designed by 100 h of dose for 10 weeks: 80 h of mCIMT followed by 20 h of BIT (mCIMT-B group) and 80 h of BIT followed by 20 h of mCIMT (BIT-mCI group). Bimanual functional performance was measured with Assisting Hand Assessment Scale (AHA) and the affected upper limb-use experience with Children’s Hand-use Experience Questionnaire (CHEQ). Parent satisfaction and expectations with therapy were measured using a specific questionnaire. There were five assessment timepoints (week 0, week 4, week 8, week 10 and week 34). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant (p > 0.05) inter- and intra-group changes in the bimanual functional performance of both groups. The affected upper limb-use experience obtained significant changes in BIT-mCI group, with statistically significant differences in the pairwise comparisons between week 0–10 and week 4–10 (p = 0.028) for use of the affected hand and the use of the affected hand to grasp between week 4 and week 8 (p = 0.028). Grasp efficacy and discomfort acquired statistically significant differences only in the BIT-mCI group for pairwise comparisons week 0–week 10/week 4–week 10 (p = 0.035). Although task execution time compared with a typically developing child of the same age obtained statistically significant differences only in the group mCIMT-B for pairwise comparisons week 0–week 8 (p = 0.03), week 0–week 10 (p = 0.03), week 4–week 8 (p = 0.04) and week 4–week 10 (p = 0.03). Family satisfaction and expectations acquired an increase between week 0 and week 10 (p ⩽ 0.02). CONCLUSION: Applying 80 h of BIT for 8 weeks in children with high bimanual functional performance USCP (6–8 years old), executed at home with family involvement would be sufficient to obtain improvements in affected upper limb-use experience, without the need to use combined protocols of 100 h. However, no statistically significant increase in bimanual functional performance would be obtained, with the basal situation of the child being a factor to consider for the execution of mCIMT and BIT.

The “Cancer Hallmarks” comprise crucial biological properties that mediate the advancement of the disease and affect patient prognosis. These hallmarks have been proposed to overlap with essential features of the WH process. However, common hallmarks and proteins actively participating in both processes have yet to be described. In this work we identify 21 WH proteins strongly linked with solid tumors by integrated TCGA Pan-Cancer and multi-omics analyses. These proteins were associated with eight of the ten described cancer hallmarks, especially avoiding immune destruction. These results show that WH and cancer's common proteins are involved in the microenvironment modification of solid tissues and immune system regulation. This set of proteins, between WH and cancer, could represent key targets for developing therapies.","López-Cortés, Andrés; Abarca, Estefanía; Silva, Leonardo; Velastegui, Erick; León-Sosa, Ariana; Karolys, Germania; Cabrera, Francisco; Caicedo, Andrés",Sci Rep,38,23

In the data mining area, this task is known as Imprecise Classification. Decision Trees that use imprecise probabilities, also known as Credal Decision Trees (CDTs), have been adapted to this field. The adaptation proposed so far uses the Imprecise Dirichlet Model (IDM), a mathematical model of imprecise probabilities that assumes prior knowledge about the data, depending strongly on a hyperparameter. This strong dependence is solved with the Non-Parametric Predictive Inference Model (NPI-M), also based on imprecise probabilities. This model does not make any prior assumption of the data and does not have parameters. In this work, we propose a new adaptation of CDTs to Imprecise Classification based on the NPI-M. An experimental study carried out in this research shows that the adaptation with NPI-M has an equivalent performance than the one obtained with the adaptation based on the IDM with the best choice of the hyperparameter. Consequently, since the NPI-M is a non-parametric approach, it is concluded that the NPI-M is more appropriated than the IDM to be applied to the adaptation of CDTs to Imprecise Classification.","Moral, Serafín; Mantas, Carlos J.; Castellano, Javier G.; Abellán, Joaquín",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,38,28

Given the severity of this major outbreak and the importance of prevention and protection against the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the predictors of engaging in the preventive behaviours could potentially be of great practical importance as it could help us identify high-risk groups and take the necessary steps towards improving their health behaviour. As the health behavioural response of the Egyptian population during COVID-19 is unknown and the health belief model constructs can be used to explain health behaviour, this study was conducted to assess the preventive behaviours to COVID-19 and the associated role of health belief model constructs over three periods of time; at the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic then 4 weeks and10 weeks later. RESULTS: Perceived severity and benefits of health belief model constructs showed significant decrease in the 2(nd) interview, followed by an increase in the 3(rd) interview (P < 0.001). Perceived barriers showed a significant increase in the 2(nd) interview followed by a significant decrease in the 3(rd) interview (P < 0.001). Knowledge score was significantly lower at the start, then a surge happened in the next interview followed by a slight drop in the 3(rd) interview (P < 0.001). Preventive behaviours were significantly lower in the 2(nd) interview then significantly higher in the 3(rd) interview (P < 0.001). On the analysis of the factors associated with preventive behaviours using multivariate regression, the results determined age, high education, being a health care worker, perceived susceptibility, benefits, barriers and self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Perceptions of benefits could be increased by tailoring communication strategies to various groups, emphasizing how different people can engage in effective preventive behaviours. Policy makers should pay attention to lower-educated persons living in rural areas being a group with the least engagement in health-protective actions.","Barakat, Ayah M.; Kasemy, Zeinab A.",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,38,30

Unintentional weight loss (UWL) is experienced by patients across the cancer spectrum, but often goes unnoticed. Patient-centered weight tracking may be a useful early detection marker. Fifty patients were enrolled in a prospective patient-centered weight tracking trial. Patients received a scale and monetary compensation to participate. A reminder to measure and record weight was texted to participants for 26 consecutive weeks. Most patients were black (86.0%) and female (68.0%). The median age was 47 years (range: 22-84 years). Many participants had Medicaid (42.0%) and the median household income by home zip code was $31,046. After 26 weeks, 90% of patients had recorded at least one weight. Among all patients, 73.7% of all possible weights were recorded and the median response rate per patient was 92.3% (24 of 26 weights). There was no difference in the response rates during the first and second halves of the study (77.7% vs. 69.7%, P = 0.53). The range of weight change over the study period was 16.1% loss to 25.0% gain, with 56% of patients maintaining stable weight. Seven patients (14.0%) lost more than 5% weight and 11 patients (22.0%) gained over 5%. Of the seven patients with weight loss, two (4.0% of the cohort) were determined to have UWL. Patient-centered weight tracking is feasible and inexpensive, and has potential as an early detector of UWL. Further studies are needed to apply this strategy to detect underlying malignancies.","Hue, Jonathan J.; Markt, Sarah C.; Rao, Goutham; Winter, Jordan M.",J Cancer Prev,38,30

These unique characteristics make magnesium alloys important green metal materials for manufacturing, especially for the automotive and 3C products industries. The developing trends of these related industries can be recognized by forecasting the demand for magnesium alloys. This study develops grey prediction power models to forecast the demand for such a promising green metal material. Grey prediction is an appropriate technique because available data regarding the demand for magnesium alloys are not in line with any statistical assumptions. In particular, because outliers might cause a deterioration of forecasting performance, a robust nonlinear interval regression analysis with neural networks is applied to detect outliers by estimating data intervals. Then, a power model is applied to the newly generated non-equidistant data sequence without outliers. Residual modification is further considered here to improve the forecasting performance of the power model. The forecasting abilities of the proposed grey residual modification models are verified using actual magnesium alloy demand data. The experimental results for ex-post testing show that the mean absolute percentage errors of the proposed models that can work on non-equidistant data were minimal among all considered models.","Hu, Yi-Chung",Environ Dev Sustain,38,27

Poor glycemic control including hypoglycemia enhances complication rates and associated morbidity, mortality and costs. Consequently, this needs to be addressed. Whilst the majority of patients with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, a considerable number of patients with diabetes require insulin to help control their diabetes. Long-acting insulin analogues were developed to reduce hypoglycemia associated with insulin and help improve adherence, which can be a concern. However, their considerably higher costs have impacted on their funding and use, especially in countries with affordability issues. Biosimilars can help reduce the costs of long-acting insulin analogues thereby increasing available choices. However, the availability and use of long-acting insulin analogues can be affected by limited price reductions versus originators and limited demand-side initiatives to encourage their use. Consequently, we wanted to assess current utilisation rates for long-acting insulin analogues, especially biosimilars, and the rationale for patterns seen, across multiple Asian countries ranging from Japan (high-income) to Pakistan (lower-income) to inform future strategies. METHODOLOGY Multiple approaches including assessing utilization and prices of insulins including biosimilars among six Asian countries and comparing the findings especially with other middle-income countries. RESULTS Typically, there was increasing use of long-acting insulin analogues among the selected Asian countries. This was especially the case enhanced by biosimilars in Bangladesh, India, and Malaysia reflecting their perceived benefits. However, there was limited use in Pakistan due to issues of affordability similar to a number of African countries. The high use of biosimilars in Bangladesh, India and Malaysia was helped by issues of affordability and local production. The limited use of biosimilars in Japan and Korea reflects limited price reductions and demand-side initiatives similar to a number of European countries. CONCLUSIONS Increasing use of long-acting insulin analogues across countries is welcomed, adding to the range of insulins available, which increasingly includes biosimilars. A number of activities are needed to enhance the use of long-acting insulin analogue biosimilars in Japan, Korea and Pakistan.","Godman, Brian; Haque, Mainul; Kumar, Santosh; Islam, Salequl; Charan, Jaykaran; Akter, Farhana; Kurdi, Amanj; Allocati, Eleonora; Bakar, Muhammed Abu; Rahim, Sagir Abdur; Sultana, Nusrat; Deeba, Farzana; Halim Khan, M A; Alam, Abm Muksudul; Jahan, Iffat; Kamal, Zubair Mahmood; Hasin, Humaira; Munzur-E-Murshid,; Nahar, Shamsun; Haque, Monami; Dutta, Siddhartha; Abhayanand, Jha Pallavi; Kaur, Rimple Jeet; Acharya, Jitendra; Sugahara, Takuma; Kwon, Hye-Young; Bae, SeungJin; Khuan, Karen Koh Pek; Khan, Tanveer Ahmed; Hussain, Shahzad; Saleem, Zikria; Pisana, Alice; Wale, Janney; Jakovljevic, Mihajlo",Current medical research and opinion,38,16

Signals may be influenced by anesthetics when patients receive general anesthesia (GA). This study determined the inhibitory concentration of propofol on MER signals when it was coadministered with dexmedetomidine. METHODS Patients were anesthetized with dexmedetomidine (0.5 µg·kg loading, followed by infusion at 0.4 µg·kg·h) and propofol through target-controlled infusion for general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. The surgeon conducted the online scoring of the background signals, spiking frequency, amplitude, and pattern of single-unit activities by using a 0-10 verbal numerical rating scale (NRS; 0, maximal suppression; 10, minimal suppression), and responses were grouped into suppression (NRS ≤ 6) and nonsuppression (NRS > 6). The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of propofol (as target effect-site concentrations: Ceprop) was determined using modified Dixon's up-and-down method (UDM). Probit regression analysis was further used to obtain the dose-response relationship, and IC05 and IC95 were calculated. RESULTS Twenty-three adult patients participated in this study. Under the concomitant infusion of dexmedetomidine, the predicted IC50 value (95% confidence interval; CI) of Ceprop for neuronal suppression during MER was 1.29 (1.24-1.34) µg·mL as calculated using modified Dixon's UDM.

In this study, we conducted a review of recent discussions on data standards and interoperability with a focus on sharing PGx test results among health systems. Materials & methods: We conducted a literature search for PGx clinical decision support systems between 1 January 2012 and 31 January 2020. Thirty-two out of 727 articles were included for the final review. Results: Nine of the 32 articles mentioned data standards and only four of the 32 articles provided solutions for the lack of interoperability. Discussions: Although PGx interoperability is essential for widespread implementation, a lack of focus on standardized data creates a formidable challenge for health information exchange. Conclusion: Standardization of PGx data is essential to improve health information exchange and the sharing of PGx results between disparate systems. However, PGx data standards and interoperability are often not addressed in the system-level implementation.","Roosan, Don; Hwang, Angela; Law, Anandi V; Chok, Jay; Roosan, Moom R",Pharmacogenomics,38,16

This study aimed at clarifying the mechanisms underlying TLR3 triggered exacerbation of experimental allergic asthma. The TLR3 ligand poly(inosinic-cytidylic) acid was applied intranasally to mice with already established experimental allergic asthma. Airway inflammation, cytokine expression, mucus production, and airway reactivity was assessed in wild-type, IL-17A, or IL-23p19-deficient, and in NK cell-depleted mice. Local application of poly(inosinic-cytidylic) acid exacerbated experimental allergic asthma in mice as characterized by enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines, aggravated airway inflammation, and increased mucus production together with pronounced airway hyperresponsiveness. This was further associated with augmented production of IL-17 by Th17 cells and NK cells. Whereas experimental exacerbation could be induced in IL-23p19-deficient mice lacking mature, proinflammatory Th17 cells, this was not possible in mice lacking IL-17A or in NK cell-depleted animals. These experiments indicate a central role for IL-17 derived from NK cells but not from Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of virus-triggered exacerbation of experimental asthma.","Lunding, Lars P; Webering, Sina; Vock, Christina; Behrends, Jochen; Wagner, Christina; Hölscher, Christoph; Fehrenbach, Heinz; Wegmann, Michael",Journal of immunology,38,16

The evaluation of tumor progression and therapeutic responses is currently based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST) criteria. As for other malignancies, RECIST criteria are being reexamined for NETs in the era of targeted therapies because tumor response to targeted therapies is rarely associated with shrinkage, as opposed to prolonged progression-free survival. Therefore, size-based criteria no longer seem to be suitable to the assessment of NET progression and therapeutic responses, especially considering targeted therapies. New imaging criteria, combining morphological and functional techniques, have proven relevant for other malignancies treated with targeted therapies. To date, such studies have rarely been conducted on NETs.

Unlike most developed countries, Nigeria does not yet have an established national system to monitor the occurrence of this infection. This meta-analysis was thus designed to determine the pooled cumulative incidence of SSIs and various determinants of its occurrence in Nigeria. Methods The electronic databases were systematically searched for articles reporting the occurrence and risk factors associated with SSIs in Nigeria from January 2000 to December 2018. The eligible articles were evaluated using a set of pre-defined criteria. The extracted data were analysed using the comprehensive meta-analysis software. The Begg and Egger's regression tests were used to assess the risk of bias of the included publications. Results Thirty-two articles emanating from the six geopolitical regions of Nigeria were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled cumulative incidence of SSIs was 14.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.113-0.184) with the highest incidence reported in the north-eastern region (27.3%, 95% CI: 0.132-0.481) of the country. It was also found to occur more predominantly following colorectal and abdominal surgeries, among elderly patients and in patients with co-morbid conditions. The most frequently reported was the superficial incisional SSIs occurring in 62.5% (95% CI: 0.333-0.848). Higher preponderance was also observed among patients with dirty wounds (52.7%, 95% CI: 0.367-0.682). Conclusion This meta-analysis documents for the first time the national burden of SSIs in Nigeria. Control measures geared towards its reduction should be strengthened and a national policy on SSI surveillance, prevention and control developed.","Olowo-Okere, Ahmed; Ibrahim, Yakubu Kokori Enevene; Olayinka, Busayo Olalekan; Ehinmidu, Joseph Olorunmola",The Nigerian postgraduate medical journal,38,10

METHODS Using anonymized, routinely collected, health care data in Wales, UK, we performed a retrospective matched cohort study (2003-2017) of adults with epilepsy prescribed an antiepileptic drug. Controls were matched with replacement on age, gender, deprivation quintile, and year of entry into the study. Participants were followed to the end of the study for the occurrence of a major cardiovascular event, and survival models were constructed to compare the time to a major cardiovascular event (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemic heart disease, clinically significant arrhythmia, thromboembolism, onset of heart failure, or a cardiovascular death) for individuals in the case group versus the control group. RESULTS There were 10 241 cases (mean age = 49.6 years, 52.2% male, mean follow-up = 6.1 years) matched to 35 145 controls. A total of 3180 (31.1%) cases received enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, and 7061 (68.9%) received non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. Cases had an increased risk of experiencing a major cardiovascular event compared to controls (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.51-1.63, p < .001). There was no notable difference in major cardiovascular events between those treated with enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs and those treated with non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (adjusted hazard ratio = .95, 95% CI = .86-1.05, p = .300). SIGNIFICANCE Individuals with epilepsy prescribed antiepileptic drugs are at an increased risk of major cardiovascular events compared with population controls. Being prescribed an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug is not associated with a greater risk of a major cardiovascular event compared to treatment with other antiepileptic drugs.

All primary hyperparathyroidism patients were managed remotely, being discharged, or with telephone follow-up. The majority of routine referrals were managed without the need for face-to-face consultation. CONCLUSION Vertigo patients and 2-week-wait throat symptom patients should be offered a face-to-face consultation in the first instance. For patients with neck or face lumps, initial referral for imaging may improve patient flow and facilitate safe discharge. It is appropriate to continue with telephone consultations for all other patient groups.","Sargsyan, Narek; Karunaratne, Dilhara; Masani, Alisha; Howell, Lauren; Yousif, Madi","Ear, nose, & throat journal",38,1

CHs are benign vascular tumors whose most common manifestations are dermal and mucous and mainly occur during childhood or adolescence, while the involvement of the central nervous system can occur in a wider age range. We conducted a PubMed research on literature published until March 2020. We only enrolled cases with histological documented presence of intracranial CH. For every case collected, we analyzed age, sex, localization, neuroimaging studies performed, the presence of extracranial CHs, symptoms, neurological deficits, extent of surgical resection (biopsy, partial or gross total), adjunct treatment received (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, Trans-Arterial Embolization TAE), and outcome. Up to March 2020, the literature review identified 52 cases to which we added the case of our personal experience. The mean age was 26 with slightly female prevalence (28 F, 25 M). The most common presenting symptom was headache (21 cases, 40%). The surgical treatment consisted of biopsy in 7 cases (13%), partial resection in 10 cases (19%), gross total resection in 31 cases (58.5%), biopsy followed by total resection in 2 cases (3%), and partial resection followed by total resection in 1 case (1.5%), and the diagnosis was obtained from an autopsy sample in 1 case (1.5%). For symptomatic lesions, surgery is a valid option to obtain histological characterization, neurological improvement, and where possible a total resection. Stereotactic radiotherapy can be used if the lesion is not surgically approachable or as an adjuvant treatment in case of partial resection, having shown good results in terms of long-term disease control.","Santoro, Giorgio; Piccirilli, Manolo; Chiarella, Vito; Greco, Nicoletta; Berra, Luigi Valentino; Santoro, Antonio",Neurosurgical review,38,1

In this study, sediment cores were sampled from the most eutrophic Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu, and three treatments were set up in a laboratory incubation experiment, involving (a) the non-treated sediment cores, (b) inoculation, and (c) sterilization. The dissolved and labile iron (Fe) and P were obtained by high-resolution dialysis and the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique, respectively. AgI-based DGT was used for measuring the 2D distribution of labile sulfide. The bacterial community was investigated using a scanning electron microscope and 16S rRNA high throughput sequencing technique. The results showed that sterilization reduced the capacity of sediment to immobilize P, and that the critical sediment depth layer for microbial P sequestration was 0-10 mm. In addition, sterilization or inoculation significantly changes the structure of bacterial communities. Fe or S oxidation under micro-aerobic or anaerobic conditions played an important role in bacterial retention of P in the sediments. Nitrate-reducing coupling Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (Acidovorax) in the inoculated sediment and electrogenic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Candidatus Electronema) in the non-treated sediment were identified as the key bacterial genera responsible for the retention of P in sediments. This implies that bacterial communities could quickly establish the ability for negative feedback regulation by inoculation once the function and structure of indigenous sediment bacteria are seriously impaired, although this needs further validation in the field.","Fan, Xianfang; Xing, Xigang; Ding, Shiming",The Science of the total environment,38,1

Hand hygiene (> 98%) and always wearing a mask when leaving home (> 96%) were almost universal habits. Greater adherence to social isolation was observed among women with multimorbidity when compared to men (PR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.23-1.79). This adherence increased proportionally with age and inversely with the level of education. The protective behavior in people with multimorbidity seems to be greater in relation to the others, although issues related to social isolation and health care deserve to be highlighted. These findings can be useful in customizing strategies for coping with the current pandemic.","Batista, Sandro Rodrigues; Souza, Ana Sara Semeão de; Nogueira, Januse; Andrade, Fabíola Bof de; Thumé, Elaine; Teixeira, Doralice Severo da Cruz; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Facchini, Luiz Augusto; Nunes, Bruno Pereira",Cadernos de saude publica,38,1

In vivo ocular feasibility and pharmacokinetics after intravitreal and suprachoroidal administration in rabbit eyes are compared against intravitreal administration of a DEX solution (1 mg/ml). Thirty rabbit eyes were injected with the DEX/LAP formulation (15 suprachoroid / 15 intravitreous). Ophthalmological signs were monitored at day 1 and at weeks 1-4-12-24 post-administration. Three eyes per sample time point were used to quantify DEX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The ocular tissues' pharmacokinetic parameters (lens, vitreous humour, choroid-retina unit and sclera) were studied. DEX/LAP was well tolerated under both administration methods. Peak intraocular DEX levels from the DEX/LAP were detected in the vitreous humour after both deliveries soon after administration. The vitreous area under the curve was significantly greater after both DEX/LAP deliveries (intravitreal: 205968.47; suprachoroidal: 11442.22 ng/g*day) than after intravitreal administration of the DEX solution (317.17 ng/g*day). Intravitreal DEX/LAP delivery extended higher vitreous DEX levels up to week 24 (466.32 ± 311.15 ng/g). With suprachoroidal delivery, DEX levels were detectable in the choroid-retina unit (12.04 ± 20.85 ng/g) and sclera (25.46 ± 44.09 ng/g) up to week 24. This study demonstrated the intraocular feasibility of both suprachoroidal and intravitreal administration of the DEX/LAP formulation. The Laponite increased the intraocular retention time of dexamethasone when compared with conventional solutions. DEX/LAP could be considered a biocompatible and useful sustained-release formulation for treating posterior-pole eye diseases.","Prieto, Esther; Cardiel, Maria Jose; Vispe, Eugenio; Idoipe, Miriam; Garcia-Martin, Elena; Fraile, Jose Maria; Polo, Vicente; Mayoral, Jose Antonio; Pablo, Luis Emilio; Rodrigo, Maria Jesus",Biomedical materials,38,1

We have retrospectively compared the effectiveness and safety of these approaches in patients with non-severe splenomegaly scheduled for elective total LS. METHODS Patients with surgical spleen disorders scheduled for elective LS between March 2005 and June 2011 underwent laparoscopic splenic mobilization via the posterolateral or anterior approach. Main outcome measures included operation time, intraoperative blood loss, frequency of postoperative pancreatic leakage, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS During the study period, 203 patients underwent LS, 58 (28.6%) via the posterolateral and 145 (71.4%) via the anterior approach. Three patients (1.5%) required conversion to laparotomy due to extensive perisplenic adhesions. The posterolateral approach was associated with significantly shorter operation time (65.0 ± 12.3 min vs. 95.0 ± 21.3 min, P < 0.01), reduced intraoperative blood loss (200.0 ± 23.4 mL vs. 350.0 ± 45.2 mL, P < 0.01), and shorter hospital stay (5.0 ± 2.0 d vs. 9.0 ± 3.0 d, P < 0.01) than the anterior approach. The frequency of pancreatic leakage was slightly lower in patients undergoing LS via the posterolateral than the anterior approach (0.0% vs. 3.4%, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The posterolateral approach is more effective and safer than the anterior approach in patients without severe splenomegaly (< 30 cm).","Ji, Bai; Wang, Yingchao; Zhang, Ping; Wang, Guangyi; Liu, Yahui",International journal of medical sciences,38,1

However, accumulated facts dispute this version of events. The first infected patient appeared in September in the United States, in December - in France. in November-December pneumonia of similar severity raged in Russia. It is difficult to explain numerous outbreaks of simultaneous contagions in isolated staffs, including military garrisons. In most of healthy adults' antibodies to coronavirus are found. The most of infected patients have no symptoms of disease. To explain these paradoxes ecological hypothesis is proposed - humanity and coronaviruses have been interacting evolutionarily for thousands years in system of biogeocenosis, periodically confronting under influence of cyclical ecological processes. The purpose of study is to investigate relationship between mortality of acute out-of-hospital pneumonia, coronavirus ones included, and cyclical fluctuations of environmental conditions. The primary material was obtained from data of Rosstat, international information bases, results of scientific studies. The classic methods of medical statistics were applied. The summer solstice (June) was used as reference point for estimating dynamics of monthly mortality in 2015-2020. The analysis of dynamics of mortality of pneumonia averaged for 2015-2020 revealed three epidemic waves with peaks in October, January, and March. Such cyclical pattern was consistently reproduced for particular years in 2015-2020. The first wave always was the lowest one. When the second wave exceeds the third one, increase in mortality in February and March was the smallest one. The greatest epidemic losses were established at the plateau. In 2020, the rate of coronavirus infection in the world coincides with the established cyclicity. The stable reproducibility of three peaks of mortality in same months testifies their regular character. The cause of all this may be the cyclicity of ecological interactions between coronaviruses and human population.","Gundarov, I A","Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",38,15

The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the early results of endoscopic nipple-sparing mastectomy (E-NSM) and to investigate the safety of this procedure. METHODS Between January 2002 and December 2005, a total of 87 patients with breast cancer but without skin and nipple involvement, including two cases of bilateral breast cancer, underwent E-NSM. In case of bloody nipple discharge and suspicious extension near the nipple as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, the major ducts within the nipple were cored (nipple coring). In other cases, nipple coring was not performed. RESULTS Of the 89 breasts in 87 patients, 42 had tumors of >2 cm and 80 were diagnosed as having invasive carcinoma. Lymph node involvement was observed in 36 procedures. The overall rate of nipple necrosis was 18% (16 of 89). The rate of nipple necrosis among the procedures with nipple coring was statistically higher than that among those without nipple coring (7 of 17, 41%, vs. 9 of 72, 13%) (P = .01). Nipple involvement was observed in 2.2% (2 of 89). After a median follow-up period of 52 months, distant metastasis was observed in nine cases; no local recurrences occurred in this series. CONCLUSIONS E-NSM is an oncologically safe procedure and an acceptable method in selected patients requiring a mastectomy. The higher rate of nipple necrosis may have been the result of a technical problem, indicating the need for continued improvement in nipple coring procedures.","Sakamoto, Naomi; Fukuma, Eisuke; Higa, Kuniki; Ozaki, Shinji; Sakamoto, Masaaki; Abe, Satoko; Kurihara, Terumasa; Tozaki, Mitsuhiro",Annals of surgical oncology,38,25

Although postpartum family planning (PPFP) is an increasingly high priority for many countries, uptake and need for PPFP varies in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize postpartum contraceptive use, and predictors and barriers to use, among postpartum women in LMIC. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Global Health databases were searched for articles and abstracts published between January 1997 and May 2018. Studies with data on contraceptive uptake through 12 months postpartum in low- and middle-income countries were included. We used random-effects models to compute pooled estimates and confidence intervals of modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR), fertility intentions (birth spacing and birth limiting), and unmet need for contraception in the postpartum period. RESULTS Among 669 studies identified, 90 were selected for full-text review, and 35 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were from East Africa, West Africa, and South Asia/South East Asia. The overall pooled mCPR during the postpartum period across all regions was 41.2% (95% CI: 15.7-69.1%), with lower pooled mCPR in West Africa (36.3%; 95% CI: 27.0-45.5%). The pooled prevalence of unmet need was 48.5% (95% CI: 19.1-78.0%) across all regions, and highest in South Asia/South East Asia (59.4, 95% CI: 53.4-65.4%). Perceptions of low pregnancy risk due to breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea were commonly associated with lack of contraceptive use and use of male condoms, withdrawal, and abstinence. Women who were not using contraception were also less likely to utilize maternal and child health (MCH) services and reside in urban settings, and be more likely to have a fear of method side effects and receive inadequate FP counseling. In contrast, women who received FP counseling in antenatal and/or postnatal care were more likely to use PPFP. CONCLUSIONS PPFP use is low and unmet need for contraception following pregnancy in LMIC is high. Tailored counseling approaches may help overcome misconceptions and meet heterogeneous needs for PPFP.","Dev, Rubee; Kohler, Pamela; Feder, Molly; Unger, Jennifer A; Woods, Nancy F; Drake, Alison L",Reproductive health,38,17

We previously reported the directed differentiation of human PSCs into epidermal stem and progenitor cells (ESPCs) and 3D epidermis to model the inherited syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA), wherein epidermal cell-junctional defects discovered using this system were validated in patient populations. Here, we describe in detail the corresponding protocol for generating PSC-derived keratinocytes using a distinct, normal PSC line (209.2 PSC). METHODS AND RESULTS Our approach modifies previous protocols to minimize spontaneous cell death and terminal differentiation, eliminate cell stress-inducing keratinocyte selection steps, and reduce total protocol duration and cost. Independent donor-derived PSC lines were converted into ESPCs through the addition of relevant morphogens and a ROCK inhibitor. Results for the 209.2 PSC line highlight consistencies in 2D and also variable features in 3D epidermis compared to the previously published FA-PSC lines. 209.2 PSC-derived ESPCs exhibited a basal cell phenotype while maintaining the capacity to form epidermal organotypic rafts with morphology consistent with fetal epidermis. Transcriptional analyses demonstrated 209.2 ESPCs express epidermis-selective markers and not early endoderm markers, thus supporting an immature stage of p63+ epidermal development. CONCLUSIONS This protocol provides an accelerated path for the generation of human ESPCs and 3D epidermal models to study normal epidermal development and homeostasis, elucidate mechanisms of epidermal disease pathogenesis, and provides a platform for developing personalized therapies.","Ruiz-Torres, Sonya; Lambert, Paul F; Wikenheiser-Brokamp, Kathryn A; Wells, Susanne I",Molecular biology reports,38,31

However, relationships between dam and calf microbial ecosystems are still unclear. The objectives of this study were to (1) characterize the various maternal and calf microbiomes during peri-partum and post-partum periods and (2) examine the influence of the maternal microbiome on calf fecal microbiome composition during the pre-weaning phase. Multiparous Holstein cows were placed in individual, freshly bedded box stalls 14 d before expected calving. Caudal vaginal fluid samples were collected approximately 24 h before calving and dam fecal, oral, colostrum, and placenta samples were collected immediately after calving. Calf fecal samples were collected at birth (meconium) and 24 h, 7 d, 42 d, and 60 d of age. Amplicons covering V4 16S rDNA regions were generated using DNA extracted from all samples and were sequenced using 300 bp paired end Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Spearman rank correlations were performed between genera in maternal and calf fecal microbiomes. Negative binomial regression models were created for genera in calf fecal samples at each time point using genera in maternal microbiomes. We determined that Bacteroidetes dominated the calf fecal microbiome at all time points (relative abundance ≥42.55%) except for 24 h post-calving, whereas Proteobacteria were the dominant phylum (relative abundance = 85.10%). Maternal fecal, oral, placental, vaginal, and colostrum microbiomes were significant predictors of calf fecal microbiome throughout pre-weaning. Results indicate that calf fecal microbiome inoculation and development may be derived from various maternal sources. Maternal microbiomes could be used to predict calf microbiome development, but further research on the environmental and genetic influences is needed.","Owens, Connor E; Huffard, Haley G; Nin-Velez, Alexandra I; Duncan, Jane; Teets, Chrissy L; Daniels, Kristy M; Ealy, Alan D; James, Robert E; Knowlton, Katharine F; Cockrum, Rebecca R",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,38,16

However, vaccine efficacy and direct effectiveness estimates have varied, with differences in study design, location, follow-up duration, and vaccine composition posing challenges for public health decision making. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to generate average estimates of kOCV efficacy and direct effectiveness from the available literature. METHODS For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Review Library on July 9, 2016, and ISI Web of Science on July 11, 2016, for randomised controlled trials and observational studies that reported estimates of direct protection against medically attended confirmed cholera conferred by kOCVs. We included studies published on any date in English, Spanish, French, or Chinese. We extracted from the published reports the primary efficacy and effectiveness estimates from each study and also estimates according to number of vaccine doses, duration, and age group. The main study outcome was average efficacy and direct effectiveness of two kOCV doses, which we estimated with random-effect models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016048232. FINDINGS Seven trials (with 695 patients with cholera) and six observational studies (217 patients with cholera) met the inclusion criteria, with an average two-dose efficacy of 58% (95% CI 42-69, I2=58%) and effectiveness of 76% (62-85, I2=0). Average two-dose efficacy in children younger than 5 years (30% [95% CI 15-42], I2=0%) was lower than in those 5 years or older (64% [58-70], I2=0%; p<0·0001). Two-dose efficacy estimates of kOCV were similar during the first 2 years after vaccination, with estimates of 56% (95% CI 42-66, I2=45%) in the first year and 59% (49-67, I2=0) in the second year. The efficacy reduced to 39% (13 to 57, I2=48%) in the third year, and 26% (-46 to 63, I2=74%) in the fourth year.

Insights for future response and recovery based on examination of various existing frameworks.,20.48381,1.0733676,2019,"PURPOSE Kupffer cells (KCs), the liver resident macrophages, are important mediators of tissue homeostasis and pathogen clearance. However, depending on the inflammatory stimuli, KCs have been involved in divergent hepato-protective or hepato-destructive immune responses. The versatility of KCs in response to environmental triggers, in combination with the specific biomarkers they express, make these macrophages attractive in vivo targets for non-invasive monitoring of liver inflammation or pathogenicity. This study aims to determine whether V-set and Ig domain-containing 4 (Vsig4) and C-type lectin domain family (Clec) 4, member F (Clec4F) can be used as imaging biomarkers for non-invasive monitoring of KCs during distinct liver inflammation models. PROCEDURE Flow cytometry (FACS), immuno-histochemistry (IHC), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Tc-99m labeled anti-Vsig4 or anti-Clec4F nanobodies (Nbs) was performed to evaluate in mice KC dynamics in concanavalin A (ConA)-induced hepatitis and in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis induced via methionine choline deficiency (MCD). RESULTS In homeostatic mice, Nbs targeting Clec4F were found to accumulate and co-localize with Vsig4-targeting Nbs only in the liver. Upon induction of acute hepatitis using ConA, down-regulation of the in vivo Nb imaging signal was observed, reflecting reduction in KC numbers as confirmed by FACS and IHC. On the other hand, induction of steatohepatitis resulted in higher signals in the liver corresponding to higher density of KCs.

Clinical data on patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are still scarce. METHODS This multicentre cohort study evaluated risk factors for morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in people living with HIV (PLWH), infected with SARS-CoV-2 in three countries in different clinical settings. COVID-19 was clinically classified as to be mild-to-moderate or severe. RESULTS Of 175 patients, 49 (28%) had severe COVID-19 and 7 (4%) patients died. Almost all patients were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and in 94%, HIV RNA was below 50 copies/mL prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. In the univariate analysis, an age 50 years or older, a CD4+ T cell nadir of < 200/µl, current CD4+ T cells < 350/µl and the presence of at least one comorbidity were significantly associated with severity of COVID-19. No significant association was found for gender, ethnicity, obesity, a detectable HIV RNA, a prior AIDS-defining illness, or tenofovir (which was mainly given as alafenamide) or protease inhibitor use in the current ART. In a multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with risk for severe COVID-19 was a current CD4+ T cell count of < 350/µl (adjusted odds ratio 2.85, 95% confidence interval 1.26-6.44, p=0.01). The only factor associated with mortality was a low CD4 T cell nadir. CONCLUSIONS In PLWH, immune deficiency is a possible risk factor for severe COVID-19, even in the setting of virological suppression. There is no evidence for a protective effect of PIs or tenofovir alafenamide.","Hoffmann, Christian; Casado, José L; Härter, Georg; Vizcarra, Pilar; Moreno, Ana; Cattaneo, Dario; Meraviglia, Paola; Spinner, Christoph D; Schabaz, Farhad; Grunwald, Stephan; Gervasoni, Cristina",HIV medicine,38,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 92 consecutive patients underwent extraperitoneal LRP for prostate cancer. In the first 47 patients, the running UVA was performed using 3-0 monofilament polyglecaprone (Monocryl®) suture (Group 1). In the subsequent 45 patients, the running UVA was performed with the 3-0 barbed suture (V-Loc® 180) (Group 2). Rhabdosphincter reconstruction was performed in all the patients. RESULTS The mean prostatectomy time was 196 and 179 minutes in Group 1 and 2, respectively (p < 0.001). Moreover, the mean UVA time was 40 and 24 minutes in Group 1 and 2, respectively (p < 0.001). Also, catheterization time, lenght of hospital stay and the number of the patients with urine leakage were significantly lower in Group 2 than the other (p < 0.001). No patients in V-Loc® 180 suture group and 5 patients in Monocryl® suture group experienced postoperative drain leakage in the present study. Overall pad usage at 6th month was higher in group 1 than the other group. In group 1 and 2, 78.7% and 93.3% of the patients reported 0 to 1 pads daily, whereas 21.3% and 6.7% reported ≥ 2 pads daily (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS We therefore consider that use of barbed suture running UVA during LRP is associated with a significantly shorter operative time maintaining a proper suturing tension compared with standard suture and it is not associated with a higher incidence of adverse events with no postoperative complications.","Arslan, Murat; Tuncel, Altug; Aslan, Yilmaz; Kozacioglu, Zafer; Gunlusoy, Bulent; Atan, Ali","Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",38,17

Disorder of consciousness (DOC) due to severe acquired brain injury is a condition needing neurorehabilitation and the role of relatives is essential, hence besides physical ""disconnection"" digital ""re-connection"" is crucial. We aimed to assess whether digital communication benefits in patients with DOC, considering the sensorial and emotional deprivation due to the COVID-19 emergency lock-down.Methods: For eleven consecutive patients with DOC admitted to our Intensive Neurorehabilitation Care (mean age: 45; females: 9), two observers registered neurobehavioral changes during a video-calls with their relatives. Heart-rate variability was measured before and during the calls. The video-call was performed by using two displays of different sizes: tablet (T-video-call) and large screen (LS-Video-call).Results: The video-calls impacted on the patients' vigilance and in the relationship with relatives. Moreover, positively impacted on their relatives. The current results showed significant greater impact on patients during the LS-video-call than when they are exposed to T-video-call.Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, besides the physical disconnection to stop the contagion spread, a ""digital re-connection"" is needed for all and especially for fragile population groups as patients with DOC.","Padua, Luca; Fredda, Giulia; Coraci, Daniele; Reale, Giuseppe; Glorioso, Davide; Loreti, Claudia; Pecchioli, Cristiano; Bernabei, Roberto",Brain injury,38,24

The aim of this study is to determine whether stage at diagnosis and survival differ between sporadic, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease(CD) related CRC. METHOD The English National Cancer Registry (NCIN), Hospital Episode Statistics(HES) and Office for National Statistics(ONS) datasets between 2000-2010 were linked, providing data on co-morbidities, stage and date of death. A logistic regression model determined whether IBD was associated with an early(I/II) or late (III/IV)cancer. Cox regression analysis was used to examine survival differences between sporadic, UC and CD. RESULTS A total of 234009 patients with CRC were included, of which 985(0.4%) and 1,922(0.8%) had CD and UC respectively. UC, but not CD, was associated with an earlier stage compared with sporadic cancers (OR 0.88 CI 0.79-0.98 p=0.02). CD had a significantly worse survival compared with sporadic patients for stage II(HR=1.71, CI 1.26-2.31 p<0.005) and III(1.53, CI 1.20-1.96 p<0.005) cancer. UC patients were associated with worse survival compared with the sporadic group for both stage III(1.38, CI 1.17-1.63 p<0.0005)and IV(1.13, CI 1.01-1.28 p=0.04)cancer. After excluding sporadic patients, UC was associated with improved survival compared with CD(0.62, CI 0.43-0.90 p=0.01) for stage II cancer. CONCLUSION Patients with IBD are diagnosed at an earlier stage but tend to have a worse survival compared with sporadic cases of CRC, in particular for nodal disease(stage III).Specifically, patients with CD related CRC appear to fare worst in terms of survival compared with both the sporadic and UC group.","Arhi, Chanpreet; Askari, Alan; Nachiappan, Subrmanian; Bottle, Alex; Arebi, Naila; Athanasiou, Antonios; Ziprin, Paul; Aylin, Paul; Faiz, Omar",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,38,10

It consists of treating the oscillating envelope of amplitude-modulated, spatially-incoherent light as if it were itself an optical wave, akin to the oscillations of the underlying electromagnetic field. This resemblance enables traditional optical imaging strategies, e.g., lenses, to be applied to NLoS imaging tasks. To date, however, this ability has only been applied computationally. In this paper, we provide a rigorous mathematical demonstration that P-field imaging can be performed with physical optics, viz., that ordinary lenses can focus or project P fields through intervening diffusers-despite these diffusers' broadly dispersing the light passing through them-and that they can image scenes hidden by such diffusers. Hence NLoS imaging might be carried out via P-field physical optics without the nontrivial computational burden of prior NLoS techniques.","Dove, Justin; Shapiro, Jeffrey H",Optics express,38,5

A meta-analysis was conducted using the generic inverse variance method. Heterogeneity between studies was investigated using the Cochrane's Q test and I2 statistic. RESULTS Four studies were included in final analysis including a total of 950 patients, and 105 (11%) patients died. Baseline NT-proBNP concentrations were significantly higher in nonsurvivors (median 2240 pg/mL, range 1678-16 347 pg/mL) when compared to survivors (665 pg/mL, 328-1252 pg/mL).

Given that ACE2, the entry receptor for the causative coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in multiple extrapulmonary tissues, direct viral tissue damage is a plausible mechanism of injury. In addition, endothelial damage and thromboinflammation, dysregulation of immune responses, and maladaptation of ACE2-related pathways might all contribute to these extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.

The dominant cell population producing them are plasma cells within the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract, but many IgA-producing cells are also found in the airways, within mammary tissues, the urogenital tract and inside the bone marrow. Most IgA antibodies are transported into the lumen by epithelial cells as part of the mucosal secretions, but they are also present in serum and other body fluids. A large part of the commensal microbiota in the gut is covered with IgA antibodies, and it has been demonstrated that this plays a role in maintaining a healthy balance between the host and the bacteria. However, IgA antibodies also play important roles in neutralizing pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract and the upper airways. The distinction between the two roles of IgA - protective and balance-maintaining - not only has implications on function but also on how the production is regulated.

METHODS From 2006 to 2011, 7 consecutive symptomatic patients (4 men; mean age 52 years) with surgically inaccessible extracranial ICA aneurysms were treated with a bare stent at a single center. Patients received clopidogrel for 3 months after the procedure and aspirin for life. Clinical follow-up with duplex ultrasound and/or computed tomographic angiography was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. RESULTS All procedures were technically successful; no neurological complications occurred. After 6 months, there was complete thrombosis of the aneurysm in all except one case. In this asymptomatic patient, the residual active flow was successfully obliterated by additional coil embolization. Over a mean follow-up of 57 ± 22 months, all patients were alive and free of local or central neurological symptoms. All stents were patent, and thrombosis of the aneurysms was complete.

In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to compare the efficacy and safety outcomes of intravenous tenecteplase to intravenous alteplase administration for acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs). METHODS We searched MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) and Scopus for published randomized controlled clinical trials providing outcomes of acute ischemic stroke with confirmed LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with either tenecteplase at different doses or alteplase at a standard dose of 0.9 mg/kg. The primary outcome was the odds of modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 3 months. RESULTS We included 4 randomized controlled clinical trials including a total of 433 patients. Patients with confirmed LVO receiving tenecteplase had higher odds of modified Rankin Scale scores of 0 to 2 (odds ratio, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.15-3.69]), successful recanalization (odds ratio, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.73-5.40]), and functional improvement defined as 1-point decrease across all modified Rankin Scale grades (common odds ratio, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.18-2.87]) at 3 months compared with patients with confirmed LVO receiving alteplase. There was little or no heterogeneity between the results provided from included studies regarding the aforementioned outcomes (I2≤20%). No difference in the outcomes of early neurological improvement, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, any intracranial hemorrhage, and the rates of modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 or all-cause mortality at 3 months was detected between patients with LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with either tenecteplase or alteplase.

The aim of our study was to determine the knowledge of current guidelines and attitude in the diagnosis and treatment of H pylori infection in primary care physicians (PCPs) and medical students in Croatia. MATERIALS AND METHODS A study was conducted among PCPs and medical students to evaluate adherence to Maastricht V consensus guidelines. Questionnaire was distributed by e-mail to 2338 PCPs offices in Croatia and to the medical students from the University of Split School of Medicine. Responses were collected electronically from June 22 to August 22, 2020. RESULTS Two hundred forty-nine PCPs and 169 medical students were included in the study. Bismuth or non-bismuth-based quadruple therapy as first-line treatment for H pylori was the choice of 4.8% of PCPs and 13% of students, while 66.3% PCPs and 79.9% students would choose clarithromycin-based triple therapy. Bismuth-based quadruple therapy was the most preferred second line of treatment for 45.4% of PCPs and 34.9% of students. Only 2.8% PCPs and 7.1% of students would correctly recommend first and second line of treatment for H. pylori infection. A larger proportion of students than PCPs would prefer C13-urea breath test (50.3% vs 6.4%). Only 59.0% PCPs would treat for H pylori in all patients including the asymptomatic ones.

Results A total of 105 (29.6%) and 250 (70.4%) women underwent RSSM and robotic multi-site myomectomy (RMSM), respectively. RSSM was more commonly performed in women with lower body mass index (21.6 vs. 22.5 kg/m2, P=0.014), without peritoneal adhesions (7.6% vs. 24.8%, P<0.001), and less (2.6 vs. 4.6, P<0.001) and smaller (6.3 vs. 7.7 cm, P<0.001) myomas compared to RMSM. After propensity score matching, the largest myoma size (P=0.143), total myoma number (P=0.671), and tumor weight (P=0.510) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Although the docking time was significantly longer in the RSSM group (5.1 vs. 3.8 minutes, P=0.005), total operation time was similar between RSSM and RMSM groups (145.9 vs. 147.3 minutes, P=0.856). Additionally, hemoglobin decrement was lower in the RSSM group than in the RMSM group (1.4 vs. 1.8 g/dL, P=0.009).

BACKGROUND High PPP is often employed to control bleeding from the hepatic vein during pure laparoscopic hepatectomy; however, there is a risk of pulmonary gas embolism. We noted that decreases in AWP were often effective. METHODS After establishing carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum in 6 male piglets and maintaining PPP at 25 mmHg, CVP was measured 3 times at each of 9 levels of airway pressure, which was increased in increments of 5 cmH2O from 0 to 40 cmH2O. CVP was measured in the same manner by maintaining PPP at 20, 15, 10, 5, and 0 mmHg, and in laparotomy. Correlation and regression analyses were performed among airway pressure, CVP, and pneumoperitoneum pressure. RESULTS Positive correlations were observed between AWP and CVP and between PPP and CVP (P < 0.001). Under high airway pressure, CVP was persistently higher than pneumoperitoneum pressure. Under low airway pressure, CVP did not increase or often decreased when PPP was higher than CVP. CONCLUSIONS By increasing pneumoperitoneum pressure, bleeding from the hepatic vein cannot be controlled under high airway pressure, but can be controlled under low airway pressure. However, under low airway pressure, the risk of pulmonary gas embolism increases when PPP is higher than CVP. We consider that reducing AWP is also effective for controlling bleeding from the hepatic vein and safer than increasing pneumoperitoneum pressure.","Kobayashi, Shin; Honda, Goro; Kurata, Masanao; Tadano, Sosuke; Sakamoto, Katsunori; Okuda, Yukihiro; Abe, Keisuke",Annals of surgery,38,1

Multiple studies have shown prevailing gender inequities disadvantaging women in medicine. The recent global pandemic due to COVID-19 has affected all parts of society but has disproportionately impacted women and may delay academic promotion of female academic radiologists. We reviewed the evidence regarding the potential career impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on female radiologists. The pandemic has disproportionately increased women's domestic and childcare responsibilities and decreased female researchers' productivity which may delay academic promotion. Strategies to address the problem of delayed promotion of female radiologists include raising awareness, mentorship and sponsorship, operational flexibility, and support with domestic and childcare responsibilities.","Tso, Hilda H; Parikh, Jay R",Clinical imaging,38,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothetic efficacy of combining liquid embolic agents with different properties and viscosities for use in endovascular embolization of cerebral AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS From March 2018 to March 2019, sixteen patients with cerebral AVMs (12 women, 4 men; age range, 33-61 years) underwent endovascular embolization with combined liquid embolic agents delivered serially via a single microcatheter. The procedure consists of initial embolization with PHIL 30%, followed by Menox 18 through the same microcatheter. According to the Spetzler-Martin scale, 11 (68.75%) AVMs were grades I-II, 4 (25%) were grade III, and 1 (6.25%) was grade IV. Angiographic, technical, and clinical outcomes were analyzed independently. RESULTS Combined PHIL and Menox embolization through the same microcatheter via 21 pedicles was performed in these 16 patients. Once the length of the reflux reached approximately 2 cm, PHIL 30% was switched to Menox 18. Antegrade flow and distal penetration of the serially applied liquid embolic agents were observed in all 16 cases. The ability to completely control the flow of the materials and avoid any dangerous proximal reflux was noted in all performed embolizations. The estimated average size reduction of the treated AVMs was 85%, ranging from 50% to 100%. Complete embolization was achieved in 10/16 or 62.5% of the cases. There was no procedure-related complication during or after the embolization. No mortality or postprocedural clinical worsening was seen. Clinical success and complete obliteration were confirmed with at least 1 follow-up angiography in 10/16 patients. CONCLUSIONS Serial delivery of nonadhesive liquid embolic agents via the same microcatheter was safe and effective in our study and may be a potential technique for routine AVM treatment. However, further investigations are required to validate the safety and the efficacy of the method.","Sirakov, A; Minkin, K; Sirakov, S",AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,38,24

Methods and Results: During the period from March 7, 2019, to April 18, 2020, due to disruption of molybdenum supply chain, we used low specific activity Tc-99m pertechnetate elute (0.5-2 mCi of 99mTcO4 in 5 mL) for each kit preparation. Two or three intradermal periareolar injections were done for each patient (0.02-0.1 mCi/0.2 mL for each injection). Immediately following injection, dynamic lymphoscintigraphy was done. Surgery was done the same day of injection and the axillary sentinel node was sought using a gamma probe. Overall, 35 patients were included in the study. The specific activity of the Tc-99m elute (in 5 mL) used for kit preparation was 2 mCi/10 mg in four, 1.5 mCi/10 mg in eight, 1.25 mCi/10 mg in eight, 1 mCi/10 mg in three, 0.75 mCi/10 mg in five, and 0.5 mCi/10 mg of 99mTc-Phytate in seven patients. For the first four groups of patients, we used two 0.2 mL injections, while in the latter two groups, three 0.2 mL injections were used. At least one sentinel node was detected in all patients but three in whom axilla was involved. Conclusion: Sentinel node biopsy can be achieved with low specific activity of Tc-99m elute at the time of Mo99-Tc-99m generator shortage. If special personal protection is used, sentinel node mapping can be done in nuclear medicine departments with excellent results despite the COVID-19 pandemic and disruption of generator shipment.","Sadri, Kayvan; Dabbagh, Vahid Reza; Forghani, Mohammad Naser; Asadi, Mahdi; Sadeghi, Ramin",Lymphatic research and biology,38,1

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to estimate the relative and absolute effects of SGLT2i in prevention of heart failure (HF) events across different risk groups. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of large, placebo-controlled RCTs with >1000 participants evaluating HF hospitalization and the composite of CV death or HF hospitalization. Due to varying durations of therapeutic exposure and follow-up, absolute risk reductions and number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated based on incidence rates (per 100 patient-years). RESULTS Across 71 553 patients enrolled in 10 late-phase RCTs, SGLT2i reduced the risk of HF hospitalization by 31% (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.64-0.74; I2 = 0%) and the composite outcome of CV death or HF hospitalization by 24% (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.72-0.80; I2 = 1.4%) compared with placebo. The number of patient-years of treatment exposure needed to prevent 1 CV death or HF hospitalization ranged from 19-26 (established HF) to 72-125 (chronic kidney disease) to 96-400 (high-risk type 2 diabetes). In mixed-effects meta-regression analyses, the benefits of SGLT2i on HF hospitalizations or the composite outcome (CV death or HF hospitalization) were not influenced by age, sex, or change in intermediate markers (glycated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, and body weight) (all P ≥ 0.10). CONCLUSION Despite wide variation in baseline risks and disease states evaluated, SGLT2i demonstrated comparable relative risk reductions in preventing HF events. Patients at highest baseline risk derived the greatest absolute benefits in preventing HF events. These composite estimates may help guide targeted implementation of SGLT2i for the prevention of HF events in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease and in the treatment of HF.","Bhatia, Kirtipal; Jain, Vardhmaan; Gupta, Kartik; Bansal, Agam; Fox, Arieh; Qamar, Arman; Damman, Kevin; Vaduganathan, Muthiah",European journal of heart failure,38,14

Several steps have led to the present understanding of plasma exudation as a non-injurious response to mucosal challenges. The implication of a swift appearance of all circulating multipotent protein systems (also including antimicrobial peptides that now are viewed as being exclusively produced by local cells) on challenged, but intact, mucosal surfaces cannot be trivial. Yet, involvement of early plasma exudation responses in innate mucosal immunology has dwelled below the radar. Admittedly, exploration of physiological plasma exudation mechanisms requires in vivo approaches beyond mouse studies. Plasma exudation also lacks the specificity that is a hallmark of biological revelations. These aspects separate plasma exudation from mainstream progress in immunology. The whole idea, presented here, thus competes with strong paradigms currently entertained in the accepted research front. The present focus on humoral innate immunity in vivo further deviates from most discussions, which concern cell-mediated innate defence. Indeed, plasma exudation has emerged as sole in vivo source of major mucosal defence proteins that now are viewed as local cell produce. In conclusion, this review highlights opportunities for complex actions and interactions provided by non-sieved plasma proteins/peptides on the surface of intact mucosal barriers in vivo.","Persson, Carl",Journal of innate immunity,38,1

It can also be particularly challenging for those outside of North America to become certified due to the limited number of international test centers. Preliminary work suggests that it is possible to reliably score the FLS manual skills component remotely using low-cost videoconferencing technology. Significant work remains to ensure that testing procedures adhere to standards defined by SAGES for this approach to be considered equivalent to standard on-site testing. OBJECTIVE To validate the integrity and validity of the FLS manual skills examination administered remotely in a real-world environment according to FLS testing protocols and to evaluate participants' experience with the setting. METHODS Individuals with various levels of training from the University of Toronto completed a pre- and a post-test questionnaire. Participants presented to one of the two FLS testing rooms available for the study, each connected via Skype to a separate room with a FLS proctor who administered and scored the test remotely (RP). An on-site proctor (OP) was present in the room as a control. An invigilator was also present in the testing room to follow directions from the RP and ensure the integrity of test materials. RESULTS Twenty-one participants were recruited, and 20 completed the test. There was no significant difference between scores by RP and OP. Interrater reliability between the RP and OP was excellent. One critical error was missed by the RP, but this would not have affected the test outcome. Participants reported being highly satisfied. CONCLUSION We demonstrate that proctors located remotely can administer the FLS skills test in a secure and reliable fashion, with excellent interrater reliability compared to an on-site proctor. Remote proctoring of the FLS examination could become a strategy to increase certification rates while containing costs.","Okrainec, Allan; Vassiliou, Melina; Jimenez, M Carolina; Henao, Oscar; Kaneva, Pepa; Matt Ritter, E",Surgical endoscopy,38,30

We compared pipeline embolization device (PED) versus conventional endovascular treatment in terms of evolution of mass effect, complications, recurrence, and retreatment rate. METHODS One hundred fifty-seven patients harboring 167 cavernous carotid aneurysms were treated using PED placement, coiling, stent-assisted coiling, and carotid vessel destruction. Procedural complications, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes were analyzed and compared. RESULTS There were no difference in age, sex, and mean aneurysm size between those treated with PED and those treated with conventional endovascular procedures. The patients treated with PED had a significantly lower proportion of small-size aneurysms (<10 mm) and a shorter follow-up duration. Multivariate analysis revealed treatment other than PED (PED: odds ratio [OR], 0.03; P=0.002) and size >15 mm (OR, 4.27; P=0.003) to be predictors of no improvement in symptoms. The rate of complete occlusion was 81.36% (48 of 59) for PED, 42.25% (39 of 71) for stent-assisted coiling, 27.27% (6 of 22) for coiling, and 73.33% (11 of 15) for carotid vessel destruction. Retreatment was needed in patients with aneurysm size >15 mm (OR, 2.67; P=0.037) and those who were not treated with PED (PED: OR, 0.16; P=0.006). The rate of major complications was 6.6% (11 of 167). Patients who were treated with PED or stent-assisted coiling had 3.84 lower odds to develop complications (OR, 0.26; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The use of PED should be encouraged, especially in symptomatic patients. We found PED to be associated with less need for future treatment, higher improvement in symptoms rate, and lower rate of complications.","Zanaty, Mario; Chalouhi, Nohra; Starke, Robert M; Barros, Guilherme; Saigh, Mark Philip; Schwartz, Eric Winthrop; Ajiboye, Norman; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula I; Hasan, David; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Jabbour, Pascal",Stroke,38,1

Human influences in the current ""Anthropocene"" epoch are exponentially impacting the environment and consequentially health. Changing ecological niches are suggested to have created health transitions expressed as modifications of immune balance from infections inflicting pathologies in the Holocene epoch (12,000 years ago) to human behaviors inflicting pathologies beginning in the Anthropocene epoch (300 years ago). A review of human immune health and adaptations responding to environmental (biological, chemical, physical, and psychological) stresses, which are influenced by social conditions, emphasize the involvement of fluctuations in immune cell subsets affecting influential gene-environment interactions. The literature from a variety of fields (anthropological, immunological, and environmental) is incorporated to present an expanded perspective on shifts in diseases within the context of immune balance and function and environmental immunology. The influences between historical and contemporary human ecology are examined in relation to human immunity. Several examples of shifts in human physiology and immunity support the premise that increased incidences of chronic diseases are a consequence of human modification of environment and lifestyle. Although the development of better health care and a broader understanding of human health have helped with better life quality and expectancy, the transition of morbidity and mortality rates from infections to chronic diseases is a cause for concern.

Healthcare-associated influenza is prevented through healthcare worker (HCW) vaccination and effective use of U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended infection control practices, including use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Although effective PPE use may significantly reduce healthcare-associated influenza transmission, PPE adherence among ICU HCWs for preventing nosocomial influenza infection has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE To characterize ICU HCW behavior, knowledge, and attitudes about recommended precautions for the prevention of healthcare-associated influenza infections. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A survey of 292 internal medicine housestaff, pulmonary/critical care fellows and faculty, nurses, and respiratory care professionals working in four ICUs in two hospitals in Baltimore, MD. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of those surveyed, 88% (n = 256) completed the survey. Only 63% of respondents were able to correctly identify adequate influenza PPE, and 62% reported high adherence (>80%) with PPE use for prevention of nosocomial influenza. In multivariable modeling, odds of high adherence varied by clinician type. Respondents who believed adherence was inconvenient had lower odds of high adherence (odds ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.82), and those reporting likelihood of being reprimanded for nonadherence were more likely to adhere (odds ratio 2.40, 95% confidence interval 1.25-4.62). CONCLUSIONS ICU HCWs report suboptimal levels of influenza PPE adherence. This finding in a high-risk setting is particularly concerning, given that it likely overestimates actual behavior. Both suboptimal adherence levels and significant PPE knowledge gaps indicate that ICU HCWs may be at a substantial risk of developing and/or transmitting nosocomial respiratory viral infection. Improving respiratory virus infection control will likely require closing knowledge gaps and changing organizational factors that influence behavior.","Daugherty, Elizabeth L; Perl, Trish M; Needham, Dale M; Rubinson, Lewis; Bilderback, Andrew; Rand, Cynthia S",Critical care medicine,38,1

However, no empirical study currently exists in the literature that examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental education. This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on dental education and dental students' experience. METHODS An anonymous online survey was administrated to professional dental students that focused on their experiences related to COVID-19. The survey included questions about student demographics, protocols for school reopening and student perceptions of institutional responses, student concerns, and psychological impacts. RESULTS Among the 145 respondents, 92.4% were pre-doctoral dental students and 7.6% were orthodontic residents; 48.2% were female and 12.6% students lived alone during the school closure due to the pandemic. Students' age ranged from 23 to 39 years. Younger students expressed more concerns about their emotional health (P = 0.01). In terms of the school's overall response to COVID-19, 73.1% students thought it was effective. The majority (83%) of students believed that social distancing in school can minimize the development of COVID-19. In general, students felt that clinical education suffered after transitioning to online but responded more positively about adjustments to other online curricular components. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted dental education.

Differential considerations for diseases involving primarily the perinephric space differ from those arising from the kidney itself, show variant imaging features, and require identification and characterisation by interpreting radiologists-an imaging diagnosis can be suggested in many cases. Lymphangiomas are congenital cystic lesions that may contain lipid-laden chyle, which may be detectable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Retroperitoneal fibrosis, Erdheim-Chester disease, and lymphoma may present as a perinephric soft tissue rind. Osseous findings favour Erdheim-Chester, ureteric obstruction favours retroperitoneal fibrosis, and associated lymphadenopathy with mass-effect, but without invasion of adjacent structures favours lymphoma. Extramedullary haematopoiesis and brown fat stimulation are both characterised by signal drop on opposed-phase T1-weighted (W) images, the former resulting from severe anaemia and the latter in the context of elevated serum catecholamines, especially in the setting of phaeochromocytoma. Liposarcoma is the most common primary sarcoma of the retroperitoneum. Metastases are uncommon; however, they can be seen in melanoma, among other primary malignancies. Increased T1W signal hyperintensity is typical of melanoma metastases and haematomas. Abscesses show non-enhancing fluid centrally with marked diffusion restriction.

METHODS The study included 1321 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-year students (full-time bachelor degree course) of Physical Education, Physiotherapy, Pedagogy as well as Tourism and Recreation from 4 universities in Poland. A questionnaire prepared by the authors was applied as a research tool. The 10-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess pain intensity. Prior to the study, the reliability of the questionnaire was assessed by conducting it on the group of 20 participants twice with a shorter interval. No significant differences between the results obtained in the two surveys were revealed (p < 0.05). RESULTS In the group of 1311 study participants, 927 (70.7%) respondents declared having experienced back pain within the last 12 months.

Furthermore, it induces chemotaxis and inflammation once released in the extracellular milieu, and it has been reported to upregulate, but also to inhibit HIV-1 replication in different cell types. We here investigated the potential role of extracellular HMGB1 in both R5 and X4 HIV-1 replication in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and U937 promonocytic cells, respectively. DESIGN MDM or U937 cells were infected with R5 and X4 HIV-1 strains, respectively, in the presence or absence of endotoxin-free recombinant (r) HMGB1 or necrotic cell supernatants either containing or depleted of endogenous HMGB1. METHODS HIV replication was measured by means of virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity in culture supernatants and cell-associated viral protein expression. Cytokine and chemokine production were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; cell surface expression of CD4, CC chemokine receptor 5, receptor for advanced glycation end-products, Toll-like receptor-2 and Toll-like receptor-4 were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS Both rHMGB1 and necrotic cell supernatant-associated HMGB1 inhibited replication of R5 HIV-1 in MDM. Surprisingly enough, no upregulation of CC chemokine receptor 5-binding chemokines or of other chemokines and cytokines was observed in rHMGB1-stimulated MDM. HMGB1 also induced chemotaxis and strongly inhibited the replication of X4 HIV-1 in the 'Minus' subset of U937 cell clones expressing high levels of putative HMGB1 receptors (receptor for advanced glycation end-products, Toll-like receptors 2 and 4). CONCLUSION Extracellular HMGB1 is a potent inhibitor of both R5 and X4 HIV-1 replication in mononuclear phagocytic cells without inducing the release of HIV-Modulatory chemokines or cytokines.","Cassetta, Luca; Fortunato, Orazio; Adduce, Leda; Rizzi, Chiara; Hering, Julia; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Bianchi, Marco Emilio; Alfano, Massimo; Poli, Guido",AIDS,38,16

The potential advantages of ACPCV are reduction of dead space, reduction of expiratory airway resistance, and preservation of vocal cord function. We developed the ACPCV system and investigated its performance in bench studies. The ETT cuff volume was regulated via four steps, depending on airway pressure and tracheal pressure. Two ventilatory settings were examined under several rates of spontaneous breathing efforts. Imposed expiratory resistance (RE), imposed expiratory work of breathing (WOB), and auto-PEEP of ACPCV were compared with continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV). RE of ACPCV (2.6 ± 0.5 cm H2O/l/s) was significantly lower than that of CMV (11.6 ± 1.6 cm H2O/l/s) (p < 0.001).

We determined which baseline angiography features predict response to intravenous thrombolytics in ischemic stroke using randomized controlled trial data. METHODS We analyzed angiograms from the IST-3 (Third International Stroke Trial), an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial of intravenous alteplase. Readers, masked to clinical, treatment, and outcome data, assessed prerandomization computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography for presence, extent, location, and completeness of obstruction and collaterals. We compared angiography findings to 6-month functional outcome (Oxford Handicap Scale) and tested for interactions with alteplase, using ordinal regression in adjusted analyses. We also meta-analyzed all available angiography data from other randomized controlled trials of intravenous thrombolytics. RESULTS In IST-3, 300 patients had prerandomization angiography (computed tomographic angiography=271 and magnetic resonance angiography=29). On multivariable analysis, more extensive angiographic obstruction and poor collaterals independently predicted poor outcome (P<0.01). We identified no significant interaction between angiography findings and alteplase effect on Oxford Handicap Scale (P≥0.075) in IST-3. In meta-analysis (5 trials of alteplase or desmoteplase, including IST-3, n=591), there was a significantly increased benefit of thrombolytics on outcome (odds ratio>1 indicates benefit) in patients with (odds ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.64; P=0.011) versus without (odds ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.35; P=0.566) arterial obstruction (P for interaction 0.017). CONCLUSIONS Intravenous thrombolytics provide benefit to stroke patients with computed tomographic angiography or magnetic resonance angiography evidence of arterial obstruction, but the sample was underpowered to demonstrate significant treatment benefit or harm among patients with apparently patent arteries.

Indeed, their positive single-stranded viral RNA genome (vRNA) undergoes in the cytoplasm replication, translation and encapsidation, three steps of the flavivirus life cycle that are coordinated through a fine-tuned equilibrium. Over the last years, RNA methylation has emerged as a powerful mechanism to regulate messenger RNA metabolism at the posttranscriptional level. Not surprisingly, flaviviruses exploit RNA epigenetic strategies to control crucial steps of their replication cycle as well as to evade sensing by the innate immune system. This review summarizes the current knowledge about vRNA methylation events and their impacts on flavivirus replication and pathogenesis. We also address the important challenges that the field of epitranscriptomics faces in reliably and accurately identifying RNA methylation sites, which should be considered in future studies on viral RNA modifications.","Ruggieri, Alessia; Helm, Mark; Chatel-Chaix, Laurent",RNA biology,38,27

Here, we have profiled the different B cell subsets elicited upon vaccination, using machine learning methods for interpreting high-dimensional flow cytometry data sets. The B cell response elicited by an adjuvanted vaccine formulation, compared to the antigen alone, was characterized using two automated methods based on clustering (FlowSOM) and dimensional reduction (t-SNE) approaches. The clustering method identified, based on multiple marker expression, different B cell populations, including plasmablasts, plasma cells, germinal center B cells and their subsets, while this profiling was more difficult with t-SNE analysis. When undefined phenotypes were detected, their characterization could be improved by integrating the t-SNE spatial visualization of cells with the FlowSOM clusters. The frequency of some cellular subsets, in particular plasma cells, was significantly higher in lymph nodes of mice primed with the adjuvanted formulation compared to antigen alone. Thanks to this automatic data analysis it was possible to identify, in an unbiased way, different B cell populations and also intermediate stages of cell differentiation elicited by immunization, thus providing a signature of B cell recall response that can be hardly obtained with the classical bidimensional gating analysis. © 2019 The Authors.

AIM This study aimed to evaluate hyperlipidemia as a risk factor connected with stroke and CVD. Moreover, having identified this risk factor, the study evaluates how hyperlipidemia has been examined earlier and what can be done in the future. METHODS All prospective studies concerning hyperlipidemia as risk factors for stroke and CVD were identified by a search of PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases with keywords hyperlipidemia, risk factors, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. RESULTS The constant positive association between the incidence of coronary heart disease and cholesterol concentration of LDL is apparent in observational studies in different populations. Thus, the reduction of LDL cholesterol in those populations, particularly with regard to initial cholesterol concentrations, can reduce the risk of vascular diseases. However, the impact of using lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins, has been demonstrated in several studies as an important factor in decreasing the mortality and morbidity in rates of patients with stroke and CVD. CONCLUSION After reviewing all the research mentioned in this review, it can be confirmed that hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for stroke and correlated in patients with CVD.","Alloubani, Aladeen; Nimer, Refat; Samara, Rama",Current cardiology reviews,38,1

While AMI therapy improves blood flow during surgery, reperfusion-induced injury may also occur, leading to secondary cardiac damage or even death. Here, we investigated miR-129-5p in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats, to explore reperfusion-related molecular mechanisms in myocardium. We used Sprague Dawley rats to establish a myocardial I/R model, with agomiR-129-5p injection, and used rat cardiomyocytes (H9c2) treated with anoxia-reoxygenation (A/R) to mimic myocardial I/R injury in vitro. A dual-luciferase reporter assay determined miR-129-5p binding to high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) in H9c2 cells. We showed that exogenous miR-129-5p restored cardiac function indices, alleviated cardiac injury, relieved inflammatory effects and reduced infarct size and cell apoptosis in rat myocardium after I/R treatment. Elevated miR-129-5p induced a reduction in HMGB1 expression in rat I/R myocardium. miR-129-5p also targeted HMGB1, and negatively regulated its expression in H9c2 cells. Moreover, miR-129-5p overexpression in the cardiomyocytes reduced cell apoptosis and recovered cell viability after A/R injury, which was reversed by subsequent HMGB1 overexpression. These findings suggest miR-129-5p plays a cardioprotective role in ameliorating myocardial I/R injury in rats, by negatively targeting HMGB1. This mechanism provides new insights into the treatment of myocardium reperfusion-related damage.","Xing, Jingxian; Liu, Junyan; Liu, Juan; Xu, Zesheng",General physiology and biophysics,38,7

To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair using a memory-ring patch (Polysoft™ mesh). Patients and Methods. Between April 2010 and March 2013, a total of 76 inguinal hernias underwent TAPP repair using Polysoft mesh in 67 adults under general anesthesia. Three different senior resident surgeons performed TAPP repair under the instruction of a specialist surgeon. Nine patients had bilateral hernias. The 76 hernias included 37 indirect inguinal hernias, 29 direct hernias, 1 femoral hernia, 1 pantaloon hernia (combined direct/indirect inguinal hernia), and 8 recurrent hernias after open anterior hernia repair. The immediate postoperative outcomes as well as the short-term outcomes (mainly recurrence and incidence of chronic pain) were studied. Results. There was no conversion from TAPP repair to anterior open repair. The mean operation time was 109 minutes (range, 40-132) for unilateral hernia repair. Scrotal seroma was diagnosed at the operation site in 5 patients. No patient had operation-related orchitis, testicle edema, trocar site infection, or chronic pain during follow-up. Conclusions. The use of Polysoft mesh for TAPP inguinal hernia repair does not seem to adversely affect the quality of repair. The use of this mesh is therefore feasible and safe and may reduce postoperative pain.","Matsutani, Takeshi; Nomura, Tsutomu; Hagiwara, Nobutoshi; Matsuda, Akihisa; Takao, Yoshimune; Uchida, Eiji",Surgery research and practice,38,28

The aim of this study was to evaluate a novel EGFR-targeting protein, the ZEGFR:1907 Affibody molecule, for radionuclide imaging of EGFR expression, to determine a suitable tracer format (dimer or monomer) and optimal label. METHODS An EGFR-specific Affibody molecule, ZEGFR:1907, and its dimeric form, (ZEGFR:1907)2, were labeled with 111In using benzyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and with 125I using p-iodobenzoate. Affinity and cellular retention of conjugates were evaluated in vitro. Biodistribution of radiolabeled Affibody molecules was compared in mice bearing EGFR-expressing A431 xenografts. Specificity of EGFR targeting was confirmed by comparison with biodistribution of non-EGFR-specific counterparts. RESULTS Head-to-tail dimerization of the Affibody molecule improved the dissociation rate. In vitro, dimeric forms demonstrated superior cellular retention of radioactivity. For both molecular set-ups, retention was better for the 111In-labeled tracer than for the radioiodinated counterpart. In vivo, all conjugates accumulated specifically in xenografts and in EGFR-expressing tissues. The retention of radioactivity in tumors was better in vivo for dimeric forms; however, the absolute uptake values were higher for monomeric tracers. The best tracer, 111In-labeled ZEGFR:1907, provided a tumor-to-blood ratio of 100 (24 h after injection). CONCLUSION The radiometal-labeled monomeric Affibody molecule ZEGFR:1907 has a potential for radionuclide molecular imaging of EGFR expression in malignant tumors.","Tolmachev, Vladimir; Friedman, Mikaela; Sandström, Mattias; Eriksson, Tove L J; Rosik, Daniel; Hodik, Monika; Ståhl, Stefan; Frejd, Fredrik Y; Orlova, Anna","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",38,16

Many problematic airborne pathogens, both viral (influenza A/H1N1, Rubella, and avian influenza/H5N1) and bacterial (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacillus anthracis), have huge impacts on health care and agricultural applications, and can potentially be used as bioterrorism agents. Many different laboratory-based methods have been introduced and are currently being used. However, such detection is generally limited by sample collection, including nasal swabs and blood analysis. Direct identification from air (specifically, aerosol samples) would be ideal, but such detection has not been very successful due to the difficulty in sample collection and the extremely low pathogen concentration found in aerosol samples. In this review, we will discuss the portable biosensors and/or micro total analysis systems (µTAS) that can be used for monitoring such airborne pathogens, similar to smoke detectors.

METHODS On April 2020, 3 counties (districts) were randomly selected from each of the 12 schistosomiasis-endemic provinces (municipality, autonomous region), and a questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the implementation of schistosomiasis control activities in these counties (districts) from January to March 2020. Then, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemics on the national schistosomiasis control program of China was evaluated using a comparative analysis approach. RESULTS Among the 36 counties (cities, districts) sampled from 12 provinces (municipality, autonomous region), 66.67% were at a high and medium risk of COVID-19 epidemics. The implementation of schistosomiasis control activities assignment, human schistosomiasis examination and treatment, snail control with chemical treatment and health education reduced by 44.26% to 91.56% as compared to 2019 during the same time period, and the schistosomiasis control program was more affected by COVID-19 in transmission-controlled provinces.

We quantified BBB in different stages of NCC by using DCE-MR imaging to look for the differences in perfusion indices and to correlate these indices with serum MMP-9 expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS DCE-MR imaging along with conventional MR imaging was performed in 57 single cysticercous brain lesions to quantify the kep, K(trans), and ve around the lesions, which were in different stages of evolution. There were 6 lesions in the vesicular stage and 17 lesions each in the colloidal, granular-nodular, and calcified stages. Serum MMP-9 was quantified from all patients, whereas perfusion indices were quantified from all stages except for the vesicular stage. RESULTS We observed significant differences among the 3 stages of NCC in serum MMP-9 expression as well as DCE-derived kep values. In addition, kep showed a strongly significant positive correlation with MMP-9 expression when modeled with the individual stage of the disease as well as with all stages when pooled together. Other DCE-derived hemodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters showed inconsistent differences with each stage of the disease. The correlation of DCE-derived parameters with serum MMP-9 expression and edema volume also showed inconsistency with the stage of the disease. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that kep correlates best with serum MMP-9 expression among the pharmacokinetic indices and most closely represents the degree of BBB breakdown, which is highest in the colloidal stage and lowest in the calcified stage. kep may be used as a noninvasive image biomarker of BBB breakdown in different stages of NCC.","Gupta, R K; Awasthi, R; Garg, R K; Kumar, N; Gupta, P K; Singh, A K; Sahoo, P; Paliwal, V K; Prasad, K N; Pandey, C M; Rathore, R K S",AJNR.

We aimed to perform a meta-analysis and systematic review to estimate the incidences of complications and to compare the short- and long-term satisfaction rates following FTL. METHODS We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane library for eligible studies. The primary outcome was the incidences of complications following FTL. The secondary outcome was the satisfaction rate immediately and 6-month after FTL. The pooled incidences of complications and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using random-effects models. RESULTS A total of 26 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Swelling was the most commonly reported complication with a pooled incidence of 35%, followed by skin dimpling (10%), paresthesia (6%), thread visibility/palpability (4%), infection (2%), and thread extrusion (2%). Absorbable threads were associated with a significantly lower risk of paresthesia (3.1% vs. 11.7%) and thread extrusion (1.6% vs. 7.6%) than non-absorbable threads. Patients older than 50 years had a significantly higher risk of dimpling (16% vs. 5.6%) and infection (5.9% vs. 0.7%) than their younger counterparts. In addition, the pooled long-term satisfaction rate was significantly decreased compared to it immediately after FTL (88% vs. 98%).

Furthermore, it should be discussed with patients preoperatively that the rejuvenation effect of FTL may not maintain in the long-term.

Although radiation exposure of interventional radiologists during these procedures is an important concern, data on operator exposure are lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS Radiation dose to interventional radiologists during CT fluoroscopy-guided renal cryoablation (n = 20) and lung RFA (n = 20) was measured prospectively in a clinical setting. Effective dose to the operator was calculated from the 1-cm dose equivalent measured on the neck outside the lead apron, and on the left chest inside the lead apron, using electronic dosimeters. Equivalent dose to the operator's finger skin was measured using thermoluminescent dosimeter rings. RESULTS The mean (median) effective dose to the operator per procedure was 6.05 (4.52) μSv during renal cryoablation and 0.74 (0.55) μSv during lung RFA. The mean (median) equivalent dose to the operator's finger skin per procedure was 2.1 (2.1) mSv during renal cryoablation, and 0.3 (0.3) mSv during lung RFA. CONCLUSION Radiation dose to interventional radiologists during renal cryoablation and lung RFA were at an acceptable level, and in line with recommended dose limits for occupational radiation exposure.","Matsui, Yusuke; Hiraki, Takao; Gobara, Hideo; Iguchi, Toshihiro; Fujiwara, Hiroyasu; Kawabata, Takahiro; Yamauchi, Takatsugu; Yamaguchi, Takuya; Kanazawa, Susumu",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,38,31

Traditionally, postoperative management of a below-knee amputation involves soft compressive dressings to allow for complete stump healing before initial prosthesis fitting. This technique is associated with a prolonged period of limited mobility, placing patients at risk for deconditioning or fall with a risk of injury to the stump. In contrast, immediate postoperative prosthesis (IPOP) placement allows patients to begin ambulation and rehabilitation on postoperative day 1, which may be of significant physiologic and psychological benefit. The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of patients undergoing IPOP placement to those of a historical control group managed with traditional soft compressive dressing placement. METHODS Medical records of all consecutive below-knee amputation patients who underwent IPOP (IPOP group; 37 patients, 2007-2010) and all patients who underwent traditional soft compressive dressing placement and were IPOP candidates (non-IPOP group; 35 patients, 2006-2007) were retrospectively reviewed. Patient comorbidities and preoperative ambulation status were compared between the IPOP and the non-IPOP groups. Primary outcomes evaluated included perioperative systemic complications, wound complications, need for surgical revision, and the time until placement of a definitive prosthesis. Data were analyzed using the chi-squared and Student's t-test. RESULTS Preoperative comorbidities and patient characteristics of the 2 groups were similar, although the IPOP group was younger (61.5 vs. 69.0 years; P=0.01). Immediate perioperative systemic complication rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups (IPOP 29.7% vs. non-IPOP 31.4%; P=0.876). Postoperative wound complication rates were as follows: wound infection (IPOP 18.9% vs. non-IPOP 25.0%; P=0.555), wound dehiscence (IPOP 29.7% vs. non-IPOP 25.0%; P=0.673), and skin breakdown separate from the incision (IPOP 18.9% vs. non-IPOP 3.6%; P=0.062). Patients in the IPOP group trended towards fewer postoperative falls (IPOP 10.8% vs. non-IPOP 21.4%; P=0.240). The need for revision was significantly greater in the non-IPOP group (IPOP 5.4% vs. non-IPOP 27.6%; P=0.013). The time from surgery to placement of the preparatory prosthesis was 51 days in the IPOP group. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing IPOP have similar perioperative systemic and wound complication rates compared to those patients undergoing conventional below-knee amputation, but are less likely to require surgical revision. The use of IPOP allows for early ambulation and rehabilitation, which may be of psychological benefit and may decrease the sequelae of prolonged immobilization. IPOP application should be considered for all appropriate candidates requiring below-knee amputation.","Ali, Mujtaba M; Loretz, Lorraine; Shea, Art; Poorvu, Eli; Robinson, William P; Schanzer, Andres; Messina, Louis M; Baril, Donald T",Annals of vascular surgery,38,11

Historically, surgical approaches have been dictated by the location of the tumor and its relation to the contiguous structures such as the vertebral bodies, subclavian vessels, and chest wall. Resection is hampered by difficulties with visualization and access within a narrow working space. The shortcomings associated with the traditional surgical approaches create a potential of injury to nearby structures. We present a case of a 43-year-old woman with a superior sulcus neurogenic tumor impinging on the left subclavian vein, who underwent a successful resection without injury to nearby structures. We found that a robotic approach improved visualization of the tumor and nearby structures and increased instrument maneuverability relative to a thoracoscopic approach, along with less pain and recovery time compared with a thoracotomy. This experience suggests that robotics provides a promising alternative for excision of superior sulcus neurogenic tumors, which may reduce associated morbidity.","Nguyen, Duy C; Garagozlo, Cameron; Moslemi, Mohammad; Rawashdeh, Badi; Meyer, Mark; Tempesta, Barbara J; Poston, Robert; Gharagozloo, Farid",Innovations,38,1

Within each competency are the associated skills and knowledge pieces (indicators). Competence can be measured using an adaptation of Miller's Pyramid for Clinical Assessment, either through self-assessment or identification of formal assessment instruments. CONCLUSIONS The Systematic Review Competencies Framework provides a standards-based, flexible way for librarians and organizations to identify areas of competence and areas in need of development to build capacity for systematic review integration.

METHODS Randomised clinical trial with 89 patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Every patient had bilateral inguinal hernia and had both prostheses implanted randomly, one on each side. Early postoperative and chronic pain was evaluated using the visual analogue scale. Also recurrence rate and subjective evaluation of patients were analysed. RESULTS Pain in the early postoperative period was inferior on the side where the self-adhesive mesh had been implanted (6.12 vs. 6.62, p=0.005 during the 1st postoperative day; 2.12 vs. 2.62, p=0.001 during the 7th postoperative day). Differences disappeared with the long-term evaluation (0.71 vs. 0.98, p=0.148 1 year after the surgery). The operative time was significantly shorter on the PPG mesh side (24.37 ± 5.1 in case of the PPG mesh and 29.66 ± 5.6 in case of the PLP mesh, p<0,001). Recurrence occurred in seven patients (7.8%), six of them (6.7%, CI 3.0-14.4) on the PPG mesh side and one (1.1%, CI 0.2-7.8) on the PLP side. These differences were not statistically significant (p=0.125) CONCLUSIONS: Although hernioplasty with self-adhesive mesh reduced early postoperative pain, this reduction was clinically irrelevant and it had no influence on chronic pain. There was a trend towards a higher recurrence rate when self-adhesive meshes were used, and although in this study differences were not statistically significant they should be confirmed in later studies using larger samples. Surgical procedures that do not need fixing sutures are promising, but further studies are needed before they become the gold standard of inguinal hernia repair.","Porrero, Jose L; Castillo, María J; Pérez-Zapata, Ana; Alonso, María T; Cano-Valderrama, Oscar; Quirós, Esther; Villar, Sol; Ramos, Beatriz; Sánchez-Cabezudo, Carlos; Bonachia, Oscar; Marcos, Alberto; Pérez, Brígido",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,38,1

We aimed to describe a novel strategy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on a tertiary referral proctology center during the first wave of infection in Italy. METHODS All patients booked appointments at the Proctology Unit between March 9th and May 4th 2020 were identified. Patients booked for a first visit underwent a structured remote consultation. Patients with perianal or sacrococcygeal abscesses, major anorectal bleeding, incoercible anal pain and red flags for malignancy were labelled as 'non-deferrable'. A flowchart was designed to comply with adequate assistance of proctologic patients. Demographics, clinical data and outcomes of in-office procedures were collected. RESULTS On a total of 548 booked visits, 198 (36.1%) were cancelled before remote consultation. Of the remaining 350, 112 (32.0%) attended a follow-up visit. Among 238 (68.0%) patients undergoing remote consultation, 88 (25.1%) were deemed 'deferrable' and 148 (42.3%) 'nondeferrable'. 2 (0.6%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 while waiting for an outpatient visit. 25/88 (28.4%) deferrable patients cancelled their appointment as felt no longer necessary. A total of 45/148 (30.4%) non deferrable patients (mean age, 46 years; 31% females) underwent in-office procedures, most often related to anal abscess and/or fistula (48.9%). Final diagnosis of malignancy occurred in 4 cases. A 55% increase in the number of in-office procedures was noted compared to the previous year. None of the attending patients nor staff members resulted COVID-19 positive during the study period. CONCLUSIONS Despite the uncertainties accompanying the use of remote consultations in proctology, the results of this study may inform the development of strategies for restructuring activities in response to future emergencies of this magnitude.","Giani, Iacopo; Gallo, Gaetano; Grossi, Ugo; Tanda, Cinzia; Linari, Chiara; Elbetti, Claudio",Minerva surgery,38,1

While common, such difference-in-median characterizations of effectiveness are but one way to summarize how outcome distributions compare. This paper explores properties of median treatment effects (TEs) as indicators of treatment effectiveness. The paper's main focus is on decisionmaking based on median TEs and it proceeds by considering two paths a decisionmaker might follow. Along one, decisions are based on point-identified differences in medians alongside partially identified median differences; along the other decisions are based on point-identified differences in medians in conjunction with other point-identified parameters. On both paths familiar difference-in-median measures play some role yet in both the traditional standards are augmented with information that will often be relevant in assessing treatments' effectiveness. Implementing either approach is straightforward. In addition to its analytical results the paper considers several policy contexts in which such considerations arise. While the paper is framed by recently reported findings on treatments for COVID-19 and uses several such studies to explore empirically some properties of median-treatment-effect measures of effectiveness, its results should be broadly applicable.","Mullahy, John",Health economics,38,16

OBJECTIVE To determine the inter-rater reliability of the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) in a large cohort of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA The mJOA score is widely accepted as the primary outcome measure in DCM; it has been utilized in clinical practice guidelines and directly influences treatment recommendations, but its reliability has not been established. METHODS A refined version of the mJOA was administered to DCM patients by 2 or more blinded clinicians. Inter-rater reliability was measured using intra-class correlation (ICC), agreement, and mean difference for mJOA total score and subscores. Data were also analyzed with ANOVA for differences by mJOA severity (mild: 15-17, moderate: 12-14, severe: < 12), assessor, assessment order, previous surgery, age, and sex. RESULTS 154 DCM patients underwent 322 mJOA assessments (183 paired assessments). ICC was 0.88 for total mJOA, 0.79 for upper extremity (UE) motor, 0.84 for lower extremity (LE) motor, 0.63 for UE sensation, and 0.78 for urinary function subscores. Paired assessments were identical across all 4 subscores in 25%. The mean difference in mJOA was 0.93 points between assessors, and this differed by severity (mild: 0.68, moderate: 1.24, severe: 0.87, p = 0.001). Differences of > = 2 points occurred in 19%. Disagreement between mild and moderate severity occurred in 12% of patients. Other variables did not demonstrate significant relationships with mJOA scores. CONCLUSION The inter-rater reliability of total mJOA and its subscores is good, except for UE sensory function (moderate). However, the vast majority of assessments differed between observers, indicating that this measure should be interpreted carefully, particularly when near the threshold between severity categories, or when a patient is reassessed for deterioration. Further efforts to educate clinicians on administration and refine UE sensory subscore may enhance the reliability of this tool.Level of Evidence: 1.","Martin, Allan R; Jentzsch, Thorsten; Wilson, Jamie R F; Moghaddamjou, Ali; Jiang, Fan; Rienmuller, Anna; Badhiwala, Jetan H; Akbar, Muhammad A; Nater, Anick; Oitment, Colby; Ganau, Mario; Massicotte, Eric M; Fehlings, Michael G",Spine,38,6

In a first experiment, vaccinated chickens were challenged with an IBV Ark99-type virulent strain (AL/4614/98). Despite extensive sequence similarity between the vaccines, the more heterogeneous commercial ArkDPI was more efficient at reducing viral loads in challenged chickens, while respiratory signs and tracheal lesions were reduced similarly by either vaccine. A distinct subpopulation of the Ark challenge virus showing asparagine at S1 position 56 was consistently negatively selected by immune pressure originating from vaccination with either vaccine. Antibody levels and antibody avidity to Ark-type S1 protein were greater in CEK-ArkDPI-vaccinated chickens compared to chickens vaccinated with the more diverse commercial ArkDPI vaccine. Synchronous replication of a homogeneous virus population likely elicits clonal expansion and affinity maturation of a greater number of responding B cells compared to a diverse virus population continuously changing its proportion of phenotypes during replication. The results of a second experiment showed that during initial vaccine virus replication (24 and 48 hr postvaccination), the virus population showing increased diversity (commercial ArkDPI) achieved higher concentrations of IBV RNA in the trachea compared to the more homogenous virus. mRNA expression of genes associated with innate immune responses in the trachea 48 hr postvaccination generally showed greater upregulation in chickens vaccinated with the heterogeneous commercial ArkDPI vaccine compared to the CEK-adapted virus. The greater upregulation of these genes is likely associated with higher virus replication achieved by the heterogeneous commercial vaccine. Thus, while the adaptive antibody response was favored by the more homogenous structure of the CEK-ArkDPI vaccine population (higher antibody levels and antibody avidity), the innate immune response was favored by the more diverse viral population of the commercial ArkDPI. We confirmed previous results that distinct subpopulations in wild Ark challenge virus become selected by immune pressure originating from vaccination, and we concluded that the population structure of IBV vaccines impacts innate immune response, antibody avidity, and protection.","Zegpi, R A; Joiner, K S; van Santen, V L; Toro, H",Avian diseases,38,16

Along this latitudinal range blooms co-occur with abundant, intertidal populations of softshell clams, Mya arenaria. Prior work identified a naturally-occurring genetic mutation in Domain II α-subunit of the clams' voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV), which significantly reduces the binding affinity of the paralytic shellfish toxin, saxitoxin (STX). This mutation provides clams with resistance to the deleterious effects of STX, allowing them to continue feeding during Alexandrium spp. blooms and attain very high tissue toxicities. This study used genetic sequencing of the NaV mutation locus in clams from four coastal regions of the Bay of Fundy-Gulf of Maine and the mid-Atlantic to determine the percentage of clams in each region that possess the resistant NaV mutation. The genotype composition was related to the occurrence and magnitude of PSP outbreaks based on shellfish toxicity, primarily that of mussels, Mytilus edulis, used as a proxy for the prevalence and severity of Alexandrium blooms in each region. As hypothesized, the proportion of clams bearing the resistant mutation generally matched up well with the historical incidence and intensity of Alexandrium spp. blooms. The highest percentage of homozygote resistant clams (RR = 70.0%), and the lowest percentage of sensitive clams (SS = 4.5%) were found in eastern Gulf of Maine populations. Exceptions at a few sites where anomalously high numbers of M. arenaria with the resistant mutation were found despite the absence of blooms, may be attributable to larval gene flow. There was no evidence that Alexandrium blooms occurring in Northport Harbor, Long Island, have resulted in a shift in genotypic composition of the local clam population, presumably due to their low cell toxicity. Seasonal mismatch of highly vulnerable M. arenaria postset with toxic blooms at this latitude may also partly explain this result. This study provides strong supporting evidence that Alexandrium blooms can select for resistance to PSP-toxins in M. arenaria populations and proposes a mechanism for the persistence of the sensitive allele throughout the region. Implications for clam aquaculture (seeding) efforts, as well as for shellfish toxicity monitoring are discussed.","Phillips, Jennifer M; Bricelj, V Monica; Mitch, Maren; Cerrato, Robert M; MacQuarrie, Scott; Connell, Laurie B",Aquatic toxicology,38,1

They have established themselves as a protein family of high therapeutic potential. They have been found to play a role in a wide variety of diseases like cancer, fibrosis, and Alzheimer's. Within the galectin family, galectin- 1 and galectin- 3 have been widely studied and their roles and functions have now been well established. AREAS COVERED - In this review, we discuss the important advancements in development of galectin-1 & 3 inhibitors. All patents filed detailing the divergent strategies to inhibit galectin-1 & 3 from 2016 to present have been covered and discussed. EXPERT OPINION - Over the past couple of decades, distinct galectin inhibitors have been synthesized, reported and studied. Among all, the mono and disaccharides-based antagonists have been found to be considerably successful. However, the cumbersome synthetic route followed to develop this class of inhibitors, in addition to complexity involved in making selective modifications within these molecules has posed a significant challenge. Recently, there have been numerous reports on heterocyclic based galectin inhibitors. If these are established as potent galectin inhibitors, their ease of synthesis and tunability could overcome the potential drawbacks of carbohydrate-based inhibitors and could thus be exploited to develop efficient and highly specific galectin inhibitors.","Sethi, Aaftaab; Sanam, Swetha; Alvala, Ravi; Alvala, Mallika",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,38,16

While pathological innate immune activation is well documented in severe disease1, the impact of autoantibodies on disease progression is less defined. Here, we used a high-throughput autoantibody (AAb) discovery technique called Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling (REAP)7 to screen a cohort of 194 SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted proteins (the ""exoproteome""). We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity. In summary, these findings implicate a pathological role for exoproteome-directed autoantibodies in COVID-19 with diverse impacts on immune functionality and associations with clinical outcomes.","Wang, Eric Y; Mao, Tianyang; Klein, Jon; Dai, Yile; Huck, John D; Jaycox, Jillian R; Liu, Feimei; Zhou, Ting; Israelow, Benjamin; Wong, Patrick; Coppi, Andreas; Lucas, Carolina; Silva, Julio; Oh, Ji Eun; Song, Eric; Perotti, Emily S; Zheng, Neil S; Fischer, Suzanne; Campbell, Melissa; Fournier, John B; Wyllie, Anne L; Vogels, Chantal B F; Ott, Isabel M; Kalinich, Chaney C; Petrone, Mary E; Watkins, Anne E; Dela Cruz, Charles; Farhadian, Shelli F; Schulz, Wade L; Ma, Shuangge; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Ko, Albert I; Iwasaki, Akiko; Ring, Aaron M",Nature,38,29

This study investigates racial and socioeconomic disparities in SCS among Medicare patients with chronic pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients over the age of 18 with a primary diagnosis of postlaminectomy syndrome (ICD-10 M96.1) or chronic pain syndrome (ICD-10 G89.4) were identified in the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Claims Limited Data Set. We defined our outcome as SCS therapy by race and socioeconomic status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the variables associated with SCS. RESULTS We identified 1,244,927 patients treated between 2016 and 2019 with a primary diagnosis of postlaminectomy syndrome (PLS) or chronic pain syndrome (CPS). Of these patients, 59,182 (4.8%) received SCS. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, compared with White patients, Black (OR [95%CI], 0.62 [0.6-0.65], p < 0.001), Asian (0.66 [0.56-0.76], p < 0.001), Hispanic (0.86 [0.8-0.93], p < 0.001), and North American Native (0.62 [0.56-0.69], p < 0.001) patients were significantly less likely to receive SCS. In addition, patients who were dual-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid were significantly less likely to receive SCS than those eligible for Medicare only (OR = 0.38 [95% CI: 0.37-0.39], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that racial and socioeconomic disparities exist in SCS among Medicare and Medicaid patients with PLS and CPS. Further work is required to elucidate the complex etiology underlying these findings.","Jones, Mark R; Orhurhu, Vwaire; O'Gara, Brian; Brovman, Ethan Y; Rao, Nikhilesh; Vanterpool, Stephanie G; Poree, Lawrence; Gulati, Amitabh; Urman, Richard D",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,38,29

Objectives To investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 may induce cellular senescence in lung epithelial cells, leading to secretion of inflammatory cytokines, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Methods Autopsy lung tissue samples from eleven COVID-19 patients and sixty age-matched non-infected controls were analysed by immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 and markers of cellular senescence (SenTraGor, p16INK4A) and key SASP cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6). We also investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 infection of an epithelial cell line induces senescence and cytokine secretion. Measurements and Main Results SARS-CoV-2 was detected by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy predominantly in alveolar type-2 (AT2) cells, which also expressed the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), a critical entry receptor for this virus. In COVID-19 samples, AT2 cells displayed increased markers of senescence [p16INK4A, SenTraGor staining positivity in 12±1.2% of cells compared to 1.7±0.13% in non-infected controls (p<0.001)], with markedly increased expression of interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 (p<0.001). Infection of epithelial cells (Vero E6) with SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro induced senescence and DNA damage (increased SenTraGor and γ-H2AX), and reduced proliferation (Ki67) compared to uninfected control cells (p<0.01). Conclusions We demonstrate that in severe COVID-19 patients, AT2 cells are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and show senescence and expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells may induce senescence and inflammation, indicating that cellular senescence may be an important molecular mechanism of severe COVID-19.","Evangelou, Konstantinos; Veroutis, Dimitris; Foukas, Periklis G.; Paschalaki, Koralia; Lagopati, Nefeli; Dimitriou, Marios; Papaspyropoulos, Angelos; Hazapis, Orsalia; Polyzou, Aikaterini; Havaki, Sophia; Kotsinas, Athanassios; Kittas, Christos; Tzioufas, Athanasios G.; de Leval, Laurence; Vassilakos, Demetris; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Karakasiliotis, Ioannis; Barnes, Peter J; Gorgoulis, Vassilis G.",bioRxiv,38,1

This paper describes a scoping review and identifies connections between telework and sustainability outcomes from previous academic studies. These connections were categorised, and are discussed, based on their contributions to different United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Most research was found to focus on countries classified as having a very high human development index status. The SWOT matrix technique was used to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses identified in the existing literature, and the threats and opportunities for future work. This aims to ensure policy coherence so that strategies to promote one outcome, such as economic productivity improvements, do not undermine another, such as improved health. Practical implications and research opportunities were identified across a range of SDG impact areas, including good health and well-being, gender equality, reduced inequality, climate mitigation, sustainable cities, and resilient communities. Overall, our impression is that increased rates of telework present an important opportunity to improve sustainability outcomes. However, it will be important that integrated and holistic policy is developed that mitigates key risks.","Moglia, M.; Hopkins, J.; Bardoel, A.",Sustainability,38,1

In this sense, ICT in general, and the construction of a personal learning environment (PLE) in particular, become allies to this end. Moreover, they have been key during the times of pandemic when formal education institutions all over the planet have been forced to close. The present study has the objective of describing the tools used by students for the purpose of searching for information, creating content, and sharing and interacting in informal environments. The methodology follows a quantitative approach under a non-experimental and transactional design. A questionnaire is applied to a probabilistic stratified sample (n=1187) comprising university students from different programs at the Universidad Nacional (Costa Rica). The main findings suggest that the search and management of information, in addition to the tools used for sharing and interacting, are the components related to a higher number of digital resources, while being less used in activities related to content creation. Between groups, differences regarding the usage of tools have been detected according to the variables of sex, age and field of study. It is recommended that universities introduce new methodologies, and promote more efficient strategies that enable raising awareness about the relevance of learning with technology, as well as to recognize the contributions of complementary informal learning to formal education. The combination of both aspects will facilitate continuous and permanent learning for the acquisition of professional skills, especially within the framework of the limitations and demands derived by the global pandemic situation caused by the COVID-19.","Garcia-Martinez, J.

Many tree crown delineation methods have difficulty in closed-canopy forests and do not leverage multiple datasets. Methods to classify individual species are often accurate for common species, but perform poorly for less common species and when applied to new sites. We ran a data science competition to help identify effective methods for delineation of individual crowns and classification to determine species identity. This competition included data from multiple sites to assess the methods’ ability to generalize learning across multiple sites simultaneously, and transfer learning to novel sites where the methods were not trained. Six teams, representing 4 countries and 9 individual participants, submitted predictions. Methods from a previous competition were also applied and used as the baseline to understand whether the methods are changing and improving over time. The best delineation method was based on an instance segmentation pipeline, closely followed by a Faster R-CNN pipeline, both of which outperformed the baseline method. However, the baseline (based on a growing region algorithm) still performed well as did the Faster R-CNN. All delineation methods generalized well and transferred to novel forests effectively. The best species classification method was based on a two-stage fully connected neural network, which significantly outperformed the baseline (a random forest and Gradient boosting ensemble). The classification methods generalized well, with all teams training their models using multiple sites simultaneously, but the predictions from these trained models generally failed to transfer effectively to a novel site. Classification performance was strongly influenced by the number of field-based species IDs available for training the models, with most methods predicting common species well at the training sites. Classification errors (i.e., species misidentification) were most common between similar species in the same genus and different species that occur in the same habitat. The best methods handled class imbalance well and learned unique spectral features even with limited data. Most methods performed better than baseline in detecting new (untrained) species, especially in the site with no training data. Our experience further shows that data science competitions are useful for comparing different methods through the use of a standardized dataset and set of evaluation criteria, which highlights promising approaches and common challenges, and therefore advances the ecological and remote sensing field as a whole.","Graves, Sarah Jane; Marconi, Sergio; Stewart, Dylan; Harmon, Ira; Weinstein, Ben G.; Kanazawa, Yuzi; Scholl, Victoria M; Joseph, Maxwell B; McClinchy, Joseph; Browne, Luke; Sullivan, Megan K; Estrada-Villegas, Sergio; Tusa, Eduardo; Wang, Daisy Zhe; Singh, Aditya; Bohlman, Stephanie A; Zare, Alina; White, Ethan P.",bioRxiv,38,6

Less visible are the grassroots, organizational initiatives based on reciprocity that emerged across the region in response to the health crisis and in the context of national lockdowns. The pandemic has deepened the danger of famine among the most vulnerable in rural and urban areas. In response, grassroots organizations using reciprocal practices are mobilizing resources to provide food and to prevent and manage the disease. We ask two questions: What reciprocity-based practices are grassroots organizations in the Andes able to marshal in support of basic provisioning during the COVID-19 pandemic? And what is the potential of these practices to shape alternatives to development post-COVID-19? We analyze reciprocity practices as hybrid spaces that combine Andean worldviews, market and non-market motivations and political claims against the state. Based on the case studies of the Cauca Regional Indigenous Council in Colombia (CRIC) and The National Campesino Movement (FECAOL) in Ecuador, this paper develops three arguments. First, as a socio-natural actor, the pandemic forces Andean communities and their organizations to coordinate their efforts to mantain life. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzes long-standing recognition of grassroots processes and claims in the Colombian and Ecuadorian Andes. The revitalization by the CRIC of reciprocity-based practices such as barters and local markets strongly links self-provisioning with the mobilization of its Indigenous identity and struggles for autonomy. These practices also forge a horizontal 'solidarity' with other social movements, consolidating a common framework of self-protection against the neoliberal state. For example, FECAOL does politics and builds coalitions through reciprocity-based action as an expression of its desire to engage with the state at different scales. Fair markets and agroecological baskets are combined with barter and gifts to provide for populations in need and to shift oppressive power-relations in the agro-chain and towards a holistic, bottom-up construction of the 'public' to address societal needs. Finally, studied grassroots organizations build coalitions and present their visions of a diverse or mixed economy to the society at large to erode the dominance of capitalism. To become a 'counter-movement' post-COVID-19, we conclude, they need to scale up to broader levels of society.","Cordoba, D.; Peredo, A. M.; Chaves, P.",World Development,38,1

The paper provides an overview of the various ways in which demarketing has been applied in a tourism context and assesses the relative value of demarketing as a means of contributing to sustainability and degrowing tourism. It is argued that demarketing can make a substantial contribution to degrowing tourism at a local or even regional scale, but that the capacity to shift visitation in space and time also highlights a core weakness with respect to its contribution at other scales. The paper concludes by noting that the concept of degrowth also needs to be best understood as a continuum of which demarketing is only one aspect.","Hall, C.

In 2018, Indonesia had a lower exclusive breastfeeding rate of 37% at 6 months postpartum; ranging from 20% to 56%, showing unequal breastfeeding support throughout the country. The World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (Ten Steps) in 1989, later embedded in UNICEF’s Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) program in 1991. The BFHI aims to encourage maternity facilities worldwide to ensure adequate education and support for breastfeeding mothers by adhering to the Ten Steps and complying with the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes. An Indonesian survey in 2011 found that less than one in 10 government hospitals implemented the Ten Steps. It has been common for Indonesian health services to collaborate with infant formula companies. While no Indonesian hospitals are currently BFHI-accredited, the WHO/UNICEF Ten Steps (updated in 2018) have been adopted in Indonesia’s national regulation of maternity facilities since 2012. Internationally, implementation of the Ten Steps individually and as a package has been associated with benefits to breastfeeding rates and maternal and infant health. However, to date, few studies have examined the impact of implementing the Ten Steps in economic terms. This study aims to measure the economic benefit of Ten Steps implementation in an Indonesian hospital. Methods: The study was conducted in January 2020 in Airlangga University Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia, which has implemented the Ten Steps since it was established in 2012. To understand and generate evidence on the social value of the Ten Steps, we conducted a “Social Return on Investment (SROI)” study of implementing the Ten Steps in this maternity facility. To estimate the costs relating to the Ten Steps we interviewed the financial and nursing managers, a senior pediatrician, and senior midwife due to their detailed understanding of the implementation of the Ten Steps in the hospital. The interview was guided by a questionnaire which we developed based on the 2018 WHO/UNICEF Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. The analysis was supported with peer-reviewed literature on the benefits of Ten Steps breastfeeding outcomes. Results: The total per annum value of investment (cost) required to implement Ten Steps in Airlangga University Hospital was US$ 972,303. The estimate yearly benefit was US$ 22,642,661. The social return on the investment in implementing Ten Steps in this facility was calculated to be US$ 49 (sensitivity analysis: US$ 18-65). Thus, for every US$ 1 invested in Ten Steps implementation by Airlangga Hospital could be expected to generate approximately US$ 49 of benefit. Conclusions: Investment in the Ten Steps implementation in this Surabaya maternity facility produced a social value 49 times greater than the cost of investment. This provides novel evidence of breastfeeding as a public health tool, demonstrating the value of the investment, in terms of social impact for mothers, babies, families, communities, and countries. Breastfeeding has the potential to help address inequity throughout the lifetime by providing the equal best start to all infants regardless of their background. Indonesia’s initial moves towards implementing the WHO/UNICEF Ten Steps can be strengthened by integrating all elements into the national regulation and health care system.","Pramono, Andini Y.; Desborough, Jane L.; Smith, Julie P.; Bourke, Siobhan",Yale J Biol Med,38,28

DIssE had three base substitutions within the leader sequence and also a deletion of nine nucleotides located at the junction of the leader and the remaining genomic sequence. A system was developed for generating DI RNAs to study the mechanism of MHV RNA replication. A cDNA copy of DIssE RNA was placed downstream of T7 RNA polymerase promoter to generate DI RNAs capable of extremely efficient replication in the presence of a helper virus. We demonstrated that, in the DI RNA-transfected cells, the leader sequence of these DI RNAs was switched to that of the helper virus during one round of replication. This high-frequency leader sequence exchange was not observed if a nine-nucleotide stretch at the junction between the leader and the remaining DI sequence was deleted. This observation suggests that a free leader RNA is utilized for the replication of MHV RNA.","Makino, S; Lai, M M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,38,12

In this study, we compared the capacity of porcine IFN-alpha, -beta and -gamma, or a combination of them, to protect IBRS-2 cells (porcine kidney cells) from infection with pseudorabies virus (PRV). The results demonstrated that porcine IFN-beta (PoIFN-beta) was the most efficient of the three IFNs in conferring resistance PRV infection; 100 U/mL PoIFN-beta inhibited PRV plaque formation 5.3-fold. Compared with PoIFN-beta, porcine IFN-gamma (PoIFN-gamma) was less capable of inhibiting PRV plaque formation (3.3-fold inhibition). Porcine IFN-alpha (PoIFN-alpha) had the least capability of the three PoIFNs, and inhibited PRV plaque formation only 1.26-fold. The inhibitory capacity increased to only 2.3-fold with a treatment of 12,800 U/mL PoIFN-alpha. A combination of PoIFN-gamma and PoIFN-alpha or PoIFN-beta inhibited PRV plaque formation 12.8-fold or 100-fold, respectively. Treatment of IBRS-2 cells with PoIFN-alpha/beta and PoIFN-gamma inhibited PRV replication 29- or 146-fold. Additionally, real-time PCR analyses of the PRV immediate early (IE) gene revealed that IE mRNA expression was profoundly decreased in cells stimulated with PoIFN-alpha/beta and PoIFN-gamma (23.8-133.0-fold) compared with vehicle-treated cells. All the findings indicate that PoIFN-gamma acts synergistically with other PoIFNs (PoIFN-alpha and -beta) to potently inhibit PRV replication in vitro.","Yao, Qingxia; Qian, Ping; Cao, Yi; He, Yannan; Si, Youhui; Xu, Zhuofei; Chen, Huanchun",European cytokine network,38,1

The patients were divided into two groups, an early LLH group (ELLH group) and a recent LLH group (RLLH group), based on the surgical approach used for the left hepatic pedicle. RESULTS A total of 72 cases of LLH (26 ELLH and 46 RLLH) were identified. The RLLH group exhibited a shorter median operative time, median length of hospital stay, and lower median blood loss compared to the ELLH group (182, 162.5-223.7 versus 232.5, 200-357.5 minutes, P < .01; 5, 4.2-7 versus 7, 6-8.7 days, P < .05; 150, 100-257.5 versus 300, 200-337.5 mL, P < .05, respectively).

Although several case series of the robotic Whipple procedure have been reported, detailed descriptions of operative techniques and a clear pathway for adopting this technology are lacking. METHODS We present a focused review of the procedure as it applies to pancreatic cancer and describe our clinical pathway for the robotic Whipple procedure used in pancreatic cancer and review the outcomes of our early experience. A systematic review of the literature is provided, focusing on the indications, variations in surgical techniques, complications, and oncological results of the robotic Whipple procedure. RESULTS A clinical pathway has been defined for preoperative training of surgeons, the requirements for hospital privileges, patient selection, and surgical techniques for the robotic Whipple procedure. The robotic technique for managing malignant lesions of the pancreas head is safe when following well-established guidelines for adopting the technology. Preliminary data demonstrate that perioperative convalescence may exceed end points when compared with the open technique. CONCLUSIONS The robotic Whipple procedure is a minimally invasive approach for select patients as part of multidisciplinary management of periampullary lesions in tertiary centers where clinicians have developed robotic surgical programs. Prospective trials are needed to define the short- and long-term benefits of the robotic Whipple procedure.","Rashid, Omar M; Mullinax, John E; Pimiento, Jose M; Meredith, Kenneth L; Malafa, Mokenge P",Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,38,33

Pathogen determination through blood culture is the gold standard for diagnosis but has limitations due to low sensitivity. Recently, circulating DNAs derived from pathogenic organisms were found in the plasma of patients with sepsis and were further proved to be more sensitive biomarkers for the diagnosis of the pathogen origin in sepsis. However, the fundamental molecular characteristics of circulating DNA in patients with sepsis remain unclear. Here, we used specific PCR and Sanger sequencing to verify the microbiology culture results via the corresponding plasma circulating DNA. We analyzed the composition and molecular characteristics of circulating DNA in septic patients using next-generation sequencing technology. We showed the presence of pathogen-derived circulating DNA in the plasma of patients with sepsis. The sizes of circulating DNA fragments derived from pathogenic bacteria showed a skewed unimodal distribution, while those derived from host cells showed a normal unimodal distribution. Lengths of fragments at peak concentration for both origins ranged from 150 bp to 200 bp, and reads mapping to pathogenic bacteria genome distributed uniformly on the reference. Our findings have improved our understanding of microbial circulating DNA in patients with sepsis as a potential methodology for the accurate diagnosis of sepsis, especially in light of an urgent need for such a diagnosis associated with the COVID-19 infection.","Liao, Wei; Zuo, Xiaoyu; Lin, Guowang; Zhou, Yaqing; Fu, Yonghong; Cai, Shaohang; Wei, Pan-Pan; Liu, Yu-Xiang; Liu, Yang; Ma, Gang; Bei, Jin-Xin",Discovery medicine,38,20

Different viral load and host response related to genetic and immune background are probably the reasons for these differences. We aimed to sought clinical and pathological correlation that justifies the different clinical outcomes among COVID-19 autopsies cases. MethodsMinimally invasive autopsy was performed on forty-seven confirmed COVID-19 patients from May-July, 2020. Electronic medical record of all patients was collected and a comprehensive histopathological evaluation was performed. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, special stain, western blotting and post-mortem real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on fresh lung tissue were performed. ResultsWe show that 5/47 (10,6%) patients present a progressive decline in oxygenation index for acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), low compliance levels, interstitial fibrosis, high -SMA+ cells/protein expression, high collagens I/III deposition and NETs(P<0.05), named as fibrotic phenotype (N=5). Conversely, 10/47 (21,2%) patients demonstrated progressive increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio, high pulmonary compliance levels, preserved elastic framework, increase thrombus formation and high platelets and D-dimer levels at admission (P<0.05), named as thrombotic phenotype. While 32/47 (68,1%) had a mixed phenotypes between both ones. ConclusionsWe believe that categorization of patients based on these two phenotypes can be used to develop prognostic tools and potential therapies since the PaO2/FiO2 ratio variation and D-dimer levels correlate with the underlying fibrotic or thrombotic pathologic process, respectively; which may indicate possible clinical outcome of the patient.","Batah, Sabrina; Benatti, Maira; Siyuan, Li; Telini, Wagner; Barbosa, Jamile; Menezes, Marcelo; Nadai, Tales; Keyla, S; Vaswani, Chirag; Gupta, Sahil; Zamboni, Dario; Wada, Danilo; Calado, Rodrigo; Oliveira, Rene; Louzada-Junior, Paulo; Auxiliadora-Martins, Maria; Veras, Flavio; Cunha, Larissa; Cunha, Thiago; Luppino-Assad, Rodrigo; Balancin, Marcelo; Morais, Sirlei; Martins, Ronaldo; Arruda, Eurico; Chahud, Fernando; Koenigkam-Santos, Marcel; Cetlin, Andrea; Cunha, Fernando; Santos, Claudia; Capelozzi, Vera; Fukuoka, Junya; Duarte-Achcar, Rosane; Fabro, Alexandre",,38,30

Adherence to the control measures depends on the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAPs) toward COVID-19 disease in health-care professionals. The present study was conducted among health-care professionals in Jaipur. The objective was to evaluate the KAPs about COVID-19 among health-care professionals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 385 participants took part in the study. A self-designed questionnaire was filled by the participants online (Google Form). The knowledge of the participants was assessed using 12 questions. Attitude and practices of the participants were assessed by two questions for each. RESULTS: Among the study completers, 52.20% were male, 71.42% of the participants were aged above 30 years, and 59.22% were nurse. The knowledge score was approximately 90%. The majority of the participants had a strong conviction that India can overcome this infectious disease in the near future. Multiple regression analysis found that good knowledge score of COVID-19 was associated with lower negative attitudes and less risky practices (P &lt; 0.001).

There is no existing literature that focuses on such impact on RD organisations in any jurisdictions, nor RD populations across multiple jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to RD organisations between April and May 2020. Quantitative and qualitative data on the impact of COVID-19 on RD organisations and patients were collected from the organisation representative's perspective. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. A follow-up focus group meeting was conducted in August 2020 to validate the survey findings and to discuss specific needs, support and recommendations for sustainable healthcare systems during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 80 RD organisations from Australia, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, India, Japan, mainland China, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan participated in the study. Of all, 89% were concerned about the impact of pandemic on their organisations. Results indicate that 63% of the organisations functioned at a reduced capacity and 42% stated a decrease in funding as their biggest challenge. Overall, 95% believed their patients were impacted, particularly in healthcare access, social lives, physical health, psychological health and financial impact. Specifically, 43% identified the reduced healthcare access as their top impact, followed by 26% about the impact on daily living and social life. Focus group meeting discussed differential impact across jurisdictions and point towards telemedicine and digitalisation as potential solutions. CONCLUSIONS: This serves as the first study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on RD patients and organisations across multiple jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region, identifying major themes on the impact on both RD patients and organisations. By including 80 organisations from ten jurisdictions, our study presents the most comprehensive assessment of the pandemic's impact to date. It highlights the need for mental health support and sheds light on moving towards telemedicine and digitalisation of organisation operation, which constitutes a sustainable model in times of pandemics and beyond.","Chung, Claudia Ching Yan; Ng, Yvette Nga Chung; Jain, Ritu; Chung, Brian Hon Yin",Orphanet J Rare Dis,38,16

Generally, antibodies are utilized as the biorecognition molecules in the LFA. However, antibodies selected using an in vivo process not only may risk killing the animal hosts and causing errors between different batches but also their range is restricted by the refrigerated conditions used to store them. To avoid these limitations, aptamers screened by an in vitro process have been studied as biorecognition molecules in LFAs. Based on the sandwich or competitive format, the aptamer-based LFA can accomplish on-site detection of target analytes. Since aptamers have a distinctive ability to undergo conformational changes, the adsorption-desorption format has also been exploited to detect target analytes in aptamer-based LFAs. This paper reviews developments in aptamer-based LFAs in the last three years for the detection of target analytes. Three formats of aptamer-based LFAs, i.e., sandwich, competitive, and adsorption-desorption, are described in detail. Based on these formats, signal amplification strategies and multiplexed detection are discussed in order to provide an overview of aptamer-based LFAs for on-site detection of target analytes. In addition, the potential commercialization and future perspectives of aptamer-based LFAs for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 are given to support the COVID-19 pandemic.","Huang, Lei; Tian, Shulin; Zhao, Wenhao; Liu, Ke; Ma, Xing; Guo, Jinhong",Biosens Bioelectron,38,1

Data on hepatic histopathological findings in COVID-19 is scarce. AIM: To characterize hepatic pathological findings in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020192813), following PRISMA guidelines. Eligible trials were those including patients of any age and COVID-19 diagnosis based on a molecular test. Histopathological reports from deceased COVID-19 patients undergoing autopsy or liver biopsy were reviewed. Articles including less than ten patients were excluded. Proportions were pooled using random-effects models. Q statistic and I 2 were used to assess heterogeneity and levels of evidence, respectively. RESULTS: We identified 18 studies from 7 countries; all were case reports and case series from autopsies. All the patients were over 15 years old, and 67.2% were male. We performed a meta-analysis of 5 studies, including 116 patients. Pooled prevalence estimates of liver histopathological findings were hepatic steatosis 55.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 46.2-63.8], congestion of hepatic sinuses 34.7% (95%CI: 7.9-68.4), vascular thrombosis 29.4% (95%CI: 0.4-87.2), fibrosis 20.5% (95%CI: 0.6-57.9), Kupffer cell hyperplasia 13.5% (95%CI: 0.6-54.3), portal inflammation 13.2% (95%CI: 0.1-48.8), and lobular inflammation 11.6% (95%CI: 0.3-35.7). We also identified the presence of venous outflow obstruction, phlebosclerosis of the portal vein, herniated portal vein, periportal abnormal vessels, hemophagocytosis, and necrosis. CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence of hepatic steatosis and vascular thrombosis as major histological liver features. Other frequent findings included portal and lobular inflammation and Kupffer cell hyperplasia or proliferation.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the prevalence and to determine some associated factors of ED among a sample of adult Egyptian male patients with T2DM. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 150 adult male patients with T2DM (aged 40-60 years) who attended the outpatient clinic of Diabetes in Alexandria Main University hospital. They were evaluated for the presence of ED which was assessed by the validated Arabic-translated five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) questionnaire. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, total serum cholesterol, HDL-C, total serum testosterone (TT) and urinary albumin creatinine ratio (uACR) were measured for all study subjects. RESULTS: The prevalence of ED was 80% among the studied sample. Significant negative correlation was found between IIEF-5 score and age, duration of diabetes, FBG and urinary ACR; while there was a significant positive correlation between IIEF-5 score and serum total testosterone. On performing multiple linear regression analysis for the parameters affecting IIEF-5 questionnaire score, TT, urinary ACR, age and FBG were the independent predictors of ED. CONCLUSION: ED was a common finding in our sample of Egyptian men with T2DM.

Underpowering and lack of reproducibility due to small sample sizes have weakened conclusions of these investigations. In other disciplines, such as neuroeconomics and social sciences, crowdsourcing has been extensively utilized as a data collection tool, and a means to increase sample sizes. Recent methodological advances allow scientists, for the first time, to test online more complex cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks. Here we review the nascent literature on the use of online crowdsourcing in cognitive and human systems neuroscience. These investigations take advantage of the ability to reliably track the activity of a participant's computer keyboard, mouse, and eye gaze in the context of large-scale studies online that involve diverse research participant pools. Crowdsourcing allows for testing the generalizability of behavioral hypotheses in real-life environments that are less accessible to lab-designed investigations. Crowdsourcing is further useful when in-laboratory studies are limited, for example during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss current limitations of crowdsourcing research, and suggest pathways to address them.

Among posttranslational modifications initiated at the ER level, glycosylation is the most common reaction. However, our understanding of the impact of glycosylation on the ER structure remains unclear. Here, we show that exostosin-1 (EXT1) glycosyltransferase, an enzyme involved in N-glycosylation, is a key regulator of ER morphology and dynamics. We have integrated multiomics and superresolution imaging to characterize the broad effect of EXT1 inactivation, including the ER shape-dynamics-function relationships in mammalian cells. We have observed that inactivating EXT1 induces cell enlargement and enhances metabolic switches such as protein secretion. In particular, suppressing EXT1 in mouse thymocytes causes developmental dysfunctions associated with the ER network extension. Last, our data illuminate the physical and functional aspects of the ER proteome-glycome-lipidome structure axis, with implications in biotechnology and medicine.","Kerselidou, Despoina; Dohai, Bushra Saeed; Nelson, David R; Daakour, Sarah; De Cock, Nicolas; Hassoun, Zahra Al Oula; Kim, Dae-Kyum; Olivet, Julien; El Assal, Diana C; Jaiswal, Ashish; Alzahmi, Amnah; Saha, Deeya; Pain, Charlotte; Matthijssens, Filip; Lemaitre, Pierre; Herfs, Michael; Chapuis, Julien; Ghesquiere, Bart; Vertommen, Didier; Kriechbaumer, Verena; Knoops, Kèvin; Lopez-Iglesias, Carmen; van Zandvoort, Marc; Lambert, Jean-Charles; Hanson, Julien; Desmet, Christophe; Thiry, Marc; Lauersen, Kyle J; Vidal, Marc; Van Vlierberghe, Pieter; Dequiedt, Franck; Salehi-Ashtiani, Kourosh; Twizere, Jean-Claude",Sci.

We analyzed a series of critically ill COVID-19 patients to see if any of our dataset's clinical variables were associated with patient outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of the Hospital in Pordenone from March 11, 2020, to April 17, 2020. Patients' characteristics of survivors and deceased groups were compared. The variables with a different distribution between the two groups were implemented in a generalized linear regression model (LM) and in an Artificial Neural Network (NN) model to verify the ""robustness"" of the association with mortality. RESULTS: In the considered period, we reviewed the data of 22 consecutive patients: 8 died. The causes of death were a severe respiratory failure (3), multi-organ failure (1), septic shock (1), pulmonary thromboembolism (2), severe hemorrhage (1). Lymphocyte and the platelet count were significantly lower in the group of deceased patients (p-value 0.043 and 0.020, respectively; cut-off values: 660/mm3; 280,000/mm3, respectively). Prothrombin time showed a statistically significant trend (p-value= 0.065; cut-off point: 16.8/sec). The LM model (AIC= 19.032), compared to the NN model (Mean Absolute Error, MAE = 0.02), was substantially alike (MSE 0.159 vs. 0.136). CONCLUSIONS: In the context of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and lengthening of prothrombin time were strictly correlated with higher mortality. Additional clinical data are needed to be able to validate this prognostic score.","Venturini, Sergio; Orso, Daniele; Cugini, Francesco; Crapis, Massimo; Fossati, Sara; Callegari, Astrid; Pellis, Tommaso; Tomasello, Dario Carmelo; Tonizzo, Maurizio; Grembiale, Alessandro; D039,; Andrea, Natascia; Vetrugno, Luigi; Bove, Tiziana",Acta Biomed,38,30

To initiate infection, the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 requires proteolytic processing mediated by host proteases. Among the host proteases proposed to carry out this activation is the cysteine protease cathepsin L. Inhibiting cathepsin L has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for treating COVID-19. SLV213 (K777) is an orally administered small molecule protease inhibitor that exhibits in vitro activity against a range of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. To confirm efficacy in vivo, K777 was evaluated in an African green monkey (AGM) model of COVID-19. A pilot experiment was designed to test K777 in a prophylactic setting, animals were pre-treated with 100mg/kg K777 (N=4) or vehicle (N=2) before inoculation with SARS-CoV-2. Initial data demonstrated that K777 treatment reduced pulmonary pathology compared to vehicle-treated animals. A second study was designed to test activity in a therapeutic setting, with K777 treatment (33 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) initiated 8 hours after exposure to the virus. In both experiments, animals received K777 daily via oral gavage for 7 days. Vehicle-treated animals exhibited higher lung weights, pleuritis, and diffuse alveolar damage. In contrast, lung pathology was reduced in K777-treated monkeys, and histopathological analyses confirmed the lack of diffuse alveolar damage. Antiviral effects were further demonstrated by quantitative reductions in viral load of samples collected from upper and lower airways. These preclinical data support the potential for early SLV213 treatment in COVID-19 patients to prevent severe lung pathology and disease progression.","Frueh, Felix W; Maneval, Daniel C; Bohm, Rudolph P; Dufour, Jason P; Blair, Robert V; Simpson, Sierra; Powell, Kathy; Aye, Pyone P; Golden, Nadia A; ROY, CHAD J; Spencer, Sky; Russell-Lodrigue, Kasi; Plante, Kenneth S; Plante, Jessica A; McKerrow, James H; Rappaport, Jay",,38,30

This study's purpose is to examine and compare viewpoints of stakeholders in relation to addressing the financial impact of the pandemic in hopes of capturing innovative and effective pathways for universities. Because the purpose involved describing and comparing these viewpoints, the researcher selected a unique mixed method, Q methodology [Q] for this study. In Q, participants sort statements related to the topic into a grid such that their Q-sort provides a snapshot of their subjectivity. Participants' sorts are grouped empirically into factors, each representing unique viewpoints. Three distinct viewpoints emerged: 1) Focus on teaching mission and students, 2) University as a business, and 3) University as community. Views 1 and 3 were dominated by university faculty while View 2 was dominated by non-faculty including administrators and staff. Q's determination of distinguishing statements within each view provides the ability to compare these views' uniqueness. The three views and consensus among the views represent rejection of decisions to lay off faculty or close programs, among others, in order to balance university finances. The importance of tenured faculty in relationship to shared governance and academic freedom is especially stressed by two of the viewpoints.

Remediation of these pollutants by conventional approaches is both technically and economically challenging. Bacillus endospores are highly resistant to most physical assaults and are capable of long-term persistence in soil. Spores can be engineered to express on their surface important enzymes for bioremediation purposes. We have developed a Bacillus thuringiensis spore platform system that can display a high density of proteins on the spore surface. The spore surface-tethered enzymes exhibit enhanced activity and stability relative to free enzymes in soil and water environments. In this study, we evaluated a Bacillus thuringiensis spore-display platform as a bioremediation tool against ATR. The Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP atzA determinant, an ATR chlorohydrolase important to the detoxification of ATR, was expressed as a fusion protein linked to the attachment domain of the BclA spore surface nap layer protein and expressed in B. thuringiensis Spores from this strain are decorated with AtzA N-terminally linked on the surface of the spores. The recombinant spores were assayed for ATR detoxification in liquid and soil environments and enzyme kinetics and stability were assessed. We successfully demonstrated the utility of this spore-based enzyme display system to detoxify ATR in water and laboratory soil samples.IMPORTANCEAtrazine is one of the most widely applied herbicides in the U.S. Midwestern states. The long environmental half-life of atrazine has contributed to the contamination of surface and ground water by atrazine and its chlorinated metabolites. The toxic properties of ATR have raised public health and ecological concerns. However, remediation of ATR by conventional approaches has proven to be costly and inefficient. We developed a novel B. thuringiensis spore platform system that is capable of long-term persistence in soil and can be engineered to surface express a high density of enzymes useful for bioremediation purposes. The enzymes are stably attached to the surface of the spore exosporium layer. The spore-based system will likely prove useful for remediation of other environmental pollutants, as well.","Hsieh, Hsin-Yeh; Lin, Chung-Ho; Hsu, Shu-Yu; Stewart, George C",,38,6

Maternal health is a great concern when treating pregnant women fighting this triad of diseases, which is highly prevalent in South Africa. MicroRNAs are involved in fine-tuning of physiological processes. Disruptions to the balance of this minute protein can lead to various physiological changes that are sometimes pathological. RECENT FINDINGS: MicroRNAs have recently been implicated in PE and have been linked to the anti-angiogenic imbalance evident in PE. Recent in silico studies have identified potential host miRNAs with anti-viral properties against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have demonstrated dysregulated expression of several miRNAs in HIV-1 infection along with the ability of HIV-1 to downregulate anti-viral host microRNAs. This review has highlighted the significant gap in literature on the potential of miRNAs in women with HIV-associated PE in synergy with the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, this review has provided evidence of the critical role that the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of miRNA plays in viral infections and PE, thereby providing a foundation for further research investigating the potential of therapeutic miRNA development with fewer side-effects for pregnant women.","Abel, Tashlen; Moodley, Jagidesa; Naicker, Thajasvarie",Curr Hypertens Rep,38,16

Rapid response and timely modifications in the emergency department (ED) for infection control are paramount to maintaining basic medical services and preventing the spread of COVID-19. This study presents the unique measure of combining a fever screening station (FSS) and graded approach to isolation and testing in a Taiwanese medical center. METHODS: An FSS was immediately set up outside the ED on January 27, 2019. A graded approach was adopted to stratify patients into ""high risk,"" ""intermediate risk,"" and ""undetermined risk"" for both isolation and testing. RESULTS: A total of 3755 patients were screened at the FSS, with 80.3% visiting the ED from home, 70.9% having no travel history, 21.4% having traveled to Asia, and 10.0% of TVGH staff. Further, 54.9% had fever, 35.5% had respiratory symptoms, 3.2% had gastrointestinal symptoms, 0.6% experienced loss of smell, and 3.1% had no symptoms; 81.3% were discharged, 18.6% admitted, and 0.1% died. About 1.9% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 10.3% to the general ward, and 6.4% were isolated. Two patients tested positive for COVID-19 (0.1%) and 127 (3.4%) tested positive for atypical infection; 1471 patients were tested for COVID-19; 583 were stratified as high-risk, 781 as intermediate-risk, and 107 as undetermined-risk patients. CONCLUSION: Rapid response for infection control is a paramount in the ED to confront the COVID-19 outbreak. The FFS helped divide the flow of high- and intermediate-risk patients; it also decreased the ED workload during a surge of febrile patients. A graded approach to testing uses risk stratification to prevent nosocomial infection of asymptomatic patients. A graded approach to isolation enables efficient allocation of scarce medical resources according to risk stratification.","Chang, Julia Chia-Yu; Chen, You-Hsu; Lin, Meng-Chen; Li, Yi-Jing; Hsu, Teh-Fu; Huang, Hsien-Hao; Yen, David Hung-Tsang",J Chin Med Assoc,38,16

Although the proportion of affected patients remains to be determined, physicians are increasingly being confronted with patients reporting respiratory symptoms and impairment beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. In face of limited evidence, the Swiss Society for Pulmonology established a working group to address this area of unmet need and formulated diagnostic and treatment recommendations for the care of patients with pulmonary long COVID (LC). METHOD: The Swiss COVID Lung Study group and Swiss Society for Pulmonology (SSP) formulated 13 questions addressing the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary LC. A survey within the SSP special interest groups involved in care of LC patients was conducted in Switzerland. A CORE process/Delphi-like process was used to formulate recommendations. Forty experienced pulmonologists replied to the first survey and 22 completed the second follow-up survey. Agreement of &#8805;70% consensus led to formulation of a recommendation. RESULTS: The participants in the survey reached consensus and formulated a strong recommendation for regarding the following points. Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 should have a pulmonary assessment including pulmonary function tests. Symptomatic subjects affected by COVID-19, including those with mild disease, should benefit from a pulmonary follow-up. Persistent respiratory symptoms after COVID-19 should be investigated by a pulmonary follow-up including plethysmography, diffusion capacity measurement, and blood gases analysis. Individuals having suffered from COVID-19 and who present with persistent respiratory symptoms should be offered a rehabilitation. Additional questions were given moderateor weak recommendations for. The panel did not reach sufficient consensus for pharmacological therapy (e.g., therapy specifically targeting lung fibrosis) to formulate recommendations for LC drug treatment. CONCLUSION: The formulated recommendations should serve as an interim guidance to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of patients with pulmonary LC. As new evidence emerges, these recommendations may need to be adapted.","Funke-Chambour, Manuela; Bridevaux, Pierre-Olivier; Clarenbach, Christian F; Soccal, Paola M; Nicod, Laurent P; von Garnier, Christophe",Respiration,38,1

Not every suspected case undergoes testing, because testing kits and other equipment are limited in many parts of the world. Yet populations increasingly use the internet to manage both home and work life during the pandemic, giving researchers mediated connections to millions of people sheltering in place. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an online news platform to recruit volunteers willing to report COVID-19-like symptoms and behaviors. METHODS: An online epidemiologic survey captured COVID-19-related symptoms and behaviors from individuals recruited through banner ads offered through Microsoft News. Respondents indicated whether they were experiencing symptoms, whether they received COVID-19 testing, and whether they traveled outside of their local area. RESULTS: A total of 87,322 respondents completed the survey across a 3-week span at the end of April 2020, with 54.3% of the responses from the United States and 32.0% from Japan. Of the total respondents, 19,631 (22.3%) reported at least one symptom associated with COVID-19. Nearly two-fifths of these respondents (39.1%) reported more than one COVID-19-like symptom. Individuals who reported being tested for COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report symptoms (47.7% vs 21.5%; P<.001). Symptom reporting rates positively correlated with per capita COVID-19 testing rates (R2=0.26; P<.001). Respondents were geographically diverse, with all states and most ZIP Codes represented. More than half of the respondents from both countries were older than 50 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: News platforms can be used to quickly recruit study participants, enabling collection of infectious disease symptoms at scale and with populations that are older than those found through social media platforms. Such platforms could enable epidemiologists and researchers to quickly assess trends in emerging infections potentially before at-risk populations present to clinics and hospitals for testing and/or treatment.","Dixon, Brian E; Mukherjee, Sumit; Wiensch, Ashley; Gray, Mary L; Ferres, Juan M Lavista; Grannis, Shaun J",J Med Internet Res,38,30

The importance of communication during this pandemic has been strongly underlined by public health experts, epidemiologists, media expert, psychologists, sociologists. In the case of serological tests, there are several aspects that have to be considered: why we perform the test, what population is tested, which are the parameters conditioning the results and their interpretation. OBJECTIVES: to show how to quantify the uncertainty related to the validity of the serological test with respect to its predictive value and in particular the positive predictive value. METHODS: the evaluation of a qualitative diagnostic test includes four distinct assessments: accuracy, empirical evidence, practical importance, and prevalence of the pathology. Accuracy is measured by the sensitivity and specificity of the test; empirical evidence is quantified by the likelihood ratio, respectively for a positive and negative test result; the practical importance of the result of a diagnostic test is assessed by the positive or negative predictive value. Prevalence of COVID-19 is substantial uncertainty and it is possible to estimate the apparent prevalence starting from the results obtained with a diagnostic test. RESULTS: at the moment, the knowledge about the accuracy of serological tests is limited and little attention is paid to confidence interval on point estimates. In terms of practical importance of testing at individual level, while negative predictive values are high whatever the level of sensitivity of the test, the interpretation of a positive results is very cumbersome. Positive predictive values above 90% can be reached only by tests with specificity above 99% at the expected prevalence rate of 5%. There is a linear relationship between apparent - testing positive - prevalence and real prevalence. The apparent prevalence in the context of serological test for COVID-19 is always larger than real prevalence. The level of specificity is crucial. CONCLUSIONS: the main applications of the serological test in the epidemic contest are: to study the seroprevalence of the virus antibodies in the general population; to screen the healthcare workers for the early identification of contagious subjects' health care settings and to screen the general population in order to identify new incident cases. In the first two cases, seroprevalence study and screening of a high-risk population, the consequences of the uncertainty associated to the statistics are already accounted for in the first situation, or are overcome by repeating the screening on the healthcare workers, and using the molecular test to verify the presence of the virus in those tested positive. The case of screening of general population is more complex and of major interest for the implication it may have on individual behaviours and on the implementation of public health interventions by the political decision makers. A positive result has, per se, no practical value for individuals since the probability of being really infected by the virus is low. The uncertainty associated with the different estimates (sensitivity, specificity and disease prevalence) play a double role: it is a key factor in defining the informative content of the test result and it might guide the individual actions and the public policy decisions.","Biggeri, Annibale; Forni, Silvia; Braga, Mario",Epidemiol Prev,38,16

Exclusion criteria are: 1) previous allergic reaction to plasma exchange or its ingredients (i.e., sodium citrate), 2) two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 at least 24 hours apart, 3) mild COVID-19 not requiring ICU admission and 4) terminally ill patients receiving palliative care. The primary site will be King Saud Medical City (KSMC), Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Also, the study will run in ICUs (Ministry of Health Cluster 1; Riyadh) and other centers in KSA pending their institutional review board (IRB) approval. INTERVENTIONS AND COMPARATOR: The intervention group will receive TPE, plus empiric treatment for COVID-19. TPE is administered using the Spectra Optia TM Apheresis System equipped with the Depuro D2000 Adsorption Cartridge (Terumo BCT Inc., USA). The first dose is 1.5 plasma volumes, followed by one plasma volume on alternate days or daily for five to seven total treatments. Spectra Optia TM Apheresis System operates with acid-citrate dextrose anticoagulant (ACDA) as per Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2019 guidelines. Plasma is replaced with albumin 5% or fresh frozen plasma in patients with coagulopathy (prothrombin time >37 seconds; international normalized ratio >3; activated partial thromboplastin time >100 or fibrinogen level <100 mg/d). TPE sessions are performed daily over four hours and laboratory markers measured daily. The comparators are controls not receiving TPE but usual empiric treatment for COVID-19 as per institutional, national and international recommendations. Both groups will receive standard ICU supportive care. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary study end-point is 28-day mortality and safety of TPE in serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19. Safety will be evaluated by the documentation of any pertinent adverse and/or serious adverse effects related to TPE as per institutional, national and international (Food and Drug Administration) guidelines. Secondary outcomes are: i) improvement in Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA) score ; ii) changes in inflammatory markers: serum C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, d-dimers and interleukin-6; iii) days on mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. RANDOMIZATION: Eligible consented patients are randomized (1:1 allocation) after stratification by ICU center and two PaO2/FIO2 ratio categories (> 150 and &#8804; 150). Randomization occurs in variable block sizes of four to eight patients. A web-based randomization service, randomize.net, is used to allocate patients to their respective strata prior to the intervention or control therapy. BLINDING (MASKING): Given the visibility of TPE machinery, the intervention will be unblinded; hence, no enrollment concealment will be expedited. The lack of allocation concealment will be mitigated by several measures (please, refer to the full protocol, Additional file 1). NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): This pilot randomized trial aims to recruit a convenience sample of patients with serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19. Therefore, at least 20 patients are to be randomized to each group per participating center. We are hoping to consent and randomize approximately 60 patients in each group over a 3 to 6 months period giving a total of 120 participants. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version 1 was approved 29/04/2020. Recruitment is ongoing, and began on 01/05/2020. We estimate completion by 29/10/2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered at ISRCTN on 18/05/2020 (ISRCTN21363594; doi.10.1186/ ISRCTN21363594).

In particular, substantial research investment has advanced monoclonal antibody therapies to the clinic where they have shown partial efficacy in reducing viral burden and hospitalization. An alternative is to use the host entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a soluble decoy that broadly blocks SARS-associated coronaviruses with limited potential for viral escape. Here, we summarize efforts to engineer higher affinity variants of soluble ACE2 that rival the potency of affinity-matured antibodies. Strategies have also been used to increase the valency of ACE2 decoys for avid spike interactions and to improve pharmacokinetics via IgG fusions. Finally, the intrinsic catalytic activity of ACE2 for the turnover of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II may directly address COVID-19 symptoms and protect against lung and cardiovascular injury, conferring dual mechanisms of action unachievable by monoclonal antibodies. Soluble ACE2 derivatives therefore have the potential to be next generation therapeutics for addressing the immediate needs of the current pandemic and possible future outbreaks.","Jing, Wenyang; Procko, Erik",Proteins,38,30

Thus, the transformation that human societies are undergoing due to COVID-19 has significantly impacted the rights of children, both at the micro and the macro levels. In Spain - a country that has been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic - we find that both infancy (especially through obstetric violence) and childhood at all its stages fall victim to an adultcentric paradigm based on control and epistemic injustice. This essay analyzes and discusses some of the negative consequences observed in this country related to the care for and the confinement of minors and their families - which has occurred as a result of the pandemic - and considers that the crisis triggered by COVID-19 may be an opportunity to shed light on situations of ancestral injustice towards children.","Massó Guijarro, Ester",Salud Colect,38,22

The precise mechanism of viral pathogenesis is not fully understood, which remains a major hurdle for medical intervention. Here we generated an interactome profile of protein-protein interactions based on host and viral protein structural similarities information. Further computational biological study combined with Gene enrichment analysis predicted key enriched pathways associated with viral pathogenesis. The results show that axon guidance, membrane trafficking, vesicle-mediated transport, apoptosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, Vpu mediated degradation of CD4 T cell, and interferon-gamma signaling are key events associated in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Further, degree centrality analysis reveals that IRF1/9/7, TP53, and CASP3, UBA52, and UBC are vital proteins for IFN-Î³-mediated signaling, apoptosis, and proteasomal degradation of CD4, respectively. We crafted chronological events of the virus life cycle. The SARS-CoV-2 enters through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the genome is trafficked to the early endosomes in a RAB5-dependent manner. It is predicted to replicate in a double-membrane vesicle (DMV) composed of the endoplasmic reticulum, autophagosome, and ERAD machinery. The SARS-CoV-2 down-regulates host translational machinery by interacting with protein kinase R, PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, and heme-regulated inhibitor and can phosphorylate eIF2a. The virion assembly occurs in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) organized by the spike and matrix protein. Collectively, we have established a spatial link between viral entry, RNA synthesis, assembly, pathogenesis, and their associated diverse host factors, those could pave the way for therapeutic intervention.","Tiwari, Ritudhwaj; Mishra, Anurag R; Gupta, Advika; Nayak, Debasis",J Biomol Struct Dyn,38,16

As previously observed with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 deeply dysregulate the immune system eliciting respiratory failure and a state of systemic hyperinflammation in severely ill individuals. Immunotherapy is often used to downgrade the detrimental effects of the disease sustained by high-level of cytokines. Those treatments, however, are known to undermine patients' ability to contain tuberculosis (TB) infection. This study aims to describe interferon-Î³ release assay (IGRA) results in severe COVID-19 patients eligible for immunosuppressive treatment. Aggregate data were gathered from five hospitals in Milan, Italy, from March 1 to May 15, 2020 and retrospectively analyses. Results were summarized using absolute frequencies and percentages and compared using a two-sided Chi-squared test. Overall, 462 COVID-19 patients were eligible for immunosuppressive therapy, among which 335 were tested using IGRA testing. More than one-third of them (122/335; 36.4%) had an indeterminate IGRA result because of insufficient immune response to mitogen control, 19 (5.7%) tested positive and 194 (57.9) negative. The majority of patients with lymphocytopenia (i.e., total lymphocyte count [TLC] below 1000â¯cells/mm3) had indeterminate IGRAs (81/155; 52.3%). The proportion becomes even higher in patients with severe lymphocytopenia (i.e., TLC<500â¯cells/mm3) (36/57; 63%). Our results suggest a possible negative impact of COVID-19 related immune dysregulation on TB infection assessment and management. Close monitoring of individuals with or without retesting of individuals with indeterminate IGRAs and further basic science investigations should to be sought to better comprehend their implication on TB epidemiology.","Torre, Alessandro; Aliberti, Stefano; Castellotti, Paola Francesca; Cirillo, Daniela Maria; Grisolia, Antonella; Mangioni, Davide; Marchetti, Giulia; Rossotti, Roberto; Santus, Pierachille; Besozzi, Giorgio; Villa, Simone; Codecasa, Luigi Ruffo",Respir Med,38,19

About the latter, hypertension and coronary heart disease are among the most common comorbidities recorded in infected patients, together with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data from Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS, Italy) show that more than 68.3% of patients had hypertension, 28.2% ischemic heart disease, 22.5% atrial fibrillation, while 30.1% T2DM. Several authors suggested that cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus are linked to endothelial dysfunction, and all of them are strictly related to aging. Considering the impact of the gender on the COVID-19 epidemic, even if confirmed cases from each nation are changing every day, epidemiological data clearly evidence that in men the infection causes worse outcomes compared to women. In Italy, up to 21 May, in the age range of 60-89 years, male deaths were 63.9% of total cases. The reason behind this difference between genders appears not clear; however, the diversity in sex-hormones and styles of life are believed to play a role in the patient's susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes. It is known that the activation of endothelial estrogen receptors increases NO and decreases ROS, protecting the vascular system from angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction, inflammation, and ROS production. During the pandemic, joining forces is vital; thus, as people help doctors by limiting their displacements out of their houses avoiding hence the spread of the infection, doctors help patients to overcome severe SARS-CoV-2 infections by using multiple pharmacological approaches. In this context, the preservation of endothelial function and the mitigation of vascular inflammation are prominent targets, essential to reduce severe outcomes also in male older patients.","Froldi, Guglielmina; Dorigo, Paola",Med Hypotheses,38,18

The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted healthcare services, and potentially vaccine coverage, and brought the need for new vaccines to be tested and rolled out. OBJECTIVES: To explore: i) the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on pregnant women's access to, and attitudes towards, routine maternal vaccines and; ii) women's attitudes towards testing Covid-19 vaccines on pregnant women and their personal willingness to take part in such a trial. DESIGN: Qualitative interview study with pregnant women in the Bristol and surrounding area (UK). METHODS: Semi-structured telephone/videoconference interviews were conducted (following a topic guide), transcribed verbatim and subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-one pregnant women (selected for demographic range) were interviewed in April/May 2020. Participants felt the pandemic had elevated the importance of routine maternal vaccines, though women were concerned about safety management around appointment attendance. Women were wary of receiving a new Covid-19 vaccine, with most perceiving it as riskier than Covid-19 itself. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to maximise the safety and efficiency of maternity appointments to encourage uptake of routine maternal vaccines, and to communicate this well. For pregnant women to gain a new vaccine or participate in a vaccine trial, they need to be convinced that the risk posed by the virus is greater than any risk of receiving a new vaccine.","Anderson, Emma; Brigden, Amberly; Davies, Anna; Shepherd, Emily; Ingram, Jenny",Midwifery,38,5

We evaluated the effectiveness of the 6 most common social-distancing policies in the United States (statewide stay-at-home orders, limited stay-at-home orders, nonessential business closures, bans on large gatherings, school closure mandates, and limits on restaurants and bars) during the early stage of the pandemic. METHODS: We applied difference-in-differences and event-study methodologies to evaluate the effect of the 6 social-distancing policies on Google-released aggregated, anonymized daily location data on movement trends over time by state for all 50 states and the District of Columbia in 6 location categories: retail and recreation, grocery stores and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residences. We compared the outcome of interest in states that adopted COVID-19-related policies with states that did not adopt such policies, before and after these policies took effect during February 15-April 25, 2020. RESULTS: Statewide stay-at-home orders had the strongest effect on reducing out-of-home mobility and increased the time people spent at home by an estimated 2.5 percentage points (15.2%) from before to after policies took effect. Limits on restaurants and bars ranked second and resulted in an increase in presence at home by an estimated 1.4 percentage points (8.5%). The other 4 policies did not significantly reduce mobility. CONCLUSION: Statewide stay-at-home orders and limits on bars and restaurants were most closely linked to reduced mobility in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the potential benefits of other such policies may have already been reaped from voluntary social distancing. Further research is needed to understand how the effect of social-distancing policies changes as voluntary social distancing wanes during later stages of a pandemic.","Abouk, Rahi; Heydari, Babak",Public Health Rep,38,30

Among presented data, we were surprised to see that serum albumin (ALB) concentrations during hospitalization did not significantly predict patient death at the multivariate analysis (MA), even if 86.6% of patients showed ALB values <35 g/L, i.e. the lower reference limit. In a similar COVID-19 population enrolled in our national reference center for infectious diseases, we recently analysed a group of common biochemistry tests, including ALB, as major predictor of COVID-19 severity (2). Although the patient rate showing an ALB <35 g/L was quite similar (89%) to that of Hundt's study, at MA low ALB concentrations remained significantly associated (P=0.003) with higher odds of death, ALB values &#8804;18 g/L giving a positive likelihood ratio of 12.2 for predicting in-hospital death. In terms of absolute ALB levels in the respective populations, it is however somewhat difficult to compare our results with those of Hundt et al. as the authors do not mention the methodology used to determine ALB in their hospital network. It is known that immunoturbidimetric assays for ALB determination, such as the one in use in our institution, are specific for the ALB measurement contrary to nonspecific colorimetric methods, which are in use in the majority of U.S. healthcare institutions, also reacting with proteins other than ALB (3). The well-known lack of specificity of the latter methods, especially at low ALB and high globulin (including ""acute phase reactants"") concentrations, i.e. the typical COVID-19 situation, may have influenced the Hundt's results. Figure 1 depicts ALB distribution in our COVID-19 patients showing that even survivors displayed a median (interquartile range) [28 g/L (25-32)] quite lower that patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled by Hundt et al. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the inability of ALB to predict death in the Hundt's study was due to spuriously higher ALB values measured with non-specific methods in the evaluated COVID-19 patients. The accuracy of ALB methods may become critical in COVID-19 cases, where ALB is decreased but acute-phase proteins are increased, and thus use of immunological assays should be preferred in this condition (4).","Pasqualetti, Sara; Aloisio, Elena; Panteghini, Mauro",Hepatology (Baltim.),38,30

The patient received only one line of anticancer treatment with sunitinib, which could not be continued due to haemorrhagic manifestations in brain metastases. The treatment was changed with immunotherapy which showed its effect even if it was stopped due to the patient wishes in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION: Immunotherapy opens the doors to a new era in treatment of metastatic renal cancer and shows efficiency even after it has been stopped.","Haineala, Bogdan; Zgura, Anca; Diaconu, Camelia; Mehedintu, Claudia; Bacinschi, Xenia; Anghel, Rodica Maricela",In Vivo,38,24

METHODS: An online questionnaire designed for this survey was distributed via the researchers' networks and was available for completion by any teacher, except those who were not working at the time. There were 1,253 teachers from all over Brazil, of both sexes, covering a wide age range, working at different levels of education, and most with more than ten years of experience. Descriptive and inferential analyses of the data were performed. RESULTS: On comparing the prepandemic period with the current one, participants indicated voice improvements. In contrast, they presented symptoms such as dry throat, effort in addressing remote classes, hoarseness after classes, and difficulties with the use of headphones, among others. They further indicated stress, general fatigue, impact of the pandemic on mental health, and the overlapping of many home tasks with professional tasks. Some smoked, and others hydrated insufficiently. CONCLUSION: Although teachers generally noticed voice improvements during the pandemic, a proportion of them perceived worsening of voices. Many indicated several factors in which speech-language pathologists could guide them with the aim of improving performance and comfort during remote and hybrid classes, an initiative that will positively impact not only their voice and communication but also their quality of life.","Nemr, Katia; Simões-Zenari, Marcia; Almeida, Vanessa Cássia de; Martins, Glauciene Amaral; Saito, Isabele Tiemi",Clinics,38,16

CLINICAL FEATURES AND OUTCOME: A 58-year-old woman presented with cough, fever, dizziness, chest tightness, polypnea and poor appetite. She was admitted to Guizhou Provincial People's hospital, and diagnosed with critically ill type of COVID-19 in February 2020. According to the patient's symptoms and signs, the TCM syndrome differentiation was qi deficiency, dampness-stasis and toxin accumulation. Then she received the combined therapy of a modified Chinese herbal formula and Western medicine. During a twelve-day period of treatment, her respiratory distress and appetite quickly improved. Abnormal laboratory indicators were resumed in time and lung lesions in CT scan largely absorbed. No side effects associated with this Chinese herbal formula were found. Before discharge, two consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs were shown to be negative for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS: Our case report suggests that collaborative treatments with traditional Chinese medicine prove beneficial in the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients.

Low trust in vaccines is attributed to a combination of factors, including lack of understanding, vaccine scares, flawed policies, social media and mistrust of vaccine manufacturers, scientists and decision-makers. The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare societies' vulnerability to new pathogens and the critical role of vaccines (and their acceptability) in containing this and future pandemics. It has also put science at the forefront of the response, with several governments relying on academics to help shape policy and communicate with the public. Against this backdrop, protecting public trust in scientists and scientific output is arguably more important than ever. Yet, conflicts of interest (CoI) in biomedical research remain ubiquitous and harmful, and measures to curb them have had limited success. There is also evidence of bias in industry-sponsored vaccine studies and academics are voicing concerns about the risks of working in a CoI prevalent research area. Here, we set out to challenge established thinking with regard to vaccine confidence, by shifting the gaze from a deficit in public understanding towards probity in research relationships and suggesting an alternative and perhaps complementary strategy for addressing vaccine mistrust. We argue that a concerted effort needs to be made to revisit the norms that undergird contemporary vaccine research, coupled with a willingness of all stakeholders to reimagine those relationships with an emphasis on demonstrating trustworthiness and probity.","Wheelock, Ana; Ives, Jonathan",J. med. ethics,38,9

Technologies that aid law enforcement agencies worldwide to identify such crimes rapidly can potentially result in the mitigation of child victimization, and the apprehending of offenders. Machine learning presents the potential to help law enforcement rapidly identify such material, and even block such content from being distributed digitally. However, collecting and storing CSAM files to train machine learning models has many ethical and legal constraints, creating a barrier to the development of accurate computer vision-based models. With such restrictions in place, the development of accurate machine learning classifiers for CSAM identification based on file metadata becomes crucial. In this work, we propose a system for CSAM identification on file storage systems based solely on metadata - file paths. Our aim is to provide a tool that is material type agnostic (image, video, PDF), and can potentially scans thousands of file storage systems in a short time. Our approach uses convolutional neural networks, and achieves an accuracy of 97% and recall of 94%. Additionally, we address the potential problem of offenders trying to evade detection by this model by evaluating the robustness of our model against adversarial modifications in the file paths.","Pereira, Mayana; Dodhia, Rahul; Brown, Richard",,38,1

(c) What can instructors do to help alleviate their online students' perceived levels of language anxiety? In addition to an exploration of the guiding questions, the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale, which was developed by Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986), is described in detail as well as how language educators can use it as a tool in their own classrooms to measure their students' perceived language anxiety levels. The pedagogical implications include recommended techniques and interventions for helping online language learners feel less isolated, less anxious, and more connected to their teacher and to their peers. Given the large number of students who are currently engaged in online or remote language learning due to COVID-19, it is important to consider how affective factors, such as anxiety, can impede learning outcomes. Furthermore, language educators and their students were required to transition rapidly to the online environment without sufficient time or preparation for it, which is an additional cause of stress for both students and instructors alike.

To date however there is no published study that specifically addresses to use tumescent anesthesia & use of tranexamic acid in it for excision of gynecomastia. Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of tumescent anesthesia in surgical excision of gynecomastia. Methods. A 4-year study with 100 patients of gynecomastia aged 14 to 47 years were enrolled with follow up for 3 months. All patients were given tumescence anesthesia in each breast comprising subcutaneous infiltration of 500 ml RL, 20 ml 0.5% bupivacaine, 30 ml 2% lignocaine, 1 mg adrenaline & 1 gm tranexamic acid. Breast tissue was excised in each breast by a single infraareolar incision & patients were assessed for intra-op pain and post-op pain by using numeric rating scale (NRS). Results. Bilateral presentation was there in 69 patients and 31 unilateral with 4 recurrent cases. Size of gland excised were 12-14 cms in 53 cases, 15-18 cms in 38 & 19-20 cms in 9 patients. Average surgical time required for each breast was 30 minutes. Intraoperative pain NRS-0 for 66, NRS-1 for 31 & NRS-5 for 03 patients. Postoperative pain for first eight hours was NRS-0 for 69 and NRS-1 for 31 patients. Conclusion. Tumescent anaesthesia for surgical excision of gynecomastia using a periareolar incision is a minimally invasive bloodless and painless technique in which ductal and stromal tissue can be removed resulting in a high level of patient satisfaction. In todays covid era it avoids the use of general anesthesia and electrocautery.","Mohan, Amitabh; Rangwala, Murtuza; Rajendran, Nagamahendran",Surg Innov,38,18

This study's objective was to analyze the factors associated with MSM's (men who have sex with men) low psychological well-being in the COVID-19 pandemic context. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted online across Brazil (26 states and federal district) in April and May 2020. The participants were recruited using snowball sampling and Facebook posts. Data were collected using social media and MSM dating apps. We estimated the prevalence, crude prevalence ratio (PR), and the respective confidence intervals (CI95%). Results: The prevalence of low psychological well-being found in the sample was 7.9%. Associated factors were belonging to the youngest group (PR 2.76; CI95% 1.90-4.01), having polyamorous relationships (PR 2.78; CI95% 1.51-5.11), not complying with social isolation measures (PR 6.27; CI95% 4.42-8.87), not using the social media to find partners (PR 1.63; CI95% 1.06-2.53), having multiple sexual partners (PR 1.80; CI95% 1.04-3.11), having reduced the number of partners (PR 2.67; CI95% 1.44-4.95), and group sex (PR 1.82; CI95% 1.23-2.69). Conclusion: The well-being of MSM living in Brazil was negatively affected during the social distancing measures intended to control the spread of COVID-19. The variables that contributed the most to this outcome include social isolation, relationships established with partners, and sexual behavior. Policy Implications: Planning and implementing public policies and actions to promote psychological well-being are needed to improve MSM's resilience by adopting safe strategies and behavior.","Camargo, Emerson Lucas Silva; de Oliveira, Bruna Isabela Adolpho; Siffoni, Igor Fessina; de Sousa, Anderson Reis; Teixeira, Jules Ramon Brito; Mendes, Isabel Amélia Costa; de Sousa, Álvaro Francisco Lopes",Sex Res Social Policy,38,26

ACE2 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cells residing in many different human organs. In human physiology, ACE2 is a pivotal counter-regulatory enzyme to ACE by the breakdown of angiotensin II, the central player in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the main substrate of ACE2. Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID-19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication and several co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2-expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID-19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage. Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID-19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis. Identifying pathologic changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding COVID-19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence-based treatment strategies. Currently, many interventional strategies are being explored in ongoing clinical trials, encompassing many drug classes and strategies, including antiviral drugs, biological response modifiers and RAAS inhibitors. Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID-19 and appropriate measures are being taken accordingly, including development of effective vaccines. In this review, we describe the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathophysiology, including factors influencing ACE2 expression and activity in relation to COVID-19 severity. In addition, we discuss the relevant pathological changes resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we highlight a selection of potential treatment modalities for COVID-19.

Reducing these disparities along with overcoming unintended negative consequences of the pandemic, such as the disruption of in-person schooling, calls for broad community-based collaborations and nuanced approaches. Based on national survey data, children from some racial and ethnic minority groups have a higher prevalence of obesity, asthma, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension; were diagnosed more frequently with COVID-19; and had more severe outcomes compared with their non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. Furthermore, a higher proportion of children from some racial and ethnic minority groups lived in families with incomes less than 200% of the federal poverty level or in households lacking secure employment compared with NHW children. Children from some racial and ethnic minority groups were also more likely to attend school via online learning compared with NHW counterparts. Because the root causes of these disparities are complex and multifactorial, an organized community-based approach is needed to achieve greater proactive and sustained collaborations between local health departments, local school systems, and other public and private organizations to pursue health equity. This article provides a summary of potential community-based health promotion strategies to address racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes and educational inequities among children and teens, specifically in the implementation of strategic partnerships, including initial collective work, outcomes-based activities, and communication. These collaborations can facilitate policy, systems, and environmental changes in school systems that support emergency preparedness, recovery, and resilience when faced with public health crises.","White, Arica; Liburd, Leandris C; Coronado, Fátima",Prev Chronic Dis,38,33

To study gas fragmentation, we use the dendrogram method to identify cores as traced by the dust continuum emission. The four clouds exhibit different fragmentation states at the observed resolution despite having similar masses at the cloud scale ($\sim$1--5 pc). Assuming a constant dust temperature of 20 K, we construct core mass functions of the clouds and find a slightly top-heavy shape as compared to the canonical initial mass function, but we note several significant uncertainties that may affect this result. The characteristic spatial separation between the cores as identified by the minimum spanning tree method, $\sim$$10^4$ AU, and the characteristic core mass, 1--7 $M_\odot$, are consistent with predictions of thermal Jeans fragmentation. The three clouds showing fragmentation may be forming OB associations (stellar mass $\sim$$10^3$ $M_\odot$).

Due to their involvement in a broad range of physiological and pathological processes and their accessibility, GPCRs are widely used as pharmacological targets of treatment. Orphan G protein-coupled receptors (oGPCRs) are GPCRs for which no natural ligands have been found, and they not only play important roles in various physiological functions, such as sensory perception, reproduction, development, growth, metabolism, and responsiveness, but are also closely related to many major diseases, such as central nervous system (CNS) diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. Recently, many studies have reported that oGPCRs play increasingly important roles as key factors in the occurrence and progression of autoimmune diseases. Therefore, oGPCRs are likely to become potential therapeutic targets and may provide a breakthrough in the study of autoimmune diseases. In this article, we focus on reviewing the recent research progress and clinical treatment effects of oGPCRs in three common autoimmune diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), shedding light on novel strategies for treatments.","Zhao, Mingming; Wang, Zheyu; Yang, Ming; Ding, Yan; Zhao, Ming; Wu, Haijing; Zhang, Yan; Lu, Qianjin",Clin. rev. allergy immunol,38,33

Most work to date assessing disease severity on chest imaging has focused on segmenting computed tomography (CT) images; however, given that CTs are performed much less frequently than chest X-rays for COVID-19 patients, automated lung lesion segmentation on chest X-rays could be clinically valuable. There currently exists a universal shortage of chest X-rays with ground truth COVID-19 lung lesion annotations, and manually contouring lung opacities is a tedious, labor-intensive task. To accelerate severity detection and augment the amount of publicly available chest X-ray training data for supervised deep learning (DL) models, we leverage existing annotated CT images to generate frontal projection""chest X-ray""images for training COVID-19 chest X-ray models. In this paper, we propose an automated pipeline for segmentation of COVID-19 lung lesions on chest X-rays comprised of a Mask R-CNN trained on a mixed dataset of open-source chest X-rays and coronal X-ray projections computed from annotated volumetric CTs. On a test set containing 40 chest X-rays of COVID-19 positive patients, our model achieved IoU scores of 0.81 $\pm$ 0.03 and 0.79 $\pm$ 0.03 when trained on a dataset of 60 chest X-rays and on a mixed dataset of 10 chest X-rays and 50 projections from CTs, respectively.

AIM: The aim of this audit was to assess the utility of our end-of-life care plan, and specifically the effectiveness of our standardised end-of-life care treatment algorithms, in dying patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: The audit primarily involved data extraction from the end-of-life care plan, which includes four hourly nursing (ward nurses) assessments of specific problems: patients with problems were managed according to standardised treatment algorithms, and the intervention was deemed to be effective if the problem was not present at subsequent assessments. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: This audit was undertaken at a general hospital in England, covered the 8 weeks from 16 March to 11 May 2020 and included all inpatients with COVID-19 who had an end-of-life care plan (and died). RESULTS: Sixty-one patients met the audit criteria: the commonest problem was shortness of breath (57.5%), which was generally controlled with conservative doses of morphine (10-20 mg/24 h via a syringe pump). Cough and audible respiratory secretions were relatively uncommon. The second most common problem was agitation/delirium (55.5%), which was generally controlled with standard pharmacological interventions. The cumulative number of patients with shortness of breath, agitation and audible respiratory secretions increased over the last 72 h of life, but most patients were symptom controlled at the point of death. CONCLUSION: Patients dying of COVID-19 experience similar end-of-life problems to other groups of patients.

These solutions involve protection and restoration of ecosystems that serve as efficient carbon sinks, including vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs: tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows) also known as 'Blue Carbon' ecosystems. In fact, many nations are seeking to manage VCEs to help meet their climate change mitigation targets through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). However, incorporation of VCEs into NDCs requires national-scale estimates of contemporary and future blue carbon storage, which has not yet been achieved. Here we address this challenge using machine learning approaches to reliably map (with 62-72% accuracy) soil carbon stocks in VCEs based on geospatial data (topography, geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic impacts), using Australia as a case study. The resulting maps of soil carbon stocks showed that there is a total of 951 Tg (±65 Tg) of carbon stock within Australian VCEs. Strong relationships between soil carbon stocks and climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation) allowed us to project future changes in carbon storage across all RCP scenarios for the years 2050 and 2090 to determine changes in environmental suitability for soil carbon stocks. Results show that soil carbon stocks in mangrove/tidal marsh ecosystems are likely to predominantly experience declines in carbon stocks under predicted climate change scenarios (19% of ecosystems area is predicted to have an increase in soil carbon stocks, while 38% of ecosystems area is predicted to have a decrease in soil carbon stocks), but a majority of seagrass area is likely to have increased soil carbon stocks (56% increase, 7% decrease). This approach is effective for developing robust national blue carbon inventories and revealing the capacity for blue carbon to help meet NDCs. The resulting spatially-explicit maps can also be used to pinpoint areas for successful blue carbon projects both now and in the future.","Young, Mary A; Serrano, Oscar; Macreadie, Peter I; Lovelock, Catherine E; Carnell, Paul; Ierodiaconou, Daniel",Sci Total Environ,38,33

Our aim was to describe and compare ultrasound and Doppler findings from pregnant women either SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative evaluated during the pandemic period. METHODS: One hundred and six (106) pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time or within one week of the ultrasound (US) scan were evaluated. There were 49 symptomatic and 57 asymptomatic women. US scans were performed either for routine fetal evaluation, or indicated due to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. For comparison, 103 pregnant women (controls) matched for maternal age, parity, body mass index, and gestational age at the time of the US scan were evaluated. Control women did not refer symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of the US scan, or when admitted for delivery, and had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test at the time of admission for delivery. Fetal biometry, fetal anatomy, amount of amniotic fluid, Doppler parameters including umbilical and middle cerebral arteries pulsatility indices, cerebro-placental ratio, and biophysical profile (BBP) were evaluated when indicated. All biometry and Doppler values were converted to z-scores for comparisons. Our primary outcome, an adverse prenatal composite outcome (APCPO) included: small for gestational age (SGA) fetus, oligohydramnios, abnormal BPP, abnormal Doppler velocimetry, and fetal death. Comorbidities, delivery information, and neonatal outcomes were registered and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Of women SARS-CoV-2 positive, 82.1% had a BMI >25.0 and had a higher prevalence of diabetes (26/106 [24.5%] vs. 13/103[12.6%]; p=0.03), but not of preeclampsia (21/106 [19.8%] vs. 11/105 [10.4%]; p=0.08) as compared to controls. The prevalence of APCPO was not significantly different between SARS-CoV-2 positive women (19/106 [17.9%]) and controls (9/103 [8.7%]; p=0.06. No differences in the prevalence of SGA fetuses (12/106 [11.3%] vs. 6/103 [5.8%]; p=0.17), fetuses with abnormal Doppler evaluation (8/106 [7.5%] vs. 2/103 [1.9%]; p=0.08), and with abnormal BPP (4/106 [3.7%] vs. 0/103 [0%] between SARS-CoV-2 positive woman and controls were documented.

We investigate private psychiatrists' uptake of video and telephone telehealth, as well as total (telehealth and face-to-face) consultations for Quarter 3 (July-September), 2020. We compare these to the same quarter in 2019. METHOD: MBS-item service data were extracted for COVID-19-psychiatrist video and telephone telehealth item numbers and compared with Quarter 3 (July-September), 2019, of face-to-face consultations for the whole of Australia. RESULTS: The number of psychiatry consultations (telehealth and face-to-face) rose during the first wave of the pandemic in Quarter 3, 2020, by 14% compared to Quarter 3, 2019, with telehealth 43% of this total. Face-to-face consultations in Quarter 3, 2020 were only 64% of the comparative number of Quarter 3, 2019 consultations. Most telehealth involved short telephone consultations of â©½15-30 min. Video consultations comprised 42% of total telehealth provision: these were for new patient assessments and longer consultations. These figures represent increased face-to-face consultation compared to Quarter 2, 2020, with substantial maintenance of telehealth consultations. CONCLUSIONS: Private psychiatrists continued using the new COVID-19 MBS telehealth items for Quarter 3, 2020 to increase the number of patient care contacts in the context of decreased face-to-face consultations compared to 2019, but increased face-to-face consultations compared to Quarter 2, 2020.","Looi, Jeffrey Cl; Allison, Stephen; Bastiampillai, Tarun; Pring, William; Reay, Rebecca; Kisely, Stephen R",Australas Psychiatry,38,33

Disease phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 exposure occurring around the time of vaccine administration have not been described. METHODS: Two-dose (14 days apart) vaccination regimen with a formalin-inactivated whole virion SARS-CoV-2 in golden Syrian hamster model was established. To investigate the disease phenotypes of a one-dose regimen given 3 days prior (D-3), 1 (D1) or 2 (D2) days after, or on the day (D0) of virus challenge, we monitored the serial clinical severity, tissue histopathology, virus burden, and antibody response of the vaccinated hamsters. RESULTS: The one-dose vaccinated hamsters had significantly lower clinical disease severity score, body weight loss, lung histology score, nucleocapsid protein expression in lung, infectious virus titres in the lung and nasal turbinate, inflammatory changes in intestines and a higher serum neutralizing antibody or IgG titre against the spike receptor-binding domain or nucleocapsid protein when compared to unvaccinated controls. These improvements were particularly noticeable in D-3, but also in D0, D1 and even D2 vaccinated hamsters to varying degrees. No increased eosinophilic infiltration was found in the nasal turbinate, lung, and intestine after virus challenge. Significantly higher serum titre of fluorescent foci microneutralization inhibition antibody was detected in D1 and D2 vaccinated hamsters at day 4 post-challenge compared to controls despite undetectable neutralizing antibody titre. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination just before or soon after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 does not worsen disease phenotypes and may even ameliorate infection.","Li, Can; Chen, Yan-Xia; Liu, Fei-Fei; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Zhao, Yan; Ye, Zhan-Hong; Cai, Jian-Piao; Chu, Hin; Zhang, Rui-Qi; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Chiu, Kelvin Hei-Yeung; Lung, David Christopher; Sridhar, Siddharth; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Zhang, Anna Jin-Xia; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Clin. infect. dis,38,16

DESIGN: Observational study of COVID-19 outcomes using quality-assured integrated data from a single UK hospital contextualised to its feeder population and associated factors (comorbidities, ethnicity, age, deprivation). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Single-city hospital with a feeder population of 228 632 adults in Wolverhampton. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admissions (defined as COVID-19 admissions (CA) or non-COVID-19 admissions (NCA)) and mortality (defined as COVID-19 deaths or non-COVID-19 deaths). RESULTS: Of the 5558 patients admitted, 686 died (556 in hospital); 930 were CA, of which 270 were hospital COVID-19 deaths, 47 non-COVID-19 deaths and 36 deaths after discharge; of the 4628 NCA, there were 239 in-hospital deaths (2 COVID-19) and 94 deaths after discharge. Of the 223 074 adults not admitted, 407 died. Age, gender, multimorbidity and black ethnicity (OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.2), p<0.001, compared with white ethnicity, absolute excess risk of <1/1000) were associated with CA and mortality. The South Asian cohort had lower CA and NCA, lower mortality compared with the white group (CA, 0.5 (0.3 to 0.8), p<0.01; NCA, 0.4 (0.3 to 0.6), p<0.001) and community deaths (0.5 (0.3 to 0.7), p<0.001). Despite many common risk factors for CA and NCA, ethnic groups had different admission rates and within-group differing association of risk factors. Deprivation impacted only the white ethnicity, in the oldest age bracket and in a lesser (not most) deprived quintile. CONCLUSIONS: Wolverhampton's results, reflecting high ethnic diversity and deprivation, are similar to other studies of black ethnicity, age and comorbidity risk in COVID-19 but strikingly different in South Asians and for deprivation. Sequentially considering population and then hospital-based NCA and CA outcomes, we present a complete single health economy picture. Risk factors may differ within ethnic groups; our data may be more representative of communities with high Black, Asian and minority ethnic populations, highlighting the need for locally focused public health strategies. We emphasise the need for a more comprehensible and nuanced conveyance of risk.","Singh, Baldev M; Bateman, James; Viswanath, Ananth; Klaire, Vijay; Mahmud, Sultan; Nevill, Alan; Dunmore, Simon J",BMJ Open,38,5

There is no information about the level of resilience and the demographic and job factors predicting resilience in the critical conditions of this occupational group. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to determine the resilience score and its predictive demographic factors among the nurses working at the hospitals involved with COVID-19 in Ahvaz, Iran. METHODS: 387 nurses from Ahvaz hospitals participated in this study. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to assess resilience. Demographic information was also collected using a designed questionnaire. Since the present study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the questionnaires were sent online. Data were entered into software SPSS (version 23) and T-test, ANOVA and regression methods were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The mean score of 61.18 (±14.8) was obtained for CD-RISC.

Secondarily it aims to summarize methods to minimize potential risk to operating room staff. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Continuing operative practice during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic places the health of operating theatre staff at potential risk. SARS-CoV2 is transmitted through inhaled droplets and aerosol particles, thus posing an inhalation threat even at considerable distance. Surgical energy devices generate an aerosol of biological particular matter during use. The risk to healthcare staff through use of surgical energy devices is unknown. METHODS: This review was conducted utilizing a rapid review methodology to enable efficient generation and dissemination of information useful for concurrent clinical practice. RESULTS: There are conflicting stances on the use of energy devices and laparoscopy by different surgical governing bodies and societies. There is no definitive evidence that aerosol generated by energy devices may carry active SARS-CoV2 virus. However, investigations of other viruses have demonstrated aerosolization through energy devise use. Measures to reduce potential transmission include appropriate personal protective equipment, evacuation and filtration of surgical plume, limiting energy device use if appropriate, and adjusting endoscopic and laparoscopic practice (low CO2 pressures, evacuation through ultrafiltration systems).

Particularly affected are older adults (i.e., those aged ≥ 65 years) who are at elevated risk for various adverse health outcomes, including declines in motor ability and physical activity (PA) participation, increased obesity, impaired cognition, and various psychological disorders. Thus, given the secular increases in the older adult population, novel and effective intervention strategies are necessary to improve physical activity behaviors and health in this population. Virtual reality (VR)-integrated exercise is a promising intervention strategy, which has been utilized in healthcare fields like stroke rehabilitation and psychotherapy. Therefore, the purpose of this editorial is to synthesize recent research examining the efficacy and effectiveness of VR exercise in the promotion of favorable health outcomes among the older adults. Results indicate the application of VR exercise to facilitate improved physical outcomes (e.g., enhanced motor ability, reduced obesity), cognition and psychological outcomes. VR exercise has also been observed to be an effective intervention strategy for fall prevention in this population. Future research should employ more rigorous research designs to allow for a more robust quantitative synthesis of the effect of VR exercise on the preceding outcomes to elucidate which type(s) of VR-based PA interventions are most effective in promoting improved health outcomes among older adults. Findings from this study will better inform the development of technology-savvy PA programs for wellness promotion in older adults who practice social distancing and exercise from home under the unprecedented global health crisis.","Gao, Zan; Lee, Jung Eun; McDonough, Daniel J.; Albers, Callie",J.

SEMs typically represent counts of individuals in discrete infection states using Markov jump processes (MJPs), but are computationally challenging as imperfect surveillance, lack of subject-level information, and temporal coarseness of the data obscure the true epidemic. Analytic integration over the latent epidemic process is impossible, and integration via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is cumbersome due to the dimensionality and discreteness of the latent state space. Simulation-based computational approaches can address the intractability of the MJP likelihood, but are numerically fragile and prohibitively expensive for complex models. A linear noise approximation (LNA) that approximates the MJP transition density with a Gaussian density has been explored for analyzing prevalence data in large-population settings, but requires modification for analyzing incidence counts without assuming that the data are normally distributed. We demonstrate how to reparameterize SEMs to appropriately analyze incidence data, and fold the LNA into a data augmentation MCMC framework that outperforms deterministic methods, statistically, and simulation-based methods, computationally. Our framework is computationally robust when the model dynamics are complex and applies to a broad class of SEMs. We evaluate our method in simulations that reflect Ebola, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, and apply our method to national surveillance counts from the 2013--2015 West Africa Ebola outbreak.","Fintzi, J.; Wakefield, J.; Minin, V.

Since then, the disease has evolved to become a global pandemic. Zimbabwe reported its first case on 20th March 2020, and the number has been increasing steadily. However, Zimbabwe has not witnessed the exponential growth witnessed in other countries so far, and the trajectory seems different. We set out to describe the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe from when the first case was confirmed to June 2020. Methods: data were collected from daily situation reports that were published by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Care from 20th March to 27th June 2020. Missing data on the daily situation reports was not imputed. Results: as of 27th June 2020, Zimbabwe had 567 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Eighty-two percent of these were returning residents and 18% were local transmission. The testing was heavily skewed towards returnees despite a comprehensive testing strategy. Of the confirmed cases, 142 were reported as recovered. However, demographic data for the cases were missing from the reports. It was not possible to estimate the probable period of infection of an active case, and case fatality in Zimbabwe was about 1% for the first 4 months of the pandemic. Conclusion: the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 experienced in Zimbabwe between March and June 2020 are somewhat different from what has been observed elsewhere. Further research to determine the reasons for the differences is warranted, to inform public health practice and tailor make suitable interventions.","Murewanhema, Grant; Burukai, Trouble; Mazingi, Dennis; Maunganidze, Fabian; Mufunda, Jacob; Munodawafa, Davison; Pote, William",Pan Afr Med J,38,16

MHV infection in mice provides an efficient cause-effect experimental model to understand the mechanisms of direct virus-induced neural-cell damage leading to demyelination and axonal loss, which are pathological features of multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common disabling neurological disease in young adults. Infiltration of T lymphocytes, activation of microglia, and their interplay are the primary pathophysiological events leading to disruption of the myelin sheath in MS. However, there is emerging evidence supporting gray matter involvement and degeneration in MS. The investigation of T cell function in the pathogenesis of deep gray matter damage is necessary. Here, we employed RSA59 (an isogenic recombinant strain of MHV-A59)-induced experimental neuroinflammation model to compare the disease in CD4-/- mice with that in CD4+/+ mice at days 5, 10, 15, and 30 postinfection (p.i.). Viral titer estimation, nucleocapsid gene amplification, and viral antinucleocapsid staining confirmed enhanced replication of the virions in the absence of functional CD4+ T cells in the brain. Histopathological analyses showed elevated susceptibility of CD4-/- mice to axonal degeneration in the CNS, with augmented progression of acute poliomyelitis and dorsal root ganglionic inflammation rarely observed in CD4+/+ mice. Depletion of CD4+ T cells showed unique pathological bulbar vacuolation in the brain parenchyma of infected mice with persistent CD11b+ microglia/macrophages in the inflamed regions on day 30 p.i. In summary, the current study suggests that CD4+ T cells are critical for controlling acute-stage poliomyelitis (gray matter inflammation), chronic axonal degeneration, and inflammatory demyelination due to loss of protective antiviral host immunity.IMPORTANCE The current trend in CNS disease biology is to attempt to understand the neural-cell-immune interaction to investigate the underlying mechanism of neuroinflammation, rather than focusing on peripheral immune activation. Most studies in MS are targeted toward understanding the involvement of CNS white matter. However, the importance of gray matter damage has become critical in understanding the long-term progressive neurological disorder. Our study highlights the importance of CD4+ T cells in safeguarding neurons against axonal blebbing and poliomyelitis from murine betacoronavirus-induced neuroinflammation. Current knowledge of the mechanisms that lead to gray matter damage in MS is limited, because the most widely used animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), does not present this aspect of the disease. Our results, therefore, add to the existing limited knowledge in the field. We also show that the microglia, though important for the initiation of neuroinflammation, cannot establish a protective host immune response without the help of CD4+ T cells.","Chakravarty, Debanjana; Saadi, Fareeha; Kundu, Soumya; Bose, Abhishek; Khan, Reas; Dine, Kimberly; Kenyon, Lawrence C; Shindler, Kenneth S; Das Sarma, Jayasri",J. virol,38,1

We undertook an epidemiologic investigation to describe the outbreak and guide public health action. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified from reports of SARS-CoV-2-positive laboratory test results to South Central Public Health District. Information on symptoms, hospitalization, recent travel, healthcare worker status, and close contacts was obtained by medical record review and patient interviews. Viral sequence analysis was conducted on a subset of available specimens. During March 13-April 10, 2020, a total of 451 COVID-19 cases among Blaine County residents (1,959 cases per 100,000 population) were reported, with earliest illness onset March 1. The median patient age was 51 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 37-63), 52 (11.5%) were hospitalized, and 5 (1.1%) died. The median duration between specimen collection and a positive laboratory result was 9 days (IQR: 4-10). Forty-four (9.8%) patients reported recent travel and an additional 37 cases occurred in out-of-state residents. Healthcare workers comprised 56 (12.4%) cases; 33 of whom worked at the only hospital in the county, leading to a 15-day disruption of hospital services. Among 562 close contacts monitored by public health authorities, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or compatible symptoms were identified in 51 (9.1%). Sequencing results from 34 specimens supported epidemiologic findings indicating travel as a source of SARS-CoV-2, and identified multiple lineages among hospital workers. Community mitigation strategies included school and resort closure, stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on incoming travelers. COVID-19 outbreaks in rural communities can disrupt health services. Lack of local laboratory capacity led to long turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. Rural communities frequented by tourists face unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing restrictions on incoming travelers and other mitigation strategies helped reduce COVID-19 transmission early in the pandemic.","Dunne, Eileen M; Maxwell, Tanis; Dawson-Skuza, Christina; Burns, Matthew; Ball, Christopher; Turner, Kathryn; Hahn, Christine G; Bowyer, Melody; Carter, Kris K; Hudson, Logan",PLoS One,38,23

However, whether specific population can be at higher risk of viremia are to date unexplored. METHODS: This cross-sectional proof-of-concept study included 41 SARS-CoV-2-positive adult individuals (six affected by haematological malignancies) hospitalized at two major hospital in Milan, for those demographic, clinical and laboratory data were available. SARS-CoV-2 load was quantified by ddPCR in paired plasma and respiratory samples. To assess significant differences between patients with and patients without viremia, Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon test were used for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 8 patients (19.5%), with a median (IQR) value of 694 (209-1023) copies/mL. Viremic patients were characterized by an higher mortality rate (50.0% vs 9.1%; p = 0.018) respect to patients without viremia. Viremic patients were more frequently affected by haematological malignancies (62.5% vs. 3.0%; p < 0.001), and had higher viral load in respiratory samples (9,404,000 [586,060-10,000,000] vs 1560 [312-25,160] copies/mL; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Even if based on a small sample population, this proof-of-concept study poses the basis for an early identification of patients at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 viremia, and therefore likely to develop severe COVID-19, and supports the need of a quantitative viral load determination in blood and respiratory samples of haematologic patients with COVID-19 in order to predict prognosis and consequently to help their further management.","Colagrossi, Luna; Antonello, Maria; Renica, Silvia; Merli, Marco; Matarazzo, Elisa; Travi, Giovanna; Vecchi, Marta; Colombo, Jacopo; Muscatello, Antonio; Grasselli, Giacomo; Molteni, Silvia Nerini; Scaravilli, Vittorio; Cattaneo, Emanuele; Fanti, Diana; Vismara, Chiara; Bandera, Alessandra; Gori, Andrea; Puoti, Massimo; Cento, Valeria; Alteri, Claudia; Perno, Carlo Federico",BMC Infect Dis,38,16

The pre-change distribution is assumed to be known and stationary, while the post-change distributions are assumed to evolve in a pre-determined non-stationary manner with some possible parametric uncertainty. In particular, it is assumed that the cumulative KL divergence between the post-change and the pre-change distributions grows super-linearly with time after the change-point. For the case where the post-change distributions are known, a universal asymptotic lower bound on the delay is derived, as the false alarm rate goes to zero. Furthermore, a window-limited CuSum test is developed, and shown to achieve the lower bound asymptotically. For the case where the post-change distributions have parametric uncertainty, a window-limited generalized likelihood-ratio test is developed and is shown to achieve the universal lower bound asymptotically. Extensions to the case with dependent observations are discussed. The analysis is validated through numerical results on synthetic data.

All healthcare staff must be trained to properly use PPE. All patients have to be screened at the hospital triage. All elective surgical interventions must be postponed. Operation room is considered as a place with high risk of cross infection so the highest level of protection should be maintained. Anesthesia, endoscopy and oral surgery are considered as aerosol producing procedures with very high risk of contamination. There is not any evidence to support the risk of infection trough blood products. Postoperative respiratory problems are more common among COVID-19 patients that may increases the estimated risk of morbidity and mortality. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic is a dynamic challenge for health system to save the healthcare staff and equipment resources by timely decisions. Healthcare workers are at the higher risk of contamination by COVID-19 especially in early phase of epidemic when the protection is sub-optimal.","Abdi, Reza; Shojaeian, Reza; Hajian, Sara; Sheikh, Shahrzad",Arch.

The aim of the study is to assess the arterial blood gas and acid-base patterns, blood pressure findings and their association with the outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective, observational study in a dedicated COVID-19 intensive care unit in Cape Town, South Africa. Admission arterial blood gas, serum electrolytes, renal function and blood pressure readings performed on COVID-19 patients admitted between 26 March and 2 June 2020 were analysed and compared between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: A total of 56 intensive care unit patients had admission arterial blood gas performed at the time of intensive care unit admission. An alkalaemia (pH > 7.45) was observed in 36 (64.3%) patients. A higher arterial pH (median 7.48 [interquartile range: 7.45-7.51] versus 7.46 [interquartile range: 7.40-7.48], P = 0.049) and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (median 7.9 kPa [interquartile range: 7.3-9.6] versus 6.5 kPa [interquartile range: 5.2-7.3], P = <0.001) were significantly associated with survival. Survivors also tended to have a higher systolic blood pressure (median: 144 mmHg [interquartile range: 134-152] versus 139 mmHg [interquartile range: 125-142], P = 0.078) and higher arterial HCO3 (median: 28.0 mmol/L [interquartile range: 25.7-28.8] versus 26.3 mmol/L [interquartile range: 24.3-27.9], P = 0.059).

We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: In this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between March 1 and March 24, 2020. As a reference group, we randomly sampled ten patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (ie, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atención Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018). We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls. The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19. To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression. The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437. FINDINGS: We collected data for 1139 cases and 11â390 population controls. Among cases, 444 (39·0%) were female and the mean age was 69·1 years (SD 15·4), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 1·98, 95% CI 1·62-2·41) and risk factors (1·46, 1·23-1·73) than did controls. Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 0·94 (95% CI 0·77-1·15). No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·80, 0·64-1·00) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (1·10, 0·88-1·37). Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·53, 95% CI 0·34-0·80). The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.

The simulator models a country as a network representing each node as an administrative region. The transportation connections between the nodes are modeled as the edges of this network. Each node runs a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model and population transfer between the nodes is considered using the transportation networks which allows modeling of the geographic spread of the disease. The simulator incorporates information ranging from population demographics and mobility data to health care resource capacity, by region, with interactive controls of system variables to allow dynamic and interactive modeling of events. The single-node simulator was validated using the thoroughly reported data from Lombardy, Italy. Then, the epidemic situation in Kazakhstan as of 31 May 2020 was accurately recreated. Afterward, we simulated a number of scenarios for Kazakhstan with different sets of policies. We also demonstrate the effects of region-based policies such as transportation limitations between administrative units and the application of different policies for different regions based on the epidemic intensity and geographic location. The results show that the simulator can be used to estimate outcomes of policy options to inform deliberations on governmental interdiction policies.","Kuzdeuov, Askat; Baimukashev, Daulet; Karabay, Aknur; Ibragimov, Bauyrzhan; Mirzakhmetov, Almas; Nurpeiissov, Mukhamet; Lewis, Michael; Atakan Varol, Huseyin",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,38,1

The study objectives were to assess the factors associated with vaccine coverage and determine vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthcare worker (HCW) population. MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted among HCW working at a public secondary hospital in Kuwait. The follow-up period was from 24 December 2020 to 15 June 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccine coverage and PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection for the VE analysis. Data on new SARS-CoV-2 infections (with or without symptoms) during study period in addition to HCWs characteristics (sex, age, nationality, and occupation) were extracted from the hospital records. The vaccine coverage and PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were cross-tabulated by the HCWs characteristics. Furthermore, we used Cox regression to estimate time-to-infection hazard ratios in vaccinated (first and second dose) compared to unvaccinated HCWs. Only one ChAdOx1 dose was given during the study period. ResultsThere were 3246 HCWs included in the analysis. The median age was 38 years (IQR = 33 - 44), 63.4% were females, 46.8% aged 31-40, and 82.3% were non-Kuwaitis. Overall, 82.1% of HCWs received at least one vaccine dose (50.4% received only one dose of ChAdOx1, 3.3% received one dose of BNT162b2, and 28.3% received two doses of BNT162b2). 17.9% of HCWs remained unvaccinated by the end of the study. A significantly lower vaccination coverage percentage was amongst female HCWs, younger age group (20 - 30 years old), and administrative/executive staff. Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed infection prevalence was 7.3%. No asymptomatic infections were reported. The SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence rate was 126 per 100,000 person-days in the unvaccinated group; whereas, the incidence rates in the partially vaccinated groups ([≥] 28 days after ChAdOx1 first dose) and ([≥] 14 days after receiving BNT162b2 through receipt of second dose) were 31.4 and 10.9 per 100,000 person-days, respectively. In the fully vaccinated group ([≥] 14 days after BNT162b2 second dose), the incidence rate was 6.3 per 100,000 person-days. The estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness of fully vaccinated was 94.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 89.4%-97.2%). The VE of partially vaccinated for ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 was 75.4% (95% CI = 67.2%-81.6%) and 91.4% (95% CI = 65.1%-97.9%), respectively. ConclusionsBoth BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines prevented most symptomatic infections in this population across age groups, nationalities, and occupations. A significant proportion (17.9%) of HCWs were unvaccinated despite the vaccine accessibility. The findings complement other VE studies and demonstrate the vaccine benefit among HCWs.","Alali, Walid Q; Ali, Lamiaa A; AlSeaidan, Mohammad; Al-Rashidi, Mohammad",,38,24

We describe the epidemiology and outcomes of RVI in a cohort enrolling 3294 consecutive patients undergoing SOT from May 2008 to December 2015 in Switzerland. Patient and allograft outcomes, and RVI diagnosed during routine clinical practice were prospectively collected. Median follow-up was 3.4 years (interquartile range 1.61-5.56). Six hundred ninety-six RVIs were diagnosed in 151/334 (45%) lung and 265/2960 (9%) non-lung transplant recipients. Cumulative incidence was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI] 53%-69%) in lung and 12% (95% CI 11%-14%) in non-lung transplant recipients. RVI led to 17.9 (95% CI 15.7-20.5) hospital admissions per 1000 patient-years. Intensive care unit admission was required in 4% (27/691) of cases. Thirty-day all-cause case fatality rate was 0.9% (6/696).

Moreover, exaggerated innate and adaptive immune responses might be involved in severe progression of the disease. However, no data on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in transplanted patients are currently available. Here, we report the first assessment of antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 11 kidney-transplanted patients recovered from RT-PCR-confirmed (n = 5) or initially suspected (n = 6) COVID-19. After reduction of immunosuppressive therapy, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 transplant patients were able to mount vigorous antiviral T cell and antibody responses, as efficiently as two nontherapeutically immunosuppressed COVID-19 patients on hemodialysis. By contrast, six RT-PCR-negative patients displayed no antibody response. Among them, three showed very low numbers of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells, whereas no T cell response was detected in the other three, potentially ruling out COVID-19 diagnosis. Low levels of T cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 were also detected in seronegative healthy controls without known exposure to the virus. These results suggest that during COVID-19, monitoring both T cell and serological immunity might be helpful for the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 but are also needed to evaluate a potential role of antiviral T cells in the development of severe forms of the disease.","Candon, Sophie; Guerrot, Dominique; Drouot, Laurent; Lemoine, Mathilde; Lebourg, Ludivine; Hanoy, Mélanie; Boyer, Olivier; Bertrand, Dominique",Am. j. transplant,38,22

A COVID-19 perspective,20.429312,1.413856,2021,"The BCG vaccine has long been recognized for reducing the risk to suffer from infectious diseases unrelated to its target disease, tuberculosis. Evidence from human trials demonstrate substantial reductions in all-cause mortality, especially in the first week of life. Observational studies have identified an association between BCG vaccination and reduced risk of respiratory infectious disease and clinical malaria later in childhood. The mechanistic basis for these pathogen-agnostic benefits, also known as beneficial non-specific effects (NSE) of BCG have been attributed to trained immunity, or epigenetic reprogramming of hematopoietic cells that give rise to innate immune cells responding more efficiently to a broad range of pathogens. Furthermore, within trained immunity, the focus so far has been on enhanced monocyte function. However, polymorphonuclear cells, namely neutrophils, are not only major constituents of the hematopoietic compartment but functionally as well as numerically represent a prominent component of the immune system. The beneficial NSEs of the BCG vaccine on newborn sepsis was recently demonstrated to be driven by a BCG-mediated numeric increase of neutrophils (emergency granulopoiesis (EG)). And experimental evidence in animal models suggest that BCG can modulate neutrophil function as well.

She was transitioned to pembrolizumab every 6 weeks at 4 mg/kg and began to develop oral sores shortly thereafter. The sores proved refractory to nystatin and mouth rinses containing corticosteroids, and the patient was ultimately diagnosed with autoimmune-triggered lichen planus. Unfortunately, her symptoms also proved refractory to typical treatments for lichen planus and worsened to the point where she began to develop cutaneous lesions and difficulty swallowing. Unfortunately, she also developed a keratoacanthoma that required excision. The pembrolizumab was stopped, and the patient’s symptoms improved with 5 days of systemic prednisone, metronidazole, and triamcinolone oral paste. Her NSCLC remains stable off active treatment for 6 months. This case study is on rare auto-immune toxicity as well as a keratoacanthoma from anti-PD-(L) 1 blockade, accompanied by sustained treatment response after cessation of the offending drug.","Preti, Beatrice T.

From a sociology of bodies and emotions, we describe the results of 387 cases, who responded to an online survey during June 2020, differentiating by educational levels and types of management. The secondary or middle level shows a greater workload, with favorable perceptions of what has been done, although with low levels of innovation. The place of affective aspects in the corrections is highlighted at the initial level. Teachers recognize that they are faced with a job that changes quantitatively and qualitatively, but that they comply with and believe they can adapt to technological changes, feeling mainly joy and pride in what they do. It is suggested to deepen the place of new skills in secondary school and the relationship between quantity and quality in the tests.","Vergara, G.; Fraire, V.; Manavella, A.; Salessi, S.",Ijeri-International Journal of Educational Research and Innovation,38,16

The one-day examination took place at the Dorothea Erxleben Learning Center (DELH) of the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg on standardized simulation subjects. In contrast to previous years, all examiners were examined individually in internal medicine, surgery and their elective subject of the practical year. In the evaluations carried out, the standardized cases were assessed as consistent and fair by examiners and exam takers. Approximately 90% of the examiners could imagine to test a state examination with simulated patients again. After successful pilot testing, a study will be conducted in the coming exam to determine whether the substitution of real patients with simulated patients in the M3 exam can contribute to better standardization and objectivity while maintaining the same high level of acceptance in the exam.

This study aimed to examine how factors related to vaccine characteristics, their social normative influence and convenience of vaccination can affect the public's preference for the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in China. METHODS: An online discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey was administered to a sample of China's general population. Participants were asked to make a series of hypothetical choices and estimate their preference for different attributes of the vaccine. A mixed logit regression model was used to analyse the DCE data. Willingness to pay for each attribute was also calculated. RESULTS: Data of 1236 participants who provided valid responses were included in the analysis. There was strong public preference for high effectiveness of the vaccine, followed by long protective duration, very few adverse events and being manufactured overseas. Price was the least important attribute affecting the public preference in selecting the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The strong public preferences detected in this study should be considered when developing COVID-19 vaccination programme in China. The results provide useful information for policymakers to identify the individual and social values for a good vaccination strategy. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The design of the experimental choices was fully based on interviews and focus group discussions participated by 26 Chinese people with diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Without their participation, the study would not be possible.","Dong, Dong; Xu, Richard Huan; Wong, Eliza Lai-Yi; Hung, Chi-Tim; Feng, Da; Feng, Zhanchun; Yeoh, Eng-Kiong; Wong, Samuel Yeung-Shan",Health expect,38,20

The twenty first century is yet again witnessing a gross global pandemic, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Globally no vaccines or drug specific to COVID-19 is available. Corona viruses have been in mutual relationship with humans and other hosts over many decades though aggressive zoonotic strains have caused havoc. Zoonotic emergent corona viruses prior to SARS-COV-2 included severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), with the former leading to aggressive infectious spread and the later with high mortality rate. Although they emerged in the early period of the twenty first century, resilient biomedical and expertise in pharmaceutical domain could not appropriate any proprietary therapeutics. Studies envisaged towards curtailing their spread employed different stages of the virus life cycle with all zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) sharing genomic and structural similarities. Hence the strategies against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could prove effective against the recent outbreak of SAR-CoV-2. The review unravels key events involved in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2 while highlighting the possible avenues of therapy. The review also holds the scope in better understanding a broad-spectrum antivirals, monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors against viral glycoproteins, host cell receptor, viral mRNA synthesis, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and viral proteases in order to design and develop antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2.","Krishna, Gayathri; Pillai, Vinod Soman; Veettil, Mohanan Valiya",Eur J Pharmacol,38,18

Mobile measurements carried out during six runs within a 24-hour period in 2017 and 2020 indicated a decrease of the average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by ∼ 30% and ∼14%, respectively. In turn, stationary measurement results obtained for the same periods demonstrated their increase by respectively ∼35% and ∼106% and a decrease in the average NO2, NOx, C6H6 and CO concentrations. This could have been impacted by meteorological factors and emissions from other, non-traffic-related sources, mainly from residential coal burning.

The global extent of the epidemic and government controls, restrictions and constraints have led to imbalances in world trade and have put many companies under pressure. The epidemic is a test of individual companies' ability to operate effectively in the new environment. It is up to managers to mitigate its impact on business. The aim of the article is to identify the activities of employers in Poland related to the protection of workers with the developing epidemic COVID-19. Methods: A survey was carried out among the employees of OHS services employed in enterprises in Poland. The research was conducted in three stages at two-week intervals. The obtained results were subjected to statistical analyses. Results: In the analysed three periods a total of 588 answers were obtained, which allowed to formulate conclusions. The research showed that in connection with the COVID-19 epidemic, about 30% of the plants updated their occupational risk assessment, about 40% updated their safety instructions, about 90% of the plants equipped their employees with additional personal protective equipment. Conclusions: The COVID-19 outbreak in Poland resulted in taking additional actions by employers to protect workers. Systematicity (methodicality) of these activities depended mainly on the seniority of the OHS service. As a border internship indicating a different approach to an emergency situation related to the epidemic, 7 years were set.","Nowacki, Krzysztof; Grabowska, Sandra; Łakomy, Karolina",Saf. Sci.,38,1

PM2.5 and NO2 are the most significant pollutant agents responsible for facilitating COVID-19 attributed death rates. Besides, we found only six out of many tested causal inferences to be significant and true within the AUPRC analysis. In line with the causal findings, a unidirectional causal effect is found from PM2.5 to Deaths, NO2 to Deaths, and economic growth to both PM2.5 and NO2. Corroborating the first experiment, the causal results confirmed the capability of polluting variables (PM2.5 to Deaths, NO2 to Deaths) to accelerate COVID-19 deaths. In contrast, we found evidence that unsustainable economic growth predicts the dynamics of air pollutants. This shows how unsustainable economic growth could increase environmental pollution by escalating emissions of pollutant agents (PM2.5 and NO2) in New York state.","Magazzino, Cosimo; Mele, Marco; Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu",J Environ Manage,38,1

The uncertainties in the molecular mechanisms leading to the switch from the early virus infection to the advanced stage ARDS is a major gridlock in therapeutic development to reduce mortality. Previous studies in our laboratory have identified matrix metalloprotease-3 (MMP3) as an important mediator of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS, particularly in the exudative phase. Our studies have also reported elevated plasma MMP3 activity levels in the ARDS patients and that inhibition of MMP3 can reduce the severity of LPS-induced ARDS in mice. Given these observations, targeting MMP3 could be a potential option to treat COVID-19 patients with ARDS, and measurement of MMP3 activity in the plasma may serve as a biomarker for the early detection of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.","Kadry, Rana; Newsome, Andrea Sikora; Somanath, Payaningal R",Infectious disorders.

METHODS: Following scoping review methods, we included 30 studies that varied in terms of methodology and theoretical approaches. The search included peer-reviewed articles and grey literature published between March and September 2020. RESULTS: Based on the studies reviewed, we found that COVID-19 infection and death rates increased not only with age and comorbidities, but also with discrimination and structural inequities based on racism and sexism. Racial and ethnic minority workers, including migrant workers, are concentrated in high-risk occupations and this concentration is correlated to lower socioeconomic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic appears in the occupational health and safety spotlight as an exacerbator of already existing socioeconomic inequalities and social inequalities in health, especially in light of the intersection of issues related to racism, ethnic minority status, and sexism. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides early evidence about the limitations of institutions' responses to the pandemic, and their capacity to provide a safe and decent working environment for all workers, regardless of their employment status or the social protections they may enjoy under normal circumstances. It is also important to think about these issues in the postpandemic context, when conditions of precariousness and vulnerability persist and possibly worsen.","Côté, Daniel; Durant, Steve; MacEachen, Ellen; Majowicz, Shannon; Meyer, Samantha; Huynh, Ai-Thuy; Laberge, Marie; Dubé, Jessica",Am. j. ind. med,38,16

These outcomes can range from no apparent impact all the way to spontaneous abortion or fetal infection with long term developmental consequences. While some pathogens have developed mechanisms to cross the placenta and directly infect the fetus, other pathogens lead to an upregulation in maternal or placental inflammation that can indirectly cause harm. The placenta is a temporary, yet critical organ that serves multiple important functions during gestation including facilitation of fetal nutrition, oxygenation, and prevention of fetal infection in utero. Here, we review trophoblast cell immunology and the molecular mechanisms utilized to protect the fetus from infection.

No Capítulo I, foi realizada uma revisão de literatura, que enfocou a raiva como uma zoonose que permeia vários ciclos epidemiológicos. Os morcegos são animais que possuem uma variedade de hábitos alimentares e integrados a eles importantes funções ecológicas. Entretanto os mais conhecidos estão associados a interações negativas, pois se alimentam de sangue (hematófagos) de aves e mamíferos. A espécie Desmodus rotundus, se alimenta estritamente de sangue de mamíferos e hoje é a principal responsável pela veiculação do vírus na região rural, principalmente para bovinos. As modificações nos ambientes naturais, inclusive no bioma Caatinga, que ocupa quase todo território paraibano, desencadeiam desequilíbrios na natureza ativando zoonoses adormecidas como a raiva. Para impedir o ressurgimento de doenças que envolvem vários ciclos devem se trabalhar mecanismos de previsibilidade de zonas de risco. Ferramentas de Geoprocessamento, como SIG (Sistema de Informação Geográfica) pode estimar áreas vulneráveis ao vírus, através da espacialização de dados georreferenciados sobre focos e locais de convívio com o principal transmissor. No Capítulo II, foi desenvolvido um trabalho com o objetivo de caracterizar espacialmente abrigos de morcegos e ocorrências da raiva na região semiárida da Paraíba. Foram utilizados dados fornecidos pela Secretaria de Estado do Desenvolvimento da Agropecuária e da Pesca da Paraíba (SEDAP) do período de 2007 a 2015, informações coletadas da plataforma digital do IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) e um mosaico de imagens do INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais). As representações geográficas foram produzidas através do software QGIS 2.16.0 Nodebo, com malhas cartográficas do IBGE e da Agência Executiva de Gestão das Águas do Estado da Paraíba. No período de 2007 a 2015 foram cadastrados 93 abrigos e registradas 51 ocorrências de raiva distribuídas em todas as mesorregiões do Estado. Através dos abrigos georreferenciados foram plotados buffers de 10 km para verificar os locais de maior risco de circulação do vírus da raiva. Considerando o raio de 10 km mais de 80 municípios estão dentro da zona de risco da circulação do vírus rábico, além de outras cidades de Pernambuco, Ceará e Rio Grande do Norte, que ficam na divisa da Paraíba.

This is an update of an earlier version of the review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of HFNC compared to standard oxygen therapy, or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), for respiratory support in adults in the ICU. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane COVID-19 Register (17 April 2020), clinical trial registers (6 April 2020) and conducted forward and backward citation searches. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled studies (RCTs) with a parallel-group or cross-over design comparing HFNC use versus other types of non-invasive respiratory support (standard oxygen therapy via nasal cannulae or mask; or NIV or NIPPV which included continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure) in adults admitted to the ICU. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 31 studies (22 parallel-group and nine cross-over designs) with 5136 participants; this update included 20 new studies. Twenty-one studies compared HFNC with standard oxygen therapy, and 13 compared HFNC with NIV or NIPPV; three studies included both comparisons. We found 51 ongoing studies (estimated 12,807 participants), and 19 studies awaiting classification for which we could not ascertain study eligibility information. In 18 studies, treatment was initiated after extubation. In the remaining studies, participants were not previously mechanically ventilated. HFNC versus standard oxygen therapy HFNC may lead to less treatment failure as indicated by escalation to alternative types of oxygen therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.86; 15 studies, 3044 participants; low-certainty evidence). HFNC probably makes little or no difference in mortality when compared with standard oxygen therapy (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.11; 11 studies, 2673 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). HFNC probably results in little or no difference to cases of pneumonia (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.09; 4 studies, 1057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and we were uncertain of its effect on nasal mucosa or skin trauma (RR 3.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 31.48; 2 studies, 617 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found low-certainty evidence that HFNC may make little or no difference to the length of ICU stay according to the type of respiratory support used (MD 0.12 days, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.27; 7 studies, 1014 participants). We are uncertain whether HFNC made any difference to the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) within 24 hours of treatment (MD 10.34 mmHg, 95% CI -17.31 to 38; 5 studies, 600 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HFNC made any difference to short-term comfort (MD 0.31, 95% CI -0.60 to 1.22; 4 studies, 662 participants, very low-certainty evidence), or to long-term comfort (MD 0.59, 95% CI -2.29 to 3.47; 2 studies, 445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). HFNC versus NIV or NIPPV We found no evidence of a difference between groups in treatment failure when HFNC were used post-extubation or without prior use of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.22; 5 studies, 1758 participants; low-certainty evidence), or in-hospital mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.31; 5 studies, 1758 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of using HFNC on incidence of pneumonia (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.52; 3 studies, 1750 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and HFNC may result in little or no difference to barotrauma (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.14; 1 study, 830 participants; low-certainty evidence). HFNC may make little or no difference to the length of ICU stay (MD -0.72 days, 95% CI -2.85 to 1.42; 2 studies, 246 participants; low-certainty evidence). The ratio of PaO2/FiO2 may be lower up to 24 hours with HFNC use (MD -58.10 mmHg, 95% CI -71.68 to -44.51; 3 studies, 1086 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HFNC improved short-term comfort when measured using comfort scores (MD 1.33, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.92; 2 studies, 258 participants) and responses to questionnaires (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.53; 1 study, 168 participants); evidence for short-term comfort was very low certainty. No studies reported on nasal mucosa or skin trauma. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HFNC may lead to less treatment failure when compared to standard oxygen therapy, but probably makes little or no difference to treatment failure when compared to NIV or NIPPV. For most other review outcomes, we found no evidence of a difference in effect. However, the evidence was often of low or very low certainty. We found a large number of ongoing studies; including these in future updates could increase the certainty or may alter the direction of these effects.","Lewis, Sharon R; Baker, Philip E; Parker, Roses; Smith, Andrew F",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,38,16

It has been hypothesized that tobacco smoking history may increase severity of this disease in the patients once infected by the underlying coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 because smoking and COVID-19 both cause lung damage. However, this hypothesis has not been tested. OBJECTIVE: Current study was designed to focus on smoking history in patients with COVID-19 and test this hypothesis that tobacco smoking history increases risk for severe COVID-19 by damaging the lungs. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a single-site, retrospective case series study of clinical associations, between epidemiological findings and clinical manifestations, radiographical or laboratory results. In our well-characterized cohort of 954 patients including 56 with tobacco smoking history, smoking history increased the risk for severe COVID-19 with an odds ratio (OR) of 5.5 (95% CI: 3.1-9.9; P = 7.3 × 10-8 ). Meta-analysis of ten cohorts for 2891 patients together obtained an OR of 2.5 (95% CI: 1.9-3.3; P < 0.00001). Semi-quantitative analysis of lung images for each of five lobes revealed a significant difference in neither lung damage at first examination nor dynamics of the lung damage at different time-points of examinations between the smoking and nonsmoking groups. No significant differences were found either in laboratory results including D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels except different covariances for density of the immune cells lymphocyte (P = 3.8 × 10-64 ) and neutrophil (P = 3.9 × 10-46 ). CONCLUSION: Tobacco smoking history increases the risk for great severity of COVID-19 but this risk is achieved unlikely by affecting the lungs.","Li, J; Long, X; Zhang, Q; Fang, X; Li, N; Fedorova, B; Hu, S; Li, Jh; Xiong, N; Lin, Z",J. intern. med,38,29

Typically, genetic sequencing is required to be able to track VOCs in real-time. However, sequencing can take time and may not be accessible in all laboratories. Genotyping by RT-ddPCR offers an alternative to rapidly detect VOCs through discrimination of specific alleles such as N501Y, which is associated with increased transmissibility and virulence. Here we describe the first cases of the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 detected in Washington State by using a combination of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RT-ddPCR, and next-generation sequencing. We initially screened 1035 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by our CDC-based laboratory-developed assay using ThermoFisher's multiplex RT-PCR COVID-19 assay over four weeks from late December 2020 to early January 2021. S gene target failures (SGTF) were subsequently assayed by RT-ddPCR to confirm four mutations within the S gene associated with the B.1.1.7 lineage: a deletion at amino acid (AA) 69-70 (ACATGT), deletion at AA 145, (TTA), N501Y mutation (TAT), and S982A mutation (GCA). All four targets were detected in two specimens; follow-up sequencing revealed a total of 9 mutations in the S gene and phylogenetic clustering within the B.1.1.7 lineage. Next, we continued screening samples for SGTF detecting 23 additional B.1.1.7 variants by RT-ddPCR and confirmed by sequencing. As VOCs become increasingly prevalent, molecular diagnostic tools like RT-ddPCR can be utilized to quickly, accurately, and sensitively distinguish more contagious lineages of SARS-CoV-2.","Perchetti, Garrett A; Zhu, Haiying; Mills, Margaret G; Shrestha, Lasata; Wagner, Cassia; Bakhash, Shah Mohamed; Lin, Michelle J; Xie, Hong; Huang, Meei-Li; Mathias, Patrick; Bedford, Trevor; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L; Roychoudhury, Pavitra",J Med Virol,38,1

Large-scale digital contact tracing (DCT) has emerged as a potential solution to resume economic and social activity while minimizing spread of the virus. Various DCT methods have been proposed, each making trade-offs between privacy, mobility restrictions, and public health. The most common approach, binary contact tracing (BCT), models infection as a binary event, informed only by an individual's test results, with corresponding binary recommendations that either all or none of the individual's contacts quarantine. BCT ignores the inherent uncertainty in contacts and the infection process, which could be used to tailor messaging to high-risk individuals, and prompt proactive testing or earlier warnings. It also does not make use of observations such as symptoms or pre-existing medical conditions, which could be used to make more accurate infectiousness predictions. In this paper, we use a recently-proposed COVID-19 epidemiological simulator to develop and test methods that can be deployed to a smartphone to locally and proactively predict an individual's infectiousness (risk of infecting others) based on their contact history and other information, while respecting strong privacy constraints. Predictions are used to provide personalized recommendations to the individual via an app, as well as to send anonymized messages to the individual's contacts, who use this information to better predict their own infectiousness, an approach we call proactive contact tracing (PCT). We find a deep-learning based PCT method which improves over BCT for equivalent average mobility, suggesting PCT could help in safe re-opening and second-wave prevention.","Bengio, Yoshua; Gupta, Prateek; Maharaj, Tegan; Rahaman, Nasim; Weiss, Martin; Deleu, Tristan; Muller, Eilif; Qu, Meng; Schmidt, Victor; St-Charles, Pierre-Luc; Alsdurf, Hannah; Bilanuik, Olexa; Buckeridge, David; Caron, G'aetan Marceau; Carrier, Pierre-Luc; Ghosn, Joumana; Ortiz-Gagne, Satya; Pal, Chris; Rish, Irina; Scholkopf, Bernhard; Sharma, Abhinav; Tang, Jian; Williams, Andrew",,38,5

Evidence from spatial analysis of New Orleans patient data at walk-up sites,20.70116,1.3854569,2021,"OBJECTIVES: A hospital-related cluster of 22 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Taiwan in January-February 2021. Rigorous control measures were introduced and could only be relaxed once the outbreak was declared over. Each day after the apparent outbreak end, we estimated the risk of future cases occurring in order to inform decision-making. METHODS: Probabilistic transmission networks were reconstructed, and transmission parameters (the reproduction number R and overdispersion parameter k) were estimated. The reporting delay during the outbreak was estimated (Scenario 1). In addition, a counterfactual scenario with less effective interventions characterized by a longer reporting delay was considered (Scenario 2). Each day, the risk of future cases was estimated under both scenarios. RESULTS: The values of R and k were estimated to be 1.30 ((95% credible interval (CI) 0.57-3.80) and 0.38 (95% CI 0.12-1.20), respectively. The mean reporting delays considered were 2.5 days (Scenario 1) and 7.8 days (Scenario 2). Following the final case, ttthe inferred probability of future cases occurring declined more quickly in Scenario 1 than Scenario 2. CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous control measures allowed the outbreak to be declared over quickly following outbreak containment. This highlights the need for effective interventions, not only to reduce cases during outbreaks but also to allow outbreaks to be declared over with confidence.","Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R; Jung, Sung-Mok; Cheng, Hao-Yuan; Thompson, Robin N",Int J Infect Dis,38,20

GD generates a significant clinical discomfort for at least six months. METHODS: Case report and non-systematic literature review. Case presentation A 56-year-old male-to-female patient, who had a history of coronary disease and a second thromboembolic event after hormone therapy (self-medicated). Once she had received acute management for the cardiovascular disease, she consulted for her GD. DISCUSSION: GD requires multidisciplinary management. Cross-sex hormonal therapy is considered the main treatment. It has been documented that oral oestrogen preparations may increase the risk of thromboembolic events in patients over the age of 40, especially when they have cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive treatment should be offered to everyone who has GD, to relieve psychological distress, decrease psychiatric comorbidity and improve quality of life. To date, there is little scientific evidence regarding cross-sex hormonal therapy in transgender women over the age of 40; we therefore recommend multidisciplinary, close and rigorous monitoring, in particular when they have cardiovascular risk.","Ocampo-Serna, Sabina; Gutiérrez-Segura, Julio César; Vallejo-González, Santiago",Rev Colomb Psiquiatr,38,17

Fatty acids, such as arachidic acid (AA), self-assemble on graphite into a sheet of parallel stripes with a periodicity of twice its molecular chain length. The molecular pattern is thus defined precisely by the size and functionality of the headgroup and tailgroup of the amphiphile. Complexation of metal ions to AA fixes the number and location of the ion, which can serve as a precursor to semiconductor nanocrystal arrays. In order to understand the effect of the ion complexation, we carry out atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) investigations of AA self-assembly in the presence of various metal ions. While the stripe orientation is dictated by the graphite lattice and the stripe periodicity is determined by the AA chain length, the size, shape, and degree of order of the stripe crystalline domain are influenced by the metal ion bond strength to the carboxylic ligand. The change of morphology in the self-assembled pattern shows a trend along the Irving-Williams series.","Dong, Wen-Fei; Wang, Ruomiao; Mao, Guangzhao; Möhwald, Helmuth",Soft Matter,38,16

Surveillance based on case reporting has become the core pandemic monitoring method in the country and globally. However, population-based seroprevalence studies may provide an unbiased estimate of the actual disease spread and, in combination with multiple surveillance tools, help to define the pandemic course. This study summarises results from four consecutive serological surveys conducted between May 2020 and April 2021 at St. Petersburg, Russia and combines them with other SARS-CoV-2 surveillance data. MethodsWe conducted four serological surveys of two random samples (May-June, July-August, October-December 2020, and February-April 2021) from adults residing in St. Petersburg recruited with the random digit dialing (RDD), accompanied by a telephone interview to collect information on both individuals who accepted and declined the invitation for testing and account for non-response. We have used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay CoronaPass total antibodies test (Genetico, Moscow, Russia) to report seroprevalence. We corrected the estimates for non-response using the bivariate probit model and also accounted the test performance characteristics, obtained from independent assay evaluation. In addition, we have summarised the official registered cases statistics, the number of hospitalised patients, the number of COVID-19 deaths, excess deaths, tests performed, data from the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) surveillance, the vaccination uptake, and St. Petersburg search and mobility trends. The infection fatality ratios (IFR) have been calculated using the Bayesian evidence synthesis model. FindingsAfter calling 113,017 random mobile phones we have reached 14,118 individuals who responded to computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and 2,413 provided blood samples at least once through the seroprevalence study. The adjusted seroprevalence in May-June, 2020 was 9.7% (95%: 7.7-11.7), 13.3% (95% 9.9-16.6) in July-August, 2020, 22.9% (95%: 20.3-25.5) in October-December, 2021 and 43.9% (95%: 39.7-48.0) in February-April, 2021. History of any symptoms, history of COVID-19 tests, and non-smoking status were significant predictors for higher seroprevalence. Most individuals remained seropositive with a maximum 10 months follow-up. 92.7% (95% CI 87.9-95.7) of participants who have reported at least one vaccine dose were seropositive. Hospitalisation and COVID-19 death statistics and search terms trends reflected the pandemic course better than the official case count, especially during the spring 2020. SARS-CoV-2 circulation showed rather low genetic SARS-CoV-2 lineages diversity that increased in the spring 2021. Local VOC (AT.1) was spreading till April 2021, but B.1.617.2 substituted all other lineages by June 2021. The IFR based on the excess deaths was equal to 1.04 (95% CI 0.80-1.31) for the adult population and 0.86% (95% CI 0.66-1.08) for the entire population. ConclusionApproximately one year after the COVID-19 pandemic about 45% of St. Petersburg, Russia residents contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Combined with vaccination uptake of about 10% it was enough to slow the pandemic until the Delta VOC started to spread. Combination of several surveillance tools provides a comprehensive pandemic picture.

That is, an anti-scientists bias was related to lessened concern and toward less preventive behaviors. Furthermore, those who were the most optimistic about hydroxychloroquine, a purported but unproven treatment against the virus, were less likely to engage in behaviors designed to decrease the spread of COVID-19. In Study 3 (n = 259), asking participants to watch a scientist discuss hydroxychloroquine on Fox News led people to greater endorsement of COVID behaviors. In short, positive feelings toward scientists, rather than political attitudes or knowledge, related to who was concerned and those willing to engage in pandemic reducing behaviors.

This virus can provoke acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to overcrowed the intensive care unit (ICU). Over the last months, worldwide experience demonstrated that the ARDS in COVID-19 patients are in many ways ""atypical"". The mortality rate in ventilated patients is high despite the application of the gold standard treatment (protective ventilation, curare, prone position, inhaled NO). Several studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could interact negatively on red blood cell homeostasis. Furthermore, SarsCov2 creates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are toxic and generate endothelial dysfunction. Hypothesis/objective(s) We hypothesis that HEMO2Life® administrated intravenously is safe and could help symptomatically the patient condition. It would increase arterial oxygen content despite lung failure and allow better tissue oxygenation control. The use of HEMO2Life® is also interesting due to its anti-oxidative effect preventing cytokine storm induced by the SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of the hypothesis: Hemarina is based on the properties of the hemoglobin of the Arenicola marina sea-worm (HEMO2Life®). This extracellular hemoglobin has an oxygen capacity 40 times greater than the hemoglobin of vertebrates. Furthermore, the size of this molecule is 250 times smaller than a human red blood cell, allowing it to diffuse in all areas of the microcirculation, without diffusing outside the vascular sector. It possesses an antioxidative property du a Superoxide Dismutase Activity. This technology has been the subject of numerous publications and HEMO2Life® was found to be well-tolerated and did not induce toxicity. It was administered intravenously to hamsters and rats, and showed no acute effect on heart rate and blood pressure and did not cause microvascular vasoconstriction. In preclinical in vivo models (mice, rats, and dogs), HEMO2Life® has enabled better tissue oxygenation, especially in the brain. This molecule has already been used in humans in organ preservation solutions and the patients showed no abnormal clinical signs. CONSEQUENCES OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The expected benefits of HEMO2Life® for COVID-19 patients are improved survival, avoidance of tracheal intubation, shorter oxygen supplementation, and the possibility of treating a larger number of patients as molecular respirator without to use an invasive machine.","Lupon, Elise; Lellouch, Alexandre G; Zal, Franck; Cetrulo, Curtis L; Lantieri, Laurent A",Med Hypotheses,38,30

Although the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less clinically apparent, collecting high-quality biospecimens from infants, children, and adolescents in a standardized manner during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential to establish a biologic understanding of the disease in the pediatric population. This biorepository enables pediatric centers world-wide to collect samples uniformly to drive forward our understanding of COVID-19 by addressing specific pediatric and neonatal COVID-19-related questions. METHODS: A COVID-19 biospecimen collection study was implemented with strategic enrollment guidelines to include patients seen in urgent care clinics and hospital settings, neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, and asymptomatic children. The methodology described here, details the importance of establishing collaborations between the clinical and research teams to harmonize protocols for patient recruitment and sample collection, processing and storage. It also details modifications required for biobanking during a surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Considerations and challenges facing enrollment of neonatal and pediatric cohorts are described. A roadmap is laid out for successful collection, processing, storage and database management of multiple pediatric samples such as blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, saliva, tracheal aspirates, stool, and urine. Using this methodology, we enrolled 327 participants, who provided a total of 972 biospecimens. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric biospecimens will be key in answering questions relating to viral transmission by children, differences between pediatric and adult viral susceptibility and immune responses, the impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on fetal development, and factors driving the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. The specimens in this biorepository will allow necessary comparative studies between children and adults, help determine the accuracy of current pediatric viral testing techniques, in addition to, understanding neonatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease abnormalities. The successful establishment of a pediatric biorepository is critical to provide insight into disease pathogenesis, and subsequently, develop future treatment and vaccination strategies.","Lima, Rosiane; Gootkind, Elizabeth F; De la Flor, Denis; Yockey, Laura J; Bordt, Evan A; D039,; Avino, Paolo; Ning, Shen; Heath, Katerina; Harding, Katherine; Zois, Jaclyn; Park, Grace; Hardcastle, Margot; Grinke, Kathleen A; Grimmel, Sheila; Davidson, Susan P; Forde, Pamela J; Hall, Kathryn E; Neilan, Anne M; Matute, Juan D; Lerou, Paul H; Fasano, Alessio; Shui, Jessica E; Edlow, Andrea G; Yonker, Lael M",BMC Med Res Methodol,38,8

We undertook an online survey to measure the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in Indonesia. The WTP was assessed using a simple dichotomous contingent valuation approach and a linear regression model was used to assess its associated determinants. There were 1,359 respondents who completed the survey.

Being a health-care worker, having a high income, and having high perceived risk were associated with higher WTP. These findings suggest that the WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high in Indonesia. This WTP information can be used to construct a payment model for a COVID-19 vaccine in the country.

OBJECTIVE: Study objectives include estimating incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential workers by symptom presentation and demographic factors, determining independent effects of occupational and community exposures on incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, establishing molecular and immunologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential workers, describing the duration and patterns of rRT-PCR-positivity, and examining post-vaccine immunologic response. METHODS: Eligible participants include Arizona residents aged 18-85 years who work at least 20 hours per week in an occupation involving regular direct contact (within three feet) with others. Recruitment goals are stratified by demographic characteristics (50% aged 40 or older, 50% women, and 50% Hispanic or American Indian), by occupation (40% healthcare personnel, 30% first responders, and 30% other essential workers), and by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (with up to 50% seropositive at baseline). Information on sociodemographics, health and medical history, vaccination status, exposures to individuals with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, use of personal protective equipment, and perceived risks are collected at enrollment and updated through quarterly surveys. Every week, participants complete active surveillance for COVID-19-like illness (CLI) and self-collect nasal swabs. Additional self-collected nasal swab and saliva specimens are collected in the event of CLI onset. Respiratory specimens are sent to Marshfield Laboratories and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. CLI symptoms and impact on work and productivity are followed through illness resolution. Serum specimens are collected every 3 months and additional sera are collected following incident rRT-PCR positivity and after each COVID-19 vaccine dose. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections will be calculated by person-weeks at risk and compared by occupation and demographic characteristics and by seropositivity status and infection and vaccination history. RESULTS: The AZ HEROES study was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Some groups of chronic patients including thalassaemia and other haemoglobin disorders were considered from the beginning of the pandemic, as vulnerable and high risk ones with regards to a more severe clinical outcome of the infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This is because patients with thalassaemia can present with many and multiple co-morbidities including diabetes, heart, liver, endocrine and other conditions mainly secondary to iron overload and consequent to ineffective or suboptimal medical care and/or adherence to chelation treatment in particular. Transfusion dependent patients with Β-thalassaemia have been greatly affected across the world, including in Iran, a country geographically situated in the so called thalassaemia belt. Iran with about 20,000 patients with Β-thalassaemia and quite successful disease specific prevention and management national programmes faced challenges similar to others. Blood shortages for example consequent to COVID-19 precaution measures taken in every country to contain the virus and the difficulties in accessing drugs including lifesaving ones (iron chelation medication) constitute major challenges. In Iran however, and despite the multiple difficulties as described above, SARS-CoV-2 had a rather small impact regarding infection rates as compared to the rest of the countries, albeit a higher mortality rate reaching 26.5% amongst COVID-19 diagnosed patients. More comprehensive data however from a bigger number of patients with thalassaemia across the world infected with SARS-CoV- 2 is necessary to draw any reliable conclusions as to the level of vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 and importantly the clinical impact of this virus in these patients.","Dehshal, Mahmoud Hadipour; Hosoya, Sachiko; Bahremani, Fatemeh Hashemi; Namini, Mehdi Tabrizi; Eleftheriou, Androulla",Thalassemia Rep.,38,16

Convergent evidence from the current and previous pandemics indicates that nurses experience the highest levels of psychological distress compared with other health professionals. Nurse leaders face particular challenges in mitigating risk and supporting nursing staff to negotiate moral distress and fatigue during large-scale, sustained crises. Synthesizing the burgeoning literature on COVID-19-related burnout and moral distress faced by nurses and identifying effective interventions to reduce poor mental health outcomes will enable nurse leaders to support the resilience of their teams. Aim: This paper aims to (1) synthesize existing literature on COVID-19-related burnout and moral distress among nurses and (2) identify recommendations for nurse leaders to support the psychological needs of nursing staff. Methods: Comprehensive searches were conducted in Medline, Embase and PsycINFO (via Ovid); CINAHL (via EBSCOHost); and ERIC (via ProQUEST). The rapid review was completed in accordance with the World Health Organization Rapid Review Guide. Key Findings: Thematic analysis of selected studies suggests that nurses are at an increased risk for stress, burnout and depression during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Younger female nurses with less clinical experience are more vulnerable to adverse mental health outcomes.","Sriharan, Abi; West, Keri J; Almost, Joan; Hamza, Aden",Nurs Leadersh (Tor Ont),38,16

BACKGROUND: Nurses play a major role in response to pandemics and epidemics in delivering patient care. The experiences of nurses who provided care have significant short and long-term consequences for individuals, communities, and the nursing profession. METHODS: Descriptive qualitative research approach was adopted in this study. We interviewed 12 nurses (22-50 years) who cared for the coronavirus disease 2019 patients in one of the clinical units of two coronavirus disease 2019 hospitals in Iraqi Kurdistan in 2020. Interviews were conducted via phone calls and were analysed using the thematic analysis method. The Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research checklist was applied when constructing this paper. RESULTS: The nurses had to care for a number of situations during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in Kurdistan. As people in the public did not believe that there was such a virus, nurses often had to deal with this lack of knowledge and aggression from some patients and their family members. Most nurses changed their preventive behaviours since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak at hospital or in public. This was mainly to protect not only themselves but their patients, colleagues, family members and friends. They were cautious about the use of a mask at the hospital and in public. Most nurses experienced fear, stress, anxiety and isolation during this period. CONCLUSIONS: The patients had some concerns about their health and staying at hospitals, and some of them had aggressive behaviours towards nurses at corona hospitals. The public, close friends and relatives of the nurses had a fear of getting the infection by the virus through the nurses. However, the nurses attempted to protect themselves, colleagues and family members, and provide the best care to coronavirus disease 2019 patients. The nurses had a high obligation towards care giving at hospitals. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The negative experiences of the nurses regarding the care of coronavirus disease 2019 patients must be considered in clinical settings. Sensitive policy programs must be established to protect nurses from the ostracization and stigmatization of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and to allow them to be able to achieve their professional practices safely.","Abdulah, Deldar Morad; Mohammedsadiq, Hawar Abdulrazaq; Liamputtong, Pranee",J. clin. nurs,38,6

In diatoms and green algae, plasma-membranes are moderately to highly permeable to CO2 but effectively impermeable to HCO3 - . Here, CO2 and HCO3 - membrane permeabilities were measured using an 18 O-exchange technique on two species of haptophyte algae, Emiliania huxleyi and Calcidiscus leptoporus, which showed that the plasma membranes of these species are also highly permeable to CO2 (0.006 to 0.02 cm · s-1 ) but minimally permeable to HCO3 - . Increased temperature and CO2 generally increased CO2 membrane permeabilities in both species, possibly due to changes in lipid composition or CO2 channel proteins. Changes in CO2 membrane permeabilities showed no association with the density of calcium carbonate coccoliths surrounding the cell, which could potentially impede passage of compounds. Haptophyte plasma membrane permeabilities to CO2 were somewhat lower than those of diatoms but generally higher than membrane permeabilities of green algae. One caveat of these measurements is that the model used to interpret 18 O-exchange data assumes that carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes 18 O-exchange, is homogeneously distributed in the cell. The implications of this assumption were tested by using a two-compartment model with an inhomogeneous distribution of carbonic anhydrase to simulate 18 O-exchange data and then inferring plasma-membrane CO2 permeabilities from the simulated data. This analysis showed that the inferred plasma-membrane CO2 permeabilities are minimal estimates but should be quite accurate under most conditions.","Blanco-Ameijeiras, Sonia; Stoll, Heather M; Zhang, Hongrui; Hopkinson, Brian M",,38,24

Objective: To estimate frequency of and reasons for reported forgone medical care from March to mid-July 2020 and examine characteristics of US adults who reported forgoing care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used data from the second wave of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey, fielded from July 7 to July 22, 2020. Respondents included a national sample of 1337 individuals aged 18 years or older in the US who were part of National Opinion Research Center's AmeriSpeak Panel. Exposures: The initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, defined as from March to mid-July 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were missed doses of prescription medications; forgone preventive and other general medical care, mental health care, and elective surgeries; forgone care for new severe health issues; and reasons for forgoing care. Results: Of 1468 individuals who completed wave 1 of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey (70.4% completion rate), 1337 completed wave 2 (91.1% completion rate). The sample of respondents included 691 (52%) women, 840 non-Hispanic White individuals (63%), 160 non-Hispanic Black individuals (12%), and 223 Hispanic individuals (17%). The mean (SE) age of respondents was 48 (0.78) years. A total of 544 respondents (41%) forwent medical care from March through mid-July 2020. Among 1055 individuals (79%) who reported needing care, 544 (52%) reported forgoing care for any reason, 307 (29%) forwent care owing to fear of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, and 75 (7%) forwent care owing to financial concerns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents who were unemployed, compared with those who were employed, forwent care more often (121 of 186 respondents [65%] vs 251 of 503 respondents [50%]; P = .01) and were more likely to attribute forgone care to fear of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (78 of 186 respondents [42%] vs 120 of 503 respondents [24%]; P = .002) and financial concerns (36 of 186 respondents [20%] vs 28 of 503 respondents [6%]; P = .001). Respondents lacking health insurance were more likely to attribute forgone care to financial concerns than respondents with Medicare or commercial coverage (19 of 88 respondents [22%] vs 32 of 768 respondents [4%]; P < .001). Frequency of and reasons for forgone care differed in some instances by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and health status. Conclusions and Relevance: This survey study found a high frequency of forgone care among US adults from March to mid-July 2020. Policies to improve health care affordability and to reassure individuals that they can safely seek care may be necessary with surging COVID-19 case rates.","Anderson, Kelly E; McGinty, Emma E; Presskreischer, Rachel; Barry, Colleen L",JAMA Netw Open,38,23

In this context, development of suitable interventions is the need of the hour. The viral spike protein (S Protein) and the cognate host cell receptor ACE2 can be considered as effective and appropriate targets for interventions. It is evident from the present computational study, that catechin and curcumin, not only exhibit strong binding affinity to viral S Protein and host receptor ACE2 but also to their complex (receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 and ACE2; RBD/ACE2-complex). The binding affinity values of catechin and curcumin for the S protein, ACE2 and RBD/ACE2-complex are - 10.5 and - 7.9 kcal/mol; - 8.9 and - 7.8 kcal/mol; and - 9.1 and - 7.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Curcumin directly binds to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of viral S Protein. Molecular simulation study over a period of 100 ns further substantiates that such interaction within RBD site of S Protein occurs during 40-100 ns out of 100 ns simulation trajectory. Contrary to this, catechin binds with amino acid residues present near the RBD site of S Protein and causes fluctuation in the amino acid residues of the RBD and its near proximity. Both catechin and curcumin bind the interface of 'RBD/ACE2-complex' and intervene in causing fluctuation of the alpha helices and beta-strands of the protein complex. Protein-protein interaction studies in presence of curcumin or catechin also corroborate the above findings suggesting the efficacy of these two polyphenols in hindering the formation of S Protein-ACE2 complex. In conclusion, this computational study for the first time predicts the possibility of above two polyphenols for therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV2.","Jena, Atala B; Kanungo, Namrata; Nayak, Vinayak; Chainy, G B N; Dandapat, Jagneshwar",Sci Rep,38,16

PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, and CINAHL electronic databases were searched to identify studies that assessed the impact of telemedicine on clinical outcomes, with no publication date restrictions. The reference lists of the selected articles were hand-searched for additional studies that had not been identified by the initial electronic search. Studies were included if they had a cohort design, used telemedicine, were conducted in PICUs or specialized PICUs, and were published in Portuguese, English, or Spanish. Two groups of reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion. The same group of reviewers independently assessed the full-text articles for eligibility and extracted the following information: telecommunication method, intervention characteristics, patient characteristics, sample size, and main results. Studies were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of PICU mortality and length of PICU stay. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Of 2703 studies initially identified, 2226 had their titles and abstracts screened. Of these, 53 were selected for full-text reading, of which 10 were included and analyzed. The main results of interest were length of PICU stay, number of deaths or mortality rate, and satisfaction of health professionals and family members. The results of meta-analysis show that the mortality rate reduced by 34% with an increase of the length of PICU stay in the PICUs with the use of telemedicine. Family members and health professionals were satisfied with the use of telemedicine. Telemedicine has the potential to improve PICU outcomes, such as mortality rate and family and staff satisfaction.

Here, we describe a digital warm-start CRISPR (dWS-CRISPR) assay for sensitive quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The dWS-CRISPR assay is initiated at above 50 °C and overcomes undesired premature target amplification at room temperature, enabling accurate and reliable digital quantification of SARS-CoV-2. By targeting SARS-CoV-2's nucleoprotein gene, the dWS-CRISPR assay is able to detect down to 5 copies/µl SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the chip. It is clinically validated by quantitatively determining 32 clinical swab samples and three clinical saliva samples. Moreover, it has been demonstrated to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 in heat-treated saliva samples without RNA extraction. Thus, the dWS-CRISPR method, as a sensitive and reliable CRISPR assay, facilitates accurate SARS-CoV-2 detection toward digitized quantification.","Ding, Xiong; Yin, Kun; Li, Ziyue; Sfeir, Maroun M; Liu, Changchun",Biosens Bioelectron,38,16

Learning from past epidemics enables public health authorities to assess aspects of the overall response system to improve the system. Moreover, learning during a crisis makes it possible to develop an approach to address unique and rapidly evolving epidemic situations. In this study, the literature was reviewed, and interviews were conducted with a director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a regulatory manager of a multinational medical equipment company. On the basis of that research, this article examines how crisis learning has facilitated a South Korean disease control agency’s surveillance of infectious diseases and its development of in vitro diagnosis kits. Those kits enabled qualified private health providers to diagnose COVID-19 infections in cooperation with multiple partners in the early period of the outbreak response. The agency’s learning from a past epidemic crisis, shared sense-making, and proactive efforts helped the nation to flatten the curve of the numbers of the confirmed cases in a short period of time.

Our aim was to investigate adherence to SCIT with aeroallergens during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrate clinical consequences of treatment disruptions in real life. METHODS: Visual analogue scale for quality of life (VAS-QoL), VAS for symptom scores (VAS-symptom), medication scores (MSs), and total symptom scores (TSS-6) were recorded during the pandemic in 327 adult allergic rhinitis and/or asthmatic patients receiving maintenance SCIT, and these scores were compared with the pre-pandemic data. Patients were grouped according to SCIT administration intervals; no delay (Group 1), <2 months (Group 2), and &#8805;2-month intervals (Group 3). RESULTS: A total of 104 (31.8%) patients (Group 3) were considered as nonadherent which was mostly related to receiving SCIT with HDMs and using public transportation for reaching the hospital. Median MS, VAS-symptom, and TSS-6 scores of Group 3 patients during the pandemic were higher than the pre-pandemic scores (p = 0.005, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), whereas median VAS-QoL scores of Group 3 during the pandemic were lower than the pre-pandemic scores (p < 0.001). Median TSS-6 and VAS-symptom scores were the highest in Group 3 compared with other groups (p < 0.001 for each comparison). Median VAS-QoL scores were the lowest in Group 3 compared with Group 1 and Group 2 (p < 0.001, p = 0.043, respectively). CONCLUSION: When precautions in allergy clinics are carefully applied, adherence to SCIT can be high during a pandemic. Patients must be encouraged to regularly adhere to SCIT injections since delays in SCIT administration can deteriorate clinical symptoms.","Yegit, Osman Ozan; Demir, Semra; Ünal, Derya; Olgaç, Müge; Terzioglu, Kadriye; Eyice Karabacak, Deniz; Tüzer, Can; Ayhan, Vehbi; Çolakoglu, Bahattin; Büyüköztürk, Suna; Gelincik, Asli",Allergy,38,14

The model has been used in the room-average analysis of infection risk and analysis using passive scalars as a proxy for aerosol transport. However, it has not been employed for risk estimation in numerical simulations of droplet dispersion. In this work, we develop a framework for the evaluation of the probability of infection in droplet dispersion simulations using the dose-response model. We introduce a version of the model that can incorporate the higher transmissibility of variant strains of SARS-CoV2 and the effect of vaccination in evaluating the probability of infection. Numerical simulations of droplet dispersion during speech are carried out to investigate the infection risk over space and time using the model. The advantage of droplet dispersion simulations for risk evaluation is demonstrated through the analysis of the effect of humidity on infection risk.","Bale, Rahul; Iida, Akiyoshi; Yamakawa, Masashi; Li, ChungGang; Tsubokura, Makoto",,38,16

Cardiac transplantation is the last resort for patients with severe heart failure, but donor shortages represent a critical issue. Cardiac regenerative therapy is beneficial, but it is currently unsuitable as a substitute for cardiac transplantation. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are excellent sources for the generation of terminally differentiated cells. The preparation of a large number of pure cardiomyocytes (CMs) is the major premise for translational studies. To control the quality of the generated CMs, an efficient differentiation method, purification strategy, and mass-scale culture must be developed. Metabolic purification and large-scale culture systems have been established, and pure hiPSC-derived CMs of clinical grade are now available for translational research. The most critical challenge in cell therapy is the engraftment of transplanted cells. To overcome the low engraftment ratio of single CMs, aggregations of CMs are developed as cardiac spheroids. A cardiac transplantation device with domed tips and lateral holes has been developed for the transplantation of cardiac spheroids. Large animal models are necessary as the next step in the process toward clinical application. The transplant device has successfully been used to inject cardiac spheroids uniformly into myocardial layers in swine, and this approach is progressing toward clinical use. Remaining issues include immunological rejection and arrhythmia, which will require further investigation to establish safe and effective transplantation. This review summarizes the present status and future challenges of cardiac regenerative therapies.","Fujita, Jun",Keio j. med,38,16

RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with IBD are not at increased risk of COVID-19 but several risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) have been identified, such as active IBD, obesity, and corticosteroid use. COVID-19 outcomes are similar among patients with IBD and the overall population. Although biologics have not been shown to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 complications, several risk factors have been associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD, including older age, obesity, the presence of comorbidities, active disease, and corticosteroid use. IBD therapy should, therefore, be continued with the aim of attaining or maintaining remission, except for corticosteroids, which should be held or reduced to the minimal effective dose.

The aim of the study was to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of an EMD telephone screening process for the identification of hospital diagnosed COVID-19 positive patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of adult EMS encounters presenting to hospitals within a large health system from March 16-June 30, 2020. EMD telephone screening status was defined as either ""positive"" or ""negative"" and was collected from prehospital medical records. COVID-19 positive patients were confirmed via hospital laboratory diagnosis and were matched to their prehospital medical record data. Patient demographics and EMS encounter level data, such as Dispatch Code and Priority level, were also collected. Estimations of sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were made. Emergency telephone screening status was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis to describe discordant pairs. Results: Of the 3,443 total encounters screened, there were 652 patients who were subsequently COVID-19 positive per hospital diagnosis (18.9%). Approximately 5.0% of all encounters did not screen positive on EMD screening but were later COVID-19 positive. Conversely, 44.2% of encounters screened positive for COVID-19, but were subsequently negative. Sensitivity of the EMD telephonic screening was estimated as 75.0% (95% CI 71.7%, 78.3%) and specificity was 45.5% (95% CI 43.7%, 47.4%). The PPV was 24.3% (95% CI 22.5%, 26.0%), and NPV 88.6% (95% CI 87.0%, 90.3%). Conclusions: The sensitivity of the EMD telephonic screening process was moderately able to identify COVID-19 positive patients. There is a need to reevaluate and revise guidelines and recommendations, specifically modified caller queries, as part of ongoing pandemic emergency response efforts in order to reduce transmissions and maximize patient and provider safety.","McCann-Pineo, Molly; Li, Timmy; Barbara, Paul; Levinsky, Brian; Debono, James; Berkowitz, Jonathan",Prehosp Emerg Care,38,30

Consistent epidemiologic evidence of reduced severity of infection in children across different populations and countries suggests there are underlying biological differences between children and adults that mediate differential disease pathogenesis. This presents a unique opportunity to learn about disease-modifying host factors from pediatric populations. Our review summarizes the current knowledge of pediatric clinical disease, role in transmission, risks for severe disease, protective immunity, as well as novel therapies and vaccine trials for children. We then define key hypotheses and areas for future research that can use the pediatric model of disease, transmission, and immunity to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies for people of all age groups.","Singh, Tulika; Heston, Sarah M; Langel, Stephanie N; Blasi, Maria; Hurst, Jillian H; Fouda, Genevieve G; Kelly, Matthew S; Permar, Sallie R",Clin Infect Dis,38,29

Educators' common reliance on such material highlights the paucity of equipoised depictions of modern ECT well suited for the training of health professionals. The authors developed and tested a new educational module enhanced by videotaped depictions of a simulated patient undergoing the consent, treatment, recovery, and follow-up phases of ECT. METHODS: The didactic intervention interspersed 7 short video clips (totaling 14 min) into a 55-min lecture on treatment-resistant depression. The session, part of an intensive course of preclinical psychiatry, was delivered online through synchronous videoconferencing with Zoom. The primary outcome measure was change in the Questionnaire on Attitudes and Knowledge of ECT (QuAKE). RESULTS: Fifty-three out of 63 (87%) eligible second-year medical students completed assessments at baseline and after exposure to the didactic intervention. QuAKE scores improved between baseline and endpoint: the Attitudes composite increased from 49.4 ± 6.1 to 59.1 ± 5.7 (paired t 10.65, p < 0.001, Cohen's d 0.69), and the Knowledge composite from 13.3 ± 1.2 to 13.9 ± 0.8 (paired t 3.97, p < 0.001, Cohen's d 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: These video-based educational materials proved easy to implement in the virtual classroom, were amenable to adaptation by end-use instructors, were well received by learners, and led to measurable changes in students' knowledge of and attitudes toward ECT.","Kitay, Brandon; Martin, Andrés; Chilton, Julie; Amsalem, Doron; Duvivier, Robbert; Goldenberg, Matthew",Acad. psychiatry,38,1

We aimed at identifying the variables associated with psychological distress during the lockdown between April and May 2020 in the Italian academic population. We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional online survey (IO CONTO 2020) within five Italian universities. Among about 240,000 individuals invited to participate through institutional communications, 18 120 filled the questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured by the self-administered Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The covariates collected included demographic and lifestyle characteristics, trust in government, doctors and scientists. Associations of covariates with influenza-like symptoms or positive COVID-19 test and with psychological distress were assessed by multiple regression models at the local level; a meta-analysis of the results was then performed. Severe levels of anxiety or depression were reported by 20% of the sample and were associated with being a student or having a lower income, irrespective of their health condition and worries about contracting the virus. The probability of being severely anxious or depressed also depended on physical activity: compared to those never exercising, the highest OR being for those who stopped during lockdown (1.53; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.84) and the lowest for those who continued (0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.95). Up to 21% of severe cases of anxiety or depression might have been avoided if during lockdown participants had continued to exercise as before. Socioeconomic insecurity contributes to increase mental problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the measures to contain it. Maintaining or introducing an adequate level of physical activity is likely to mitigate such detrimental effects. Promoting safe practice of physical activity should remain a public health priority to reduce health risks during the pandemic.","Fornili, Marco; Petri, Davide; Berrocal, Carmen; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Ricceri, Fulvio; Macciotta, Alessandra; Bruno, Andreina; Farinella, Domenica; Baccini, Michela; Severi, Gianluca; Baglietto, Laura",PLoS One,38,24

METHODS: An anonymized web-based questionnaire was used to assess demographics, CL history, and activity, CL wear habits and perceived risk of infection due to CL wear during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 737 participants with an average age of 27.4 (±9.3) years completed the online questionnaire. The vast majority of respondents were soft CL wearers and reported at least two years of CL wear. Patients concerns about the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to CL wear (40.6 % of participants) were significantly related (&#967;2(1)â¯=â¯11.195, pâ¯<â¯0.05) to CL discontinuation (46 % of participants) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This fact joins the significant changes in the frequency of CL wear during the COVID-19 pandemic (&#967;2(4)â¯=â¯31.982, pâ¯<â¯0.05), with a tendency to increase occasional CL wear from 29.1 % to 61.8 %. Interestingly, the majority of respondent (87.9 %) indicated that no professional had offered them information related to CL wear and COVID-19, and that they had not sought it on their own (82.2 %). CONCLUSION: There is a relationship between the perceived risk of infection and CL dropout during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a tendency to change the CL frequency of wear, with an increase in occasional CL wear. During the ongoing pandemic, eye care practitioners should reinforce CL patient education to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and CL-related complications requiring clinical care.","García-Ayuso, Diego; Escámez-Torrecilla, Miguel; Galindo-Romero, Caridad; Valiente-Soriano, Francisco J; Moya-Rodríguez, Esmeralda; Sobrado-Calvo, Paloma; Di Pierdomenico, Johnny",Cont. lens anterior eye,38,9

The hazard ratio (HR) for fractures after stroke was 1.26 (CI: 1.15-1.39) and for fractures after TIA, it was 1.14 (CI: 1.03-1.25). In female stroke patients, the HR for fractures was 1.32 (CI: 1.15-1.60), while in males, it was 1.20 (CI: 1.03-1.39). Among TIA patients, females had an elevated HR for fractures (HR: 1.21; CI: 1.06-1.37). In individuals aged &#8805; 80 years, an increased risk for fractures was only detected among TIA patients (HR: 1.26; CI: 1.05-1.51). Dementia and non-opioid analgesic therapy were positively associated with fracture after both stroke and TIA. CONCLUSION: Stroke was positively associated with fracture in patients < 80 years, while TIA was positively associated with fracture in patients &#8805; 80 years and females. Dementia and analgesic therapy were also associated with fracture after either stroke or TIA.","Tanislav, C; Kostev, K",Osteoporosis int,38,3

Due to the growing death toll and constant coverage this pandemic gets, it is likely to activate mortality awareness, to greater or lesser extents, depending on a variety of situational factors. Using terror management theory and the terror management health model, we outline reactions to the pandemic that consist of proximal defences aimed at reducing perceived vulnerability to (as well as denial of) the threat, and distal defences bound by ideological frameworks from which symbolic meaning can be derived. We provide predictions and recommendations for shifting reactions to this pandemic towards behaviours that decrease, rather than increase, the spread of the virus. We conclude by considering the benefits of shifting towards collective mindsets to more effectively combat COVID-19 and to better prepare for the next inevitable pandemic.","Courtney, Emily P; Goldenberg, Jamie L; Boyd, Patrick",Br J Soc Psychol,38,1

The problem with COVID-19 therapeutics is due to complexity of the mechanism of the pathogenesis of this virus. In this review, an extensive analysis of genome architecture and mode of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 with an emphasis on therapeutic approaches is performed. SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of a single, ~29.9 kb long RNA having significant sequence similarity to BAT-CoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genome. Two-third part of SARS-Cov-2 genome comprises of ORF (ORF1ab) resulting in the formation of 2 polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, later processed into 16 smaller non-structural proteins (NSPs). The four major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the spike surface glycoprotein (S), a small envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. S protein helps in receptor binding and membrane fusion and hence plays the most important role in the transmission of CoVs. Priming of S protein is done by serine 2 transmembrane protease and thus plays a key role in virus and host cell fusion. This review highlights the possible mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 to search for possible therapeutic options.","Shamsi, Anas; Mohammad, Taj; Anwar, Saleha; Amani, Samreen; Khan, Mohd Shahnawaz; Husain, Fohad Mabood; Rehman, Md Tabish; Islam, Asimul; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz",Int J Biol Macromol,38,16

This study examined teaching resources that would have been helpful when schools closed, and how school meal programs should be changed in the 2020-2021 school year. METHODS: In October 2020, a 27-item, cross-sectional, online survey was administered to 99 teachers and staff members in an urban, Midwestern school district. Data were analyzed using frequencies and proportions, and open-ended responses were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Online teaching was difficult for teachers and students, and training for online teaching, improved Internet access, and more time for grading or office hours would have been helpful when schools closed. Meal programs were offered by 86% of schools after closing, and many participants supported continuing meal programs for 2020-2021. Resources needed to continue meal programs included funding for meal reimbursement, transportation to the meal sites, and more staff. Suggested changes to meal programs included offering more variety or more food, and solving transportation issues. CONCLUSION: Addressing these concerns can improve school and community health. Findings will inform efforts to enhance online teaching and improve and continue school meal programs as the world continues to be affected by COVID-19.","Chrisman, Matthew S; Alnaim, Lubna",J. sch. health,38,28

The results from a 304-participant study suggest that the spoken back warning covers may not work as intended, even when converted from text to speech. We controlled for COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy and political leanings and found that the vaccination hesitant Alexa users ignored any type of warning as long as the Tweets align with their personal beliefs. The politically independent users trusted Alexa less then their politically-laden counterparts and that helped them accurately perceiving truthful COVID-19 information.

China, as the early epicenter of the pandemic, locked down one-third of its cities in an attempt to prevent the rapid spread of the virus. Human migration patterns have subsequently been radically altered and many regions have seen perceived improvements in air quality during the lockdowns. This study empirically examines the relationship between human migration and air pollution and further evaluates the causal impacts of the lockdowns. A spatial econometric method and a spatial explicit counterfactual framework are employed in this study. The key findings are as follows: i) a considerable amount of variation in AQI, PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 concentration can be explained by human migration but we fail to find suggestive evidence in the cases of SO2 and CO; ii) the implementation of lockdown measures led to a significant reduction in AQI (18.1%), PM2.5 (22.2%), NO2 (20.5%), and PM10 (10.7%), but has no meaningful impacts on SO2, CO and O3 levels; iii) further analysis indicates that the impacts of lockdown policies varied by control stringency and by regional heterogeneity.

Existing automatic and interactive segmentation models for medical images only use data from a single time point (static). However, valuable segmentation information from previous time points is often not used to aid the segmentation of a patient's follow-up scans. Also, fully automatic segmentation techniques frequently produce results that would need further editing for clinical use. In this work, we propose a new single network model for interactive segmentation that fully utilizes all available past information to refine the segmentation of follow-up scans. In the first segmentation round, our model takes 3D volumes of medical images from two-time points (target and reference) as concatenated slices with the additional reference time point segmentation as a guide to segment the target scan. In subsequent segmentation refinement rounds, user feedback in the form of scribbles that correct the segmentation and the target's previous segmentation results are additionally fed into the model. This ensures that the segmentation information from previous refinement rounds is retained. Experimental results on our in-house multiclass longitudinal COVID-19 dataset show that the proposed model outperforms its static version and can assist in localizing COVID-19 infections in patient's follow-up scans.","Foo, Michelle Xiao-Lin; Kim, Seong Tae; Paschali, Magdalini; Goli, Leili; Burian, Egon; Makowski, Marcus; Braren, Rickmer; Navab, Nassir; Wendler, Thomas",,38,1

Although pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19-associated myocardial injury have been studied throughout the pandemic course in 2019, its morphological characterisation is still unclear. With this study, we aimed to characterise echocardiographic patterns of ventricular function in patients with COVID-19-associated myocardial injury. METHODS: We prospectively assessed 32 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and presence or absence of elevated high sensitive troponin T (hsTNT+ vs. hsTNT-) by comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) and strain echocardiography. RESULTS: A minority (34.3%) of patients had normal ventricular function, whereas 65.7% had left and/or right ventricular dysfunction defined by impaired left and/or right ventricular ejection fraction and strain measurements. Concomitant biventricular dysfunction was common in hsTNT+ patients. We observed impaired left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) in patients with myocardial injury (-13.9% vs. -17.7% for hsTNT+ vs. hsTNT-, p = 0.005) but preserved LV ejection fraction (52% vs. 59%, p = 0.074). Further, in these patients, right ventricular (RV) systolic function was impaired with lower RV ejection fraction (40% vs. 49%, p = 0.001) and reduced RV free wall strain (-18.5% vs. -28.3%, p = 0.003). Myocardial dysfunction partially recovered in hsTNT + patients after 52 days of follow-up. In particular, LV-GLS and RV-FWS significantly improved from baseline to follow-up (LV-GLS: -13.9% to -16.5%, p = 0.013; RV-FWS: -18.5% to -22.3%, p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19-associated myocardial injury, comprehensive 3D and strain echocardiography revealed LV dysfunction by GLS and RV dysfunction, which partially resolved at 2-month follow-up.

Aerobic fitness and vertical jump were assessed before and after four periods in two different seasons: COVID-19 lockdown, competitive period before lockdown, competitive period and summer break of the 2016-2017 season. Linear mixed models were used to examine within-period changes and between-period differences in changes observed during COVID-19 lockdown and the three other periods. Within-period changes in aerobic fitness showed a significant improvement following COVID-19 lockdown (p<0.001) and a significant decline during summer break (p<0.001). Between-period differences were significant in the comparison of COVID-19 lockdown with both the competitive 2019-2020 season (p<0.01) and summer break (p<0.001). For the vertical jump, only the between-period comparison revealed significant differences as the changes associated with COVID-19 lockdown were worse than those of the two competitive periods, for both absolute (p<0.05; p<0.001) and relative peak power (p<0.01; p<0.001). Home-based training during lockdown was effective to improve aerobic fitness, although it did not allow players to maintain their competitive period's power levels.","Rampinini, Ermanno; Donghi, Federico; Martin, Marco; Bosio, Andrea; Riggio, Marco; Maffiuletti, Nicola A",Int. j. sports med,38,24

A major pathological characteristic for DM is the apoptosis of endothelial cells (ECs) induced by high glucose (HG), however, the function of circRNA in the ECs' phenotypes is still elusive. Here, this study identified an up-regulated circRNA (circVEGFC) in the HG-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Functionally, knockdown of circVEGFC alleviated the apoptosis and recovered the proliferation in HUVECs induced by HG administration. Mechanistically, circVEGFC functioned as the sponge of miR-338-3p, and miR-338-3p was found to target the 3'-Untranslated Regions (3'-UTR) of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1&#945;). HIF-1&#945;, a critical transcription factor in DM, could activate the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and promote its protein product. In conclusion, these findings reveal the promotion of circVEGFC/miR-338-3p/HIF-1&#945;/VEGFA axis in the HG-induced ECs' apoptosis, providing a potential treatment strategy for ECs' damage in DM.","Wei, Hua; Cao, Cong; Wei, Xiaojuan; Meng, Minglv; Wu, Biaoliang; Meng, Lianxin; Wei, Xi; Gu, Shixing; Li, Hongmian","Aging (Albany, N.Y.

Through an established academic-practice partnership, pre-licensure nursing students were able to fill this new Patient Services Aid role. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the students' experiences in this mutually beneficial innovative role. METHODS: Electronic surveys and qualitative focus groups were used to evaluate the students' experiences. RESULTS: A total of 34 students were employed at the health system as PSAs. Focus groups (n = 16) analysis showed that, while the role was not a substitute for academic clinical experiences, they did improve the students' confidence in the clinical setting and helped teach necessary non-technical skills. Students appreciated the ability to network with multiple disciplines while working as PSAs. CONCLUSIONS: This role was developed to assist with immediate COVID-19 needs; however, this model of using pre-licensure students in non-clinical roles can improve students' non-technical skills and confidence in the clinical setting. The success of the activity was due to the strong relationships between the School of Nursing and health system. Other schools of nursing could benefit from developing collaborative partnerships with local healthcare systems.","Howard, Valerie; Hartman, Ann Michelle; Allen, Deborah H; Reynolds, Staci S",Nurse Educ Today,38,1

Severe cases of COVID-19 can manifest inflammation in organs other than the lung, in tissues not known to support viral replication, and also in a hypercoagulable state. These observations have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can provoke a hyperimmune response in some cases that could lead to secondary organ damage. Methods: With evidence of elevated levels of interleuking-6 (IL-6) in patients with severe COVID-19, we conducted a small pilot off-label compassionate care study of the IL-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab patients with severe COVID-19. Results: Following a single infusion of tocilizumab in patients with severe manifested rapid declines in C-reactive protein (CRP), D-Dimer, and gradual rises in lymphocyte and platelet counts.

This Perspective explores some advantages and disadvantages of ""low-dosage"" challenge studies, in the setting of testing second-generation vaccines against COVID-19. Compared to a conventional vaccine challenge, a low-dosage vaccine challenge would be likelier to start, and start earlier. A low-dosage challenge would also be less likely to rule out a vaccine candidate which would have been potentially effective in target usage. A key ethical advantage of a low-dosage challenge over conventional challenge is that both it and its dose escalation process are safer for each participant. Low-dosage studies usually require larger numbers of participants than conventional challenges, but this and other potential disadvantages are less serious than they may initially appear. Overall, low-dosage challenges should be considered for certain roles, such as prioritizing between second-generation vaccines against COVID-19.","Steuwer, Bastian; Jamrozik, Euzebiusz; Eyal, Nir",Int. j. infect. dis,38,30

Rumors against management of public health emergencies,20.68415,1.3567224,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally. Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome. We have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. This epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human anti-SARS-CoV antibody CR3022. In this study, we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the model of the human &#945;7 nAChR. We found that all studied protein complexes' interface involves a large part of the ""toxin-like"" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human &#945;7 nAChR. Our findings provide further support to the hypothesis about the protective role of nicotine and other cholinergic agonists. The potential therapeutic role of CR3022 and other similar monoclonal antibodies with increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein against the clinical effects originating from the dysregulated cholinergic pathway should be further explored.","Lagoumintzis, George; Chasapis, Christos T; Alexandris, Nikolaos; Kouretas, Dimitrios; Tzartos, Socrates; Eliopoulos, Elias; Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Poulas, Konstantinos",Food Chem Toxicol,38,21

Previously published papers have demonstrated that increased levels of D-dimer at hospital admission correlate with a more severe disease (0.5 mg/L) or occurrence of death (1 mg/L). The potential prothrombotic action of the SARS-CoV-2 is supported by the topographical involvement of the lung regions with a predilection for the lower lobe with peripheral involvement. If this hypothesis is demonstrated, this could suggest the benefit of using antithrombotic/coagulation regimens for SARS-CoV-2 and, at the same time, the urgency to identify drugs that could alter the inflammatory storm, thus protecting the vessel wall.","Saba, Luca; Sverzellati, Nicola",J. thorac imaging,38,22

CT role was widely debated for its limited specificity. Here we report the diagnostic role of CT in two EDs in Lombardy, epicenter of Italian outbreak. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Admitting chest CT from 142 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. CT scans were classified in ""highly likely,"" ""likely,"" and ""unlikely"" COVID-19 pneumonia according to the presence of typical, indeterminate, and atypical findings, or ""negative"" in the absence of findings, or ""alternative diagnosis"" when a different diagnosis was found. Nasopharyngeal swab results, turnaround time, and time to positive results were collected. CT diagnostic performances were assessed considering RT-PCR as reference standard. RESULTS: Most of cases (96/142, 68%) were classified as ""highly likely"" COVID-19 pneumonia. Ten (7%) and seven (5%) patients were classified as ""likely"" and ""unlikely"" COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively. In 21 (15%) patients a differential diagnosis was provided, including typical pneumonia, pulmonary edema, neoplasia, and pulmonary embolism. CT was negative in 8/142 (6%) patients. Mean turnaround time for the first COVID-19 RT-PCR was 30 ± 13 h. CT diagnostic accuracy in respect of the first test swab was 79% and increased to 91.5% after repeated swabs and/or BAL, for 18 false-negative first swab. CT performance was good with 76% specificity, 99% sensitivity, 90% positive predictive value and 97% negative predictive value.

Existing surveillance systems are generally not based on population samples and are not longitudinal in design. METHODS: Samples were collected from individuals aged 2 years and older living in private households in England that were randomly selected from address lists and previous Office for National Statistics surveys in repeated cross-sectional household surveys with additional serial sampling and longitudinal follow-up. Participants completed a questionnaire and did nose and throat self-swabs. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time by use of dynamic multilevel regression and poststratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also assessed. The study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN21086382. FINDINGS: Between April 26 and Nov 1, 2020, results were available from 1â191â170 samples from 280â327 individuals; 5231 samples were positive overall, from 3923 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between April 26 and June 28, 2020, from 0·40% (95% credible interval 0·29-0·54) to 0·06% (0·04-0·07), followed by low levels during July and August, 2020, before substantial increases at the end of August, 2020, with percentages testing positive above 1% from the end of October, 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the first wave (April 26 to June 28, 2020), but not in the second wave (from the end of August to Nov 1, 2020). Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17-24 years) was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the second wave. For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than six times higher in those aged 17-24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at the end of September, 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45-68%, dependent on calendar time. INTERPRETATION: Important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the first wave that was captured by the study (April to June, 2020) and the first part of the second wave of increased positivity rates (end of August to Nov 1, 2020), and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards.

The aim of this study was to explore the public's knowledge of COVID-19, their willingness to undergo cosmetic surgery during the pandemic, and the factors influencing their decisions. Methods: An internet-based cross-sectional survey was conducted. We collected data on demographic information, knowledge about COVID-19, and willingness to undergo cosmetic procedures. Participants also completed the cosmetic procedure screening questionnaire to assess body dysmorphic disorder. Results: The sample included a total of 1643 participants (women, n = 1002; 61%). A total of 613 (37.3%) participants were aged between 30 and 40 years. The majority (n = 1472; 89.6%) referred to official government accounts for information regarding COVID-19. Most participants (n = 1451; 88.3%) felt that the pandemic was serious, and 1387 (85%) said they would not leave home to undergo cosmetic procedures during the outbreak. Being women, the presence of body-image concerns, and higher cosmetic procedure screening questionnaire scores were associated with an increased willingness to undergo cosmetic procedures. Conclusions: This is the first study to explore the public's willingness to undergo cosmetic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The public was well educated about the pandemic, via government actions. This was reflected in participants who wished to undergo a cosmetic plastic procedure; we identified factors associated with an increased willingness to undergo procedures, which may help design awareness initiatives.","Gelidan, Adnan G; Mrad, Mohamed A; Kattan, Abdullah E; Kattan, Wid E; AlEnazi, Thamer H; Bakraa, Reem M; Barry, Mazen A",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,38,16

We use four cough datasets, namely Cambridge, Coswara, Virufy, and NoCoCoDa to verify the proposed method. At first, our proposed method uses the audio features of cough samples and then applies machine learning (ML) techniques to classify them as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. Then, we consider a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that combines ensemble technologies (i.e., soft and hard) to select the best model. In MCDM, we use the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for ranking purposes, while entropy is applied to calculate evaluation criteria weights. In addition, we apply the feature reduction process through recursive feature elimination with cross-validation under different estimators. The results of our empirical evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models.","Chowdhury, Nihad Karim; Kabir, Muhammad Ashad; Rahman, Md. Muhtadir",,38,29

In response, China has taken a proactive step by issuing a legal decision to ban consumption of terrestrial wildlife. However, concerns have been raised and opponents of bans argue that well-regulated trade should be promoted instead. By analyzing China's legal framework and management system regulating wildlife trade, together with state and provincial-level wildlife-trade licenses and wildlife criminal cases, we argue that current wildlife trade regulations do not function as expected. This is due to outdated protected species lists, insufficient cross-sector collaboration, and weak restrictions and law enforcement on farming and trading of species. The lack of quarantine standards for wildlife and increased wildlife farming in recent years pose great risks for food safety and public health. In addition, wildlife consumption is neither required for subsistence nor an essential part of Chinese diets. All these facts make the ban necessary to provoke improvement in wildlife management, such as updating protected species lists, revising laws and changing consumption behaviors. Nonetheless, the ban is not sufficient to address all the problems. To sustain the efficacy of the change, we propose that a long-term mechanism to reduce the demand and improve effective management is needed.","Xiao, Lingyun; Lu, Zhi; Li, Xueyang; Zhao, Xiang; Li, Binbin V",Curr Biol,38,1

More rarely, COVID-19 can be complicated by hemodynamic failure due to fulminant myocarditis or massive pulmonary embolism necessitating the implantation of venous-arterial ECMO. The management of ECMO during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging due to some specificities related to the disease characteristics, such as the management of anticoagulation in patients with a hypercoagulable state and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. In large retrospective cohorts, survival of ECMO-rescued COVID-19 patients with ADRS was reported to be similar to that reported in previous studies on ECMO support for severe ARDS.

The uncertainties refer to interval and polytopic types, and the constraints are described in the form of 1-norm inequalities. A linear DMPC framework containing a linear performance index, linear robust stability conditions, a stochastic linear co-positive Lyapunov function, a cone invariant set, and a linear programming based DMPC algorithm is introduced. A global positive Markov jump system is decomposed into several subsystems. These subsystems can exchange information with each other and each subsystem has its own controller. Using a matrix decomposition technique, the DMPC controller gain matrix is divided into nonnegative and non-positive components and thus the corresponding stochastic stability conditions are transformed into linear programming. By virtue of a stochastic linear co-positive Lyapunov function, the positivity and stochastic stability of the systems are achieved under the DMPC controller. A lower computation burden DMPC algorithm is presented for solving the min-max optimization problem of performance index. The proposed DMPC design approach is extended for general systems. Finally, an example is given to verify the effectiveness of the DMPC design.","Zhang, Junfeng; Deng, Xuanjin; Zhang, Langwen; Liu, Laiyou",Journal of the Franklin Institute,38,30

As the most popular video-sharing platform globally, YouTube is a potent medium for the dissemination of key public health information. Understanding the nature of available content regarding COVID-19 vaccination on this widely used platform is of substantial public health interest. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the reliability and quality of information on COVID-19 vaccination in YouTube videos. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the phrases ""coronavirus vaccine"" and ""COVID-19 vaccine"" were searched on the UK version of YouTube on December 10, 2020. The 200 most viewed videos of each search were extracted and screened for relevance and English language. Video content and characteristics were extracted and independently rated against Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct and DISCERN quality criteria for consumer health information by 2 authors. RESULTS: Forty-eight videos, with a combined total view count of 30,100,561, were included in the analysis. Topics addressed comprised the following: vaccine science (n=18, 58%), vaccine trials (n=28, 58%), side effects (n=23, 48%), efficacy (n=17, 35%), and manufacturing (n=8, 17%). Ten (21%) videos encouraged continued public health measures. Only 2 (4.2%) videos made nonfactual claims. The content of 47 (98%) videos was scored to have low (n=27, 56%) or moderate (n=20, 42%) adherence to Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct principles. Median overall DISCERN score per channel type ranged from 40.3 (IQR 34.8-47.0) to 64.3 (IQR 58.5-66.3). Educational channels produced by both medical and nonmedical professionals achieved significantly higher DISCERN scores than those of other categories. The highest median DISCERN scores were achieved by educational videos produced by medical professionals (64.3, IQR 58.5-66.3) and the lowest median scores by independent users (18, IQR 18-20). CONCLUSIONS: The overall quality and reliability of information on COVID-19 vaccines on YouTube remains poor. Videos produced by educational channels, especially by medical professionals, were higher in quality and reliability than those produced by other sources, including health-related organizations. Collaboration between health-related organizations and established medical and educational YouTube content producers provides an opportunity for the dissemination of high-quality information on COVID-19 vaccination. Such collaboration holds potential as a rapidly implementable public health intervention aiming to engage a wide audience and increase public vaccination awareness and knowledge.","Chan, Calvin; Sounderajah, Viknesh; Daniels, Elisabeth; Acharya, Amish; Clarke, Jonathan; Yalamanchili, Seema; Normahani, Pasha; Markar, Sheraz; Ashrafian, Hutan; Darzi, Ara",JMIR Public Health Surveill,38,22

Here we report the available safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04368728) among 45 healthy adults (18-55 years of age), who were randomized to receive 2 doses-separated by 21 days-of 10 µg, 30 µg or 100 µg of BNT162b1. BNT162b1 is a lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the trimerized receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Local reactions and systemic events were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, and transient. A second vaccination with 100 µg was not administered because of the increased reactogenicity and a lack of meaningfully increased immunogenicity after a single dose compared with the 30-µg dose. RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titres in sera increased with dose level and after a second dose. Geometric mean neutralizing titres reached 1.9-4.6-fold that of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera, which were obtained at least 14 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. These results support further evaluation of this mRNA vaccine candidate.","Mulligan, Mark J; Lyke, Kirsten E; Kitchin, Nicholas; Absalon, Judith; Gurtman, Alejandra; Lockhart, Stephen; Neuzil, Kathleen; Raabe, Vanessa; Bailey, Ruth; Swanson, Kena A; Li, Ping; Koury, Kenneth; Kalina, Warren; Cooper, David; Fontes-Garfias, Camila; Shi, Pei-Yong; Türeci, Özlem; Tompkins, Kristin R; Walsh, Edward E; Frenck, Robert; Falsey, Ann R; Dormitzer, Philip R; Gruber, William C; Sahin, Ugur; Jansen, Kathrin U",Nature,38,24

Aim of the study was to evaluate the management of severe ARF due to COVID-19 pneumonia using noninvasive ventilatory support (NIVS), studying safety and effectiveness of NIVS. METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicenter study. Primary outcomes were NIVS failure with intubation rate and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital stay and factors related to NIVS failure and mortality. These outcomes were compared with patients intubated and admitted to ICU. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two patients were hospitalized because of severe respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 ratio <250). One hundred thirty-eight patients were admitted to Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit (RICU) for a NIVS trial. One hundred patients were treated successfully with NIVS (74.5%); 38 failed NIVS trial (27.5%). In-hospital mortality was 23.18% in RICU group and 30.55% in ICU group. Patients with NIVS failure were older, had a lower number of lymphocytes, a higher IL-6, lower PaO2, PaC O2, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, higher respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate at admission and lower PaO2, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio and higher RR after 1-6 hours.

Methods: In this retrospective study, we analyzed data on 141 fatal cases of confirmed COVID-19 that occurred among patients in Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 20 to March 6, 2020. We analyzed their epidemiological characteristics, clinical and radiological features, laboratory results, and treatment. Results: Of the 141 patients (49 females, 92 males), the median age was 77 years (range: 24-92 years). The most likely source of exposure included the Huanan seafood market (n=3, 2%), family members (n=6, 4%), and hospital-acquired infection (n=8, 6%). The remaining 116 patients (72%) had no known source of exposure. Of the patients, 101 (72%) had chronic diseases. The most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease. The most common clinical manifestations were fever (n=121, 85%), dry cough (n=77, 54%), shortness of breath (n=23, 16%), and chest pain (n=15, 10%). Less common clinical manifestations included fatigue (n=7, 4%), headache (n=3, 2%), disorders of consciousness (n=2, 1%), diarrhea (n=2, 1%) and lumbago (n=1, 0.7%). In terms of laboratory tests, the absolute value of lymphocytes in most patients was reduced (n=132, 94%), but C-reactive protein (n=141, 100%), procalcitonin(n=121, 89%), serum amyloid (n=140, 99%) were significantly increased. The most common findings on imaging of the lungs were bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity (n=101, 72%), mainly in the lower lobes (n=15, 10%), with lesions being more common on the right. Other imaging findings included diffuse consolidation (n=4, 3%), ground-glass opacity and consolidation (n=20, 14%), and pneumothorax (n=1, 0.7%). All patients were treated with antibiotics and antiviral drugs. Other treatments included immunoglobulin (n=49, 35%), corticosteroids (n=45, 32%), continuous renal replacement therapy (n=24, 17%), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n=12, 9%). All patients were treated with oxygen therapy. The mode of administration included invasive mechanical ventilation (n=61, 43%), noninvasive mechanical ventilation (n=65, 46%), and nasal catheter oxygen inhalation (n=15, 11%). The direct causes of death were acute respiratory distress syndrome (n=90, 64%), multiple organ failure (n=24, 17%), sudden cardiac arrest (n=11, 8%), viral myocarditis (n=8, 5%), acute myocardial infarction (n=4, 3%), cerebrovascular accident (n=3, 2%), and acute gastrointestinal bleeding (n=1, 0.7%). Conclusions: Risk factors for death due to COVID-19 included older age, male sex, and the presence of comorbidities. The most common direct causes of death were acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, sudden cardiac arrest, and viral myocarditis.","Xiao, Y J; Dong, X; Yang, H Z; Tan, H Y; Zhou, R L; Chen, Y; Shen, X B; Yan, M Y",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,38,3

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 213 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged or died by 15 March 2020. We retrospectively collected epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, computed tomography imaging and outcome data. Clinical characteristics were described and relative risk factors were compared. RESULTS: Most clinical characteristics of this study were similar to those from studies in Wuhan, but there were lower mortality rate and milder severity. The median time from onset of symptoms to confirmation and hospitalization was 4 and 5 days, respectively. The median virus clearance and shedding times were 10 and 15 days, respectively. When the severe/critical group was compared with the mild/moderate group, significant risk factors included: older age; dyspnea; hypertension; poor appetite; fatigue; higher white cell count, neutrophil count, prothrombin time, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein; and lower lymphocyte count and albumin (p < 0.05). In the intensive care unit (ICU) group compared with the non-ICU group, risk factors included: older age; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); dyspnea; poor appetite; higher white cell count, D-dimer, ALT, AST and LDH; and lower lymphocyte count and albumin (p < 0.05). Independent risk factors associated with the severe/critical group were dyspnea [odds ratio (OR) = 19.48], ALT (OR = 6.02) and albumin (OR = 3.36). Independent risk factors associated with the ICU group were dyspnea (OR = 8.88), COPD (OR = 31.80), D-dimer (OR = 8.37), ALT (OR = 28.76) and LDH (OR = 9.95) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The severity of COVID-19 outside Wuhan, China was milder than that within Wuhan. The clinical infective period was long, and the longest virus shedding time was 35 days. The most important risk factors were dyspnea, COPD, D-dimer, ALT, LDH and albumin.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Hu, Xingsheng; Hu, Chunhong; Yang, Yong; Chen, Juan; Zhong, Ping; Wen, Yajing; Chen, Xiangyu",Ther Adv Respir Dis,38,16

Infection by CoVs such as HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43 and -HKU1 leads to the common cold, short lasting rhinitis, cough, sore throat and fever. However, CoVs such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the newest SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) lead to severe and deadly diseases with mortality rates ranging between ~1 to 35% depending on factors such as age and pre-existing conditions. Despite continuous global health threats to humans, there are no approved vaccines or drugs targeting human CoVs, and the recent outbreak of COVID-19 emphasizes an urgent need for therapeutic interventions.

In order to help slow the spread of the virus and save hospital resources, nonessential businesses were forced to close and elective surgeries have been postponed. METHODS: As we reach the peak of the pandemic and the COVID-19 CC19 vaccine gets distributed, healthcare systems must develop plans to safely resume elective surgeries. This article outlines a single center academic medical center's perioperative COVID-19 protocol to help keep surgeons, operating room teams, and patients safe. RESULTS: While testing protocols can help minimize the transmission of the virus, there is still the potential for COVID+ patients to undergo surgery undetected, due to potential false negative tests and the long incubation period before seroconversion and symptom development. CONCLUSIONS: An effective institutional strategy not only includes clear perioperative testing protocols, but also education regarding clinical manifestations and exposure control.","Bonano, John C; Huddleston, James I",J. arthroplasty,38,24

Evidence from prior epidemics suggests increased alcohol consumption during quarantine and times of high stress are associated with a greater chance of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD). This study examines alcohol sales data to ascertain how individuals are interacting with alcohol during the pandemic.Materials and method: Monthly off premises alcohol sales data for select US alcoholic beverage control states were used to construct monthly sales patterns from 2015 to 2020. An independent samples t-test was used to determine if COVID-19 era alcohol sales were higher than those that occurred from 2015 to 2019.Results: Alcohol sales from March to August 2020 were significantly higher than sales from the same span of months from 2015 to 2019 (t=-2.47, p<.05). The associated monthly percentage increase in sales ranged from 14 to 44% with the overall trend indicating a move toward pre-pandemic sales totals.Conclusion: As COVID-19 continues to disrupt typical ways of being across the globe, the implications of increased sales of alcohol should not be overlooked. Taken together, the evidence on increased use during isolation and later AUD diagnosis coupled with the ABC state sales figures here, point to a potential increase in the development of AUD and an increase in alcohol-related harms.","Morton, Cory M",Subst Abus,38,10

The causative agent was identified as a coronavirus which was named MERS-CoV. Purpose: This study reviewed the published literature to investigate the incidence and mortality rate of MERS-CoV to identify the main threats and gaps and frame containment strategies. Methodology: MEDLINE and CINAHL electronic databases were searched using a pre-defined search strategy. Additional references from the bibliographies of retrieved articles were also reviewed and experts (respiratory disease consultants) involved in case management in the United Arab Emirates were contacted. Selection criteria were: original research articles on MERS-CoV incidence. The initial literature search identified 47 papers. Of these, 16 original articles met the selection criteria. All were type II evidence— population-based clinical MERS-CoV studies. Findings: Since 2012 cases have been reported in 14 countries, with most of the reporting from the Arabian Peninsula region. A total of 212 cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia up to April 2014, of which 88 died. The countries most affected by the disease are Saudi Arabia with 183 cases, of which 74 (40 %) died and the United Arab Emirates with 19 cases, of which 7 (37 %) died. So far, all the cases have been linked to six countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. No cases have been identified in the United States of America. The virus has spread from sick people to others through close contact. Conclusions: The disease is following a propagated epidemic curve and trending to more spreading and adding more and more cases. In time, increasing numbers of index cases will lead to a change in the epidemiological curve pattern to an explosive epidemic curve, which is considered threatening for coronavirus as the case fatality rate is extremely high and mortality rate can reach up to 50 %. Gap analysis studies are needed to determine why the virus is still circulating and propagating in spite of the advanced preventive and control measures applied so far. The main question that needs to be addressed is how to reach the sources of infection and to break the transmission chain. Keywords MERS-CoV; Incidence","Hussain, Hamid Y.",J. Infect.

DESIGN: Ecological study of publicly available data. Countries reporting >25 COVID-19 related deaths until 8 June 2020 were included. The outcome was log mean mortality rate from COVID-19, an estimate of the country-level daily increase in reported deaths during the ascending phase of the epidemic curve. Potential determinants assessed were most recently published demographic parameters (population and population density, percentage population living in urban areas, population >65 years, average body mass index and smoking prevalence); economic parameters (gross domestic product per capita); environmental parameters (pollution levels and mean temperature (January-May); comorbidities (prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cancer); health system parameters (WHO Health Index and hospital beds per 10 000 population); international arrivals; the stringency index, as a measure of country-level response to COVID-19; BCG vaccination coverage; UV radiation exposure; and testing capacity. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyse the data. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Country-level mean mortality rate: the mean slope of the COVID-19 mortality curve during its ascending phase. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven countries were included: Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the UK and the USA. RESULTS: Of all country-level determinants included in the multivariable model, total number of international arrivals (beta 0.033 (95% CI 0.012 to 0.054)) and BCG vaccination coverage (-0.018 (95% CI -0.034 to -0.002)), were significantly associated with the natural logarithm of the mean death rate. CONCLUSIONS: International travel was directly associated with the mortality slope and thus potentially the spread of COVID-19. Very early restrictions on international travel should be considered to control COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent related deaths.","Pana, Tiberiu A; Bhattacharya, Sohinee; Gamble, David T; Pasdar, Zahra; Szlachetka, Weronika A; Perdomo-Lampignano, Jesus A; Ewers, Kai D; McLernon, David J; Myint, Phyo K",BMJ Open,38,10

Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43. However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans. The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic. In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates. Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms. However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs. Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic. The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them. In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.","Zimmermann, Petra; Curtis, Nigel",Pediatr Infect Dis J,38,6

Patients, clinicians and hospital authorities have had to balance the risks to patients of attending hospital, many of whom are especially vulnerable, with the risks of delaying or modifying cancer treatment. Those whose care has been significantly impacted include patients suffering from the effects of cancer on bone, where delivering the usual standard of care for bone support has often not been possible and clinicians have been forced to seek alternative options for adequate management. At a virtual meeting of the Cancer and Bone Society in July 2020, an expert group shared experiences and solutions to this challenge, following which a questionnaire was sent internationally to the symposium’s participants, to explore the issues faced and solutions offered. 70 respondents, from 9 countries (majority USA, 39%, followed by UK, 19%) included 50 clinicians, spread across a diverse range of specialties (but with a high proportion, 64%, of medical oncologists) and 20 who classified themselves as non-clinical (solely lab-based). Spread of clinician specialty across tumour types was breast (65%), prostate (27%), followed by renal, myeloma and melanoma. Analysis showed that management of metastatic bone disease in all solid tumour types and myeloma, adjuvant bisphosphonate breast cancer therapy and cancer treatment induced bone loss, was substantially impacted. Respondents reported delays to routine CT scans (58%), standard bone scans (48%) and MRI scans (46%), though emergency scans were less affected. Delays in palliative radiotherapy for bone pain were reported by 31% of respondents with treatments often involving only a single dose without fractionation. Delays to, or cancellation of, prophylactic surgery for bone pain were reported by 35% of respondents. Access to treatments with intravenous bisphosphonates and subcutaneous denosumab was a major problem, mitigated by provision of drug administration at home or in a local clinic, reduced frequency of administration or switching to oral bisphosphonates taken at home. The questionnaire also revealed damaging delays or complete stopping of both clinical and laboratory research. In addition to an analysis of the questionnaire, this paper presents a rationale and recommendations for adaptation of the normal guidelines for protection of bone health during the pandemic.","Brown, J.E.; Wood, S.L.; Confavreux, C.; Abe, M.; Weilbaecher, K.; Hadji, P.; Johnson, R.W.; Rhoades, J.A.; Edwards, C.M.; Croucher, P.I.; Juarez, P.; El Badri, S.; Ariaspinilla, G.; D'Oronzo, S.; Guise, T.A.; Van Poznak, C.",J Bone Oncol,38,1

Although it is known that SARS-CoV-2’s own RNA evades nsp1’s host translation shutoff, the molecular mechanism underlying the evasion was poorly understood. We performed an extended ensemble molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the mechanism of the viral RNA evasion. Simulation results showed that the stem loop structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA 5’-untranslated region (SL1) is recognized by both nsp1’s globular region and intrinsically disordered region. The recognition presumably enables selective translation of viral RNAs. Cluster analysis of the binding mode and detailed analysis of the binding poses revealed several residues involved in the SL1 recognition mechanism. The simulation results imply that the nsp1 C-terminal helices are lifted from the 40S ribosome upon the binding of SL1 to nsp1, unblocking translation of the viral RNA.","Sakuraba, Shun; Qilin, Xie; Kasahara, Kota; Iwakiri, Junichi; Kono, Hidetoshi",bioRxiv,38,16

In this study, biogenic and biocompatible AgNPs using the agro-waste, non-edible Hibiscus sabdariffa stem were synthesized. Under optimized reaction conditions, synthesized green AgNPs were crystalline, face cubic centered, spherical with a diameter of around 17 nm and a surface charge of -20 mV. Their murine lethal dose 50 (LD50) was 4 folds higher than the chemical AgNPs. Furthermore, they were more murine hepato- and nephro-tolerated than chemical counterparts due to activation of Nrf-2 and HO-1 pathway. They exerted an apoptotic anti-ovarian cancer activity with IC50 value 6 times more than the normal cell line. Being functionalized with polydopamine and conjugated to either moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin, the conjugates exerted an augmented antibiofilm activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii biofilms that was significantly higher than antibiotic alone or functionalized AgNPs suggesting a synergistic activity.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected access to health care in Saudi Arabia, including mandatory vaccinations for young children. We aimed to assess the prevalence of intentionally delayed vaccinations in children aged ≤ 2 years during the COVID-19 pandemic curfew in Saudi Arabia, its relation to the caregivers' fear of infection, and identifying factors affecting the caregivers' decision. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a self-administered survey that targeted primary caregivers of children aged ≤ 2 years residing in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic curfew (March 4–July 6, 2020). Results: We received responses from 577 caregivers, of whom 90.8% were mothers. The prevalence of intentional vaccination delay was 37%. Upon adjusting the potential confounders, the odds of delaying scheduled childhood vaccination because of COVID-19 pandemic fears were greater among caregivers with higher levels of fear (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.11). Common reasons for delaying vaccinations were COVID-19 infection and prevention of exposure to COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: Intentional vaccination delay leaves young children vulnerable to preventable infectious diseases. Identifying these children and offering catch-up vaccinations reduces this risk. Campaigns to increase awareness about the dangers of delaying vaccine-preventable diseases must be promoted to caregivers in addition to the promotion of home vaccination services. In preparation for future pandemics, we recommend countries consider interventions to control the level of fear and anxiety provoked by the pandemics and media, and interventions for improved access to vaccinations.","Baghdadi, Leena R.; Younis, Afnan; Al Suwaidan, Hessah I.; Hassounah, Marwah M.; Al Khalifah, Reem",Front Pediatr,38,8

Phenotyping of these specific HLA-E-restricted T cells requires new tools such as tetramers for rapid cell staining or sorting, as well as for the identification of new peptides capable to bind to the HLA-E pocket. To this aim, we have developed an optimal photosensitive peptide to generate stable HLA-E/pUV complexes allowing high-throughput production of new HLA-E/peptide complexes by peptide exchange. We characterized the UV exchange by ELISA and improved the peptide exchange readout using size exclusion chromatography. This novel approach for complex quantification is indeed very important to perform tetramerization of MHC/peptide complexes with the high quality required for detection of specific T cells. Our approach allows the rapid screening of peptides capable of binding to the non-classical human HLA-E allele, paving the way for the development of new therapeutic approaches based on the detection of HLA-E-restricted T cells.","Vaurs, Juliette; Douchin, Gaël; Echasserieau, Klara; Oger, Romain; Jouand, Nicolas; Fortun, Agnès; Hesnard, Leslie; Croyal, Mikaël; Pecorari, Frédéric; Gervois, Nadine; Bernardeau, Karine",Sci Rep,38,16

We conducted a single-center survey to investigate the psychological status and perceived social support among operation room (OR) medical staffs during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A total of 197 OR medical staffs were enrolled in the survey. The authors performed a cohort study during the period of Wuhan lockdown and then conducted a longitudinal follow-up after lifting of lockdown. The Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess for depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety. The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) was used to assess perceived social support. We compared the psychological status of OR medical staffs before and after lifting of Wuhan lockdown. Results: During the period of city lockdown, 177 (89.8%) had close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in OR medical staffs was 41.6 and 43.1% under Wuhan lockdown, while 13.2 and 15.7% after lifting of lockdown (P = 0.002, P = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female, living in suburb areas, shortage of protective equipment and close contact with COVID-19 patients were associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety. Perceived social support was negatively correlated with depression and anxiety severity in the OR medical staffs (P < 0.05). Conclusions: OR medical staffs exhibited high incidence of anxiety and depression faced with the high risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients. More social support and social recognition for anesthesiologists and OR nurses might potentially help them relieve their psychological pressure.","Li, Xin-yi; Wang, Jin; Zhang, Rui-xian; Chen, Luhua; He, Colin K.; Wang, Cheng-yao; Ke, Jian-juan; Wang, Yan-lin; Zhang, Zong-ze; Song, Xue-min",Front Psychiatry,38,24

METHODS: A cross‐sectional survey of 622 youth aged 14 to 28 was conducted. Analyses were conducted to understand the changes in mental and physical health among youth in four groups: (a) participants with a friend or family member diagnosed with COVID‐19, (b) participants with symptoms associated with COVID‐19, (c) participants with atopic conditions (asthma and allergies), and (d) participants with other preexisting physical health conditions. RESULTS: Many participants with physical health concerns met screening criteria for an internalizing disorder, which was significantly higher than the rate found among participants without physical health conditions. Significantly greater declines in self‐reported mental health were observed during the COVID‐19 period compared to 3 months earlier among youth reporting physical health concerns compared to those without physical health concerns. Substance use does not appear to have been affected. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health concerns are highly prevalent among youth with physical health concerns, and also appear to be exacerbated by the COVID‐19 pandemic. Physical health concerns appear to constitute risk factors for heightened mental health responses to the pandemic situation. System planners striving to adapt mental health services to meet social/physical distancing recommendations are urged to consider youth with physical health conditions and ensure that adequate integrated mental health and physical health supports are available to them.","Hawke, Lisa D.; Monga, Suneeta; Korczak, Daphne; Hayes, Em; Relihan, Jacqueline; Darnay, Karleigh; Cleverley, Kristin; Lunsky, Yona; Szatmari, Peter; Henderson, Joanna",Early Interv Psychiatry,38,1

METHODS: Two hundred thirty-nine patients with epilepsy (53% female, 35% seizure-free, 97% on antiseizure medication) answered a structured audit on telemedical counseling as part of individual outpatients' care. RESULTS: Overall 82% of the participants were satisfied with the telemedical appointment. The telemedical appointment was rated equal to onsite appointments in means of time (91%), comprehensibility (94%), and opportunity to get answers to current questions (92%). It was evaluated as good as onsite appointments regarding comprehension of the disease (88%) and impact on following the physician's advice (82%). The participants considered immediate convenience and shortfall of travel expenses as advantages of telemedicine, whereas lack of personal contact and diagnostics (electroencephalogram [EEG] recordings, blood analysis) were seen as disadvantages. About 73% of the participants would appreciate the opportunity of future telemedical counseling, but the majority (75%) wished to have further appointments onsite. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, people with epilepsy appear to be satisfied with telemedical counseling. However, patients greatly appreciate the medical services onsite and consider telemedicine as an add-on service rather than a substitute to visits onsite.","von Wrede, Randi; Moskau-Hartmann, Susanna; Baumgartner, Tobias; Helmstaedter, Christoph; Surges, Rainer",Epilepsy Behav,38,8

However, there is a lack of research that focuses on these problems. The Nepal NHI program initiated in 2016 has experienced numerous implementation challenges. This qualitative study delves into the NHI program's inputs and throughputs/implementation bottlenecks. The study based in Nepal's four districts included 28 in-depth interviews, six focus group discussions, and identified 12 themes that pointed to the NHI program's inadequate inputs causing bottlenecks. The analysis employed the Grounded Theory. The main challenges identified were insufficiently defined NHI implementations guidelines, conflicting Act clauses, a lack of HIB organizational guidelines, and inadequate human resources. The major throughput bottlenecks were difficulty enrolling the insurees, the inability to select the health providers competitively and to act as a prudent purchaser of the services. These inadequate inputs and throughput bottlenecks led to negative outputs such as insurees' high dropouts, and low coverage of poor households. The NHI program's sustainability might be at stake if the identified problems persist, further exacerbated by the plummeting economic situation in the country due to COVID-19.","Gurung, Gaj Bahadur; Panza, Alessio",The International journal of health planning and management,38,16

Methods: In 3 553 407 residents of Norway on January 1st 2020 aged 20-70 (with mean [SD] age 44.1 [14.3] years and 51% men), we studied whether persons in occupations in touch with pupils/students/patients/customers (using Standard Classification of Occupations [ISCO-08 codes]) had a higher risk of 1) COVID-19 and 2) hospitalization with COVID-19, compared to everyone aged 20-70 years using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and birth country. Results: Nurses, physicians, dentists, physiotherapists, bus/tram and taxi drivers had 1.5-3.5 times the odds of COVID-19 during the 1st wave of infection when compared to everyone in their working age. In the 2nd wave of the epidemic, bartenders, waiters, food service counter attendants, taxi drivers and travel stewards had 1.5-4 times the odds of COVID-19 when compared to everyone in their working age. Teachers had no or only a moderately increased odds of COVID-19. Occupation may be of limited relevance for the odds of severe COVID-19, here studied as hospitalization with the disease. Conclusion: Studying the entire Norwegian population using international standardized codes of occupations, our findings may be of relevance to national and regional authorities in handling the epidemic.

The main issues in the sustainability of hand hygiene automatic monitoring are healthcare worker (HCW) turnover rates and declining participation. In this study we had the opportunity to observe hand hygiene compliance over three years, with the intervention of a real-time reminder system. We aimed to assess hand hygiene compliance and the impact of real-time reminders. METHODS We observed HCWs and room compliance with using alcohol-based hand rubs (AHR) on room entry and exit. Linear multilevel mixed models with time autocorrelations were performed to analyse the repeated measurements of daily room compliance and the effect of reminders over eight quarters (24 months). RESULTS 111 HCWs were observed and 525,576 activities were identified in the database. We observed an improvement in compliance both on room entry and exit over two years, and the rooms which had activated reminders had better performance than the rooms which did not have activated reminders. CONCLUSIONS This study showed the benefit of using real-time reminders. In this study even 20% of rooms with an activated reminder improved overall hand hygiene compliance. A randomized real-time reminder setting may be a potential solution in reducing user fatigue and enhancing HCW self-awareness.","Huang, Fanyu; Boudjema, Sophia; Brouqui, Philippe",The Journal of hospital infection,38,17

The goal of this study was to assess the diagnostic values of different methods of detecting and estimating the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and the auxiliary diagnostic potential of antibody assays. By retrospectively analyzing the data of viral RNAs and serum IgM‐IgG antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2 from 38 cases with confirmed COVID‐19 in the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, we found that, in the early phase of the illness, the viral RNA was most abundant in the sputum specimens, followed by that in the throat swabs, while the antibody assays identified fewer positive cases at this stage. However, the sensitivity of the antibody assays overtook that of RNA test from eighth day of disease onset. Simultaneous use of antibody assay and RT‐qPCR improved the sensitivity of the diagnoses. Moreover, we found that most of these cases with no detectable viral RNA load during the early stages were able to be seropositive after 7 days. Our findings indicate that the antibody detection could be used as an effective supplementary indicator of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in suspected cases with no detectable viral RNA, and in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in confirming the infection.

Short-form tests like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) use a “sampling” of measures, administering key items in a shortened format to efficiently assess cognition while reducing time requirements, participant burden, and administrative costs. We compared the MoCA to a commonly used long-form cognitive battery in predicting AD symptom onset and sensitivity to AD neuroimaging biomarkers. METHODS: Survival, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and multiple regression analyses compared the MoCA and long-form measures in predicting time to symptom onset in cognitively normal older adults (n = 6230) from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) cohort who had, on average, 2.3 ± 1.2 annual assessments. Multiple regression models in a separate sample (n = 416) from the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) compared the sensitivity of the MoCA and long-form measures to neuroimaging biomarkers including amyloid PET, tau PET, and cortical thickness. RESULTS: Hazard ratios suggested that both the MoCA and the long-form measures are similarly and modestly efficacious in predicting symptomatic conversion, although model comparison analyses indicated that the long-form measures slightly outperformed the MoCA (HRs > 1.57). AUC analyses indicated no difference between the measures in predicting conversion (DeLong’s test, Z = 1.48, p = 0.13). Sensitivity to AD neuroimaging biomarkers was similar for the two measures though there were only modest associations with tau PET (rs = − 0.13, ps < 0.02) and cortical thickness in cognitively normal participants (rs = 0.15–0.16, ps < 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Both test formats showed weak associations with symptom onset, AUC analyses indicated low diagnostic accuracy, and biomarker correlations were modest in cognitively normal participants. Alternative assessment approaches are needed to improve how clinicians and researchers monitor cognitive changes and disease progression prior to symptom onset.","Hassenstab, Jason; Nicosia, Jessica; LaRose, Megan; Aschenbrenner, Andrew J.; Gordon, Brian A.; Benzinger, Tammie L.

Landsteiner ABO blood groups have been linked to host susceptibility to various infections through the interaction of the carbohydrate moieties defining ABO antigens with micro-organisms and the immune system. Previous studies of the original SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) demonstrated a decreased susceptibility to infection in group O individuals (Cheng et al. JAMA 2005; 293:1450-1) and the ability of plasma-derived anti-A antibodies to block the interaction between viral spike protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in vitro (Guillon et al. Glycobiology 2008; 18:1085-93). A recent genome-wide association study of patients with respiratory failure complicating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suggested a higher risk of severe disease in group A, and a protective effect in group O (Ellinghaus et al. NEJM 2020 DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa2020283). Since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic, a broad testing strategy was implemented in Kuwait and all individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were admitted to a single facility, including asymptomatic individuals. Here we examined the clinical outcomes of this cohort with respect to ABO blood group and compared its blood group distribution to that of the general population. Methods: All patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction assay of a nasopharyngeal swab specimen that were admitted to Jaber Hospital between February 24th to May 27th 2020 were included in the study. Relevant demographic and clinical data were extracted from hospital records. An anonymized summary of the distribution of blood types of the entire population of Kuwait was obtained from a national database and used as a control group. Clinical outcomes were in accordance with international consensus definitions. Appropriate statistical tests were used for bivariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine relationships between variables of interest and outcome. Results: Of 3305 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients 37.1%, 25.5%, 28.9% and 8.5% were group O, A, B and AB respectively. 69.2% were male and 30.8% were female. Median age was 42 years. 48.1% were Kuwaiti citizens and 51.9% were non-Kuwaiti. Commonest comorbidities were hypertension (21.5%) and diabetes (20.1%). 17.4% were obese. 37.2% were asymptomatic on admission. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics among the blood groups. Univariate analysis of clinical outcomes revealed no significant differences in need for oxygen support, admission to intensive care, intubation or death among the blood groups. However, rates of any adverse event and pneumonia differed significantly (Table 1). Multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, obesity and comorbidities showed that group A had higher odds of developing pneumonia compared to the other blood groups combined (adjusted odds ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.72, p<0.0363). We found no relationship between pneumonia and other blood groups. Compared to the general population, the COVID-19 cohort had a lower frequency of group O, equivalent frequency of group A and higher frequency of groups B and AB (Table 2). This trend was independent of nationality (Kuwaiti versus non-Kuwaiti). Incorporation of Rh (D) status did not impact the trend observed with ABO blood groups. Finally, no significant difference in Rh (D) status was found between the COVID-19 and general populations (Rh positive 93.4% versus 93.6% respectively, p=0.99) Conclusion: In a large, unselected patient population, no association between blood group and severe clinical outcomes in COVID-19 was found. Consistent with reports in other populations, we found a lower prevalence of blood group O in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals and higher prevalence of blood group B and AB implicating a potential role of ABO blood group in susceptibility to infection. No association between SARS-CoV-2 infection with blood group A or Rh (D) group was found. Further examination of the mechanistic link between ABO antigens, antibodies and SARS-CoV-2, and its implications on controlling the current pandemic is warranted.

There have been multiple reports of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases following SARS-CoV-2 infections. There are several suggested mechanisms involved in the development of autoimmune diseases, including cross-reactivity (molecular mimicry). A typical workflow for discovering cross-reactive epitopes (mimotopes) starts with a sequence similarity search between protein sequences of human and a pathogen. However, sequence similarity information alone is not enough to predict cross-reactivity between proteins since proteins can share highly similar conformational epitopes whose amino acid residues are situated far apart in the linear protein sequences. Therefore, we used a hidden Markov model-based tool to identify distant viral homologs of human proteins. Also, we utilized experimentally determined and modeled protein structures of SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins to find homologous protein structures between them. Next, we predicted binding affinity (IC50) of potentially cross-reactive T-cell epitopes to 34 MHC allelic variants that have been associated with autoimmune diseases using multiple prediction algorithms. Overall, from 8,138 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we identified 3,238 potentially cross-reactive B-cell epitopes covering six human proteins and 1,224 potentially cross-reactive T-cell epitopes covering 285 human proteins. To visualize the predicted cross-reactive T-cell and B-cell epitopes, we developed a web-based application “Molecular Mimicry Map (3M) of SARS-CoV-2” (available at https://ahs2202.github.io/3M/). The web application enables researchers to explore potential cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 epitopes alongside custom peptide vaccines, allowing researchers to identify potentially suboptimal peptide vaccine candidates or less ideal part of a whole virus vaccine to design a safer vaccine for people with genetic and environmental predispositions to autoimmune diseases. Together, the computational resources and the interactive web application provide a foundation for the investigation of molecular mimicry in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease following COVID-19.","An, Hyunsu; Park, Jihwan",bioRxiv,38,3

This people group is especially vulnerable partly because of behavioural habits, but the built environment they live in also plays a significant role. These dormitories are typically densely populated, so the living conditions are cramped. The short lease given to most dormitories also means the design does not typically focus on environmental performance, like good natural ventilation. This paper seeks to understand how these dormitories' design affects natural ventilation and, subsequently, the spread of the COVID-19 particles by looking at two existing worker dorms in Singapore. Findings show that some rooms are poorly orientated against the prevailing wind directions, so there is dominant stagnant air in these rooms, leading to respiratory droplets' long residence times. These particles can hover in the air for 10 min and more. Interventions like increased bed distance and removing upper deck beds only showed limited ventilation improvements in some rooms. Comparatively, internal wind scoops' strategic placement was more effective at directing wind towards more stagnant zones. Large canyon aspect ratios were also effective at removing particles from higher elevations.","Zheng, Kai; Ortner, Peter; Lim, Yu Wen; Zhi, Tay Jing",Sustain Cities Soc,38,6

RESULTS: A total of 11 out of 137 (8%) episodes of acute gastroenteritis were associated with HPeV genomic detection with median viral load 14678 ± 28927 genomes/mg fecal specimens. There was no significant difference in the detection rate between male and female (54.5% (6/11) vs. 45.5% (5/11). Among the 11 HPeV-positive cases, 2 were also positive for other viral pathogens, including rotavirus (n = 2). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the development of a laboratory designed Real Time PCR TaqMan assay for quantitative detection of HPeV and the optimization and standardization of this assay using stool of children with acute gastroenteritis are described.","Bergallo, Massimiliano; Galliano, Ilaria; Montanari, Paola; Rosa Brusin, Martina; Gabiano, Clara",J Clin Virol,38,5

The causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV). Codon usage of viral genes are believed to be subjected to different selection pressures in different host environments. Previous studies on codon usage of influenza A viruses helped identify viral host origins and evolution trends, however, similar studies on coronaviruses are lacking. In this study, we compared the codon usage bias using global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group CA and between-group CA. We found that the bat RaTG13 virus best matched the overall codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 in orf1ab, spike and nucleocapsid genes, while the pangolin P1E virus had a more similar codon usage in membrane gene. The amino acid usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was generally found similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs. However, we found greater synonymous codon usage differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and membrane genes, suggesting these two genes of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to different evolutionary pressures.","Gu, Haogao; Chu, Daniel K W; Peiris, Malik; Poon, Leo L M",Virus Evol,38,30

We explored the role of PIU in terms of primary and middle school teachers’ fear of COVID-19 and psychological need thwarting (PNT) of online teaching. We empirically evaluated the relationships among these research variables in explaining teachers’ psychological distress during COVID-19. Online survey data were collected from 9030 teachers. A high proportion of participants demonstrated psychological distress: depression (20.4%), anxiety (26.4%), and stress (10.2%). Structural equation modeling was used to test our proposed conceptual model, wherein PIU behaviors served as predictors, mediated by fear of COVID-19 and PNT of online teaching, for teachers’ psychological distress. With ideal model fit, the results of the path coefficients indicated that PIU behaviors were associated with fear of COVID-19 (p < 0.001); fear of COVID-19 and PNT of online teaching were associated with psychological distress (p < 0.001); and fear of COVID-19 was also positively associated with PNT of online teaching (p < 0.001). PSU and PSMU had an indirect positive effect on psychological distress through the mediator of fear of COVID-19 and PNT of online teaching. As such, we suggest that school administrators pay greater attention to teachers’ psychological needs through efforts to enhance teachers’ autonomy and relatedness from interpersonal relationships, alleviating PNT of online teaching. Our PNT of online teaching scale may also serve as a contribution for further research and practice.","Yi, Jian; Chen, I-Hua; Lin, Chung-Ying; Li, Cheng-Chieh; Liao, Xiao-Ling; Wei, Zhi-Hui; Gamble, Jeffrey Hugh",Healthcare (Basel),38,1

Starting in March, some patients who called 911 and required advanced life support (ALS) may have decompensated more rapidly than would have been expected, possibly because of concomitant COVID19 infection and/or delays in seeking medical care because of fear of exposure to the virus, and social isolation. In this study, our goal was to determine if there was an increase in prehospital ALS pronouncements and a decrease in ED visits for potentially serious conditions such as MI and stroke during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern NJ. METHODS STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of prehospital patients pronounced dead by paramedics and patients with MI and stroke in the EDs of receiving hospitals of these paramedics. Study Setting and Population: Ten ground ALS units in northern NJ and nine receiving hospital EDs. Each ALS unit is staffed by two NJ-certified mobile intensive care paramedics and respond with a paramedic flycar in a two-tiered dispatch system. Data Analysis: We identified prehospital pronouncements using the EMSCharts electronic record (Zoll Medical, Chelmsford, Massachusetts). We tabulated the number of pronouncements by week from January 1 to June 30 in 2019 and 2020. We tabulated the combined total number of pronouncements and ED visits by month along with visits for MI and stroke and calculated the changes during the same timeframe. We used Chi-square to test for statistical significance for the monthly changes from 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: For January through June in 2019 and 2020, there were 12,210 and 13,200 ALS dispatches, and 366 and 555 prehospital pronouncements, respectively. In 2020, pronouncements rose from a weekly baseline of 13 in early March, reached a peak of 45 at the beginning of April, then returned to the baseline level by the end of May. April 2020, the month with the most pronouncements, had 183% more pronouncements than April 2019 but total ED visits and visits for MI and stroke were 49%, 46% and 42% less, respectively (p < 0.0001 for each of these changes). CONCLUSION: Following the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern NJ, we found pre-hospital ALS death pronouncements increased and ED visits for MI and stroke decreased. Although we have speculated about the reasons for these findings, further studies are needed to determine what the actual causes were.","Jain, Nikhil; Berkenbush, Michael; Feldman, David C.; Eskin, Barnet; Allegra, John R.",Am J Emerg Med,38,20

However, both systemic spread and systemic inflammatory responses are thought to contribute to the systemic pathogenesis. In this study, we determined the temporal kinetics of viral RNA in serum (RNAemia) and the associated inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the course of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. We show that RNAemia can be detected in 90% of the patients who develop critical disease, compared to 50% of the patients who develop moderate or severe disease. Furthermore, RNAemia lasts longer in patients who develop critical disease. Elevated levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and MCP-1—but not IL-6—are associated with viral load in serum, whereas higher levels of IL-6 in serum were associated with the development of critical disease. In conclusion, RNAemia is common in hospitalized patients, with the highest frequency and duration in patients who develop critical disease. The fact that several cytokines or chemokines are directly associated with the presence of viral RNA in the circulation suggests that the development of RNAemia is an important factor in the systemic pathogenesis of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Severe COVID-19 can be considered a systemic disease as many extrarespiratory complications occur. However, the systemic pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that the presence of viral RNA in the blood (RNAemia) occurs more frequently in patients who develop critical disease, compared to patients with moderate or severe disease. In addition, RNAemia is associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, like MCP-1 and IL-10, in serum during the course of disease. This suggests that extrarespiratory spread of SARS-CoV-2 contributes to systemic inflammatory responses, which are an important factor in the systemic pathogenesis of COVID-19.","van Riel, Debby; Embregts, Carmen W.

Understanding what proportion of these patients require testing and who can be safely screened in community‐based models of care is critical for workforce and infrastructure planning across the healthcare system, as well as public messaging campaigns. METHODS: In this cross‐sectional survey, we screened patients presenting to a SARS‐CoV‐2 screening clinic in a tertiary ED. We assessed the proportion of patients who met testing criteria; self‐reported symptom severity; reasons why they came to the ED for screening; and views on community‐based care. RESULTS: We include findings from 1846 patients. Most patients (55.3%) did not meet contemporaneous criteria for testing and most (57.6%) had mild or no (13.4%) symptoms. The main reason for coming to the ED was being referred by a telephone health service (31.3%) and 136 (7.4%) said they tried to contact their GP but could not get an appointment. Only 47 (2.6%) said they thought the disease was too specialized for their GP to manage. CONCLUSIONS: While capacity building in acute care facilities is an important part of pandemic planning, it is also important that patients not needing hospital level of care can be assessed and treated elsewhere. We have identified a significant proportion of people at this early stage in the pandemic who have sought health care at hospital but who might have been assisted in the community had services been available and public health messaging structured to guide them there.","Rojek, Amanda; Dutch, Martin; Peyton, Daniel; Pelly, Rachel; Putland, Mark; Hiscock, Harriet; Knott, Jonathan",Emerg Med Australas,38,1

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 677 patients. Two nasopharyngeal swabs and 1 oropharyngeal swab were collected from patients. The RDT was performed onsite by a commercially available immune-chromatographic assay on the nasopharyngeal swab. The nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were examined for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RDT was 34.5% and the specificity was 99.8%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the test were 96.6% and 91.5%, respectively. The detection rate of RDT in RT-qPCR positive results was high (45%) for cycle threshold values <25. CONCLUSION: The utility of RDT is in diagnosing symptomatic patients and may not be particularly suited as a screening tool for patients with low viral load. The low sensitivity of RDT does not qualify its use as a single test in patients who test negative; RT-qPCR continues to be the gold standard test.","Thakur, Preeti; Saxena, Sonal; Manchanda, Vikas; Rana, Neha; Goel, Ruchi; Arora, Ritu",Lab Med,38,16

Using a masked selection approach, we identified VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes and further assembled these into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These VH constructs showed increased affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 4.0 nM (180 ng/mL).

The CCMDD programme aims at improving patient retention and adherence through better access to medicines, resulting in better health outcomes. AIM: We assessed whether patients with T2DM enrolled in CCMDD achieved the recommended targets for glycaemic, blood pressure (BP) and lipid control. SETTING: City of Tshwane, South Africa. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 198 T2DM patients enrolled in CCMDD and assessed their control of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), BP and lipids. RESULTS: Most of the records reviewed belonged to women (64.7%), African (89.9%), hypertensive (82.7%) and to patients exclusively on oral antidiabetic agents (98.5%). Patients were, on average, 57.7 (s.d. = 12.1) years old and had participated in the CCMDD programme for, on average, 2 years. The mean HbA1c was 8% (s.d. = 2).

This study investigated neutralisation titres against SARS-CoV-2 up to 6 months post-symptom onset in individuals with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Plasma neutralisation titres in convalescent COVID-19 individuals were determined at baseline and 6 months post-symptom onset using a cell culture infectious SARS-CoV-2 assay. Total SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG and IgA binding was measured using a lectin capture ELISA and compared between timepoints and correlated to neutralising titres. FINDINGS: All 48 convalescent COVID-19 individuals were found to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 50% inhibitory dilution neutralisation titres (ID(50)) at baseline and 6 months post-symptom onset with mean ID(50) of 1/943 and 1/411, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation titres peaked within 1-2 months post-symptom onset. However, 50% of individuals showed comparable ID(50) at baseline and 6 months post-symptom onset. Both SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG and IgA levels correlated well with neutralising titres. IgG binding was found to be sustained up to 6 months post-symptom onset, whereas IgA levels declined. INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates durability of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG and neutralisation responses following recovery from mild COVID-19. Thus, all subjects included in this study might potentially have protective levels of neutralising antibodies 6 months post-symptom onset. This study also demonstrates a relationship between spike-specific IgA and neutralisation decline, with implications for long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The COVID-19 has prompted an urgent search for effective interventions, and there is little information about the money value of treatments. The present study aimed to summarize economic evaluation evidence of preventing strategies, programs, and treatments of COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and specialized databases of economic evaluation from December 2019 to July 2020 to identify relevant literature to economic evaluation of programs against COVID-19. Two researchers screened titles and abstracts, extracted data from full-text articles, and did their quality assessment by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Then, quality synthesis of results was done. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies of economic evaluations met our inclusion criteria. The CHEERS scores for most studies (n=9) were 85 or higher (excellent quality). Eight studies scored 70 to 85 (good quality), eight studies scored 55 to 70 (average quality), and one study < %55 (poor quality). The decision-analytic modeling was applied to twenty-three studies (88%) to evaluate their services. Most studies utilized the SIR model for outcomes. In studies with long-time horizons, social distancing was more cost-effective than quarantine, non-intervention, and herd immunity. Personal protective equipment was more cost-effective in the short-term than non-intervention. Screening tests were cost-effective in all studies. CONCLUSION: The results suggested screening tests and social distancing to be cost-effective alternatives in preventing and controlling COVID-19 on a long-time horizon. However, evidence is still insufficient and too heterogeneous to allow any definite conclusions regarding costs of interventions.

There is evidence that older age and several comorbidities can affect the risk to develop severe pneumonia and possibly the need of mechanic ventilation in subjects infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as X‐linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). METHODS: When the SARS‐CoV‐2 epidemic has reached Italy, we have activated a surveillance protocol of patients with IEI, to perform SARS‐CoV‐2 search by nasopharyngeal swab in patients presenting with symptoms that could be a manifestation of COVID‐19, such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or vomiting. RESULTS: We describe two patients with X‐linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) aged 34 and 26 years with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID‐19, as diagnosed by SARS‐CoV‐2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions. Both patients developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by fever, cough, and anorexia and associated with elevation of CRP and ferritin, but have never required oxygen ventilation or intensive care. CONCLUSION: Our report suggests that XLA patients might present with high risk to develop pneumonia after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, but can recover from infection, suggesting that B‐cell response might be important, but is not strictly required to overcome the disease. However, there is a need for larger observational studies to extend these conclusions to other patients with similar genetic immune defects.","Soresina, Annarosa; Moratto, Daniele; Chiarini, Marco; Paolillo, Ciro; Baresi, Giulia; Focà, Emanuele; Bezzi, Michela; Baronio, Barbara; Giacomelli, Mauro; Badolato, Raffaele",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,38,16

We examined viral loads of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in fatal (15 cases), symptomatic/survived (133 cases), and asymptomatic cases (138 cases) using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). We examined 5768 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and attempted to detect the SARS-CoV-2 genome using RT-qPCR. Among them, the viral genome was detected using the method for the 370 NPS samples with a positive rate of 6.4%. A comparison of each age showed that the fatal case was higher than the survived case and asymptomatic patients. Survived cases were older than asymptomatic patients. Notably, the viral load in the fatal cases was significantly higher than in symptomatic or asymptomatic cases (p < 0.05). These results suggested that a high viral load of the SARS-CoV-2 in elderly patients at an early stage of the disease results in a poor outcome. We should, therefore, intervene early to prevent a severe stage of the disease in such cases.","Tsukagoshi, Hiroyuki; Shinoda, Daisuke; Saito, Mariko; Okayama, Kaori; Sada, Mitsuru; Kimura, Hirokazu; Saruki, Nobuhiro",Viruses,38,33

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether symptoms persist further or improve over time, we followed patients discharged after hospitalization for severe COVID-19 to characterize their overall health status and their physical and mental health at 6 months post-hospital discharge. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients ≥ 18 years hospitalized for COVID-19 at a single health system, who required at minimum 6 l of supplemental oxygen during admission, had intact baseline functional status, and were discharged alive. MAIN MEASURES: Overall health status, physical health, mental health, and dyspnea were assessed with validated surveys: the PROMIS® Global Health-10 and PROMIS® Dyspnea Characteristics instruments. KEY RESULTS: Of 152 patients who completed the 1 month post-discharge survey, 126 (83%) completed the 6-month survey. Median age of 6-month respondents was 62; 40% were female. Ninety-three (74%) patients reported that their health had not returned to baseline at 6 months, and endorsed a mean of 7.1 symptoms. Participants’ summary t-scores in both the physical health and mental health domains at 6 months (45.2, standard deviation [SD] 9.8; 47.4, SD 9.8, respectively) remained lower than their baseline (physical health 53.7, SD 9.4; mental health 54.2, SD 8.0; p<0.001). Overall, 79 (63%) patients reported shortness of breath within the prior week (median score 2 out of 10 (interquartile range [IQR] 0–5), vs 42 (33%) pre-COVID-19 infection (0, IQR 0–1)). A total of 11/124 (9%) patients without pre-COVID oxygen requirements still needed oxygen 6 months post-hospital discharge. One hundred and seven (85%) were still experiencing fatigue at 6 months post-discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Even 6 months after hospital discharge, the majority of patients report that their health has not returned to normal. Support and treatments to return these patients back to their pre-COVID baseline are urgently needed.

We investigated if contact with children also affords adults a degree of protection from COVID-19. DESIGN: Cohort study based on linked administrative data. SETTING: Scotland. STUDY POPULATION: All National Health Service Scotland healthcare workers and their household contacts as of March 2020. MAIN EXPOSURE: Number of young children (0–11 years) living in the participant’s household. MAIN OUTCOMES: COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation, and any COVID-19 (any positive test for SARS-CoV-2) in adults aged ≥18 years between 1 March and 12 October 2020. RESULTS: 241 266, 41 198, 23 783 and 3850 adults shared a household with 0, 1, 2 and 3 or more young children, respectively. Over the study period, the risk of COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation was reduced progressively with increasing numbers of household children—fully adjusted HR (aHR) 0.93 per child (95% CI 0.79 to 1.10). The risk of any COVID-19 was similarly reduced, with the association being statistically significant (aHR per child 0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.98). After schools reopened to all children in August 2020, no association was seen between exposure to young children and risk of any COVID-19 (aHR per child 1.03; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.14). CONCLUSION: Between March and October 2020, living with young children was associated with an attenuated risk of any COVID-19 and COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation among adults living in healthcare worker households. There was no evidence that living with young children increased adults’ risk of COVID-19, including during the period after schools reopened.","Wood, Rachael; Thomson, Emma; Galbraith, Robert; Gribben, Ciara; Caldwell, David; Bishop, Jennifer; Reid, Martin; Shah, Anoop S V; Templeton, Kate; Goldberg, David; Robertson, Chris; Hutchinson, Sharon J; Colhoun, Helen M; McKeigue, Paul M; McAllister, David A",Arch Dis Child,38,24

This analysis provides a critical update and expansion of previously published data, to include trends after fall school reopenings, and adds preschool-aged children (0-4 years) and college-aged young adults (18-24 years) (1). Among children, adolescents, and young adults, weekly incidence (cases per 100,000 persons) increased with age and was highest during the final week of the review period (the week of December 6) among all age groups. Time trends in weekly reported incidence for children and adolescents aged 0-17 years tracked consistently with trends observed among adults since June, with both incidence and positive test results tending to increase since September after summer declines. Reported incidence and positive test results among children aged 0-10 years were consistently lower than those in older age groups. To reduce community transmission, which will support schools in operating more safely for in-person learning, communities and schools should fully implement and strictly adhere to recommended mitigation strategies, especially universal and proper masking, to reduce COVID-19 incidence.","Leidman, Eva; Duca, Lindsey M.; Omura, John D.; Proia, Krista; Stephens, James W.; Sauber-Schatz, Erin K.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,38,16

The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases. For these regions, healthcare delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment. While mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances. Thoracic imaging with chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pre-test probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints. To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints. Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide. The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of CXR and CT in the management of COVID-19.","Rubin, Geoffrey D.; Ryerson, Christopher J.; Haramati, Linda B.; Sverzellati, Nicola; Kanne, Jeffrey P.; Raoof, Suhail; Schluger, Neil W.; Volpi, Annalisa; Yim, Jae-Joon; Martin, Ian B.

Multiple observational studies showed that patients with chronic kidney disease and especially those on the hemodialysis program have an increased risk of severe morbidity and mortality caused by the novel coronavirus. AIM OF STUDY: was to determine the prognosis and mortality risk in hemodialysis patients hospitalized for symptomatic COVID-19 infection, using the ALAMA age score and the COVID-GRAM critical illness risk score. METHOD: Prospective and retrospective study that included 74 patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, hospitalized in the Constanta County Emergency Clinical Hospital between March 2020 - December 2020, confirmed with SARS-CoV 2 infection by RT-PCR testing. RESULTS: Out of the total number of 74 hospitalized patients (64.58% M, 35.41% F; mean age = 66.64 years), having moderate and severe forms of the disease. 56.25% needed conventional oxygen therapy, 22.9% non-invasive mechanical ventilation and 12.5% intubation and ventilation. All patients underwent specific treatment according to the national protocols, updated with the rapid changes and increasing informations regarding the disease management. The mean duration of hospitalization was 12.33 days. 94.7 % of patients had additional risk factors (diabetes mellitus-47.56%, arterial hypertension-87.3%, COPD – 7.8%, systemic aterosclerosis – 35.4%, immunosuppression – 11.6%, malignant tumors – 4.8% ). Mean ALAMA score was more than 85 years (p<0.01) and mean COVID-GRAM critical illness risk score was 202 (92.1% risk for critical illness). Fatal outcome affected 37.8% of the patients, mainly due to severe respiratory failure, myocarditis, arrhythmias and stroke. CONCLUSION: Hemodialysis patients with SARS-CoV 2 infection have an unfavorable evolution and a reserved prognosis with a high risk of death, depending especially on the need for ventilatory support. 6.25% of the patients followed had post-COVID syndrome (disseminated intravascular coagulation, severe bacterial infections, enterocolitis), but these long-term complications of the survivors will need further studies.","Pana, Camelia; Iordache, Alexandru; Bogdan, Campineanu; Sburlan (Stanigut), Alina Mihaela; Tuta, Liliana-Ana",Nephrol Dial Transplant,38,1

Six of them (TJP1, PTPN13, HTRA1, PARD3, MLLT4, LNX2) are also recognized by SARS‐CoV while three (NHERF1, MAST2, RADIL) are specific to SARS‐CoV‐2 E protein. Most of these SARS‐CoV‐2 protein partners are involved in cellular junctions/polarity and could be also linked to evasion mechanisms of the immune responses during viral infection. Among the binders of the SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins E, 3a, or N, seven significantly affect viral replication under knock down gene expression in infected cells.

Academic papers in various disciplines, especially computer science, contain a large number of algorithms. Identifying the algorithms from the full-text content of papers can determine popular or classical algorithms in a specific field and help scholars gain a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms and even the field. To this end, this article takes the field of natural language processing (NLP) as an example and identifies algorithms from academic papers in the field. A dictionary of algorithms is constructed by manually annotating the contents of papers, and sentences containing algorithms in the dictionary are extracted through dictionary-based matching. The number of articles mentioning an algorithm is used as an indicator to analyze the influence of that algorithm. Our results reveal the algorithm with the highest influence in NLP papers and show that classification algorithms represent the largest proportion among the high-impact algorithms. In addition, the evolution of the influence of algorithms reflects the changes in research tasks and topics in the field, and the changes in the influence of different algorithms show different trends. As a preliminary exploration, this paper conducts an analysis of the impact of algorithms mentioned in the academic text, and the results can be used as training data for the automatic extraction of large-scale algorithms in the future. The methodology in this paper is domain-independent and can be applied to other domains.","Wang, Yuzhuo; Zhang, Chengzhi",J Informetr,38,22

Evidence is emerging that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 2.5 μm or less) associates with higher COVID-19 mortality rates, but whether it also associates with the speed at which the disease is capable of spreading in a population is unknown. Here, we establish the association between long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 in the United States (US) and COVID-19 basic reproduction ratio R 0– a dimensionless epidemic measure of the rapidity of disease spread through a population. We inferred state-level R 0 values using a state-of-the-art susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) model initialized with COVID-19 epidemiological data corresponding to the period March 2–April 30. This period was characterized by a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases across the US states, implementation of strict social distancing measures, and a significant drop in outdoor air pollution. We find that an increase of 1 μg/m3 in PM2.5 levels below current national ambient air quality standards associates with an increase of 0.25 in R 0 (95% CI: 0.048–0.447). A 10% increase in secondary inorganic composition, sulfate-nitrate-ammonium, in PM2.5 associates with ≈10% increase in R 0 by 0.22 (95% CI: 0.083–0.352), and presence of black carbon (soot) in the ambient moderates this relationship. We considered several potential confounding factors in our analysis including gaseous air pollutants, and socio-economical and meteorological conditions. Our results underscore two policy implications – first, regulatory standards need to be better guided by exploring the concentration-response relationships near the lower end of the PM2.5 air quality distribution; and second, pollution regulations need to be continually enforced for combustion emissions that largely determine secondary inorganic aerosol formation.","Chakrabarty, Rajan K.; Beeler, Payton; Liu, Pai; Goswami, Spondita; Harvey, Richard D.; Pervez, Shamsh; van Donkelaar, Aaron; Martin, Randall V.",Sci Total Environ,38,16

This high severity is dependent on a cytokine storm, most likely induced by the interleukin-6 (IL-6) amplifier, which is hyper-activation machinery that regulates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and stimulated by the simultaneous activation of IL-6-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NF-κB signaling in non-immune cells including alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells.

In order to control the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals have been subjected to increased exposure to work stress. In this systematic review, we aimed at investigating the prevalence and determinants of immediate and long-term post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) effects on healthcare professionals by the COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) and SARS-2003 (SARS CoV-1) pandemics. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the recommendations of the Protocols for Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Only studies reporting the prevalence of PTSD (frequency, percentage) and related risk factors (adjusted odds ratio (OR)) in healthcare professionals (HCPs) during the SARS CoV-2 and SARS CoV-1 pandemics were included. The following databases were screened: Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, and Health Psychosocial Instrument (HaPI). Results: Six of eight studies reported PTSD symptoms among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in China (three), Singapore (one), India (one), and the United States of America (USA) (two), while two studies reported symptoms during the SARS-2003 pandemic in China (one) and Singapore (one). Sample sizes ranged from 263 to 5062 with a combined total of 10,074 participants. All of the studies self-reported the level of exposure to coronaviruses (CoV-1 and CoV-2) and severity of PTSD. Seven studies reported the prevalence of immediate PTSD and determinants, while one study reported delayed-onset PTSD (3 years after CoV-1 pandemic). Determinants of immediate PTSD were reported for the CoV-2 pandemic, while those for long-term PTSD were reported for the CoV-1 pandemic. Conclusions: A comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and determinants of immediate or long-term pandemic PTSD for healthcare workers can improve prevention, diagnosis, and management. Rigorous research measuring the prevalence of PTSD and its associated risk factors (adjusted OR) for the CoV-2 pandemic are envisaged.

This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we propose to estimate R(eff) for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted by Bayesian inference (particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland. This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data. Except for the specific model structure, it is non-specifically assumed that the transmission rate follows a basic stochastic process constrained by the observations. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its R(eff)(t). Besides, it allows to assess and to interpret the evolution of transmission with respect to the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in Ireland. We can thus estimate a reduction of more than 80% for the first wave in all the studied regions but a smaller reduction for the second wave when the epidemic was less active, around 45% in France but just 20% in Ireland. For the third wave in Ireland the reduction was again significant (>70%).","Cazelles, Bernard; Champagne, Clara; Nguyen-Van-Yen, Benjamin; Comiskey, Catherine; Vergu, Elisabeta; Roche, Benjamin",PLoS Comput Biol,38,30

As traditional supply chains could not meet up with the demand, makeshift solutions were developed and locally manufactured by rapid prototyping networks. Among the different global initiatives, retrofitting of full-face snorkeling masks for Non-Invasive-Ventilation (NIV) applications seems the most challenging. This article provides a systematic overview of rapid prototyped - 3D printed - designs that enable attachment of medical equipment to snorkeling masks, highlighting potential and challenges in additive manufacturing. The different NIV connector designs are compared on low-cost 3D fabrication time and costs, which allows a rapid assessment of developed connectors for health care workers in urgent need of retrofitting snorkeling masks for NIV purposes. Challenges and safety issues of the rapid prototyping approach for healthcare applications during the pandemic are discussed as well. When critical parameters such as the final product cost, geographical availability of the feedstock and the 3D printers and the medical efficiency of the rapid prototyped products are well considered before deploying decentralized 3D printing as manufacturing method, this rapid prototyping strategy contributed to reduce personal protective equipment and NIV shortages during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also concluded that it is crucial to carefully optimize material and printer parameter settings to realize best fitting and airtight connector-mask connections, which is heavily depending on the chosen feedstock and type of printer.","Profili, Jacopo; Brunet, Rafael; Dubois, Émilie L; Groenhuis, Vincent; Hof, Lucas A",,38,6

It is one of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-6 was reported as an exacerbating factor in coronavirus disease. In recent years, it has become clear that the function of muscle-derived IL-6 is different from what has been reported so far. Exercise is accompanied by skeletal muscle contraction, during which, several bioactive substances, collectively named myokines, are secreted from the muscles. Many reports have shown that IL-6 is the most abundant myokine. Interestingly, it was indicated that IL-6 plays opposing roles as a myokine and as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. In this review, we discuss why IL-6 has different functions, the signaling mode of hyper-IL-6 via soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), and the involvement of soluble glycoprotein 130 in the suppressive effect of hyper-IL-6. Furthermore, the involvement of a disintegrin and metalloprotease family molecules in the secretion of sIL-6R is described. One of the functions of muscle-derived IL-6 is lipid metabolism in the liver. However, the differences between the functions of IL-6 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and the functions of muscle-derived IL-6 are unclear. Although the involvement of myokines in lipid metabolism in adipocytes was previously discussed, little is known about the direct relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and muscle-derived IL-6. This review is the first to discuss the relationship between the function of IL-6 in diseases and the function of muscle-derived IL-6, focusing on IL-6 signaling and lipid metabolism in the liver.","Nara, Hidetoshi; Watanabe, Rin",Int J Mol Sci,38,16

The current situation provides an unprecedented opportunity to invest in initiatives that address these common factors and encourage people to live more healthily and sustainably. Such initiatives can generate the positive feedback loops needed to change the systems and structures that shape our lives. INHERIT (January 2016–December 2019), an ambitious, multisectoral and transnational research project that involved 18 organisations across Europe, funded by the European Commission, explored such solutions. It identified, defined and analysed promising inter-sectoral policies, practices and approaches to simultaneously promote environmental sustainability, protect and promote health and contribute to health equity (the INHERIT “triple-win”) and that can encourage and enable people to live, move and consume more healthfully and sustainably. It also explored the facilitators and barriers to working across sectors and in public private cooperation. The insights were brought together in guidelines setting out how policy makers can help instigate and support local “triple-win” initiatives that influence behaviours as an approach to contributing to the change that is so urgently needed to stem environmental degradation and the interlinked threats to health and wellbeing.

COVID-19 predisposes patients to a hypercoagulable state, however, the pathophysiology behind the thrombotic complications seen in this disease is not well understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed and the pathogenesis likely involves a host immune response contributing to vascular endothelial cell injury, inflammation, activation of the coagulation cascade via tissue factor expression, and shutdown of fibrinolysis. Treatments targeting these pathways may need to be considered to improve clinical outcomes and decrease overall mortality due to thrombotic complications. In this review, we will discuss the proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms for thrombotic complications in COVID-19, as well as treatment strategies for these complications based on the current literature available.","Kichloo, Asim; Dettloff, Kirk; Aljadah, Michael; Albosta, Michael; Jamal, Shakeel; Singh, Jagmeet; Wani, Farah; Kumar, Akshay; Vallabhaneni, Srilakshmi; Khan, Muhammad Zia",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,38,5

This study examined the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on sustainability determinants, with the time arisen from December 27, 2019, through June 30, 2020. This study considers quantitative COVID-19 dashboard data with sustainable determinants; old age group, people exposed to air pollution, and countries with the most international travelers. Applying linear regression examines that COVID-19 behavior concerning the aging population and countries host the most international travelers, more positively significant than people exposed to PM2.5% air pollution, respectively. This study made a novel contribution by analyzing two variables' interaction; first, the aging population and the countries that host the most international travelers. Secondly, the aging population and people exposed to air pollution are vulnerable to COVID-19 globally, a novel concept comprehensively. Results show that countries with aging populations are more exposed to COVID-19, and its interaction term host the most international travelers. It also analyses that the aging population and its interaction with people exposed to air pollution are also vulnerable to COVID-19 but marginally lesser than the former. However, their behavior varies from country to country, making room for future study to analyze a more in-depth analysis. It gives a different dimension to consider other risk factors of COVID-19 by bearing in mind its unique contagious characteristics, which will help policymakers draft a sound epidemic preparedness policy to tackle the unforeseen crisis. It gives a thought of provoking to policy practitioners for the risk characteristics of COVID-19, which needs a reassessment to epidemic risk management to deal with this, and future unforeseen crisis by considering Sustainable Development Goals.","Abbas, Hafiz Syed Mohsin; Xu, Xiaodong; Sun, Chunxia; Ullah, Atta; Gillani, Samreen; Raza, Muhammad Ahsan Ali",Heliyon,38,1

A clear advantage of magnetic supports is their easy separation due to the magnetic attraction between magnetic NPs and an external magnetic field, facilitating the biocatalyst reuse. This allows for savings of materials and energy in the biocatalytic process. Commonly, magnetic NPs are isolated from enzymes either by polymers, silica, or some other protective layer. However, in those cases when iron oxide NPs are in close proximity to the enzyme, the biocatalyst may display a fascinating behavior, allowing for synergy of the performance due to the enzyme-like properties shown in iron oxides. Another important parameter which is discussed in this review is the magnetic support porosity, especially in hierarchical porous supports. In the case of comparatively large pores, which can freely accommodate enzyme molecules without jeopardizing their conformation, the enzyme surface ordering may create an optimal crowding on the support, enhancing the biocatalytic performance. Other factors such as surface-modifying agents or special enzyme reactor designs can be also influential in the performance of magnetic NP based immobilized enzymes.","Matveeva, Valentina G.; Bronstein, Lyudmila M.",Nanomaterials (Basel),38,28

How is it best morally justified, and what are its moral limits? I distinguish two varieties of harm reduction. One of them, technocratic harm reduction, is premised on the fact of non-enforceability of prohibitionist policies. The second, deliberative harm reduction, is premised on the fact of reasonable disagreement, grounded in the fact that reasonable persons disagree about a range of controversial behaviours.

It is associated with premature mortality, lower quality of life (QoL) and greater use of healthcare resources. The burden of multimorbidity could be huge in the low and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Ethiopia. However, there is limited evidence on the magnitude of multimorbidity, associated risk factors and its effect on QoL and functionality. In addition, the evidence base on the way health systems are organised to manage patients with multimorbidity is sparse. The knowledge gleaned from this study could have a timely and significant impact on the prevention, management and survival of patients with NCD multimorbidity in Ethiopia and in LMICs at large. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study has three phases: (1) a cross-sectional quantitative study to determine the magnitude of NCD multimorbidity and its effect on QoL and functionality, (2) a qualitative study to explore organisation of care for patients with multimorbidity, and (3) a longitudinal quantitative study to investigate disease progression and patient outcomes over time.

METHODS AND RESULTS: COVID-19 patients at seven institutions receiving HCQ therapy from whom a baseline and at least one ECG at 48+ h were available were enrolled in the study. QT/QTc prolongation, QT-associated and QT-independent arrhythmic events, arrhythmic mortality, and overall mortality during HCQ therapy were assessed. A total of 649 COVID-19 patients (61.9 ± 18.7 years, 46.1% males) were enrolled. HCQ therapy was administrated as a home therapy regimen in 126 (19.4%) patients, and as an in-hospital-treatment to 495 (76.3%) hospitalized and 28 (4.3%) intensive care unit (ICU) patients. At 36–72 and at 96+ h after the first HCQ dose, 358 and 404 ECGs were obtained, respectively. A significant QT/QTc interval prolongation was observed (P < 0.001), but the magnitude of the increase was modest [+13 (9–16) ms]. Baseline QT/QTc length and presence of fever (P = 0.001) at admission represented the most important determinants of QT/QTc prolongation. No arrhythmic-related deaths were reported. The overall major ventricular arrhythmia rate was low (1.1%), with all events found not to be related to QT or HCQ therapy at a centralized event evaluation. No differences in QT/QTc prolongation and QT-related arrhythmias were observed across different clinical settings, with non-QT-related arrhythmias being more common in the intensive care setting. CONCLUSION: HCQ administration is safe for a short-term treatment for patients with COVID-19 infection regardless of the clinical setting of delivery, causing only modest QTc prolongation and no directly attributable arrhythmic deaths.","Gasperetti, Alessio; Biffi, Mauro; Duru, Firat; Schiavone, Marco; Ziacchi, Matteo; Mitacchione, Gianfranco; Lavalle, Carlo; Saguner, Ardan; Lanfranchi, Antonio; Casalini, Giacomo; Tocci, Marco; Fabbricatore, Davide; Salghetti, Francesca; Mariani, Marco Valerio; Busana, Mattia; Bellia, Alfonso; Cogliati, Chiara Beatrice; Viale, Pierluigi; Antinori, Spinello; Galli, Massimo; Galiè, Nazzareno; Tondo, Claudio; Forleo, Giovanni Battista",Europace,38,20

More than one year after the first reported case significant knowledge gaps remain, highlighting the need for a coordinated approach. To address this need, the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Working Group (MNCH WG) of the COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition conducted an international survey to identify global research priorities for COVID-19 in maternal, reproductive and child health. METHOD: This project was undertaken using a modified Delphi method. An electronic questionnaire was disseminated to clinicians and researchers in three different languages (English, French and Spanish) via MNCH WG affiliated networks. Respondents were asked to select the five most urgent research priorities among a list of 17 identified by the MNCH WG. Analysis of questionnaire data was undertaken to identify key similarities and differences among respondents according to questionnaire language, location and specialty. Following elimination of the seven lowest ranking priorities, the questionnaire was recirculated to the original pool of respondents. Thematic analysis of final questionnaire data was undertaken by the MNCH WG from which four priority research themes emerged. RESULTS: Questionnaire 1 was completed by 225 respondents from 29 countries. Questionnaire 2 was returned by 49 respondents. The four priority research themes which emerged from the analysis were 1) access to healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) the direct and 3) indirect effects of COVID-19 on pregnant and breastfeeding women and children and 4) the transmission of COVID-19 and protection from infection. CONCLUSION: The results of these questionnaires indicated a high level of concordance among continents and specialties regarding priority research themes. This prioritized list of research uncertainties, developed to specifically highlight the most urgent clinical needs as perceived by healthcare professionals and researchers, could help funding organizations and researchers to answer the most pressing questions for clinicians and public health professionals during the pandemic.

Here we aimed to identify arterivirus proteins involved in the mode-of-action of cyclophilin inhibitors and to investigate how these compounds inhibit arterivirus RNA synthesis in the infected cell. Repeated passaging of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV) in the presence of CsA revealed that reduced drug sensitivity is associated with the emergence of adaptive mutations in nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), one of the transmembrane subunits of the arterivirus replicase polyprotein. Introduction of singular nsp5 mutations (nsp5 Q21R, Y113H, or A134V) led to a ∼2-fold decrease in sensitivity to CsA treatment, whereas combinations of mutations further increased EAV’s CsA resistance. The detailed experimental characterization of engineered EAV mutants harboring CsA-resistance mutations implicated nsp5 in arterivirus RNA synthesis. Particularly, in an in vitro assay, EAV RNA synthesis was far less sensitive to CsA treatment when nsp5 contained the adaptive mutations mentioned above. Interestingly, for increased sensitivity to the closely-related drug ALV CsA-resistant nsp5 mutants required the incorporation of an additional adaptive mutation, which resided in nsp2 (H114R), another transmembrane subunit of the arterivirus replicase. Our study provides the first evidence for the involvement of nsp2 and nsp5 in the mechanism underlying the inhibition of arterivirus replication by cyclophilin inhibitors. Importance Currently, no approved treatments are available to combat infections with nidoviruses, a group of plus-stranded RNA viruses including important zoonotic and veterinary pathogens. Previously, the cyclophilin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) were shown to inhibit the replication of diverse nidoviruses (both arteriviruses and coronaviruses), and may thus represent a class of pan-nidovirus inhibitors. Here, using the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus, we have established that resistance to CsA and ALV treatment is associated with adaptive mutations in two trans-membrane subunits of the viral replication complex, nonstructural proteins 2 and 5. This is the first evidence for the involvement of specific replicase subunits of nidoviruses in the mechanism underlying the inhibition of their replication by cyclophilin inhibitors. Understanding this mechanism of action is of major importance to guide future drug design, both for nidoviruses and other RNA viruses inhibited by these compounds.","de Wilde, Adriaan H.; Boomaars-van der Zanden, A.

In this sense, several factors may be related to the increase in experiences of anxiety and depression in PwMS during the current pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In this study we first explored the reactions of anxiety, depression and fear to COVID-19 in a group of PwMS that belong to the Ibero-American region. Besides, we explored whether having been positive to COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, the obstacles to attend medical appointments during the outbreak and subjective experience of MS progression, could predict the anxiety and depression reactions in our PwMS sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted on 202 MS patients from six countries (Argentina, Mexico, Spain, Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Cuba). For comparisons between variables an independent-samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance were used. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the effects of potential predictor variables over emotional reactions. RESULTS: Our results showed that PwMS who were positive for COVID-19 reported higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (p<.001) and also higher levels of anxiety (p<.001) compared to non-positive patients. Those patients who had difficulties attending their medical appointments during the outbreak showed higher levels of depression (p=.03) and anxiety (p=.019). Levels of anxiety (p<.001) and depression (p=.006) were also higher among patients with the subjective experience of MS disease progression. The reactions of fear of COVID-19, having been positive to COVID-19, problems attending medical appointments, and subjective experience of MS disease progression showed a high association with the negative impact of the pandemic on mental health of PwMS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the situation generated by the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health of PwMS in our sample. Our results also alert to the importance of offering psychological care to patients with multiple sclerosis during the current outbreak, regardless of whether they have been positive for COVID-19.","Broche-Pérez, Yunier; Jiménez-Morales, Rodneys M.; Monasterio-Ramos, Laura Ortiz; Vázquez-Gómez, Lázaro A.; Fernández-Fleites, Zoylen",Mult Scler Relat Disord,38,24

However, little is known regarding the systematic review of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. The current study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, aimed to estimate the incidence of recurrent SARS CoV 2 RNA positivity after recovery from COVID 19 and to determine the factors associated with recurrent positivity. Methods: We searched the PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry for studies published to June 12, 2020. Studies were reviewed to determine the risk of bias. A random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Results: Fourteen studies of 2,568 individuals were included. The incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.81% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.44-18.19%). The pooled estimate of the interval from disease onset to recurrence was 35.44 days (95% CI: 32.65-38.24 days), and from the last negative to recurrent positive result was 9.76 days (95% CI: 7.31-12.22 days). Patients with younger age (mean difference [MD]=-2.27, 95% CI: -2.95 to -1.80) and a longer initial illness (MD=8.24 days; 95% CI: 7.54-8.95; I2=98.9%) were more likely to experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while patients with diabetes (RR=0.52; 95% CI: 0.30-0.90; I2=53%), severe disease (RR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.35-0.84; I2=70%), and a low lymphocyte count (RR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.39-0.86; I2=48%) were less likely to experience recurrent SARS CoV 2 positivity.

This study examines the association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impact and the mental health of parents and school-aged children; specifically, whether qualities of the parent–child relationship moderated the relationship between parents’ emotional health (EH) and children’s emotional and behavioral health (EBH). METHODS: Data from this Internet-based study of a community sample were collected in March–May 2020. Parents (N = 158, 92.4% White, 96.2% female) reported on COVID-19 impacts, their own EH, perceptions of their relationship with their eldest child between 6 and 12 years-old, and the EBH of that child. RESULTS: Responses to questions about COVID-19 impact were assigned weighted values and used to create a COVID-19 impact scale. Hierarchical linear regressions revealed that greater COVID-19 impact was associated with greater parents’ EH issues only, and parents’ EH was a significant positive predictor of children’s EBH. Positive qualities and conflict in the parent–child relationship moderated the link between parents’ and children’s EH. At higher levels of relationship conflict and lower levels of positivity, there were stronger positive associations between parents’ and children’s EH. Parent–child relationship quality did not moderate the association between parents’ EH and children’s behavioral health (BH). CONCLUSIONS: These cross-sectional study results suggest that beyond focusing on symptom management, families may benefit from supports targeting the parent–child relationship. Insights and implications for practitioners are discussed.","Bate, Jordan; Pham, Phoebe T; Borelli, Jessica L",J Pediatr Psychol,38,22

The aim of our study was to develop a new chemo-prophylactic/-therapeutic strategy that effectively prevents COVID-19 and related complications. Methods: In in vitro studies, COVID-19 infection-sensitive cells were incubated with human oropharyngeal fluids containing high SARS-CoV-2 loads. Levels of infection were determined via intra-cellular virus loads using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Efficacies for infection prevention were determined using several antiviral treatments: lipid-encapsulated ozonized oil (HOO), water-soluble HOO (HOOws), UV, and hydrogen peroxide. In in vivo studies, safety and efficacy of HOO in fighting COVID-19 infection was evaluated in human subjects. Results: HOO in combination with HOOws was the only treatment able to fully neutralize SARS-CoV-2 as well as its capacity to penetrate and reproduce inside sensitive cells. Accordingly, the feasibility of using HOO/HOOws was tested in vivo. Analysis of expired gas in healthy subjects indicates that HOO administration increases oxygen availability in the lung. For our human studies, HOO/HOOws was administered to 52 cancer patients and 21 healthy subjects at high risk for COVID-19 infection, and all of them showed clinical safety. None of them developed COVID-19 infection, although an incidence of at least 11 cases was expected. Efficacy of HOO/HOOws was tested in four COVID-19 patients obtaining recovery and qPCR negativization in less than 10 days. Conclusions: Based on our experience, the HOO/HOOws treatment can be administered at standard doses (three pills per day) for chemo-prophylactic purposes to healthy subjects for COVID-19 prevention and at high doses (up to eight pills per day) for therapeutic purposes to infected patients. This combined prevention strategy can provide a novel protocol to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.","Izzotti, Alberto; Fracchia, Enzo; Au, William; Colombo, Monica; Pfeffer, Ulrich; Emionite, Laura; Pavan, Simone; Miotto, Daniele; Lova, Paola; Grasselli, Elena; Faelli, Emanuela; Piero, Ruggeri; Tiso, Micaela; Pulliero, Alessandra",J Pers Med,38,24

Since 2002 that the first Coronavirus epidemic has emerged, many pieces of researches have indicated several psychological problems during this period. In circumstances such as COVID-19, researchers could deploy previous resources to identify the most prevalent psychological effects of Coronavirus diseases. We aim to systematically review and quantitatively assess the psychological problems during Coronavirus epidemics to identify the most prevalent psychological problems. Method: A systematic review of the literature will be conducted on psychological problems during previous and the new Coronavirus epidemics. Electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO/ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar will be systematically searched using predefined search terms to identify relevant articles published from January 1, 2002 to June 20, 2020. Two authors independently identify papers that reported the prevalence rates of the psychological problems during Coronavirus outbreaks. The outcomes will include the most prevalent psychological problems during Coronavirus outbreaks. To ensure we have gathered all the evidence, we will conduct another search on the specific psychological problems revealed in the previous search. Study selection will follow the Cochrane library guideline. Afterward, data synthesis will be performed via the meta-analysis of the prevalence rates using the random effect model. Conclusion: The findings can allow identifying the most prevalent psychological problems since the first Coronavirus epidemic in 2002.

There has been little data on the epidemiology of workplace violence against frontline clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the pattern of workplace violence and its association with quality of life (QOL) against frontline clinicians during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: A cross-sectional online study was conducted in China between March 15 and March 20, 2020. Frontline clinicians' experience with workplace violence was measured with six standardized questions derived from the Workplace Violence Scale, while anxiety, depressive, and insomnia symptoms, and QOL were measured using the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, respectively. Univariate analyses, multivariable logistic regression analyses, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were conducted. Results: A total of 15,531 clinicians completed the assessment; 2,878 (18.5, 95% CI = 17.92–19.14%) reported workplace violence during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (verbal violence: 16.1%; physical violence: 6.9%). According to multivariable models, key correlates of workplace violence were male gender, longer work experience, higher education level, smoking, working in the psychiatry or emergency department, working in tertiary hospitals, being involved in direct care of infected patients, having infected family/ friends/ colleagues, and frequently using social communication programs. Clinicians working in inpatient departments were less likely to report workplace violence compared to those working in outpatient departments. SEM analysis revealed that both violence and emotional disturbances (anxiety, depression, and insomnia) directly affected QOL (standardized direct effect = −0.031, and −0.566, respectively, P < 0.05), while emotional disturbances partly mediated the association between work violence and QOL (standardized indirect effect = −0.184, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Frontline clinicians were vulnerable to workplace violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the negative impact of workplace violence on quality of care and clinicians' QOL, health authorities and policymakers should take effective measures to reduce workplace violence against clinicians.","Yang, Yuan; Li, Yue; An, Ying; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Zhang, Ling; Cheung, Teris; Hall, Brian J.; Ungvari, Gabor S.; An, Feng-Rong; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Front Psychiatry,38,15

Thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin is recommended by current guidelines, but evidence is still weak. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin on hospital mortality in patients admitted for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The effects of enoxaparin on intensive care admission and hospital length-of-stay were evaluated as secondary outcomes. METHODS: Observational cohort study, with data collected from patients admitted to Poliambulanza Foundation with positive real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 from 20th February to 10th May 2020. Multivariate logistic regression with overlap weight propensity score was used to model hospital mortality and intensive care admission, hospital length-of-stay was analyzed with a multivariate Poisson regression. Seven hundred and ninety nine (57%) patients who received enoxaparin at least once during the hospitalization were included in the enoxaparin cohort, 604 (43%) patients who did not were included in the control cohort. FINDINGS: At the adjusted analysis enoxaparin was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (Odds Ratio 0·53, 95% C.I. 0·40–0·70) compared with no enoxaparin treatment. Hospital length-of-stay was longer for patients treated with enoxaparin (Incidence Rate Ratios 1·45, 95% C.I. 1·36–1·54). Enoxaparin treatment was associated with reduced risk of intensive care admission at the adjusted analysis (Odds Ratio 0·48, 95% C.I. 0·32–0·69). INTERPRETATION: This study shows that treatment with enoxaparin during hospital stay is associated with a lower death rate and, while results from randomized clinical trials are still pending, this study supports the use of thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin in all patients admitted for COVID-19. Moreover, when enoxaparin is used on the wards, it reduces the risk of Intensive Care Unit admission.","Albani, Filippo; Sepe, Lilia; Fusina, Federica; Prezioso, Chiara; Baronio, Manuela; Caminiti, Federica; Di Maio, Antonella; Faggian, Barbara; Franceschetti, Maria Elena; Massari, Marco; Salvaggio, Marcello; Natalini, Giuseppe",EClinicalMedicine,38,1

SARS-CoV-1 mutates frequently because of its RNA genome, which challenges the antiviral development. Here, we performed computational saturation mutagenesis of the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 to identify the residues crucial for its functions. We used the structure-based energy calculations to analyze the effects of the missense mutations on the SARS-CoV-1 S stability and the binding affinity with hACE2. The sequence and structure alignment showed similarities between the S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that target mutations of S protein amino acids generate similar effects on their stabilities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. For example, G839W of SARS-CoV-1 corresponds to G857W of SARS-CoV-2, which decrease the stability of their S glycoproteins. The viral mutation analysis of the two different SARS-CoV-1 isolates showed that mutations, T487S and L472P, weakened the S-hACE2 binding of the 2003-2004 SARS-CoV-1 isolate. In addition, the mutations of L472P and F360S destabilized the 2003-2004 viral isolate. We further predicted that many mutations on N-linked glycosylation sites would increase the stability of the S glycoprotein. Our results can be of therapeutic importance in the design of antivirals or vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Author Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) is an RNA virus that undergoes frequent mutations, which may result in more virulent SARS-CoV-1 variants. To prevent another pandemic in the future, scientists must understand the mechanisms of viral mutations and predict if any variants could become a dominant. The infection of SARS-CoV-1 in cells is largely depending on the interactions of the viral Spike (S) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). We applied a computational method to predict S missense mutations that will make SARS-CoV-1 more virulent. We are interested in the variants that can change SARS-CoV-1 spike protein stability and/or change the virus-receptor interactions. We mutated each residue of SARS-CoV-1 spike to all possible amino acids; we calculated the differences between the folding energy and binding energy of each variant and the wildtype and identified the target S mutations with significant effects on protein stability and protein-protein interaction. We found some viral mutations could destabilize S and weaken S-hACE2 binding of SARS-CoV-1 isolate. Our results show that the computational saturation mutagenesis is a reliable approach in the analysis and prediction of missense mutations.","Sobitan, Adebiyi; Mahase, Vidhyanand; Rhoades, Raina; Williams, Dejaun; Liu, Dongxiao; Xie, Yixin; Li, Lin; Tang, Qiyi; Teng, Shaolei",bioRxiv,38,16

The Act included a new focus on cancer control, including the requirement that the NCI award research grants and contracts, in collaboration with other public agencies and private industry, to conduct cancer control activities related to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cancer. The requirement placed the NCI at the nexus of a rapidly changing science and a complex and dynamic healthcare delivery system and involved an evolutionary transformation to advance cancer control and cancer care delivery research along the cancer care continuum. Analysis is based on a qualitative ethnographic approach using historical records, oral histories, and targeted interviews. The multimethod approach provided the opportunity to describe to the vision, leadership, and struggle to build an infrastructure, expand expertise, and forge collaboration with the NCI and a complex and changing healthcare system. As the 50th anniversary of the National Cancer Act approaches in 2020, the process and these achievements are at risk of being taken for granted or lost in the flow of history. Documenting the process, milestones, and key players provides insight and guidance for continuing to improve cancer care, advance research, and reduce cancer incidence and mortality. Cancer care is a microcosm of the larger healthcare system providing insight and lessons on the importance of developing and maintaining a research infrastructure and the role of multi- level collaboration and partnerships involving both the private and public sectors.","Kaluzny, Arnold D.; O'Brien, Donna M.",Health Policy Open,38,24

Meanwhile, the virus is sweeping all around the world and has infected millions of people. Fever and pulmonary symptoms have been noticed as major and early signs of infection, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms were also observed in a significant portion of patients. The clinical investigation of disease onset was underestimated, especially due to the neglection of cases presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. AIM: To characterize the clinical features of coronavirus-infected patients with gastrointestinal symptoms as initial symptoms. METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-center case series of the general consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Wuhan Union Hospital from February 2, 2020 to February 13, 2020. According to their initial symptoms, these patients were classified into two groups. Patients in group one presented with pulmonary symptoms (PS) as initial symptoms, and group two presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (GS). Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Among the 50 patients recruited, no patient has been admitted to intensive care units, and no patient died during the study. The duration of hospitalization was longer in the GS group than in the PS group (12.13 ± 2.44 vs 10.00 ± 2.13, P < 0.01). All of the 50 patients exhibited decreased lymphocytes. However, lymphocytes in the GS group were significantly lower compared to those in the PS group (0.94 ± 0.06 vs 1.04 ± 0.15, P < 0.01). Procalcitonin and hs-CRP were both significantly higher in the GS group than in the PS group. Accordingly, the duration of viral shedding was significantly longer in the GS group compared to the PS group (10.22 ± 1.93 vs 8.15 ± 1.87, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms as initial symptoms need more days of viral shedding and hospitalization than the patients presenting with pulmonary symptoms.","Yang, Tuo-Yun; Li, Yuan-Chao; Wang, Si-Cong; Dai, Qing-Qing; Jiang, Xue-Song; Zuo, Shu; Jia, Liu; Zheng, Jun-Bo; Wang, Hong-Liang",World J Clin Cases,38,20

METHODS: Samples were collected from 136 patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pneumonia admitted to the Shanghai public health clinical center (116 mild, 20 severe). The concentrations of serum urea, Uric Acid (UA), Creatinine (CREA), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and urine protein (Pro) have been tested in this study. RESULTS: Higher levels of urea (female 7.00 ± 3.31, male 8.87 ± 5.18) Pro (female7/7, male 12/13), hs‐CRP (female 2/7, male 5/13) ESR (female 94.43 ± 33.26, male 67.85 ± 22.77) were found in severe patients compared with the mild (urea: female 3.71 ± 1.00, male 4.42 ± 1.14; Pro: female 3/46, male 12/70; hs‐CRP: female 1/46, male 3/70; ESR: female 43.32 ± 33.24, male 21.64 ± 21.82). UA is lower in the severe group (female 146.90 ± 54.01, male 139.34 ± 66.95) than in mild group (female 251.99 ± 64.35, male 339.81 ± 71.32). CREA and PCT did not show a significant difference between mild and severe patients, but the difference among the five biological markers (urea, Pro, hs‐CRP, ESR, and UA) between mild and severe patients we tested was small (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Severe COVID‐19 patients had higher levels of urea and Pro, while their UA levels were lower, reflecting poor kidney function in severe patients. However, higher levels of hs‐CRP, ESR indicated that inflammatory responses were more active in severe patients.","Gao, Menglu; Wang, Qianying; Wei, Jianhao; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Li, Haicong",J Clin Lab Anal,38,20

We conducted a detailed analysis of OTDs as part of 2 seroepidemiological investigations of COVID-19 outbreaks. METHODS: Two retrospective cohort studies were conducted in a high school and primary schools of Northern France following a COVID-19 epidemic in February-March 2020. Students, their relatives, and school staff were included. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were identified using a flow-cytometry-based assay detecting anti-S IgG. RESULTS: Among 2,004 participants (median [IQR] age: 31 [11–43] years), 303 (15.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. OTDs were present in 91 (30.0%) and 92 (30.3%) of them, respectively, and had 85.1 and 78.0% positive predictive values for SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively. In seropositive participants, OTDs were independently associated with an age above 18 years, female gender, fatigue, and headache. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the higher frequency of OTDs in females than males and adults than children. Their high predictive value for the diagnosis of COVID-19 suggests that they should be systematically searched for in patients with respiratory symptoms, fever, or headache. The association of OTDs with headache, not previously reported, suggests that they share a common mechanism, which deserves further investigation.","Galmiche, Simon; Bruel, Timothée; Madec, Yoann; Tondeur, Laura; Grzelak, Ludivine; Staropoli, Isabelle; Cailleau, Isabelle; Ungeheuer, Marie-Noëlle; Renaudat, Charlotte; Fernandes Pellerin, Sandrine; Hoen, Bruno; Schwartz, Olivier; Fontanet, Arnaud",Neuroepidemiology,38,32

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to analyse the Covid-19 preventive behaviour and the socio-economic drivers behind the health-response behaviour. DATA: The study employs data from waves 1 and 2 of South Africa’s nationally representative National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS)—Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (CRAM). The nationally representative panel data has a sample of 7073 individuals in Wave 1 and 5676 individuals in Wave 2. METHODS: The study uses bivariate statistics, concentration indices and multivariate estimation techniques, ranging from a probit, control-function approach, special-regressor method and seemingly unrelated regression to account for endogeneity while identifying the drivers of the response behaviour. FINDINGS: The findings indicate enhanced behavioural responsiveness to Covid-19. Preventive behaviour is evolving over time; the use of face mask has overtaken handwashing as the most utilised preventive measure. Other measures, like social distancing, avoiding close contact, avoiding big groups and staying at home, have declined between the two periods of the study. There is increased risk perception with significant concentration among the higher income groups, the educated and older respondents. Our findings validate the health-belief model, with perceived risk, self-efficacy, perceived awareness and barriers to preventive strategy adoption identified as significant drivers of health-response behaviour. Measures such as social distancing, avoiding close contact, and the use of sanitisers are practised more by the rich and educated, but not by the low-income respondents. CONCLUSION: The respondents from lower socio-economic backgrounds are associated with optimism bias and face barriers to the adoption of preventive strategies.

With the beginning of the space age in 1957, a new branch of geodesy was created, satellite geodesy. Only with satellites did geodesy become truly global. Oceans were no longer obstacles and the Earth as a whole could be observed and measured in consistent series of measurements. Of particular interest is the determination of the spatial structures and finally the temporal changes of the Earth's gravitational field. The knowledge of the gravitational field represents the natural bridge to the study of the physics of the Earth's interior, the circulation of our oceans and, more recently, the climate. Today, key findings on climate change are derived from the temporal changes in the gravitational field: on ice mass loss in Greenland and Antarctica, sea level rise and generally on changes in the global water cycle. This has only become possible with dedicated gravity satellite missions opening a method known as satellite gravimetry. In the first forty years of space age, satellite gravimetry was based on the analysis of the orbital motion of satellites. Due to the uneven distribution of observatories over the globe, the initially inaccurate measuring methods and the inadequacies of the evaluation models, the reconstruction of global models of the Earth's gravitational field was a great challenge. The transition from passive satellites for gravity field determination to satellites equipped with special sensor technology, which was initiated in the last decade of the twentieth century, brought decisive progress. In the chronological sequence of the launch of such new satellites, the history, mission objectives and measuring principles of the missions CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE flown since 2000 are outlined and essential scientific results of the individual missions are highlighted.

Holling type II function response is incorporated to address the predation rate as well as toxic substance distribution in zooplankton. It is also presumed that infected phytoplankton does recover from the viral infection. In the absence of time delay, stability and Hopf-bifurcation conditions are investigated to explore the system dynamics around all the possible equilibrium points. Further, in the presence of time delay, conditions for local stability are derived around the interior equilibria and the properties of the periodic solution are obtained by applying normal form theory and central manifold arguments. Computational simulation is performed to illustrate our theoretical findings. It is explored that system dynamics is very sensitive corresponding to carrying capacity and toxin liberation rate and able to generate chaos. Further, it is observed that time delay in the viral infection process can destabilize the phytoplankton density whereas zooplankton density remains in its old state. Incorporation of time delay also gives the scenario of double Hopf-bifurcation. Some control parameters are discussed to stabilize system dynamics. The effect of time delay on (i) growth rate of susceptible phytoplankton shows the extinction and double Hopf-bifurcation in the zooplankton population, (ii) a sufficiently large value of carrying capacity stabilizes the chaotic dynamics or makes the whole system chaotic with further increment.","Thakur, Nilesh Kumar; Srivastava, Smriti Chandra; Ojha, Archana",Iran J Sci Technol Trans A Sci,38,28

Several prediction models have been developed to explore the relationship between patients' covariates and survival. However, the high-dimensional genomic features limit the prediction performance of the survival model. Thus, an accurate and reliable prediction model is necessary for survival analysis using high-dimensional genomic data. RESULTS In this study, we proposed an improved survival prediction model based on XGBoost framework called XGBLC, which used Lasso-Cox to enhance the ability to analyze high-dimensional genomic data. The novel first and second order gradient statistics of Lasso-Cox were defined to construct the loss function of XGBLC. We extensively tested our XGBLC algorithm on both simulated and real world datasets, and estimated the performance of models with 5-fold cross-validation. Based on 20 cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), XGBLC outperforms five state-of-the-art survival methods in terms of C-index, Brier score and AUC. The results show that XGBLC still keeps good accuracy and robustness by comparing the performance on the simulated datasets with different scales. The developed prediction model would be beneficial for physicians to understand the effects of patient's genomic characteristics on survival and make personalized treatment decisions.

Vitamin D (VITD) deficiency has been suggested to alter SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and the course of disease. Thus, we aimed to investigate associations of VITD status to disease presentation within the CovILD registry. This prospective, multicenter, observational study on long-term sequelae includes patients with COVID-19 after hospitalization or outpatients with persistent symptoms. Eight weeks after PCR confirmed diagnosis, a detailed questionnaire, a clinical examination, and laboratory testing, including VITD status, were evaluated. Furthermore, available laboratory specimens close to hospital admission were used to retrospectively analyze 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at disease onset. A total of 109 patients were included in the analysis (60% males, 40% females), aged 58 ± 14 years. Eight weeks after the onset of COVID-19, a high proportion of patients presented with impaired VITD metabolism and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. PTH concentrations were increased in patients who needed intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, while VITD levels were not significantly different between disease severity groups. Low VITD levels at disease onset or at eight-week follow-up were not related to persistent symptom burden, lung function impairment, ongoing inflammation, or more severe CT abnormalities. VITD deficiency is frequent among COVID-19 patients but not associated with disease outcomes. However, individuals with severe disease display a disturbed parathyroid-vitamin-D axis within their recovery phase. The proposed significance of VITD supplementation in the clinical management of COVID-19 remains elusive.","Pizzini, Alex; Aichner, Magdalena; Sahanic, Sabina; Böhm, Anna; Egger, Alexander; Hoermann, Gregor; Kurz, Katharina; Widmann, Gerlig; Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa; Weiss, Günter; Tancevski, Ivan; Sonnweber, Thomas; Löffler-Ragg, Judith",Nutrients,38,16

In this review, we narrated the available data, from credible publishers, regarding the possible role of polyphenols and natural extracts-containing polyphenols in the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and their immune-boosting properties. It was revealed that polyphenols could be considered as promising biologically active substances for the prevention of COVID-19. The underlying potential mechanism behind this action is mostly due to the antiviral activities and the immune-regulation functions of polyphenols against COVID-19-infections. Antivirus polyphenolic-based medications can mitigate SARS-CoV-2-enzymes, which are vital for virus duplication and infection. It was also found that triterpenoid, anthraquinone, flavonoids, and tannins are possible keys to scheming antiviral therapies for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-proteases. The identified pharmacophore structures of polyphenols could be utilized in the explanation of novel anti-COVID-19 designs. The advantage of using mixtures containing polyphenols is related to the high-safety profile without having major side-effects, but further randomized controlled trials are required in the upcoming studies.","Mehany, Taha; Khalifa, Ibrahim; Barakat, Hassan; Althwab, Sami A.; Alharbi, Yousef M.; El-Sohaimy, Sobhy",Food Biosci,38,1

Studies on DC-SIGN function would be greatly aided by the establishment of a mouse model, however, it is unclear if the murine (m) homologue of human (h) DC-SIGN also binds to pathogens. Here, we investigated the interaction of mDC-SIGN, also termed CIRE, with the Ebolavirus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP), a ligand of hDC-SIGN. We found that mDC-SIGN neither binds EBOV-GP nor enhances infection by reporterviruses pseudotyped with EBOV-GP. Analysis of chimeras between mDC-SIGN and hDC-SIGN provided evidence that determinants in the carbohydrate recognition domain and in the neck domain of mDC-SIGN inhibit a functional interaction with EBOV-GP. Moreover, mDC-SIGN was found be monomeric, suggesting that lack of multimerization, which is believed to be required for efficient pathogen recognition by hDC-SIGN, might be one factor that prevents binding of mDC-SIGN to EBOV-GP. Our results suggest that mDC-SIGN on murine dendritic cells is not an adequate model for pathogen interactions with hDC-SIGN.","Gramberg, Thomas; Caminschi, Irina; Wegele, Anja; Hofmann, Heike; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Virology,38,18

The association between hepatic steatosis, which frequently accompanies obesity, and the pneumonia severity score (PSS) evaluated on computed tomography (CT), and the prevalence of steatosis in patients with COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. AIM: To assess the frequency of hepatic steatosis in the chest CT of COVID-19 patients and its association with the PSS. METHODS: The chest CT images of 485 patients who were admitted to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups as COVID-19-positive [CT- and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive] and controls (CT- and RT-PCR-negative). The CT images of both groups were evaluated for PSS as the ratio of the volume of involved lung parenchyma to the total lung volume. Hepatic steatosis was defined as a liver attenuation value of ≤ 40 Hounsfield units (HU). RESULTS: Of the 485 patients, 56.5% (n = 274) were defined as the COVID-19-positive group and 43.5% (n = 211) as the control group. The average age of the COVID-19-positive group was significantly higher than that of the control group (50.9 ± 10.9 years vs 40.4 ± 12.3 years, P < 0.001). The frequency of hepatic steatosis in the positive group was significantly higher compared with the control group (40.9% vs 19.4%, P < 0.001). The average hepatic attenuation values were significantly lower in the positive group compared with the control group (45.7 ± 11.4 HU vs 53.9 ± 15.9 HU, P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight, and obesity there was almost a 2.2 times greater odds of hepatic steatosis in the COVID-19-positive group than in the controls (odds ratio 2.187; 95% confidence interval: 1.336-3.580, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hepatic steatosis was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared with controls after adjustment for age and comorbidities.

In Africa, as of June 2, 2020, a total of 152,442 COVID-19 cases and 4334 deaths have been reported. The five countries with the highest commutative number of cases in Africa are South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria, and Ghana. Africa, together with the rest of world have had to swiftly undertake measures necessary to protect the continent from irreversible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that is claiming lives and destroying livelihoods. The lower number of COVID-19 cases in most African countries is attributed to inadequate health systems, low-to-absent testing capacity, poor reporting system and insufficient number of medical staff. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to most African countries from cities to rural areas and has created a strong demand on already scarce resources and requires an intense mobilization of additional resources to implement established emergency contingency measures. Closure of borders and movements of people restrictions within the country as measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19; this has resulted in the sector being adversely affected by the loss of income. Cooperative prevention and control measures are one of the promising solutions to deplete the spread of COVID-19 on the continent.","Rutayisire, Erigene; Nkundimana, Gerard; Mitonga, Honore K.; Boye, Alex; Nikwigize, Solange",Int J Infect Dis,38,16

The AGRI National Project’s online panel participants (N = 3449) provided baseline gambling data 6 months prior to the pandemic. Re-surveying this sample during the lockdown provided an opportunity to make quantitative comparisons of the changes. Nearly one-third of gamblers reported ceasing gambling altogether during the lockdown. For the continuing gamblers, quantitative data indicated significant decreases in gambling frequency, time spent in gambling sessions, money spent, and the number of game types played. Qualitative perceptions of changes in gambling were examined and the accuracy of these reports were not closely aligned with actual changes in gambling. Gambling platform was the only gambling engagement metric where increases were found with ~ 17% of the gambling sample migrating to online gambling during the lockdown. Although problem gambling within the sample generally declined, consistent with previous literature, it was also found that gambling online—among other biopsychosocial factors—was a significant predictor for classification as a problem gambler during the lockdown. COVID-specific influences on health, employment, leisure time and social isolation were moderately associated with problem gambling scores but were not independent predictors of changes in gambling engagement during lockdown. Future studies are required to assess if the pandemic related changes in gambling evidenced in this study remain stable, or if engagement reverts to pre-pandemic levels when the pandemic response allows for the re-opening of land-based gambling venues.","Shaw, Carrie A.; Hodgins, David C.; Williams, Robert J.; Belanger, Yale D.; Christensen, Darren R.; el-Guebaly, Nady; McGrath, Daniel S.; Nicoll, Fiona; Smith, Garry J.; Stevens, Rhys M.

It does so by binding to host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, leading to endocytosis with the receptor, and subsequently using the host cell’s machinery to replicate copies of itself and invade new cells. The extent of the spread of infection in the body is dependent on the pattern of ACE2 expression and overreaction of the immune system. Additionally, by inducing an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the loss of ACE2 would favour the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes in the lungs.

Our aim was to test the safety and feasibility of 5% CO(2) and 95% air inhalation to correct hypocapnia in mechanically ventilated infants with NE undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. METHODS: Ten infants were assigned to this open-label, single-center trial. The gas mixture of 5% CO(2) and 95% air was administered through patient circuits if the temperature-corrected PCO(2) ≤40 mm Hg. The CO(2) inhalation was continued for 12 h or was stopped earlier if the base deficit (BD) level decreased <5 mmol/L. Follow-up was performed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development II. RESULTS: The patients spent a median 95.1% (range 44.6–98.5%) of time in the desired PCO(2) range (40–60 mm Hg) during the inhalation. All PCO(2) values were >40 mm Hg, the lower value of the target range. Regression modeling revealed that BD and lactate had a tendency to decrease during the intervention (by 0.61 and 0.55 mmol/L/h, respectively), whereas pH remained stable. The rate of moderate disabilities and normal outcome was 50%.

At this time though there are guidelines and recommendations for medical management of these patients, there is a lack of guidance on how should a plastic surgeon approach the COVID-19 suspect or infected patient who presents either in elective or emergency setting. We aim to provide a consensus guideline based on the current recommendations of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the pooled experience of the major centers performing plastic and reconstructive surgery in India. METHODS: The current guidelines and recommendations on the COVID-19 pandemic were studied from both government and non-government sources including ICMR. The problems in the specialty of plastic surgery were categorized into four groups and for each group, separate and individual guidelines have been worked out. GUIDELINES: Consensus guidelines have been formulated for the specialty of Plastic and Reconstructive surgery. The patients requiring plastic surgery service have been categorized into four groups of acute, subacute, chronic and late category. Acute cases are the ones who require intervention within 24-48 hours. Subacute cases are the ones who require intervention in the next 3-10 days while the chronic are the ones who need plastic surgery preferably within a month. The late category are the ones who need surgery within the next six months. This has been done based on the urgency and priority of surgical intervention titrated against the risks of operating and inadvertently acquiring exposure of COVID-19 positive patients. CONCLUSION: Currently in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic there are no clear guidelines specific to the vast majority of patients who come for a plastic surgery intervention. This puts the patients at risk due to the impending plastic surgery problem while at the same time poses risk of exposure to COVID-19 for the surgical team. A consensus guidelines are presented to steer the plastic surgeon in his work in the wake of COVID-19 crisis. The guidelines are based on firm scientific evidence from the reputed research and regulatory bodies and have been made in consonance with plastic surgery experts around the country so that these practices best suit the needs of the patients while being mindful of resource limitations and infection risks. The approach of “delayed conservative treatment” works best in present case scenario.","Agarwal, Rajiv; Singhal, Maneesh; Shankhdhar, Vinay Kant; Chittoria, Ravi Kumar; Sahu, Ranjit Kumar; Singh, Veena; Chandra, Ramesh",J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,38,22

Methods: This retrospective study included 282 patients with COVID-19. The PNI score of all patients, 147 of whom were male, with a mean age of 56.4±15.3 years, was calculated. According to the PNI score, the patients with normal and mild malnutrition constituted group-1 (n=159) and the patients with moderate-to-severe and serious malnutrition constituted group-2 (n=123). Results: The PNI score was correlated with age (r=-0.146, p=0.014); oxygen saturation (r=0.190, p=0.001); heart rate (r=-0.117, p=0.05); hospitalization duration (r=-0.266, p<0.001); white blood cells (r=0.156, p=0.009); hemoglobin (r=0.307, p<0.001); C-reactive protein (CRP) (r=-0.346, p<0.001); creatinine (r=-0.184, p=0.002); D-dimer (r=-0.304, p<0.001); ferritin (r=-0.283, p<0.001); procalcitonin (r=-0.287, p<0.001); the confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age ≥65 years score (r=-0.217, p<0.001); and the quick sequential organ failure assessment score (r=-0.261, p<0.001) in patients with COVID-19. Mortality was significantly higher in Group 2 (p<0.001). Survival was significantly higher if PNI score was >41.2 (p<0.001, sensitivity: 78.7% and specificity: 84.2%). In multivariate regression analysis, among various other parameters, only PNI score and oxygen saturation had a significant effect on the disease course (p=0.02 and p=0.045, respectively). Conclusion: PNI, calculated from the serum albumin concentration and total lymphocyte count, is a simple and objective indicator that assesses the immune nutritional status of patients with COVID-19. The presence of malnutrition has a high predictive value in predicting the severity of COVID-19. Our data suggest that the PNI might be useful for risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice.","Ekinci, Iskender; Uzun, Hafize; Utku, Irem Kirac; Ozkan, Hanise; Buyukkaba, Mitat; Cinar, Ahmet; Akarsu, Murat; Kumbasar, Abdulbaki; Tabak, Omur",Int. j. vitam. nutr. res,38,16

However, their bioavailability remains to be improved compared with that of chemical drugs. Here, we screened and identified a new peptide, Ctry2459, from a scorpion venom peptide library that was proven to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection via inactivating infectious viral particles. However, Ctry2459 cannot suppress established infection of HCV because of the poor cellular uptake and restriction of endosomes. Based on the molecular template of the Ctry2459 peptide, we designed two histidine-rich peptides (Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3) with significantly enhanced cellular uptake and improved intracellular distribution. Moreover, the two mutated peptides, as well as the wild-type peptide Ctry2459, exhibited virucidal activities against HCV. In distinct contrast to the Ctry2459 peptide, the mutated peptides significantly suppressed the established HCV infection at the cellular level but demonstrated lower cytotoxic and hemolytic activities. Our work presents an effective design strategy for optimizing natural antiviral peptides and opens a new avenue for enhancing the bioavailability of peptide drugs.","Hong, Wei; Zhang, Runhong; Di, Zhiyong; He, Yawen; Zhao, Zhenhuan; Hu, Jun; Wu, Yingliang; Li, Wenxin; Cao, Zhijian",Biomaterials,38,1

Despite non-pharmaceutical interventions as social distance, mask-wearing, and restrictive lockdown, the daily confirmed cases remain growing. Vaccine developments from Pfizer, Moderna, and Gamaleya Institute reach more than 90% efficacy and sustain the vaccination campaigns in multiple countries. However, natural and vaccine-induced immunity responses remain poorly understood. There are great expectations, but the new SARS-CoV-2 variants demand to inquire if the vaccines will be highly protective or induce permanent immunity. Further, in the first quarter of 2021, vaccine supply is scarce. Consequently, some countries that are applying the Pfizer vaccine will delay its second required dose. Likewise, logistic supply, economic and political implications impose a set of grand challenges to develop vaccination policies. Therefore, health decision-makers require tools to evaluate hypothetical scenarios and evaluate admissible responses. Following some of the WHO-SAGE recommendations, we formulate an optimal control problem with mixed constraints to describe vaccination schedules. Our solution identifies vaccination policies that minimize the burden of COVID-19 quantified by the number of disability-adjusted years of life lost. These optimal policies ensure the vaccination coverage of a prescribed population fraction in a given time horizon and preserve hospitalization occupancy below a risk level. We explore via simulation plausible scenarios regarding efficacy, coverage, vaccine-induced, and natural immunity. Our simulations suggest that response regarding vaccine-induced immunity and reinfection periods would play a dominant role in mitigating COVID-19.","Acuña-Zegarra, Manuel Adrian; Díaz-Infante, Saúl; Baca-Carrasco, David; Liceaga, Daniel Olmos",Math Biosci,38,8

Patients and Methods Retrospective, cohort study of 140 patients with moderate-to-critical COVID-19 associated pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation admitted from January 28th, 2020 to February 28th, 2020, and followed up through March, 13th 2020 in Union Hospital, Wuhan, China. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and other measures were tested as predictors of in-hospital mortality in survival analysis. Results Of 140 patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, 51.4% were men, with a median age of 60 years. Patients with SpO2 ≤90% were older, more likely to be men, to have hypertension and to present with dyspnea than those with SpO2 >90%. Overall, 36 (25.7%) patients died during hospitalization after a median 14-day follow-up. Higher post-oxygen supplementation SpO2 levels were associated with reduced mortality independently of age and sex (hazard ratio per 1-unit SpO2 0.93, 95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.95, P < .001). SpO2 cutoff of 90.5% yielded 84.6% sensitivity and 97.2% specificity for prediction of survival. Dyspnea was also independently associated with death in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 2.60; 95% confidence interval 1.24-5.43, P = .01). Conclusions In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, hypoxemia was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. These results may help guide clinical management of severe COVID-19 patients, particularly in settings requiring strategic allocation of limited critical care resources.","Xie, Jiang; Covassin, Naima; Fan, Zhengyang; Singh, Prachi; Gao, Wei; Li, Guangxi; Kara, Tomas; Somers, Virend K.",Mayo Clin Proc,38,1

In the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the gag and pol genes overlap by 241 nucleotides with pol in the -1 phase with respect to gag. The gag-pol fusion is produced via a -1 ribosomal frameshifting event that brings the overlapping, out-of-phase gag and pol genes into translational phase. Frameshifting occurs at a so called 'shift site' 8-10 nucleotides upstream of a hairpin loop which may play a role in the regulation of frameshifting. We have fused this region of HIV-1 to the 5' end of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in order to quantitatively measure ribosomal frameshifting both in cells and by in vitro translation. A series of 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides was designed to specifically bind the sequences which flank the gag-pol hairpin. Ribosomal frameshifting is enhanced up to 6 fold by those oligonucleotides which bind the area just 3 to the stem. Oligonucleotides which bind 5' to the stem have no effect on frameshift efficiency. In addition, we have constructed a series of fusion genes which mimic the effect of the bound oligonucleotides with intramolecular hairpins. The results suggest that increasing RNA secondary structure downstream of the shift site increases the frequency of ribosomal frameshifting, and that this effect can be mimicked by antisense oligonucleotides.","Vickers, T A; Ecker, D J",Nucleic acids research,38,24

Aims To review studies reporting GI symptoms among COVID-19 patients. Results Fifteen papers (2800 patients) were identified. Frequency of GI symptoms varied from 3.0% to 39.6%, including diarrhea: 7.5%, nausea: 4.5%, anorexia: 4.4%, vomiting: 1.3%, abdominal pain: 0.5%, belching/reflux: 0.3%. These may be the first manifestation of COVID-19, however, there is controversy whether these reflect better or worst prognosis. Finally, the potential relationship with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor in the digestive tract as the virus entry route, is discussed. Conclusions GI symptoms may be common in COVID-19 may be the first manifestation before fever and respiratory symptoms. Therefore, clinicians and gastroenterologists need to be aware of these atypical cases during the current pandemic and of the fecal–oral transmission, and preventive measures may be implemented.","Schmulson, M.; Dávalos, F.; Berumen, J.",,38,1

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished empirical studies, either observational or interventional, analysing the comparative effectiveness of NPIs against the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched Embase/Medline and medRxiv to identify the relevant literature. RESULTS: We identified 34 studies. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, school closing was the most effective NPI, followed by workplace closing, business and venue closing and public event bans. Public information campaigns and mask wearing requirements were also effective in controlling the pandemic while being less disruptive for the population than other NPIs. There was no evidence on the effectiveness of public transport closure, testing and contact tracing strategies and quarantining or isolation of individuals. Early implementation was associated with a higher effectiveness in reducing COVID-19 cases and deaths, while general stringency of the NPIs was not. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we found that school closing, followed by workplace closing, business and venue closing and public event bans were the most effective NPIs in controlling the spread of COVID-19. An early response and a combination of specific social distancing measures are effective at reducing COVID-19 cases and deaths. Continuous monitoring of NPIs effectiveness is needed in order to adapt decision making.","Mendez-Brito, Alba; Bcheraoui, Charbel El; Pozo-Martin, Francisco",J Infect,38,16

MAIN: SARS-CoV-2 stimulates humoral and cellular immunity systems, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear NF-kB signalling pathways, which regulate inflammatory gene expression and immune cell differentiation. The result is pro-inflammatory cytokines release, hyperinflammatory condition, and cytokine storm, which provoke severe lung alterations that can lead to multi-organ failure in COVID-19. Multiple genetic and immunologic factors may contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in African individuals when compared to the rest of the global population. In this article, the role of malaria, NF-kB and MAPK pathways, caspase-12 expression, high level of LAIR-1-containing antibodies, and differential glycophorins (GYPA/B) expression in COVID-19 are discussed. CONCLUSION: Understanding pathophysiological mechanisms can help identify target points for drugs and vaccines development against COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores this link and proposes a biological and molecular answer to the epidemiologic discrepancy in COVID-19 in Africa.","Altable, Marcos; de la Serna, Juan Moisés",Virus Res,38,24

METHODS: This was a retrospective multi-centre study, which included patients who sustained fractures between 20 January and 19 February 2020. The collected data included patients’ demographics (age and gender), injury-related (injury type, fracture location, injury mechanism, places where fracture occurred), and treatment modality. SPSS 23.0 was used to describe the data and perform some analysis. RESULTS: A total of 436 patients with 453 fractures were included; there were 153 males and 283 females, with an average age of 76.2 years (standard deviation, SD, 7.7 years; 65 to 105). For either males or females, 70–74 years was the most commonly involved age group. A total of 317 (72.7%) patients had their fractures occurring at home. Among 453 fractures, there were 264 (58.3%) hip fractures, accounting for 58.3%. Fall from standing height was the most common cause of fracture, making a proportion of 89.4% (405/453). Most fractures (95.8%, 434/453) were treated surgically, and 4.2% (19/453) were treated by plaster fixation or traction. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was the most used surgical method, taking a proportion of 49.2% (223/453). CONCLUSION: These findings highlighted the importance of primary prevention (home prevention) measures and could be used for references for individuals, health care providers, or health administrative department during the global pandemic of COVID-19.","Zhu, Yanbin; Chen, Wei; Xin, Xing; Yin, Yingchao; Hu, Jinglve; Lv, Hongzhi; Li, Weixu; Deng, Xiangtian; Zhu, Chao; Zhu, Jian; Zhang, Jinli; Ye, Fagang; Chen, Aimin; Wu, Zhanyong; Ma, Zhanbei; Zhang, Xinhu; Gao, Fengmei; Li, Jidong; Wang, Conglin; Zhang, Yingze; Hou, Zhiyong",Int Orthop,38,13

The proper assembly and integrity of the nucleolus reflects the accurate synthesis and processing of rRNAs which in turn, as major components of ribosomes, ensure the uninterrupted flow of the genetic information during translation. Therefore, the abundant production of rRNAs in a precisely functional nucleolus is of outmost importance for the cell viability and requires the concerted action of essential enzymes, associated factors and epigenetic marks. The coordination and regulation of such an elaborate process depends on not only protein factors, but also on numerous regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Herein, we focus on RNA-mediated mechanisms that control the synthesis, processing and modification of rRNAs in mammals. We highlight the significance of regulatory ncRNAs in rRNA biogenesis and the maintenance of the nucleolar morphology, as well as their role in human diseases and as novel druggable molecular targets.","Kaliatsi, Eleni G.; Giarimoglou, Nikoleta; Stathopoulos, Constantinos; Stamatopoulou, Vassiliki",Int J Mol Sci,38,20

Respiratory involvement, the main symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection, means that other manifestations, such as neurological, take a back seat, with the consequent delay in diagnosis and treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All COVID-19 patients admitted with neurological symptoms or diagnosed with encephalitis since March 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Zaragoza, Spain. RESULTS: Two patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal PCR and whose clinical picture consisted of neurological alterations compatible with encephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microbiology was negative for bacteria and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 but, given the clinical suspicion of encephalitis due to the latter, antiviral treatment with immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis was started early. Despite this, the evolution was not satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 encephalitis is a recently described clinical entity, whose pathophysiology is still unknown and no treatment with clinical evidence is available to date.","Lozano Gómez, Herminia; Pascual Bielsa, Ana; Abansés Moreno, Paula; Luque Gómez, María Pilar; Matute Guerrero, Almudena; Araiz Burdio, Juan José",Med Clin (Engl Ed),38,16

In an extraordinary feat of engineering, the conference centre floor was transformed within a matter of weeks into wards with piped oxygen at each bed. Whilst the emergency medicine specialists took the lead in designing and commissioning the facility, the medical management and staff were drawn mostly from family physicians. This report is a short reflection on the experience of the first 4 weeks of managing patients in this repurposed space. Our insights evolved during various formal and informal learning conversations as the in-patient service became more organised over time. We hope that these insights, as well as the process of reaching them, will assist other colleagues in serving their communities during this difficult moment in history; moreover, it may reflect a renewed appreciation for team-based interdisciplinary efforts in achieving person-centred care.","Reid, Steve; Ras, Tasleem; von Pressentin, Klaus",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,38,24

To reduce the barriers and increase actionable reporting of mistreatment, we integrated peer-facilitated learning environment sessions led by a group of trained third- and fourth-year medical students in all core clinical clerkships. METHODS: During the 2018–2019 academic year, third-year medical students were recruited, oriented, and trained to act as facilitators of sessions on mistreatment. The sessions occurred once every clerkship block, using a standardized session introduction and guide. After a 6-month pilot, new medical students were recruited and worked as scribe/facilitator pairs, receiving an additional 1.5-hour training midyear, which was evaluated with a postworkshop survey. RESULTS: Thirty-eight students implemented 43 peer-facilitated sessions and completed deidentified minutes of each session, which were shared with clerkship directors and the Medical Education Office for review. Survey data from midyear facilitator training indicated that facilitators highly agreed peer-led sessions were an important avenue for students to process experiences of mistreatment (3.9 out of 4), understood barriers to reporting (3.8 out of 4) and definitions of mistreatment (3.6 out of 4), and felt confident to facilitate these sessions (3.6 out of 4). DISCUSSION: Peer-facilitated sessions offer a method to learn more about student experiences with mistreatment in real time and create a new avenue for communication between faculty and students. Assembling a stable core team of third- and fourth-year students trained in facilitation skills ensures the sustainability and relevance of the program.","Randolph, Martine N.; Erb, Emily Cokorinos; Garg, Priya S.; Thompson, Rachel; Cohen-Osher, Molly",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,38,26
