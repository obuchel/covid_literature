292,Non-Hemagglutinating Flaviviruses: Molecular Mechanisms for the Emergence of New Strains via Adaptation to European Ticks,2009-10-05,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes human epidemics across Eurasia. Clinical manifestations range from inapparent infections and fevers to fatal encephalitis but the factors that determine disease severity are currently undefined. TBEV is characteristically a hemagglutinating (HA) virus; the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes tentatively reflects virion receptor/fusion activity. However, for the past few years many atypical HA-deficient strains have been isolated from patients and also from the natural European host tick, Ixodes persulcatus. By analysing the sequences of HA-deficient strains we have identified 3 unique amino acid substitutions (D67G, E122G or D277A) in the envelope protein, each of which increases the net charge and hydrophobicity of the virion surface. Therefore, we genetically engineered virus mutants each containing one of these 3 substitutions; they all exhibited HA-deficiency. Unexpectedly, each genetically modified non-HA virus demonstrated increased TBEV reproduction in feeding Ixodes ricinus, not the recognised tick host for these strains. Moreover, virus transmission efficiency between infected and uninfected ticks co-feeding on mice was also intensified by each substitution. Retrospectively, the mutation D67G was identified in viruses isolated from patients with encephalitis. We propose that the emergence of atypical Siberian HA-deficient TBEV strains in Europe is linked to their molecular adaptation to local ticks. This process appears to be driven by the selection of single mutations that change the virion surface thus enhancing receptor/fusion function essential for TBEV entry into the unfamiliar tick species. As the consequence of this adaptive mutagenesis, some of these mutations also appear to enhance the ability of TBEV to cross the human blood-brain barrier, a likely explanation for fatal encephalitis. Future research will reveal if these emerging Siberian TBEV strains continue to disperse westwards across Europe by adaptation to the indigenous tick species and if they are associated with severe forms of TBE.","Khasnatinov, Maxim A.; Ustanikova, Katarina; Frolova, Tatiana V.; Pogodina, Vanda V.; Bochkova, Nadezshda G.; Levina, Ludmila S.; Slovak, Mirko; Kazimirova, Maria; Labuda, Milan; Klempa, Boris; Eleckova, Elena; Gould, Ernest A.; Gritsun, Tamara S.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2750751/,138
398,Neutralization of X4- and R5-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 variants by HOCl-modified serum albumins,2010-06-02,"BACKGROUND: Myeloperoxidase (MPO), an important element of the microbicidal activity of neutrophils, generates hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from H(2)O(2 )and chloride, which is released into body fluids. Besides its direct microbicidal activity, HOCl can react with amino acid residues and HOCl-modified proteins can be detected in vivo. FINDINGS: This report is based on binding studies of HOCl-modified serum albumins to HIV-1 gp120 and three different neutralization assays using infectious virus. The binding studies were carried out by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and by standard ELISA techniques. Virus neutralization assays were carried out using HIV-1 NL4-3 virus and recombinant strains with CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptor usage. Viral infection was monitored by a standard p24 or X-gal staining assay. Our data demonstrate that HOCl-modified mouse-, bovine- and human serum albumins all bind to the HIV-1 NL4-3 gp120 (LAV) glycoprotein in contrast to non-modified albumin. Binding of HOCl-modified albumin to gp120 correlated to the blockade of CD4 as well as that of V3 loop specific monoclonal antibody binding. In neutralization experiments, HOCl-modified serum albumins inhibited replication and syncytium formation of the X4- and R5-tropic NL4-3 isolates in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that HOCl-modified serum albumin veils the binding site for CD4 and the V3 loop on gp120. Such masking of the viral gp120/gp41 envelope complex might be a simple but promising strategy to inactivate HIV-1 and therefore prevent infection when HOCl-modified serum albumin is applied, for example, as a topical microbicide.","Polzer, Svenja; van Yperen, Melanie; Kirst, Martin; Schwalbe, Birco; Schaal, Heiner; Schreiber, Michael",BMC Res Notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2887905/,138
460,On epidemic modeling in real time: An application to the 2009 Novel A (H1N1) influenza outbreak in Canada,2010-11-05,"BACKGROUND: Management of emerging infectious diseases such as the 2009 influenza pandemic A (H1N1) poses great challenges for real-time mathematical modeling of disease transmission due to limited information on disease natural history and epidemiology, stochastic variation in the course of epidemics, and changing case definitions and surveillance practices. FINDINGS: The Richards model and its variants are used to fit the cumulative epidemic curve for laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) infections in Canada, made available by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The model is used to obtain estimates for turning points in the initial outbreak, the basic reproductive number (R(0)), and for expected final outbreak size in the absence of interventions. Confirmed case data were used to construct a best-fit 2-phase model with three turning points. R(0 )was estimated to be 1.30 (95% CI 1.12-1.47) for the first phase (April 1 to May 4) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.16-1.54) for the second phase (May 4 to June 19). Hospitalization data were also used to fit a 1-phase model with R(0 )= 1.35 (1.20-1.49) and a single turning point of June 11. CONCLUSIONS: Application of the Richards model to Canadian pH1N1 data shows that detection of turning points is affected by the quality of data available at the time of data usage. Using a Richards model, robust estimates of R(0 )were obtained approximately one month after the initial outbreak in the case of 2009 A (H1N1) in Canada.","Hsieh, Ying-Hen; Fisman, David N; Wu, Jianhong",BMC Res Notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989981/,138
833,Genome Stability of Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Based on Analysis of Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase Genes,2012-04-26,"Influenza A virus (H1N1), which arose in 2009, constituted the fourth pandemic after the cases of 1918, 1957, and 1968. This new variant was formed by a triple reassortment, with genomic segments from swine, avian, and human influenza origins. The objective of this study was to analyze sequences of hemagglutinin (n=2038) and neuraminidase (n=1273) genes, in order to assess the extent of diversity among circulating 2009-2010 strains, estimate if these genes evolved through positive, negative, or neutral selection models of evolution during the pandemic phase, and analyze the worldwide percentage of detection of important amino acid mutations that could enhance the viral performance, such as transmissibility or resistance to drugs. A continuous surveillance by public health authorities will be critical to monitor the appearance of new influenza variants, especially in animal reservoirs such as swine and birds, in order to prevent the potential animal-human transmission of viruses with pandemic potential.","Espínola, Emilio E",Open Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3349948/,138
878,"Differential Seroprevalence of Human Bocavirus Species 1-4 in Beijing, China",2012-06-22,"BACKGROUND: Four species of human bocaviruses (HBoV1-4) have been identified based on phylogenetic analysis since its first report in 2005. HBoV1 has been associated with respiratory disease, whereas HBoV2-4 are mainly detected in enteric infections. Although the prevalence of HBoVs in humans has been studied in some regions, it has not been well addressed globally. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cross-reactivity of anti-VP2 antibodies was detected between HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 in mouse and human serum. The prevalence of specific anti-VP2 IgG antibodies against HBoV1-4 was determined in different age groups of healthy individuals aged 0-70 years old in Beijing, China, using a competition ELISA assay based on virus-like particles of HBoV1-4. The seroprevalence of HBoV1-4 was 50%, 36.9%, 28.7%, and 0.8%, respectively, in children aged 0-14 years (n = 244); whereas the seroprevalence of HBoV1-4 was 66.9%, 49.3%, 38.7% and 1.4%, respectively, in healthy adults (≥15 years old; n = 142). The seropositive rate of HBoV1 was higher than that of HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 in individuals older than 0.5 years. Furthermore, IgG seroconversion of HBoV1 (10/31, 32.3%), HBoV2 (8/31, 25.8%), and HBoV3 (2/31, 6.5%) was found in paired sera collected from children with respiratory tract infections who were positive for HBoV1 according to PCR analysis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that HBoV1 is more prevalent than HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 in the population we sampled in Beijing, China, suggesting that HBoV species may play differential roles in disease.","Guo, Li; Wang, Yaying; Zhou, Hongli; Wu, Chao; Song, Jingdong; Li, Jianguo; Paranhos-Baccalà, Gláucia; Vernet, Guy; Wang, Jianwei; Hung, Tao",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3382199/,138
951,"Genetic Variation in the TNF Gene Is Associated with Susceptibility to Severe Sepsis, but Not with Mortality",2012-09-27,"BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor superfamily (TNFR)-mediated immune response play an essential role in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis. Studies examining associations of TNF and lymphotoxin-α (LTA) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with severe sepsis have produced conflicting results. The objective of this study was to investigate whether genetic variation in TNF, LTA, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B was associated with susceptibility to or death from severe sepsis in Chinese Han population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ten SNPs in TNF, LTA, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B were genotyped in samples of patients with severe sepsis (n = 432), sepsis (n = 384) and healthy controls (n = 624). Our results showed that rs1800629, a SNP in the promoter region of TNF, was significantly associated with risk for severe sepsis. The minor allele frequency of rs1800629 was significantly higher in severe sepsis patients than that in both healthy controls (P(adj) = 0.00046, odds ratio (OR)(adj) = 1.92) and sepsis patients (P(adj) = 0.002, OR(adj) = 1.56). Further, we investigated the correlation between rs1800629 genotypes and TNF-α concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy volunteers exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) ex vivo, and the association between rs1800629 and TNF-α serum levels in severe sepsis patients. After exposure to LPS, the TNF-α concentration in culture supernatants of PBMCs was significantly higher in the subjects with AA+AG genotypes than that with GG genotype (P = 0.007). Moreover, in patients with severe sepsis, individuals with AA+AG genotypes had significantly higher TNF-α serum concentrations than those with GG genotype (P(adj) = 0.02). However, there were no significant associations between SNPs in the four candidate genes and 30 day mortality for patients with severe sepsis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggested that the functional TNF gene SNP rs1800629 was strongly associated with susceptibility to severe sepsis, but not with lethality in Chinese Han population.","Song, Zhenju; Song, Yuanlin; Yin, Jun; Shen, Yao; Yao, Chenling; Sun, Zhan; Jiang, Jinjun; Zhu, Duming; Zhang, Yong; Shen, Qinjun; Gao, Lei; Tong, Chaoyang; Bai, Chunxue",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3459853/,138
987,Reproductive Number and Serial Interval of the First Wave of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus in South Africa,2012-11-16,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Describing transmissibility parameters of past pandemics from diverse geographic sites remains critical to planning responses to future outbreaks. We characterize the transmissibility of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (hereafter pH1N1) in South Africa during 2009 by estimating the serial interval (SI), the initial effective reproductive number (initial R(t)) and the temporal variation of R(t). METHODS: We make use of data from a central registry of all pH1N1 laboratory-confirmed cases detected throughout South Africa. Whenever date of symptom onset is missing, we estimate it from the date of specimen collection using a multiple imputation approach repeated 100 times for each missing value. We apply a likelihood-based method (method 1) for simultaneous estimation of initial R(t) and the SI; estimate initial R(t) from SI distributions established from prior field studies (method 2); and the Wallinga and Teunis method (method 3) to model the temporal variation of R(t). RESULTS: 12,360 confirmed pH1N1 cases were reported in the central registry. During the period of exponential growth of the epidemic (June 21 to August 3, 2009), we simultaneously estimate a mean R(t) of 1.47 (95% CI: 1.30–1.72) and mean SI of 2.78 days (95% CI: 1.80–3.75) (method 1). Field studies found a mean SI of 2.3 days between primary cases and laboratory-confirmed secondary cases, and 2.7 days when considering both suspected and confirmed secondary cases. Incorporating the SI estimate from field studies using laboratory-confirmed cases, we found an initial R(t) of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.38–1.49) (method 2). The mean R(t) peaked at 2.91 (95% CI: 0.85–2.91) on June 21, as the epidemic commenced, and R(t)>1 was sustained until August 22 (method 3). CONCLUSIONS: Transmissibility characteristics of pH1N1 in South Africa are similar to estimates reported by countries outside of Africa. Estimations using the likelihood-based method are in agreement with field findings.","Archer, Brett N.; Tempia, Stefano; White, Laura F.; Pagano, Marcello; Cohen, Cheryl",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3500305/,138
1050,Lung tissue bioenergetics and caspase activity in rodents,2013-01-12,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to establish a suitable in vitro system for investigating effects of respiratory pathogens and toxins on lung tissue bioenergetics (cellular respiration and ATP content) and caspase activity. Wistar rats and C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized by sevoflurane inhalation. Lung fragments were then collected and incubated at 37°C in a continuously gassed (with 95% O(2):5% CO(2)) Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) or Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Phosphorescence O(2) analyzer that measured dissolved O(2) concentration as a function of time was used to monitor the rate of cellular mitochondrial O(2) consumption. Cellular ATP content was measured using the luciferin/luciferase system. The caspase-3 substrate N-acetyl-asp-glu-val-asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) was used to monitor intracellular caspase activity; cleaved AMC moieties (reflecting caspase activity) were separated on HPLC and detected by fluorescence. Lung histology and immunostaining with anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody were also performed. RESULTS: For Wistar rats, the values of k(c) and ATP for 0 < t ≤ 7 h (mean ± SD) were 0.15 ± 0.02 μM O(2) min(-1) mg(-1) (n = 18, coefficient of variation, Cv = 13%) and 131 ± 69 pmol mg(-1) (n = 16, Cv = 53%), respectively. The AMC peak areas remained relatively small despite a ~5-fold rise over 6 h. Good tissue preservation was evident despite time-dependent increases in apoptotic cells. Lung tissue bioenergetics, caspase activity and structure were deleterious in unoxygenated or intermittently oxygenated solutions. Incubating lung tissue in O(2) depleted MEM for 30 min or anesthesia by urethane had no effect on lung bioenergetics, but produced higher caspase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Lung tissue bioenergetics and structure could be maintained in vitro in oxygenated buffer for several hours and, thus, used as biomarkers for investigating respiratory pathogens or toxins.","Alsuwaidi, Ahmed R; Alsamri, Mohammed T; Alfazari, Ali S; Almarzooqi, Saeeda; Albawardi, Alia; Othman, Aws R; Pramathan, Thachillath; Hartwig, Stacey M; Varga, Steven M; Souid, Abdul-Kader",BMC Res Notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557141/,138
1084,Anti-radiation damage effect of polyethylenimine as a toll-like receptor 5 targeted agonist,2012-10-26,"A number of agents are now available for use in protecting against ionizing radiation. These radiation-protective agents, however, have many adverse effects. Efforts have been made to develop new radiation-protective agents for medical application. Here, we investigated whether a compound, polyethylenimine (PEI), which activates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)-mediated NF-kB signaling pathways, could have an anti-radiation effect on a mouse model. First, a cell-based screening model for an agonist of TLR5-mediated NF-kB pathway was established and then validated by activation of TLR5-mediated NF-kB luciferase reporter activity with a known TLR5 agonist, flagellin. We found that PEI induced dose-dependent activation of the TLR5-mediated NF-kB pathway, indicating that PEI is indeed a TLR5 agonist. Furthermore, the anti-radiation effect of polyethylenimine was assessed using a γ-ray total body irradiation (TBI) mouse model. Compared with the irradiation control, both survival time and survival rate were significantly improved in mice that received either a low dose of polyethylenimine (P= 0.019) or a high dose of polyethylenimine (P< 0.001). We also observed a positive correlation between animal body weight and survival time in mice that received a low dose of polyethylenimine, a high dose of polyethylenimine and amifostine, over a period of 30 days, r= 0.42 (P< 0.02), 0.72 (P< 0.0001) and 0.95 (P< 0.0001), respectively, while a negative correlation between animal body weight and survival time was observed in the irradiation control (r= –0.89; P< 0.0001). These results indicate that polyethylenimine is a new TLR5 agonist with potential application in offering protection for patients receiving radiotherapy or in radiation-related accidents.","Hu, Zhiqiang; Xing, Yaling; Qian, Yuanyu; Chen, Xiaojuan; Tu, Jian; Ren, Lening; Wang, Kai; Chen, Zhongbin",J Radiat Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589936/,138
1195,The epidemiological and public health research response to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1): experiences from Hong Kong,2012-08-09,"In recent years, Hong Kong has invested in research infrastructure to appropriately respond to novel infectious disease epidemics. Research from Hong Kong made a strong contribution to the international response to the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic (pH1N1). Summarizing, describing, and reviewing Hong Kong’s response to the 2009 pandemic, this article aimed to identify key elements of a real‐time research response. A systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE for research into the infection dynamics and natural history, impact, or control of pH1N1 in Hong Kong. Eligible articles were analyzed according to their scope. Fifty‐five articles were included in the review. Transmissibility of pH1N1 was similar in Hong Kong to elsewhere, and only a small fraction of infections were associated with severe disease. School closures were effective in reducing pH1N1 transmission, oseltamivir was effective for treatment of severe cases while convalescent plasma therapy has the potential to mitigate future pandemics. There was a rapid and comprehensive research response to pH1N1 in Hong Kong, providing important information on the epidemiology of the novel virus with relevance internationally as well as locally. The scientific knowledge gained through these detailed studies of pH1N1 is now being used to revise and update pandemic plans. The experiences of the research response in Hong Kong could provide a template for the research response to future emerging and reemerging disease epidemics.","Wu, Peng; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Wu, Joseph T.; Lau, Eric H.

1351,"Overexpression of PTEN suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion through inhibition of the PI3-K-Akt-GSK3beta pathway",2014-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal and uncontrolled proliferation of lung fibroblasts may contribute to pulmonary fibrosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce fibroblast proliferation and differentiation through activation of phosphoinositide3-Kinase (PI3-K) pathway. However, the detail mechanism by which LPS contributes to the development of lung fibrosis is not clearly understood. To investigate the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a PI3-K pathway suppressor, on LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, collagen secretion and activation of PI3-K, we transfected PTEN overexpression lentivirus into cultured mouse lung fibroblasts with or without LPS treatment to evaluate proliferation by MTT and Flow cytometry assays. Expression of PTEN, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) and phosphorylation of Akt were determined by Western-blot or real-time RT-PCR assays. The PTEN phosphorylation activity was measured by a malachite green-based assay. The content of C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) in cell culture supernatants was examined by ELISA. RESULTS: We found that overexpression of PTEN effectively increased expression and phosphatase activity of PTEN, and concomitantly inhibited LPS-induced fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion. Phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta protein expression levels in the LPS-induced PTEN overexpression transfected cells were significantly lower than those in the LPS-induced non-transfected cells, which can be reversed by the PTEN inhibitor, bpV(phen). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results show that overexpression and induced phosphatase activity of PTEN inhibits LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion through inactivation of PI3-K-Akt-GSK3beta signaling pathways, which can be abrogated by a selective PTEN inhibitor. Thus, expression and phosphatase activity of PTEN could be a potential therapeutic target for LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Compared with PTEN expression level, phosphatase activity of PTEN is more crucial in affecting lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion.","He, Zhengyu; Deng, Yuxiao; Li, Wen; Chen, Yongming; Xing, Shunpeng; Zhao, Xianyuan; Ding, Jia; Gao, Yuan; Wang, Xiangrui",Cell Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892003/,138
1366,Dietary Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 and Zinc Oxide Stimulate Immune Reactions to Trivalent Influenza Vaccination in Pigs but Do Not Affect Virological Response upon Challenge Infection,2014-01-28,"Swine influenza viruses (SIV) regularly cause significant disease in pigs worldwide. Since there is no causative treatment of SIV, we tested if probiotic Enterococcus (E.) faecium NCIMB 10415 or zinc (Zn) oxide as feed supplements provide beneficial effects upon SIV infection in piglets. Seventy-two weaned piglets were fed three different diets containing either E. faecium or different levels of Zn (2500 ppm, Zn(high); 50 ppm, Zn(low)). Half of the piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly (VAC) twice with an inactivated trivalent SIV vaccine, while all piglets were then infected intranasally with H3N2 SIV. Significantly higher weekly weight gains were observed in the E. faecium group before virus infection, and piglets in Zn(high) and E. faecium groups gained weight after infection while those in the control group (Zn(low)) lost weight. Using ELISA, we found significantly higher H3N2-specific antibody levels in the E. faecium+VAC group 2 days before and at the day of challenge infection as well as at 4 and 6 days after challenge infection. Higher hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were also observed in the Zn(high)+VAC and E. faecium+VAC groups at 0, 1 and 4 days after infection. However, there were no significant differences in virus shedding and lung lesions between the dietary groups. Using flow cytometry analysis significantly higher activated T helper cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte percentages in the PBMCs were detected in the Zn(high) and E. faecium groups at single time points after infection compared to the Zn(low) control group, but no prolonged effect was found. In the BAL cells no influence of dietary supplementation on immune cell percentages could be detected. Our results suggest that feeding high doses of zinc oxide and particularly E. faecium could beneficially influence humoral immune responses after vaccination and recovery from SIV infection, but not affect virus shedding and lung pathology.","Wang, Zhenya; Burwinkel, Michael; Chai, Weidong; Lange, Elke; Blohm, Ulrike; Breithaupt, Angele; Hoffmann, Bernd; Twardziok, Sven; Rieger, Juliane; Janczyk, Pawel; Pieper, Robert; Osterrieder, Nikolaus",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904981/,138
1409,Triggering ubiquitination of IFNAR1 protects tissues from inflammatory injury,2014-01-31,"Type 1 interferons (IFN) protect the host against viruses by engaging a cognate receptor (consisting of IFNAR1/IFNAR2 chains) and inducing downstream signaling and gene expression. However, inflammatory stimuli can trigger IFNAR1 ubiquitination and downregulation thereby attenuating IFN effects in vitro. The significance of this paradoxical regulation is unknown. Presented here results demonstrate that inability to stimulate IFNAR1 ubiquitination in the Ifnar1(SA) knock-in mice renders them highly susceptible to numerous inflammatory syndromes including acute and chronic pancreatitis, and autoimmune and toxic hepatitis. Ifnar1(SA) mice (or their bone marrow-receiving wild type animals) display persistent immune infiltration of inflamed tissues, extensive damage and gravely inadequate tissue regeneration. Pharmacologic stimulation of IFNAR1 ubiquitination is protective against from toxic hepatitis and fulminant generalized inflammation in wild type but not Ifnar1(SA) mice. These results suggest that endogenous mechanisms that trigger IFNAR1 ubiquitination for limiting the inflammation-induced tissue damage can be purposely mimicked for therapeutic benefits.

1458,IL-13 signaling via IL-13Rα(2) triggers TGF-β(1)-dependent allograft fibrosis,2013-10-22,"BACKGROUND: Allograft fibrosis still remains a critical problem in transplantation, including heart transplantation. The IL-13/TGF-β(1) interaction has previously been identified as a key pathway orchestrating fibrosis in different inflammatory immune disorders. Here we investigate if this pathway is also responsible for allograft fibrosis and if interference with the IL-13/TGF-β(1) interaction prevents allograft fibrosis. METHODS: FVB or control DBA/1 donor hearts were transplanted heterotopically into DBA/1 recipient mice and hearts were explanted at day 60 and 100 post-transplantation. Cardiac tissue was examined by Masson’s trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, CD11b, IL-13, Fas ligand, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-13, β2-microglobulin, and Gremlin-1. Graft-infiltrating cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. IL-13 and TGF-β(1) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the amount of collagen was quantified using a Sircol assay; IL-13Rα(2) expression was detected by Western blotting. In some experiments IL-13/ TGF-β(1) signaling was blocked with specific IL-13Rα(2) siRNA. Additionally, a PCR array of RNA isolated from the allografts was performed to analyze expression of multiple genes involved in fibrosis. RESULTS: Both groups survived long-term (>100 days). The allogeneic grafts were infiltrated by significantly increased numbers of CD4(+) (P <0.0001), CD8(+) (P <0.0001), and CD11b(+) cells (P = 0.0065) by day 100. Furthermore, elevated IL-13 levels (P = 0.0003) and numbers of infiltrating IL-13(+) cells (P = 0.0037), together with an expression of IL-13Rα(2), were detected only within allografts. The expression of IL-13 and IL-13Rα(2) resulted in significantly increased TGF-β(1) levels (P <0.0001), higher numbers of CD11b(high)Gr1(intermediate)TGF-β(1)(+) cells, and elevated cardiac collagen deposition (P = 0.0094). The allograft fibrosis found in these experiments was accompanied by upregulation of multiple profibrotic genes, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical stainings of allograft tissue. Blockage of the IL-13/TGF-β(1) interaction by IL-13Rα(2) siRNA led to lower numbers of CD11b(high)Gr1(intermediate)TGF-β(1)(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), and CD11b(+) cells, and prevented collagen deposition (P = 0.0018) within these allografts. CONCLUSIONS: IL-13 signaling via IL-13Rα(2) induces TGF-β(1) and causes allograft fibrosis in a murine model of chronic transplant rejection. Blockage of this IL-13/TGF-β(1) interaction by IL-13Rα(2) siRNA prevents cardiac allograft fibrosis. Thus, IL-13Rα(2) may be exploitable as a future target to reduce allograft fibrosis in organ transplantation.","Brunner, Stefan M; Schiechl, Gabriela; Kesselring, Rebecca; Martin, Maria; Balam, Saidou; Schlitt, Hans J; Geissler, Edward K; Fichtner-Feigl, Stefan",Transplant Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4016099/,138
1478,Interferon Gene Expression in Sputum Cells Correlates with the Asthma Index Score During Virus-Induced Exacerbations,2014-05-24,"RATIONALE: The majority of asthma exacerbations are related to viral respiratory infections. Some, but not all, previous studies have reported that low interferon responses in patients with asthma increase the risk for virus-induced exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the relationship between lower airway inflammatory biomarkers, specifically interferon gene expression, and the severity or presence of an exacerbation in asthmatics experiencing a naturally occurring viral infection. METHODS: Sputum samples were analyzed from subjects in an asthma exacerbation study who experienced a confirmed viral infection. Subjects were monitored for daily symptoms, medication use, and peak expiratory flow rate until baseline. Sputum samples were assessed for cell counts and gene expression. RESULTS: IFN-γ expression was significantly greater in patients with asthma exacerbations compared to non-exacerbating patients (p=0.002). IFN-α1, IFN-β1, and IFN-γ mRNA levels correlated with the peak Asthma Index (r=0.58, p<0.001; r=0.57, p=0.001; and r=0.51, p=0.004, respectively). Additionally, IL-13, IL-10 and eosinophil major basic protein mRNA levels were greater in patients with asthma exacerbations compared to non-exacerbating patients (p=0.03, p=0.06, and p=0.02, respectively), and IL-13 mRNA correlated with the peak Asthma Index (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that asthma exacerbations are associated with increased rather than decreased expression of interferons early in the course of infection. These findings raise the possibility that excessive virus-induced interferon production during acute infections can contribute to airway inflammation and exacerbations of asthma.","Schwantes, Elizabeth A.; Manthei, David M.; Denlinger, Loren C.; Evans, Michael D.; Gern, James E.; Jarjour, Nizar N.; Mathur, Sameer K.",Clinical & Experimental Allergy,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4037351?pdf=render,138
1693,Therapeutic vaccination and immunomodulation in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: preclinical studies in the woodchuck,2014-12-23,"Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) may lead to subclinical, acute or chronic hepatitis. In the prevaccination era, HBV infections were endemic due to frequent mother to child transmission in large regions of the world. However, there are still estimated 240 million chronic HBV carriers today and ca. 620,000 patients die per year due to HBV-related liver diseases. Recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-α and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues does not lead to satisfactory results. Induction of HBV-specific T cells by therapeutic vaccination or immunomodulation may be an innovative strategy to overcome virus persistence. Vaccination with commercially available HBV vaccines in patients with or without therapeutic reduction of viral load did not result in effective immune control of HBV infection, suggesting that combination of antiviral treatment with new formulations of therapeutic vaccines is needed. The woodchuck (Marmota monax) and its HBV-like woodchuck hepatitis virus are a useful preclinical animal model for developing new therapeutic approaches in chronic hepadnaviral infections. Several innovative approaches combining antiviral treatments using nucleos(t)ide analogues, with prime-boost vaccination using DNA vaccines, new hepadnaviral antigens or recombinant adenoviral vectors were tested in the woodchuck model. In this review, we summarize these encouraging results obtained with these therapeutic vaccines. In addition, we present potential innovations in immunostimulatory strategies by blocking the interaction of the inhibitory programmed death receptor 1 with its ligand in this animal model.","Kosinska, Anna D.; Liu, Jia; Lu, Mengji; Roggendorf, Michael",Med Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4305085/,138
1716,Fatal outcome of human influenza A (H5N1) is associated with high viral load and hypercytokinemia,2006-09-10,"Avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses cause severe disease in humans(1,2), but the basis for their virulence remains unclear. In vitro and animal studies indicate that high and disseminated viral replication is important for disease pathogenesis(3,4,5). Laboratory experiments suggest that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation may contribute to disease severity(6,7,8,9). To assess the relevance of these findings for human disease, we performed virological and immunological studies in 18 individuals with H5N1 and 8 individuals infected with human influenza virus subtypes. Influenza H5N1 infection in humans is characterized by high pharyngeal virus loads and frequent detection of viral RNA in rectum and blood. Viral RNA in blood was present only in fatal H5N1 cases and was associated with higher pharyngeal viral loads. We observed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died, and these correlated with pharyngeal viral loads. Genetic characterization of H5N1 viruses revealed mutations in the viral polymerase complex associated with mammalian adaptation and virulence. Our observations indicate that high viral load, and the resulting intense inflammatory responses, are central to influenza H5N1 pathogenesis. The focus of clinical management should be on preventing this intense cytokine response, by early diagnosis and effective antiviral treatment.

1857,H5N1 Virus Hemagglutinin Inhibition of cAMP-Dependent CFTR via TLR4-Mediated Janus Tyrosine Kinase 3 Activation Exacerbates Lung Inflammation,2015-01-12,"The host tolerance mechanisms to avian influenza virus (H5N1) infection that limit tissue injury remain unknown. Emerging evidence indicates that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-dependent Cl(−) channel, modulates airway inflammation. Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) 3, a JAK family member that plays a central role in inflammatory responses, prominently contributes to the dysregulated innate immune response upon H5N1 attachment; therefore, this study aims to elucidate whether JAK3 activation induced by H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) inhibits cAMP-dependent CFTR channels. We performed short-circuit current, immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses of the airway epithelium in Jak3(+/+) and Jak3(+/−) mice. We demonstrate that H5N1 HA attachment inhibits cAMP-dependent CFTR Cl(−) channels via JAK3-mediated adenylyl cyclase (AC) suppression, which reduces cAMP production. This inhibition leads to increased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and inflammatory responses. H5N1 HA is detected by TLR4 expressed on respiratory epithelial cells, facilitating JAK3 activation. This activation induces the interaction between TLR4 and Gαi protein, which blocks ACs. Our findings provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of acute lung injury via the inhibition of cAMP-dependent CFTR channels, indicating that the administration of cAMP-elevating agents and targeting JAK3 may activate host tolerance to infection for the management of influenza virus–induced fatal pneumonia.","Cao, Ke; Chen, Minhui; Jie, Xiang; Wang, Yansheng; Li, Qiasheng; Xu, Jun",Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4461576/,138
1870,Molecular Chaperone Hsp90 Is a Therapeutic Target for Noroviruses,2015-04-08,"Human noroviruses (HuNoV) are a significant cause of acute gastroenteritis in the developed world, and yet our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in norovirus replication and pathogenesis has been limited by the inability to efficiently culture these viruses in the laboratory. Using the murine norovirus (MNV) model, we have recently identified a network of host factors that interact with the 5′ and 3′ extremities of the norovirus RNA genome. In addition to a number of well-known cellular RNA binding proteins, the molecular chaperone Hsp90 was identified as a component of the ribonucleoprotein complex. Here, we show that the inhibition of Hsp90 activity negatively impacts norovirus replication in cell culture. Small-molecule-mediated inhibition of Hsp90 activity using 17-DMAG (17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin) revealed that Hsp90 plays a pleiotropic role in the norovirus life cycle but that the stability of the viral capsid protein is integrally linked to Hsp90 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both the MNV-1 and the HuNoV capsid proteins require Hsp90 activity for their stability and that targeting Hsp90 in vivo can significantly reduce virus replication. In summary, we demonstrate that targeting cellular proteostasis can inhibit norovirus replication, identifying a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of norovirus infections. IMPORTANCE HuNoV are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis around the world. RNA viruses, including noroviruses, rely heavily on host cell proteins and pathways for all aspects of their life cycle. Here, we identify one such protein, the molecular chaperone Hsp90, as an important factor required during the norovirus life cycle. We demonstrate that both murine and human noroviruses require the activity of Hsp90 for the stability of their capsid proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that targeting Hsp90 activity in vivo using small molecule inhibitors also reduces infectious virus production. Given the considerable interest in the development of Hsp90 inhibitors for use in cancer therapeutics, we identify here a new target that could be explored for the development of antiviral strategies to control norovirus outbreaks and treat chronic norovirus infection in immunosuppressed patients.","Vashist, Surender; Urena, Luis; Gonzalez-Hernandez, Mariam B.; Choi, Jayoung; de Rougemont, Alexis; Rocha-Pereira, Joana; Neyts, Johan; Hwang, Seungmin; Wobus, Christiane E.; Goodfellow, Ian",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4474317/,138
2017,Worldwide transmission and seasonal variation of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus activity during the 2009–2010 pandemic,2013-03-30,"BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza activity varies with geography and time of year. OBJECTIVE: To describe how pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 [A(H1N1)pdm09] activity varied during the 2009–2010 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed influenza virological data compiled by the World Health Organization from June 2009–August 2010. We calculated weekly proportions of A(H1N1)pdm09‐positive specimens out of all A(H1N1)pdm09‐positive specimens detected during the study period for each country. We compared parameters of pandemic activity (e.g., peak A[H1N1]pdm09 weekly proportion [peak activity], number of weeks between the 5th and 95th percentiles of A(H1N1)pdm09 cumulative weekly proportion [duration of activity]) between countries in temperate and tropical–subtropical regions. We quantified the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 out of all influenza A specimens by country and correlated it with countries' central latitudes. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 80 countries (47 temperate, 33 tropical–subtropical). The median proportion of cases identified during the peak week was higher in temperate (0·12) than in tropical–subtropical (0·09) regions (P < 0·01). The median duration of activity was longer in tropical–subtropical (27 weeks) than in temperate countries (20 weeks) (P < 0·01). In most temperate countries (98%), peak pandemic activity occurred during the fall–winter period. There was a positive correlation between country central latitude and proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 out of all influenza A specimens (r: 0·76; P < 0·01). CONCLUSIONS: The transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 exhibited similarities with seasonal influenza transmission in that activity varied between temperate and tropical–subtropical countries and by time of year. Our findings suggest the potential utility of accounting for these factors during future pandemic planning.","Storms, Aaron D.; Van Kerkhove, Maria D.; Azziz‐Baumgartner, Eduardo; Lee, Wing‐Kei; Widdowson, Marc‐Alain; Ferguson, Neil M.; Mounts, Anthony W.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4634296/,138
2038,Dynamics of ADAM17-Mediated Shedding of ACE2 Applied to Pancreatic Islets of Male db/db Mice,2015-12-01,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene therapy aimed at counteracting pancreatic ACE2 depletion improves glucose regulation in two diabetic mouse models: db/db mice and angiotensin II-infused mice. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) can cause shedding of ACE2 from the cell membrane. The aim of our studies was to determine whether ADAM17 depletes ACE2 levels in pancreatic islets and β-cells. Dynamics of ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding were investigated in 832/13 insulinoma cells. Within a wide range of ACE2 expression levels, including the level observed in mouse pancreatic islets, overexpression of ADAM17 increases shed ACE2 and decreases cellular ACE2 levels. We provide a mathematical description of shed and cellular ACE2 activities as a function of the ADAM17 activity. The effect of ADAM17 on the cellular ACE2 content was relatively modest with an absolute control strength value less than 0.25 and approaching 0 at low ADAM17 activities. Although we found that ADAM17 and ACE2 are both expressed in pancreatic islets, the β-cell is not the major cell type expressing ACE2 in islets. During diabetes progression in 8-, 12-, and 15-week-old db/db mice, ACE2 mRNA and ACE2 activity levels in pancreatic islets were not decreased over time nor significantly decreased compared with nondiabetic db/m mice. Levels of ADAM17 mRNA and ADAM17 activity were also not significantly changed. Inhibiting basal ADAM17 activity in mouse islets failed to affect ACE2 levels. We conclude that whereas ADAM17 has the ability to shed ACE2, ADAM17 does not deplete ACE2 from pancreatic islets in diabetic db/db mice.","Pedersen, Kim Brint; Chodavarapu, Harshita; Porretta, Constance; Robinson, Leonie K.; Lazartigues, Eric",Endocrinology,https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/156/12/4411/8985997/endo4411.pdf,138
2256,Lipopolysaccharide and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Inhibit Interferon Signaling in Hepatocytes by Increasing Ubiquitin-Like Protease 18 (USP18) Expression,2016-05-27,"Inflammation may be maladaptive to the control of viral infection when it impairs interferon (IFN) responses, enhancing viral replication and spread. Dysregulated immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a hallmark of chronic viral infections such as, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that expression of an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), ubiquitin-like protease (USP)18 is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses to IFN-α. We examined the ability of inflammatory stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 to upregulate hepatocyte USP18 expression and blunt the IFN-α response. Human hepatoma cells and primary murine hepatocytes were treated with TNF-α/LPS/IL-6/IL-10 and USP18, phosphorylated (p)-STAT1 and myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (Mx1) expression was determined. Treatment of Huh7.5 cells and primary murine hepatocytes with LPS and TNF-α, but not IL-6 or IL-10, led to upregulated USP18 expression and induced an IFN-α refractory state, which was reversed by USP18 knockdown. Liver inflammation was induced in vivo using a murine model of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury led to an induction of USP18 expression in liver tissue and promotion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis replication. These data demonstrate that certain inflammatory stimuli (TNF-α and LPS) but not others (IL-6 and IL-10) target USP18 expression and thus inhibit IFN signaling. These findings represent a new paradigm for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses, with USP18 representing a potential target for intervention in various inflammatory states. IMPORTANCE Inflammation may prevent the control of viral infection when it impairs the innate immune response, enhancing viral replication and spread. Blunted immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a common characteristic of chronic viral infections. Previous studies have shown that expression of certain interferon-stimulated genes is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses. In this study, we show that multiple inflammatory stimuli can modulate interferon stimulated gene expression and thus inhibit hepatocyte interferon signaling via USP18 induction. These findings represent a new paradigm for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses, with the induction of USP18 representing a potential target for intervention in various inflammatory states.","MacParland, Sonya A.; Ma, Xue-Zhong; Chen, Limin; Khattar, Ramzi; Cherepanov, Vera; Selzner, Markus; Feld, Jordan J.; Selzner, Nazia; McGilvray, Ian D.",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4886784/,138
2265,Key mechanisms governing resolution of lung inflammation,2016-04-27,"Innate immunity normally provides excellent defence against invading microorganisms. Acute inflammation is a form of innate immune defence and represents one of the primary responses to injury, infection and irritation, largely mediated by granulocyte effector cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils. Failure to remove an inflammatory stimulus (often resulting in failed resolution of inflammation) can lead to chronic inflammation resulting in tissue injury caused by high numbers of infiltrating activated granulocytes. Successful resolution of inflammation is dependent upon the removal of these cells. Under normal physiological conditions, apoptosis (programmed cell death) precedes phagocytic recognition and clearance of these cells by, for example, macrophages, dendritic and epithelial cells (a process known as efferocytosis). Inflammation contributes to immune defence within the respiratory mucosa (responsible for gas exchange) because lung epithelia are continuously exposed to a multiplicity of airborne pathogens, allergens and foreign particles. Failure to resolve inflammation within the respiratory mucosa is a major contributor of numerous lung diseases. This review will summarise the major mechanisms regulating lung inflammation, including key cellular interplays such as apoptotic cell clearance by alveolar macrophages and macrophage/neutrophil/epithelial cell interactions. The different acute and chronic inflammatory disease states caused by dysregulated/impaired resolution of lung inflammation will be discussed. Furthermore, the resolution of lung inflammation during neutrophil/eosinophil-dominant lung injury or enhanced resolution driven via pharmacological manipulation will also be considered.","Robb, C.

(2011) Annual influenza vaccination: coverage and attitudes of primary care staff in Australia. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 5(2), 135–141. Background Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all Australian health care workers (HCWs) including those working in primary health care. There is limited published data on coverage, workplace provision, attitudes and personal barriers to influenza vaccination amongst primary health care staff. The aim of this study was to contribute to the limited literature base in this important area by investigating these issues in the primary health care setting in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods A postal survey was sent to general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses (PNs) from inner city, semi‐urban and rural areas of NSW, Australia. There were 139 responses in total (response rate 36%) from 79 GPs (response rate 30%) and 60 PNs (response rate 46%). Results Reported influenza vaccination coverage in both 2007 and 2008 was greater than 70%, with GPs reporting higher coverage than PNs in both years. The main barriers identified were lack of awareness of vaccination recommendations for general practice staff and concern about adverse effects from the vaccine. Conclusions Rates of influenza vaccination coverage reported in this study were higher than in previous studies of hospital and institutional HCWs, though it is possible that the study design may have contributed to these higher results. Nevertheless, these findings highlight that more needs to be done to understand barriers to vaccination in this group, to inform the development of appropriate strategies to increase vaccination coverage in primary health care staff, with a special focus on PNs.","Ward, Kirsten; Seale, Holly; Zwar, Nicholas; Leask, Julie; MacIntyre, C.

Despite an increasing list of potential salvage therapies, standard-of-care for these patients has not changed in over a decade. Immunotherapy has been seen as an exciting option, with the potential to offer specific and long lasting tumor clearance. The “gold standard” in immunotherapy has been the development of a tumor-specific CD8 T cell response to potentiate tumor clearance and immunological memory. While many advances have been made in the field of immunotherapy, few therapies have seen true success. Many of the same principles used to develop immunotherapy in tumors of the peripheral organs have been applied to brain tumor immunotherapy. The immune-specialized nature of the brain should call into question whether this approach is appropriate. Recent results from our own experiments require a rethinking of current dogma. Perhaps a CD8 T cell response is not sufficient for an organ as immunologically unique as the brain. Examination of previously elucidated principles of the brain’s immune-specialized status and known immunological preferences should generate discussion and experimentation to address the failure of current therapies.","Murphy, Katherine A.; Griffith, Thomas S.",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4999780/,138

Pseudomonas spp. was tested with our novel antimicrobial compound. The zones of inhibition in agar culture were measured for each individual component and for the compound, and the results were compared with those of the control group which had been treated with cloxacillin. Data were expressed as means ± standard deviations. Quantitative analyses were performed using the paired t-test. RESULTS: The antibiotic effect of the Phenol-rich compound sweet gel was statistically shown to be more significant than that of cloxacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.05).

Inflammations are mainly divided into acute and chronic inflammation depending on various inflammatory processes and cellular mechanisms. Recent investigations have clarified that inflammation is a major factor for the progression of various chronic diseases/disorders, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, eye disorders, arthritis, obesity, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease. Free radical productions from different biological and environmental sources are due to an imbalance of natural antioxidants which further leads to various inflammatory associated diseases. In this review article, we have outlined the inflammatory process and its cellular mechanisms involved in the progression of various chronic modern human diseases. In addition, we have discussed the role of free radicals-induced tissue damage, antioxidant defence, and molecular mechanisms in chronic inflammatory diseases/disorders.

We investigated the antimicrobial effect of glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA) and its derivatives against 50 clinical S. aureus strains, including 18 methicillin-resistant strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of GRA, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, disodium succinoyl glycyrrhetinate (GR-SU), stearyl glycyrrhetinate and glycyrrhetinyl stearate were evaluated against various S. aureus strains. Additionally, we investigated the bactericidal effects of GRA and GR-SU against two specific S. aureus strains. DNA microarray analysis was also performed to clarify the mechanism underlying the antibacterial activity of GR-SU. We detected the antimicrobial activities of five agents against S. aureus strains. GRA and GR-SU showed strong antibacterial activities compared to the other three agents tested. At a higher concentration (above 2x MIC), GRA and GR-SU showed bactericidal activity, whereas at a concentration of 1x MIC, they showed a bacteriostatic effect. Additionally, GRA and GR-SU exhibited a synergistic effect with gentamicin. The expression of a large number of genes (including transporters) and metabolic factors (carbohydrates and amino acids) was altered by the addition of GR-SU, suggesting that the inhibition of these metabolic processes may influence the degree of the requirement for carbohydrates or amino acids. In fact, the requirement for carbohydrates or amino acids was increased in the presence of either GRA or GR-SU. GRA and GR-SU exhibited strong antibacterial activity against several S. aureus strains, including MRSA. This activity may be partly due to the inhibition of several pathways involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.","Oyama, Kentaro; Kawada-Matsuo, Miki; Oogai, Yuichi; Hayashi, Tetsuya; Nakamura, Norifumi; Komatsuzawa, Hitoshi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5098735/,138
2554,The Role of Fear-Related Behaviors in the 2013–2016 West Africa Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak,2016-10-13,"The 2013–2016 West Africa Ebola virus disease pandemic was the largest, longest, deadliest, and most geographically expansive outbreak in the 40-year interval since Ebola was first identified. Fear-related behaviors played an important role in shaping the outbreak. Fear-related behaviors are defined as “individual or collective behaviors and actions initiated in response to fear reactions that are triggered by a perceived threat or actual exposure to a potentially traumatizing event. FRBs modify the future risk of harm.” This review examines how fear-related behaviors were implicated in (1) accelerating the spread of Ebola, (2) impeding the utilization of life-saving Ebola treatment, (3) curtailing the availability of medical services for treatable conditions, (4) increasing the risks for new-onset psychological distress and psychiatric disorders, and (5) amplifying the downstream cascades of social problems. Fear-related behaviors are identified for each of these outcomes. Particularly notable are behaviors such as treating Ebola patients in home or private clinic settings, the “laying of hands” on Ebola-infected individuals to perform faith-based healing, observing hands-on funeral and burial customs, foregoing available life-saving treatment, and stigmatizing Ebola survivors and health professionals. Future directions include modeling the onset, operation, and perpetuation of fear-related behaviors and devising strategies to redirect behavioral responses to mass threats in a manner that reduces risks and promotes resilience.","Shultz, James M.; Cooper, Janice L.; Baingana, Florence; Oquendo, Maria A.; Espinel, Zelde; Althouse, Benjamin M.; Marcelin, Louis Herns; Towers, Sherry; Espinola, Maria; McCoy, Clyde B.; Mazurik, Laurie; Wainberg, Milton L.; Neria, Yuval; Rechkemmer, Andreas",Curr Psychiatry Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241909/,138
2589,Preventive Effects of Carnosine on Lipopolysaccharide-induced Lung Injury,2017-02-16,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a potentially devastating form of acute lung injury, which involves neutrophilic inflammation and pulmonary cell death. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in ARDS development. New compounds for inhibiting the onset and progression of ARDS are required. Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a small di-peptide with numerous activities, including antioxidant effects, metal chelation, proton buffering capacity and the inhibition of protein carbonylation and glycoxidation. We have examined the preventive effects of carnosine on tissue injury, oedema and inflammation in a murine model for ARDS. Oral administration of carnosine suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular permeability, tissue injury and inflammation in the lung. In vivo imaging analysis revealed that LPS administration increased the level of ROS and that this increase was inhibited by carnosine administration. Carnosine also suppressed LPS-induced neutrophilic inflammation (evaluated by activation of myeloperoxidase in the lung and increased extracellular DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid). Furthermore, carnosine administration suppressed the LPS-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress response in vivo. These results suggest that the oral administration of carnosine suppresses LPS-induced lung injury via carnosine’s ROS-reducing activity. Therefore, carnosine may be beneficial for suppressing the onset and progression of ARDS.","Tanaka, Ken-Ichiro; Sugizaki, Toshifumi; Kanda, Yuki; Tamura, Fumiya; Niino, Tomomi; Kawahara, Masahiro",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5311717/,138

As a continued effort, the aim of the present study was to further evaluate the interaction between TPIC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to better understand the cellular entry mechanism. In the present investigation, experiments relevant to co-localization, endocytosis inhibitors and factors influencing the internalization were performed. Without any treatment, there was no co-localization between aminopeptidase N/CD13 (APN/CD13) and caveolin 1 (CAV1). However, co-localization between CD13 and CAV1 was observed when cells were incubated with an anti-CD13 antibody or TPIC. As compared with antibody treatment, TPIC accelerated the speed and enhanced the degree of co-localization. TPIC entered HUVEC not only together with CD13 but also together with CAV1. However, this internalization was not dependent on the enzyme activity of CD13 but could be inhibited by methyl-β-eyclodextfin (MβCD), further identifying the involvement of caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CvME). This conclusion was also verified by endocytosis inhibitor experiments.","Liu, Chunxi; Liu, Tingxian; Yu, Xiaoyue; Gu, Yizhu",Acta Pharm Sin B,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5430811/,138
2709,Peripheral blood AKAP7 expression as an early marker for lymphocyte-mediated post-stroke blood brain barrier disruption,2017-04-26,"Our group recently identified 16 genes whose peripheral blood expression levels are differentially regulated in acute ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the early expression levels of any of these 16 genes are predictive for post-stroke blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Transcriptional expression levels of candidate genes were measured in peripheral blood sampled from ischemic stroke patients at emergency department admission, and BBB permeability was assessed at 24 hour follow up via perfusion-weighted imaging. Early heightened expression levels of AKAP7, a gene encoding a protein kinase A-binding scaffolding molecule, were significantly associated with BBB disruption 24 hours post-hospital admission. We then determined that AKAP7 is predominantly expressed by lymphocytes in peripheral blood, and strongly co-expressed with ITGA3, a gene encoding the adhesion molecule integrin alpha 3. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that heightened expression of AKAP7 and ITGA3 in primary human lymphocytes is associated with a highly adherent phenotype. Collectively, our results suggest that AKAP7 expression levels may have clinical utility as a prognostic biomarker for post-stroke BBB complications, and are likely elevated early in patients who later develop post-stroke BBB disruption due to the presence of an invasive lymphocyte population in the peripheral blood.","O’Connell, Grant C.; Treadway, Madison B.; Petrone, Ashley B.; Tennant, Connie S.; Lucke-Wold, Noelle; Chantler, Paul D.; Barr, Taura L.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5430856/,138
2711,CD163(+)CD204(+) tumor-associated macrophages contribute to T cell regulation via interleukin-10 and PD-L1 production in oral squamous cell carcinoma,2017-05-11,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by producing various mediators. Although preclinical studies demonstrated that TAMs preferentially express CD163 and CD204, the TAM subsets in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain unknown. In this study, we examined the expression and role of TAM subsets in OSCC. Forty-six patients with OSCC were analyzed for expression of TAMs in biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry. We examined TAM subsets and their production of immune suppressive molecules (IL-10 and PD-L1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three OSCC patients by flow cytometry. CD163 was detected around the tumor or connective tissue, while CD204 was detected in/around the tumors. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that CD163(+)CD204(+) TAMs strongly produced IL-10 and PD-L1 in comparison with CD163(+)CD204(−) and CD163(−)CD204(+) TAMs. Furthermore, the number of activated CD3(+) T cells after co-culture with CD163(+)CD204(+) TAMs was significantly lower than that after co-culture with other TAM subsets. In clinical findings, the number of CD163(+)CD204(+) TAMs was negatively correlated with that of CD25(+) cells and 5-year progression-free survival. These results suggest that CD163(+)CD204(+) TAMs possibly play a key role in the invasion and metastasis of OSCC by T-cell regulation via IL-10 and PD-L1 production.","Kubota, Keigo; Moriyama, Masafumi; Furukawa, Sachiko; Rafiul, Haque A.

2925,Cytokines Interleukin 4 (IL-4) and Interleukin 10 (IL-10) Gene Polymorphisms as Potential Host Susceptibility Factors in Virus-Induced Encephalitis,2017-09-22,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to analyze and explore the relationship between the cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in relation to gene polymorphism and their respective effects on the susceptibility to virus-induced encephalitis. MATERIAL/METHODS: From January 2012 to June 2013, 112 patients with virus-induced encephalitis (the case group and 109 healthy individuals (the control group) were recruited for the purposes of this study. The functional variations that IL-4 and IL-10 genes exhibit were detected through the use of a function analysis and selection tool for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (FASTSNP). The genotypes of IL-4 were rs2227283 and IL-4 rs2227288, and the genotypes of IL-10 were rs1800871 and IL-10 rs1800872. These genotypes were respectively assessed using direct sequencing. RESULTS: IL-4 rs2227283 and IL-10 rs1800871 have no correlation in with risk of virus-induced encephalitis (both P>0.05) GA and AA genotypes were related to IL-4 rs2227288 and GT, while TT and GT + TT genotypes were related to IL-10 rs1800872. These were highlighted as being risk factors in virus-induced encephalitis (all P<0.05). However, the duration of fever, white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, and lymphocytes and monocytes of virus-induced encephalitis patients with IL-4 rs2227288 and IL-10 rs1800872 all displayed significant differences (all P<0.05). Frequencies of GAGT and CAGT haplotypes were evaluated and deemed to be of statistical significance and subsequently were highlighted as being risk factors in virus-induced encephalitis (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IL-4 rs2227288 and IL-10 rs1800872 may contribute to an increased risk for virus-induced encephalitis. Through use of direct sequencing, we showed that genotypes of IL-4 rs2227288 and IL-10 rs1800872 may have particular host susceptibility to virus-induced encephalitis.","Yu, Ying; Chen, Ying; Wang, Feng-Ling; Sun, Jing; Li, Hai-Jun; Liu, Jia-Ming",Med Sci Monit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5683680/,138
3003,The Fractionated Toona sinensis Leaf Extract Induces Apoptosis of Human Osteosarcoma Cells and Inhibits Tumor Growth in a Murine Xenograft Model,2016-11-22,"Background: Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor prevalent in adolescents with poor prognosis. Toona sinensis showed potent antiproliferation effect on lung, melatonin, ovary, colon, and liver cancers. However, the effects of the species on osteosarcoma cells are rarely investigated. Results: In this study, we found fraction 1 of Toona sinensis leaf (TSL-1) resulted in inhibition of cell viability in MG-63, Saos-2, and U2OS osteosarcoma cell lines, while it only caused a moderate suppressive effect on normal osteoblasts. In addition, TSL-1 significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase leakage and induced apoptosis and necrosis in Saos-2 cells. TSL-1 increased mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic factor Bad. Most important, TSL-1 significantly suppressed Saos-2 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice by increasing caspase-3. The IC-50 of TSL-1 for the 3 tested osteosarcoma cells is around 1/9 of that for lung cancer cells. Conclusion: We demonstrated that TSL-1, a fractionated extract from TSL, caused significant cytotoxicity to osteosarcoma cells due to apoptosis. In vivo xenograft study showed that TSL-1 suppressed the growth of osteosarcoma cells at least in part by inducing apoptosis. Our results indicate that TSL-1 has potential to be a promising anti-osteosarcoma adjuvant functional plant extract.","Chen, Chung-Hwan; Li, Ching-Ju; Tai, I-Chun; Lin, Xiao-Hui; Hsu, Hseng-Kuang; Ho, Mei-Ling",Integr Cancer Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5759936/,138
3087,Asymmetric expression level of clock genes in left vs. right nasal mucosa in humans with and without allergies and in rats: Circadian characteristics and possible contribution to nasal cycle,2018-03-13,"Numerous peripheral tissues possess self-sustaining daily biologic rhythms that are regulated at the molecular level by clock genes such as PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1. Physiological function of nasal mucosa exhibits rhythmic variability to a day-night environmental cycle. Nevertheless, little is known of the expression and distribution pattern of clock genes in nasal mucosa. The present study investigates the expression level and distribution pattern of PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 genes in nasal mucosa of healthy controls, allergic rhinitis patients, and normal rats. In human and rat nasal mucosa, the levels of these genes are asymmetrically expressed in nasal mucosa derived from right and left cavities in normal controls, allergic patients, and rat. In human nasal mucosa, the expression levels of these genes were higher in the decongested side than the congested mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, these clock genes are expressed in a rhythmic circadian manner under the regular light/dark cycles. The expression levels of MUC5AC, a key mucin genes produced in superficial epithelium, are higher in decongested side than that congested side in human nasal mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, MUC5AC levels showed a circadian rhythm which was associated with different expression levels in nasal mucosa derived from the right and left nasal cavities. Taken together with these results, the present study shows that the clock genes such as PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 are present in human and rat nasal mucosa, and suggest that these clock genes may control the pathophysiological function of nasal mucosa as circadian oscillators and affect the maintenance of the nasal cycle.","Kim, Ha Kyun; Kim, Hyun Jung; Kim, Jae Hyung; Kim, Tae Hoon; Lee, Sang Hag",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5849312/,138
3088,Translating Lung Microbiome Profiles into the Next-Generation Diagnostic Gold Standard for Pneumonia: a Clinical Investigator’s Perspective,2018-03-13,"Severe bacterial pneumonia is a major global cause of morbidity and mortality, yet current diagnostic approaches rely on identification of causative pathogens by cultures, which require extended incubation periods and often fail to detect relevant pathogens. Consequently, patients are prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics in a “one-size-fits-all” manner, which may be inappropriate for their individual needs and promote antibiotic resistance. My research focuses on leveraging next-generation sequencing of microbial DNA directly from patient samples for the development of new, culture-independent definitions of pneumonia. In this perspective article, I discuss the current state of the field and focus on the conceptual and research design challenges for clinical translation. With ongoing technological advancements and application of computational biology methods for assessing clinical validity and utility, I anticipate that sequencing-based diagnostics will soon be able to positively disrupt the way we think about, diagnose, and treat pulmonary infections.","Kitsios, Georgios D.",mSystems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5850077/,138
3274,Cell free preparations of probiotics exerted antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against multidrug resistant E. coli,2018-03-12,"The sharp increase in antibiotic resistance imposes a global threat to human health and the discovery of effective antimicrobial alternatives is needed. The use of probiotics to combat bacterial pathogens has gained a rising interest. Pathogenic Escherichia coli is causative of multiple clinical syndromes such as diarrheal diseases, meningitis and urinary tract infections. In this work, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotics to control multidrug-resistant E. coli and reduce their ability to form biofilms. Six E. coli resistant to at least five antibiotics (Ceftazidime, Ampicillin, Clarithromycin, Amoxicillin + Clavulanic Acid and Ceftriaxone) were isolated in this work. Preparations of cell-free spent media (CFSM) of six probiotics belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus which were grown in Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) broth exhibited strong antibacterial activity (inhibition zones of 11.77–23.10 mm) against all E. coli isolates. Two E. coli isolates, namely E. coli WW1 and IC2, which were most resistant to all antibiotics were subjected to antibiofilm experiments. Interestingly, the CFSM of MRS fermented by all probiotics resulted in inhibition of biofilm formation while B. longum caused highest inhibition (57.94%) in case of E. coli IC2 biofilms and L. plantarum was responsible for 64.57% reduction of E. coli WW1 biofilms. On the other hand, CFSM of skim milk fermented by L. helveticus and L. rhamnosus exhibited a slight inhibitory activity against IC2 isolate (inhibition percentage of 31.52 and 17. 68, respectively) while WW1 isolate biofilms was reduced by CFSM of milk fermented by B. longum and L. helveticus (70.81 and 69.49 reduction percentage, respectively). These results support the effective use of probiotics as antimicrobial alternatives and to eradicate biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant E. coli.","Abdelhamid, Ahmed G.; Esaam, Aliaa; Hazaa, Mahmoud M.",Saudi Pharm J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6035330/,138
3312,A bioreactor system for the manufacture of a genetically modified Plasmodium falciparum blood stage malaria cell bank for use in a clinical trial,2018-08-06,"BACKGROUND: Although the use of induced blood stage malaria infection has proven to be a valuable tool for testing the efficacy of vaccines and drugs against Plasmodium falciparum, a limiting factor has been the availability of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)—compliant defined P. falciparum strains for in vivo use. The aim of this study was to develop a cost-effective method for the large-scale production of P. falciparum cell banks suitable for use in clinical trials. METHODS: Genetically-attenuated parasites (GAP) were produced by targeted deletion of the gene encoding the knob associated histidine rich protein (kahrp) from P. falciparum strain 3D7. A GAP master cell bank (MCB) was manufactured by culturing parasites in an FDA approved single use, closed system sterile plastic bioreactor. All components used to manufacture the MCB were screened to comply with standards appropriate for in vivo use. The cryopreserved MCB was subjected to extensive testing to ensure GMP compliance for a phase 1 investigational product. RESULTS: Two hundred vials of the GAP MCB were successfully manufactured. At harvest, the GAP MCB had a parasitaemia of 6.3%, with 96% of parasites at ring stage. Testing confirmed that all release criteria were met (sterility, absence of viral contaminants and endotoxins, parasite viability following cryopreservation, identity and anti-malarial drug sensitivity of parasites). CONCLUSION: Large-scale in vitro culture of P. falciparum parasites using a wave bioreactor can be achieved under GMP-compliant conditions. This provides a cost-effective methodology for the production of malaria parasites suitable for administration in clinical trials.","Pawliw, Rebecca; Farrow, Rebecca; Sekuloski, Silvana; Jennings, Helen; Healer, Julie; Phuong, Thuan; Sathe, Pri; Pasay, Cielo; Evans, Krystal; Cowman, Alan F.; Schofield, Louis; Chen, Nanhua; McCarthy, James; Trenholme, Katharine",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080485/,138
3366,Nebulisation of synthetic lamellar lipids mitigates radiation-induced lung injury in a large animal model,2018-09-06,"Methods to protect against radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) will facilitate the development of more effective radio-therapeutic protocols for lung cancer and may provide the means to protect the wider population in the event of a deliberate or accidental nuclear or radiological event. We hypothesised that supplementing lipid membranes through nebulization of synthetic lamellar lipids would mitigate RILI. Following pre-treatment with either nebulised lamellar lipids or saline, anaesthetised sheep were prescribed fractionated radiotherapy (30 Gray (Gy) total dose in five 6 Gy fractions at 3–4 days intervals) to a defined unilateral lung volume. Gross pathology in radio-exposed lung 37 days after the first radiation treatment was consistent between treatment groups and consisted of deep red congestion evident on the pleural surface and firmness on palpation. Consistent histopathological features in radio-exposed lung were subpleural, periarteriolar and peribronchial intra-alveolar oedema, alveolar fibrosis, interstitial pneumonia and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. The synthetic lamellar lipids abrogated radiation-induced alveolar fibrosis and reduced alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA) expression in radio-exposed lung compared to saline treated sheep. Administration of synthetic lamellar lipids was also associated with an increased number of cells expressing dendritic cell-lysosomal associated membrane protein throughout the lung.","Collie, David; Murchison, John T.; Wright, Steven H.; McLean, Alec; Howard, Lynsey; del-Pozo, Jorge; Smith, Sionagh; McLachlan, Gerry; Lawrence, Jessica; Kay, Elaine; Schwarz, Tobias; Parys, Magdalena",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127301/,138
3475,Association of the Human Bocavirus With Tonsil Squamous Cell Carcinomas,2018-10-16,"Background: The human bocavirus (HBoV) is known to persist latently in the infected host cells and seems to replicate its DNA via the DNA damage response system, which is frequently defect in tumors and correlates with microsatellite instability (MSI). Because HBoV is able to persist in the infected tissues, induces pro-fibrotic and pro- cancerogenic cytokines in vivo and in vitro, and is detected in colorectal and lung tumors, the virus may be involved in cancerogenesis at least as a cofactor. Recently it was shown that the adenotonsillar tissue is an important site of HBoV1 persistence and replication. Considering the background that approximately 60% of oropharyngeal cancers were thought to be attributable to a HPV infection, a co-participation of HBoV in terms of a chronic virus infection might play a role in the cancerogenesis of tonsil tumors. Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tonsil tumor samples were screened for HBoV and HPV DNA. Positive tissue sections were afterward subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to identify HBoV and HPV infected cells. By use of an in vitro cell culture model with primary tonsil fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and lymphocytes infected by HBoV we tried to find the target cells of virus replication. MSI testing was based on a previously published protocol using a de-multiplexed PCR followed by fluorescent detection of PCR products in a capillary sequencing device. Results: In total 62 of 103 (60, 19%) of the tonsil squamous cell carcinomas tested positive for HBoV DNA and 66 of 103 (66%) samples were identified as HPV positive. The FISH analysis revealed both double infection of HPV and HBoV in the same cells as well as single infections of both viruses within the tumor tissue. Twenty-two of 62 HBoV positive tumors tested HPV negative, 40 of 62 tissue sections were HBoV and HPV positive. We analyzed 21 out of the 62 HBoV positive tumors for MSI. Of those four tonsils displayed MSI in at least 1 of 10 microsatellite markers. Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis that human bocavirus infections as a cofactor may have an impact on tumor development in tonsils, although it still remains possible that HBoV solely displays a tumor tropism.","Höpken, Merle; Förster, Isabel; Maune, Steffen; Brockmann, Michael; Schildgen, Oliver; Schildgen, Verena",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6232770/,138
3490,The enzymatic biosynthesis of acylated steroidal glycosides and their cytotoxic activity,2018-05-01,"Herein we describe the discovery and functional characterization of a steroidal glycosyltransferase (SGT) from Ornithogalum saundersiae and a steroidal glycoside acyltransferase (SGA) from Escherichia coli and their application in the biosynthesis of acylated steroidal glycosides (ASGs). Initially, an SGT gene, designated as OsSGT1, was isolated from O. saundersiae. OsSGT1-containing cell free extract was then used as the biocatalyst to react with 49 structurally diverse drug-like compounds. The recombinant OsSGT1 was shown to be active against both 3β- and 17β-hydroxyl steroids. Unexpectedly, in an effort to identify OsSGT1, we found the bacteria lacA gene in lac operon actually encoded an SGA, specifically catalyzing the acetylations of sugar moieties of steroid 17β-glucosides. Finally, a novel enzymatic two-step synthesis of two ASGs, acetylated testosterone-17-O-β-glucosides (AT-17β-Gs) and acetylated estradiol-17-O-β-glucosides (AE-17β-Gs), from the abundantly available free steroids using OsSGT1 and EcSGA1 as the biocatalysts was developed. The two-step process is characterized by EcSGA1-catalyzed regioselective acylations of all hydroxyl groups on the sugar unit of unprotected steroidal glycosides (SGs) in the late stage, thereby significantly streamlining the synthetic route towards ASGs and thus forming four monoacylates. The improved cytotoxic activities of 3′-acetylated testosterone17-O-β-glucoside towards seven human tumor cell lines were thus observable.","Liu, Ming; Kong, Jian-Qiang",Acta Pharm Sin B,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6251810/,138
3491,Beyond Type 1 Regulatory T Cells: Co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b in IL-10-Producing T Cell Lineages,2018-11-19,"Type 1 regulatory CD4(+) T (Tr1) cells express high levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 but not the master transcription factor Foxp3, and can suppress inflammation and promote immune tolerance. In order to identify and obtain viable Tr1 cells for research and clinical applications, co-expression of CD49b and LAG3 has been proposed as a unique surface signature for both human and mouse Tr1 cells. However, recent studies have revealed that this pattern of co-expression is dependent on the stimulating conditions and the differentiation stage of the CD4(+) T cells. Here, using an IL-10(GFP)/Foxp3(RFP) dual reporter transgenic murine model, we demonstrate that co-expression of CD49b and LAG3 is not restricted to the Foxp3(−) Tr1 cells, but is also observed in Foxp3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells and CD8(+) T cells that produce IL-10. Our data indicate that IL-10-producing Tr1 cells, Treg cells and CD8(+) T cells are all capable of co-expressing LAG3 and CD49b in vitro following differentiation under IL-10-inducing conditions, and in vivo following pathogenic insult or infection in the pulmonary mucosa. Our findings urge caution in the use of LAG3/CD49b co-expression as sole markers to identify Tr1 cells, since it may mark IL-10-producing T cell lineages more broadly, including the Foxp3(−) Tr1 cells, Foxp3(+) Treg cells, and CD8(+) T cells.","Huang, Weishan; Solouki, Sabrina; Carter, Chavez; Zheng, Song-Guo; August, Avery",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6252342/,138
3708,Targeting pericytes for neurovascular regeneration,2019-03-20,"Pericytes, as a key cellular part of the blood-brain barrier, play an important role in the maintenance of brain neurovascular unit. These cells participate in brain homeostasis by regulating vascular development and integrity mainly through secreting various factors. Pericytes per se show different restorative properties after blood-brain barrier injury. Upon the occurrence of brain acute and chronic diseases, pericytes provoke immune cells to regulate neuro-inflammatory conditions. Loss of pericytes in distinct neurologic disorders intensifies blood-brain barrier permeability and leads to vascular dementia. The therapeutic potential of pericytes is originated from the unique morphological shape, location, and their ability in providing vast paracrine and juxtacrine interactions. A subset of pericytes possesses multipotentiality and exhibit trans-differentiation capacity in the context of damaged tissue.

3864,The MAP3K7-mTOR Axis Promotes the Proliferation and Malignancy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells,2019-06-04,"Targeted therapy is currently limited for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to the lack of suitable targets. Kinases play pivotal roles in many cellular biological processes, whereas dysregulation of kinases may lead to various diseases, particularly cancer. However, the role of kinases in HCC malignancy remains unclear. In this study, we employed a kinome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library, comprising 710 kinase-related genes, to screen whether any kinases were essential for cell proliferation in various HCC cell lines. Through a kinome siRNA library screening, we found that MAP3K7 was a crucial gene for HCC cell proliferation. Pharmacological or genetic ablation of MAP3K7 diminished the growth, migration, and invasion of HCC cells, including primary HCC cells. Stable knockdown of MAP3K7 attenuated tumor formation in a spheroid cell culture model and tumor xenograft mouse model. In addition, silencing MAP3K7 reduced the phosphorylation and expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in HCC cells. MAP3K7 expression was positively correlated with mTOR expression in tumors of patients with HCC. Higher co-expression of MAP3K7 and mTOR was significantly associated with poor prognosis of HCC. Taken together, our results revealed that the MAP3K7-mTOR axis might promote tumorigenesis and malignancy, which provides a potential marker or therapeutic target for HCC patients.","Cheng, Jin-Shiung; Tsai, Wei-Lun; Liu, Pei-Feng; Goan, Yih-Gang; Lin, Chih-Wen; Tseng, Ho-Hsing; Lee, Cheng-Hsin; Shu, Chih-Wen",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6558008/,138
3991,The protective and pathogenic roles of IL-17 in viral infections: friend or foe?,2019-07-24,"Viral infections cause substantial human morbidity and mortality, and are a significant health burden worldwide. Following a viral infection, the host may initiate complex antiviral immune responses to antagonize viral invasion and replication. However, proinflammatory antiviral immune responses pose a great threat to the host if not properly held in check. Interleukin (IL)-17 is a pleiotropic cytokine participating in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including tissue integrity maintenance, cancer progression, autoimmune disease development and, more intriguingly, infectious diseases. Abundant evidence suggests that while IL-17 plays a crucial role in enhancing effective antiviral immune responses, it may also promote and exacerbate virus-induced illnesses. Accumulated experimental and clinical evidence has broadened our understanding of the seemingly paradoxical role of IL-17 in viral infections and suggests that IL-17-targeted immunotherapy may be a promising therapeutic option. Herein, we summarize current knowledge regarding the protective and pathogenic roles of IL-17 in viral infections, with emphasis on underlying mechanisms. The various and critical roles of IL-17 in viral infections necessitate the development of therapeutic strategies that are uniquely tailored to both the infectious agent and the infection environment.","Ma, Wen-Tao; Yao, Xiao-Ting; Peng, Qun; Chen, De-Kun",Open Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6685926/,138

Interest of using NDV as an anticancer agent has arisen from its ability to kill tumor cells with limited toxicity to normal cells. METHODS: In this investigation, the proliferation of brain tumor cell line, glioblastoma multiform (DBTRG.05MG) induced by NDV strain AF2240 was evaluated in-vitro, by using MTT proliferation assay. Furthermore, Cytological observations were studied using fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, DNA laddering in agarose gel electrophoresis assay used to detect the mode of cell death and analysis of the cellular DNA content by flowcytometery. RESULTS: MTT proliferation assay, Cytological observations using fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy show the anti-proliferation effect and apoptogenic features of NDV on DBTRG.05MG. Furthermore, analysis of the cellular DNA content showed that there was a loss of treated cells in all cell cycle phases (G1, S and G2/M) accompanied with increasing in sub-G1 region (apoptosis peak).

Parrot bornavirus 1 to 8 (PaBV-1 to 8) causes neurological and/or gastrointestinal syndromes and death on psittacines. We aimed to identify and to produce epidemiologic knowledge about the etiologic agent associated with a death of two female Psittacus erithacus (grey parrot). Methods and Results: Both parrots were submitted for a complete standardised necropsy. Tissue samples were analysed by PCR. The findings in necropsy were compatible with bornavirus infection. Analysis revealed PaBV-4 related with genotypes detected in captive and in wild birds. The N and X proteins of PaBV-4 were more related to avian bornaviruses, while phosphoprotein was more related to variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 (VSBV-1). Within the P gene/phosphoprotein a highly conserved region between and within bornavirus species was found. Conclusions: Portugal is on the routes of the intensive world trade of psittacines. Broad screening studies are required to help understanding the role of wild birds in the emergence and spread of pathogenic bornaviruses. PaBV-4 phosphoprotein is closer to VSBV-1 associated with lethal encephalitis in humans than with some of the avian bornaviruses.

However, whether such recombinant strains could induce desired immune responses in the lung, where TB infection occurs, is not clear. In this paper, C57BL/6 J mice were intranasally vaccinated with attenuated LIΔactAplcB-Rv3875 (Δ refers to gene deletion in the bacterial genome) or LIΔactAplcB-Rv0129c, the two vaccine candidates that utilize LI as an antigen delivery vector. Bacterial load in the target organs, histological changes in the infected organs, the percentage of specific cytokine-secreting T cells in the lung and spleen, IgG levels in the serum and secretory IgA (SIgA) levles in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were determined at specific days post inoculation (dpi). The results showed that both strains were mainly confined to the lung and were eliminated at 10 dpi. The histological damage caused by the infection in the lung was slight and recovered by day 5. Intranasal vaccination of the mice twice at an interval of 4 weeks notably elicited TB antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses in the lung and SIgA secretion in the pulmonary mucosa, and significantly enhanced the percentage of double-functional CD8(+) T cells (IFN-γ(+) TNF-α(+) CD8(+)). To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the used of LI vector vaccines to induce promising lung-localized cellular and humoral immune responses by intranasal vaccination. These data suggest that LI could be a novel and promising live vector to construct an intranasal vaccine against respiratory diseases.","Jiang, Ming-juan; Liu, Si-jing; Su, Lin; Zhang, Xiang; Li, Yong-yu; Tang, Tian; Wang, Chuan",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6962167/,138
4987,Treatment of multiple sclerosis with anti-measles cow colostrum,1984,"Twenty-four volunteers at the Common Cold Unit were divided into two groups of twelve. One group was vaccinated orally with an enterovirus (LEV 4) and the other with nutrient broth. Both groups were challenged three days later with intranasal rhinovirus 4 and they were observed clinically and monitored by laboratory tests to see if any modification of the rhinovirus infection occurred. All the vaccinated volunteers were successfully infected with LEV 4 and were excreting the enterovirus in the faeces at near maximum titres at the time of the rhinovirus infection, following which 67 per cent of the volunteers were infected and 29 per cent developed symptoms. However, the vaccinated group did not differ from the unvaccinated in respect of the illness induced, the excretion of rhinovirus type 4 or the rise of RV 4 antibody titre. LEV 4 was isolated from the nasopharynx of some of the volunteers, but the rhinovirus infection was not modified even in these. Interferon was present in the serum and nasal washings of nine volunteers in all, of whom only 3 had received the LEV 4 vaccination. Two additional volunteers were shown to be insusceptible to reinfection with LEV4. It was concluded that live enterovirus vaccination does not induce viral interference.","Matthews, T. H.

5048,Relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis an autoimmune model of multiple sclerosis,1985,"Minced von Ebner's glands of rat tongue were incubatedin vitro with histamine and histamine receptor antagonists. At various time intervals, media and homogenates of the tissue were assayed for lingual lipase and amylase activity and percentage secretion calculated. Histamine elicited moderate secretion (≈10%) of lingual lipase and amylase. In contrast, pyrilamine, and H(1) receptor antagonist, elicited>60% secretion. There were statistically significant differences between the percentage secretion of lingual lipase and amylase for basal secretion, as well as for histmine-and pyrilamine-evoked secretion of lingual lipase and amylase for basal secretion, as well as for histamine-and pyrilamine-evoked secretion above basal. The H(2) receptor inhibitors, cimetidine and ranitidine, stimulated secretion of only amylase, but not lingual lipase. When combined with histamine, these antagonists partially inhibited only the secretion of histamine-evoked lingual lipase, but not amylase. The differences in percentage secretion between the two enzymes indicate that exocytosis may not be the only process involved in protein secretion. The anomalous effects of the H(1) and H(2) receptor antagonists necessitate a more detailed characterization of the receptors of von Ebner's glands.","Field, Ruth B.; Chirtel, Stuart J.",Agents Actions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087539/,138

The conclusion was reached that the viruses investigated do not play a major role in the natural history of chronic obstructive lung disease. This is based on the following observations: a. The rate of viral infections associated with respiratory disease or acute exacerbations of the bronchitis is low (see Tables 2 and 6). b. Respiratory disease before the first examination is not caused by these viruses to any appreciable extent (see Table 3). c. Antibody level in patients' sera against individual viruses or groups of viruses do not indicate protection against subsequent respiratory disease or against a deterioration of bronchial function (see Tables 4 and 5).","Klaer, W.; Reinert, Bergith; Trendelenburg, F.; Wigand, R.",Pneumonologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087550/,138
5118,Proteomic Profiling of HL-60 Cells during ATRA-Induced Differentiation,2018-08-18,"Intracellular protein distribution and sorting were examined in rat parotid striated duct cells, in which tissue kallikrein is apical, and Na,K-ATPase is basolateral. Electron-microscopic immunogold cytochemistry, with both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, demonstrated these enzymes at opposite poles of the cells and in distinct intracellular sites. Kallikrein was found within apical secretory granules, whereas Na,K-ATPase was present on basolateral cell membranes. In addition, kallikrein was localized throughout cisternae of all Golgi profiles, whereas Na,K-ATPase (α-subunit) was found only in small peripheral vesicles and/or lateral cisternal extensions of a basal subset of Golgi profiles. These differences in the subcellular distribution of the two marker antigens were most clearly seen with double immunogold labelling. Our results suggest that kallikrein, an apical, regulated secretory protein, and Na,K-ATPase, a basolateral, constitutively transported membrane protein, are segregated at (or prior to) the level of the Golgi apparatus rather than in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), as was expected.","Simson, J.

5137,The Role of the Home Environment in the Transmission of Infectious Diseases,2002,"1. In order to characterize some of the molecular events leading to repair of myelin in the adult central nervous system (CNS), we examined the expression of transcripts for myelin basic protein (MBP) during remyelination in the mouse. C57B1/6 mice develop a demyelinating disease when glial cells are selectively infected by the A59 strain of mouse coronavrius. The virus is spontaneously cleared from the mice by 4 weeks postinfection (WPI), a time when remyelination is starting. 2. At 3 WPI total MBP transcripts are decreased by 75% in demyelinating lesions compared to control white matter. Using RNase protection assays andin situ hybridization with probes for particular MBP exons, we detected an increase in MBP transcripts containing exon 2 information, coincident with the earliest histological signs of remyelination. 3. The expression of MBP transcripts containing exon 2 information was first seen clustered in the perinuclear cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes scattered within the lesions. This is reminiscent of the increased levels and perinuclear clustering of MBP transcripts containing exon 2 seen during early developmental myelination. The peak abundance of exon 2-containing transcripts in the lesions was 13-fold that seen in control white matter. At later stages of remyelination, additional forms of MBP transcripts (without exon 2) increased and their distribution was more diffuse. 4. Thus, during remyelination, preforms of MBP transcripts, which are normally present at low levels in the adult CNS, are abundantly expressed and regulated in a manner similar to that observed in developmental myelination.","Jordan, Craig A.; Friedrich, Victor L.; de Ferra, Francesca; Weismiller, David G.; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Dubois-Dalcq, Monique",Cell Mol Neurobiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087849/,138

We measured mucosal and systemic immune parameters at the time of vaccination with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in 292 Indian infants aged 6–11 months, including plasma cytokines, leukocyte counts, fecal biomarkers of environmental enteropathy and peripheral blood T-cell phenotype, focused on gut-homing regulatory CD4+ populations. We did not find a distinct immune phenotype associated with OPV immunogenicity, although viral pathogens were more prevalent in stool at the time of immunization among infants who failed to seroconvert (63.9% vs. 45.6%, p = 0.002). Using a machine-learning approach, we could predict seroconversion a priori using immune parameters and infection status with a median 58% accuracy (cross-validation IQR: 50–69%) compared with 50% expected by chance. Better identification of immune predictors of OPV immunogenicity is likely to require sampling of mucosal tissue and improved oral poliovirus infection models.","Babji, Sudhir; Manickavasagam, Punithavathy; Chen, Yin-Huai; Jeyavelu, Nithya; Jose, Nisha Vincy; Praharaj, Ira; Syed, Chanduni; Kaliappan, Saravanakumar Puthupalayam; John, Jacob; Giri, Sidhartha; Venugopal, Srinivasan; Kampmann, Beate; Parker, Edward P.

DESIGN: A consensus committee of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups had teleconference and electronic-based discussion. The entire committee iteratively developed the entire document and recommendations. METHODS: Each committee member independently gave their top five priorities for sepsis research. A total of 88 suggestions (ESM 1 - supplemental table 1) were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, leading to the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup had teleconferences to go over each priority followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science. RESULTS: The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Of these, the top six clinical priorities were identified and include the following questions: (1) can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times?; (2) what are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?; (3) should rapid diagnostic tests be implemented in clinical practice?; (4) should empiric antibiotic combination therapy be used in sepsis or septic shock?; (5) what are the predictors of sepsis long-term morbidity and mortality?; and (6) what information identifies organ dysfunction? CONCLUSIONS: While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines give multiple recommendations on the treatment of sepsis, significant knowledge gaps remain, both in bedside issues directly applicable to clinicians, as well as understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of sepsis. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

6337,Modulation of Sodium Transport in Alveolar Epithelial Cells by Estradiol and Progesterone,2011,"Influenza virus infection (IVI) is typically subclinical or causes a self-limiting upper respiratory disease. However, in a small subset of patients IVI rapidly progresses to primary viral pneumonia (PVP) with respiratory failure; a minority of patients require intensive care unit admission. Inherited and acquired variability in host immune responses may influence susceptibility and outcome of IVI. However, the molecular basis of such human factors remains largely elusive. It has been proposed that homozygosity for IFITM3 rs12252-C is associated with a population-attributable risk of 5.4 % for severe IVI in Northern Europeans and 54.3 % for severe H1N1pdm infection in Chinese. A total of 148 patients with confirmed IVI were considered for recruitment; 118 Spanish patients (60 of them hospitalized with PVP) and 246 healthy Spanish individuals were finally included in the statistical analysis. PCR-RFLP was used with confirmation by Sanger sequencing. The allele frequency for rs12252-C was found to be 3.5 % among the general Spanish population. We found no rs12252-C homozygous individuals in our control group. The only Spanish patient homozygous for rs12252-C had a neurological disorder (a known risk factor for severe IVI) and mild influenza. Our data do not suggest a role of rs12252-C in the development of severe IVI in our population. These data may be relevant to recognize whether patients homozygous for rs12252-C are at risk of severe influenza, and hence require individualized measures in the case of IVI.","López-Rodríguez, M.; Herrera-Ramos, E.; Solé-Violán, J.; Ruíz-Hernández, J.

Four of the patients had been treated with high-dose cytosine arabinoside as part of the cytostatic regimen, six had a central venous line and four patients had oral lesions prior to the infection. Selective gut decontamination consisted of co-trimoxazole/colistin in five patients and quinolones in three patients. The first three patients died, either due to interstitial pneumonia with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or due to infection-triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation despite prompt empiric antibiotic therapy including vancomycin. The other patients improved after empiric supplementation of penicillin G (30 Mega/day) to the antibiotic regimen. Beginning ARDS in two of these patients dramatically responded to high-dose steriods. We conclude thatSt. mitis is a major pathogen in neutropenic leukemic patients. Infection appears to occur independently of acute leukemic cell type, regimen of selective gut decontamination, venous access, visible oral lesions or treatment with highdose cytosine arabinoside. The clinical course of our patients raises questions about the value of commonly recommended empiric antibiotic regimens, which were clearly ineffective to control infections withSt. mitis in this patient group. Our data indicate that immediate antibiotic therapy with penicillin G is indicated and may be life-saving for suspectedSt. mitis infections in neutropenic leukemic patients.","Arning, M.; Gehrt, A.; Aul, C.; Runde, V.; Hadding, U.; Schneider, W.",Blut,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101690/,138

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 patients underwent (99m)Tc-DTPA inhalation lung scintigraphy. Six region of interest (ROI) patterns were adopted: ROI 1 was outlined around the entire hemithorax, and ROIs 2–6 were outlined around the hemithorax but excluded square ROIs of different size in the hilar region. Half-times (T(½)) were calculated with time-activity curves using onecompartment and two-compartment analyses. The T(½) of ROIs 1–5 were plotted against the T(½) of ROI 6, and regression lines were obtained with the least-squares method. The absolute values of the differences between surveyed values and regression line were calculated. The Wilcoxon test for trend and a single linear regression model were used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: There were significant reductions in the absolute values of the differences between surveyed values and regression line from ROIs 1–5 by one-component analysis and the fast component of two-compartment analysis (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the deposition of radioaerosol in the hilar region affects the clearance rate of (99m)Tc-DTPA from the alveoli in damaged lungs. The hilar region should be excluded from ROIs when alveolar epithelial permeability is evaluated.","Ogi, Shigeyuki; Gotoh, Eisuke; Uchiyama, Mayuki; Fukuda, Kunihiko; Urashima, Mitsuyoshi; Fukumitsu, Nobuyoshi",Jpn J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101729/,138

Artificial transcription factors are a potentially powerful molecular strategy for improving cellulase production in T. reesei. In this study, enhanced transcriptional activators XYR1VP, ACE2VP, and ACE1VP were constructed by linking the C terminus of XYR1, ACE2, or ACE1 with an activation domain of herpes simplex virus protein VP16. T. reesei transformants T(XYR1VP), T(ACE2VP), and T(ACE1VP) showed improved cellulase and/or xylanase production. T(XYR1VP) has a cellulase-free phenotype but with significantly elevated xylanase production.

Patients for whom all three criteria were adverse constituted class 3, patients with none of the adverse criteria constituted class one and patients with one or various association of the adverse criteria formed Class 2. Most patients older than 16 years have disease characteristics that place them in class 3 with very few in class 2.

Given the limited evidence, lack of standardized practice, and variable perception of procedural safety, uncertainty still exists on what constitutes the best approach in critically ill patients with immunocompromised state who present with pulmonary infiltrates in the era of prophylactic antimicrobials and the presence of new diagnostic tests. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic yield, safety and impact of FB and BAL on management decisions in immunocompromised critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A prospective, observational study of 106 non-HIV immunocompromised patients admitted to the intensive care unit with pulmonary infiltrates who underwent FB with BAL. RESULTS: FB and BAL established the diagnosis in 38 (33%) of cases, and had a positive impact on management in 44 (38.3%) of cases. Escalation of ventilator support was not required in 94 (81.7%) of cases, while 18 (15.7%) required invasive and 3 (2.6%) required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation after the procedure. Three patients (2.6%) died within 24 h of bronchoscopy, and 46 patients (40%) died in ICU. Significant hypoxemia developed in 5% of cases. CONCLUSION: FB can be safely performed in immunocompromised critically ill patients in the ICU. The yield can be improved when FB is done prior to initiation of empiric antimicrobials, within 24 h of admission to the ICU, and in patients with focal disease.","Al-Qadi, Mazen O.; Cartin-Ceba, Rodrigo; Kashyap, Rahul; Kaur, Sumanjit; Peters, Steve G.",Lung,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102260/,138
6949,Effects of in vivo Soluble Selectin Gene Introduction on LPS-Induced Leukocyte Accumulation in the Murine Lung,1999,"ABSTRACT: To better understand the impact of severe illness on the amino acid economy and nutritional needs of pediatric patients, we studied plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine kinetics in eleven critically ill patients (six full-term newborns and five young infants). Within 48 h of the diagnosis of sepsis they were given primed constant i.v. infusions of L-[1-(13)C]phenylalanine and L-[3,3,(2)H(2)]tyrosine for 4 h. Routine nutritional support continued during this period by parentcral administration of dextrose, lipid emulsion, and an amino acid mixture low in tyrosine. Phenylalanine and tyrosine fluxes and rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation did not differ significantly between the two age groups, and so the data were combined for evaluation. For the entire group, values (μmol-kg(−1)-h(−1); mean ± SD) for phenylalanine and tyrosine fluxes and rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation were 132 ± 24, 66 ± 16, and 29 ± 12, respectively. Plasma phenylalanine to tyrosine concentration ratio was 1.67 ± 0.6. From a comparison of the rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation with measured phenylalanine intakes, it was concluded that their routine, clinical nutritional support was inadequate to achieve body phenylalanine balance. In comparison with published data, the relative rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation appears to be high. We speculate that tyrosine is a conditionally indispensable amino acid under these conditions; it would be desirable to establish the intake levels and ratio of phenylalanine to tyrosine that effectively support aromatic amino acid balance in these critically ill patients.","Castillo, Leticia; Yu, Y Ming; Marchini, J Sergio; Chapman, Thomas E; Sanchez, Melchor; Young, Vernon R; Burke, John F",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102387/,138

Here we report that histone H1 efficiently blocks furin-dependent pro-von Willebrand factor (pro-vWF) processing in a dose-dependent manner. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies confirmed that histone H1 could interact with furin, and the interaction mainly took place on the cell surface. We noted that histone H1 was released from cells undergoing necrosis and apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2).

To study the functions of GM-CSF in the central nervous system (CNS), we examined the effects of GM-CSF on cytokine production by glial cells. GM-CSF induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by microglia, but not by astrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by bioassay and the detection of IL-6 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. GM-CSF did not induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a or IL-1 in microglia and astrocytes, whereas lipopolysaccharide induced all these cytokines. The induction of IL-6 by GM-CSF in microglia was completely inhibited by antibodies to GM-CSF. Neither IL-3 nor macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) induced IL-6 production in microglia. Given that IL-1 and TNFα, monokines derived from microglia, induce IL-6 production in astrocytes, but not in microglia, results indicate that astrocytes and microglia may mutually regulate IL-6 production by different cytokines.","Suzumura, Akio; Sawada, Makoto; Marunouchi, Tohru",Brain Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111018/,138
7547,Nieuwe influenza A (H1N1) - Mexicaanse griep,2009,"Organisms throughout biology need to maintain the integrity of their genome. From bacteria to vertebrates, life has established sophisticated mechanisms to detect and eliminate foreign genetic material or to restrict its function and replication. Tremendous progress has been made in the understanding of these mechanisms which keep foreign or unwanted nucleic acids from viruses or phages in check. Mechanisms reach from restriction-modification systems and CRISPR/Cas in bacteria and archaea to RNA interference and immune sensing of nucleic acids, altogether integral parts of a system which is now appreciated as nucleic acid immunity. With inherited receptors and acquired sequence information, nucleic acid immunity comprises innate and adaptive components. Effector functions include diverse nuclease systems, intrinsic activities to directly restrict the function of foreign nucleic acids (e.g., PKR, ADAR1, IFIT1), and extrinsic pathways to alert the immune system and to elicit cytotoxic immune responses. These effects act in concert to restrict viral replication and to eliminate virus-infected cells. The principles of nucleic acid immunity are highly relevant for human disease. Besides its essential contribution to antiviral defense and restriction of endogenous retroelements, dysregulation of nucleic acid immunity can also lead to erroneous detection and response to self nucleic acids then causing sterile inflammation and autoimmunity. Even mechanisms of nucleic acid immunity which are not established in vertebrates are relevant for human disease when they are present in pathogens such as bacteria, parasites, or helminths or in pathogen-transmitting organisms such as insects. This review aims to provide an overview of the diverse mechanisms of nucleic acid immunity which mostly have been looked at separately in the past and to integrate them under the framework nucleic acid immunity as a basic principle of life, the understanding of which has great potential to advance medicine.","Hartmann, G.",Adv Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112058/,138

8047,SELECTED EPIDEMICS & EMERGING PATHOGENS – RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES – AN OVERVIEW,2017-09-12,"Studies are described in which hybridoma technology is used to produce a variety of reagents for the characterization and manipulation of the bovine humoral immune system. Selected members of a set of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for each of four major isotypes of bovine Ig constant regions, one specific for anti-bovine Ig constant regions as well as one specific for anti-bovine light chains are discussed. Interspecific fusion of bovine lymphocytes with the established mouse cell line, SP2/0 was used to produce a collection of stable hybridomas among which were found secretors of bovine IgG1, IgG2, IgM, IgA and bovine light chain. Interspecific fusion of SP2/0 with lymphocytes from a multiparous Holstein four days post immunization with Streptococcus agalactiae yielded MAb with specificity for the immunizing antigen. One of these hybridomas, LHRB 19.17, which displayed a particularly stable secretory phenotype, was used as an immunogen for the production of a library of murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies. Competitive antigen binding analysis showed that 15 of the 24 anti-LHRB 19.17 idiotype antibodies isolated blocked the binding of the idiotype to its nominal antigen and so were candidates for evaluation as antigen mimics. Some of the ways in which monoclonal anti-idiotypes in particular, and monoclonal in general, might be of use in problems of animal disease are discussed.","Goldsby, R.A.; Srikumaran, S.; Arulanandam, A.; Hague, B.; Ponce De Leon, F.A.; Sevoian, M.; Guidry, A.J.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126093/,138

Multivariable logistic regression, based on retrospective data collected for 194 cases (cats that died or were euthanased) and 320 controls (cats that did not die) revealed an increased risk of mortality for cats admitted to adoption centres unneutered, in fair/poor health and cats born at adoption centres. Cats aged 7 weeks or less and cats aged over 7 years had an increased risk of mortality compared with cats of other ages. The risk of mortality decreased as the time in the adoption centre increased. Cats with disabilities (eg, blindness) had a higher mortality risk than cats without disabilities. Knowledge of these risk factors can inform intervention strategies aimed at reducing the risk of cat mortality at adoption centres.","Murray, Jane K.; Skillings, Elizabeth; Gruffydd-Jones, Timothy J.",J Feline Med Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129399/,138

Antibody-sensitized, FIPV challenged—kittens developed earlier clinical signs (including pyrexia, icterus, and thrombocytopenia) and died more rapidly than did non-sensitized, FIPV-challenged kittens. Mean survival time in sensitized kittens was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced compared to non-sensitized kittens (mean ± SEM, 10.0 ± 0.6 days vs. 28.8 ± 8.3 days, respectively). Lesions induced included fibrinous peritonitis, disseminated pyogranulomatous inflammation and necrotizing phlebitis and periphlebitis. FIPV antigen, immunoglobulin G, complement (C3) and fibrinogen were demonstrated in lesions by immunofluorescence microscopy. The pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in persons bears striking resemblance to that of FIP in experimental kittens. In both FIP and DHF, non-neutralizing antibody may promote acute disease by enhancement of virus infection in mononuclear phagocytes or by formation of immune complexes, activation of complement and secondary vascular disturbances.","Weiss, Richard C; Scott, Fredric W",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134169/,138

9798,The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in red blood cells selectively takes up serum proteins that affect host pathogenicity,2020-04-15,"BACKGROUND: Development assistance for health (DAH) is one of the most important means for Japan to promote diplomacy with developing countries and contribute to the international community. This study, for the first time, estimated the gross disbursement of Japan’s DAH from 2012 to 2016 and clarified its flows, including source, aid type, channel, target region, and target health focus area. METHODS: Data on Japan Tracker, the first data platform of Japan’s DAH, were used. The DAH definition was based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) sector classification. Regarding core funding to non-health-specific multilateral agencies, we estimated DAH and its flows based on the OECD methodology for calculating imputed multilateral official development assistance (ODA). RESULTS: Japan’s DAH was estimated at 1472.94 (2012), 823.15 (2013), 832.06 (2014), 701.98 (2015), and 894.57 million USD (2016) in constant prices of 2016. Multilateral agencies received the largest DAH share of 44.96–57.01% in these periods, followed by bilateral grants (34.59–53.08%) and bilateral loans (1.96–15.04%). Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) was the largest contributors to the DAH (76.26–82.68%), followed by Ministry of Finance (MOF) (10.86–16.25%). Japan’s DAH was most heavily distributed in the African region with 41.64–53.48% share. The channel through which the most DAH went was Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (20.04–34.89%). Between 2012 and 2016, approximately 70% was allocated to primary health care and the rest to health system strengthening. CONCLUSIONS: With many major high-level health related meetings ahead, coming years will play a powerful opportunity to reevaluate DAH and shape the future of DAH for Japan. We hope that the results of this study will enhance the social debate for and contribute to the implementation of Japan’s DAH with a more efficient and effective strategy.","Nomura, Shuhei; Sakamoto, Haruka; Sugai, Maaya Kita; Nakamura, Haruyo; Maruyama-Sakurai, Keiko; Lee, Sangnim; Ishizuka, Aya; Shibuya, Kenji",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161223/,138

In the Cyclades plateau (Aegean Sea), a qualitative and quantitative analysis of macro‐benthic fauna was carried out in 1986. Standard multivariate analysis techniques were applied to both ecological (living benthic fauna) and paleoecological data sets in order to distinguish distribution patterns. Results showed that caution must prevail in drawing conclusions from a limited data set. The clearest classification was obtained using total living fauna, while the dead molluscan fauna gave a similar pattern; this indicates similar response to the environmental conditions of the area. In the analysis of the living molluscan fauna, the groups failed to show any clusters, probably as an effect of some impoverished sites. In the two groups delineated, depth seems to be the major factor in the distribution of species. The fact that two distinct data sets (subfossil assemblages and living communities), when treated separately, produce similar grouping indicates that the subfossil assemblages could be reliably used as a first approach for determination of the living communities' distribution patterns.","Zenetos, Argyro; Papathanassiou, Evangelos; Aartsen, Jacobus J.

It increases user’s comfort and diagnosis quality of chronic cardiac and/or high-risk patients. This paper covers the enormous data to be transmitted from the ECG device to the physician’s, namely the cardiologist’s, control unit. Existent ECG devices uniformly sample analog signals and convert them to digital samples which are compressed before data transmission. However, event-driven sampling simultaneously compresses and samples. Therefore, this paper quantitatively compares successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) compression and level-crossing analog-to-digital converter (LC-ADC). Evaluation metrics are the percent root-mean-square difference ([Formula: see text] ), bit compression ratio ([Formula: see text] ) and data length in bits. When a 12-bit reconstruction is operated on the outputs of an 8-bit LC-ADC with 12-bit and 10-kHz reference counter, the [Formula: see text] is equal to 80% for 75% of test ECG signals. That is better than the 71.87% [Formula: see text] of the 12-bit 1-kHz SAR ADC with DWT compression. The modeled LC-ADC guarantees a signal quality in terms of [Formula: see text] comparable to the [Formula: see text] of the SAR ADC with DWT compression. The data length in bits of the LC-ADC is lower than the data length in bits of the SAR ADC with more than 14-bit resolution with DWT compression for 82% of the test ECG signals. However, for lower resolutions, to obtain lower power consumption for radiofrequency transmission, a better alternative remains the SAR ADC with DWT compression.","Ben-Romdhane, Manel; Maalej, Asma; Tlili, Mariam; Rebai, Chiheb; Rivet, François; Dallet, Dominique",Arab J Sci Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223297/,138

There are very high similarities to humans in anatomy and functions of the immune system, e g., the presence of tonsils, which are absent in rodents. The porcine immune system resembles man for more than 80% of analyzed parameters in contrast to the mouse with only about 10%. The pig can easily be bred, and there are less emotional problems to use them as experimental animals than dogs or monkeys. Indwelling cannulas in a vein or lymphatic vessel enable repetitive stress-free sampling. Meanwhile, there are many markers available to characterize immune cells. Lymphoid organs, their function, and their role in lymphocyte kinetics (proliferation and migration) are reviewed. For long-term experiments, minipigs (e.g., Göttingen minipig) are available. Pigs can be kept under gnotobiotic (germfree) conditions for some time after birth to study the effects of microbiota. The effects of probiotics can be tested on the gut immune system. The lung has been used for extracorporeal preservation and immune engineering. After genetic modifications are established, the pig is the best animal model for future xenotransplantation to reduce the problem of organ shortage for organ transplantation. Autotransplantation of particles of lymphnodes regenerates in the subcutaneous tissue. This is a model to treat secondary lymphedema patients.

12127,Lung-resident mesenchymal stromal cells are tissue-specific regulators of lung homeostasis,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of endothelial cells and vascular system is one of the most important pathological changes of porcine circovirus disease (PCVD) caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). PCV2-infected endothelial cells can upregulate the production of endothelial-derived IL-8, which can inhibit the maturation of dendritic cells. Endothelial-derived IL-8 has different structural and biological characteristics compared with monocyte-derived IL-8. However, the mechanism of endothelial-derived IL-8 production is still unclear. RESULTS: Key molecules of RIG-I-like signaling pathway RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS and a key molecule of JNK signaling pathway c-Jun in PCV2-infected porcine iliac artery endothelial cells (PIECs) were upregulated significantly detected with quantitative PCR, Western blot and fluorescence confocal microscopy, while no significant changes were found in NF-κB signaling pathway. Meanwhile, the expression of endothelial-derived IL-8 was downregulated after RIG-I, MDA-5, or MAVS genes in PIECs were knocked down and PIECs were treated by JNK inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: PCV2 can activate RIG-I/MDA-5/MAVS/JNK signaling pathway to induce the production of endothelial-derived IL-8 in PIECs, which provides an insight into the further study of endothelial dysfunction and vascular system disorder caused by PCV2.","Shi, Fengyang; Li, Qiuming; Liu, Shiyu; Liu, Fengying; Wang, Jianfang; Cui, Defeng; Hou, Xiaolin; Zhou, Shuanghai; Zhang, Yonghong; Li, Huanrong",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7392700/,138

Precision medicine refers to matching the right medicine to the right patients based on their molecular signatures. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the mechanism of tumorigenesis and drug resistance is essential to precision medicine. CRISPR-cas9 system is a powerful tool for gene editing and CRISPR-based high-throughput screening has been widely applied especially in searching for tumor-driven or synergistic lethal genes aiming to overcome drug resistance.

In this review, we describe the anatomical organization of the cholinergic system and the key nAChR subtypes mediating cholinergic regulation of DA transmission and nicotine reward and dependence, in an effort to identify potential targets for smoking intervention. Cholinergic modulation of midbrain DA systems relies on topographic organization of mesopontine cholinergic projections, and activation of nAChRs in midbrain DA neurons. Previous studies have revealed that α4, α6, and β2 subunit-containing nAChRs expressed in midbrain DA neurons and their terminals in the striatum regulate firings of midbrain DA neurons and activity-dependent dopamine release in the striatum. These nAChRs undergo modification upon chronic nicotine exposure. Clinical investigation has demonstrated that partial agonists of these receptors elevate the success rate of smoking cessation relative to placebo.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a potential therapy for mucositis but efficient product is not available because the enzyme is degraded following oral administration or induces an immune reaction after intravascular infusion. Multi-modified Stable Anti-Oxidant Enzymes(®) (MS-AOE(®)) is a new recombinant SOD with better resistance to pepsin and trypsin. We referred it as MS-SOD to distinguish from other SODs. In this study we investigated its potential to alleviate 5-FU-induced intestinal injury and the mechanisms. An intestinal mucositis model was established in C57/BL6 mice by 5-day administration of 5-FU (50 mg/kg every day, ip). MS-SOD (800 IU/10 g, ig) was given once daily for 9 days. 5-FU caused severe mucositis with intestinal morphological damage, bodyweight loss and diarrhea; MS-SOD significantly decreased the severity. 5-FU markedly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines in the intestine which were ameliorated by MS-SOD. Furthermore, MS-SOD modified intestinal microbes, particularly reduced Verrucomicrobia, compared with the 5-FU group. In Caco2 cells, MS-SOD (250–1000 U/mL) dose-dependently decreased tBHP-induced ROS generation. In RAW264.7 cells, MS-SOD (500 U/mL) had no effect on LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines, but inhibited iNOS expression. These results demonstrate that MS-SOD can scavenge ROS at the initial stage of injury, thus play an indirect role in anti-inflammatory and barrier protein protection. In conclusion, MS-SOD attenuates 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis by suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation, and influencing microbes. MS-SOD may exert beneficial effect in prevention of intestinal mucositis during chemotherapy in clinic.","Yan, Xiao-xia; Li, Hai-long; Zhang, Yi-ting; Wu, Shou-yan; Lu, Heng-lei; Yu, Xiao-lu; Meng, Fan-guo; Sun, Jian-hua; Gong, Li-kun",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468365/,138

In this study, we performed a structure-based similarity search and found 16 hit compounds. Among the 16 hits, (1S,6S,7R)-6-(acetyloxy)-1-[(3-methylbutanoyl)oxy]-4a,5,6,7a-tetrahydro-1H-spiro[cyclopenta[c]pyran-7,2’-oxiran]-4-ylmethyl 3-methylbutanoate (denoted as Amcp) exhibited superior anticancer activity against human pancreatic cancer BxPC-3 and SW1990 cells. The anti-proliferation activity of Amcp was validated in human pancreatic cancer BxPC-3 and SW1990 cells in vitro. Amcp more effectively induced apoptosis in BxPC-3 and SW1990 cells than gemcitabine. At a concentration of 15 μM, Amcp significantly suppressed the PI3K/AKT pathway and disrupted the mitochondrial membrane equilibrium through modulation of Noxa and Mcl-1 balance in both cell lines. Meanwhile, knockdown of Noxa substantially attenuated Amcp-induced reduction of cell viability and anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 level in BxPC-3 cells. In addition, Amcp showed synergistic anticancer effects when combined with gemcitabine in BxPC-3 cells. To conclude, this work not only suggests that Amcp possesses a dual-inhibitory activity towards PI3K/AKT pathway and Mcl-1, but also enlightens further development of bioactive valepotriate derivatives.","Yan, You-you; Shi, Ke-yu; Teng, Fei; Chen, Jing; Che, Jin-xin; Dong, Xiao-wu; Lin, Neng-ming; Zhang, Bo",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470838/,138
12872,Preclinical PK/PD model for the combinatorial use of dexamethasone and sulpiride in the treatment of breast cancer,2019-06-05,"Evidence to date suggests that β-arrestins act beyond their role as adapter proteins. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) may be a factor in inflammation and fibrosis in the pathogenesis of heart failure. In the present study we investigated the effect of AVP on inflammatory cytokine IL-6 production in murine hearts and the impact of β-arrestin 2-dependent signaling on AVP-induced IL-6 production. We found that administration of AVP (0.5 U/kg, iv) markedly increased the levels of IL-6 mRNA in rat hearts with the maximum level occurred at 6 h. In β-arrestin 2 KO mouse hearts, deletion of β-arrestin 2 decreased AVP-induced IL-6 mRNA expression. We then performed in vitro experiments in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts (ARCFs). We found that AVP (10(−9)–10(−6) M) dose-dependently increased the expression of IL-6 mRNA and protein, activation of NF-κB signaling and ERK(1/2) phosphorylation, whereas knockdown of β-arrestin 2 blocked AVP-induced IL-6 increase, NF-κB activation and ERK(1/2) phosphorylation. Pharmacological blockade of ERK(1/2) using PD98059 diminished AVP-induced NF-κB activation and IL-6 production. The selective V(1A) receptor antagonist SR49059 effectively blocked AVP-induced NF-κB phosphorylation and activation as well as IL-6 expression in ARCFs. In AVP-treated mice, pre-injection of SR49059 (2 mg/kg, iv) abolished AVP-induced NF-κB activation and IL-6 production in hearts. The above results suggest that AVP induces IL-6 induction in murine hearts via the V(1A) receptor-mediated β-arrestin2/ERK(1/2)/NF-κB pathway, thus reveal a novel mechanism of myocardial inflammation in heart failure involving the V(1A)/β-arrestin 2/ERK(1/2)/NF-κB signaling pathway.","Sun, Shu-zhen; Cao, Hong; Yao, Na; Zhao, Ling-ling; Zhu, Xiao-fang; Ni, Er-an; Zhu, Qi; Zhu, Wei-zhong",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470839/,138

Previous studies have shown that metoprolol prevents several chronic OSA-induced cardiovascular diseases through inhibiting autonomic nerve hyperactivity. It remains unclear whether chronic OSA can lead to dendritic remodeling in the brain, and whether metoprolol affects the dendritic remodeling. In this study we investigated the effect of metoprolol on dendrite morphology in a canine model of chronic OSA, which was established in beagles through clamping and reopening the endotracheal tube for 4 h every other day for 12 weeks. OSA beagles were administered metoprolol (5 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1)). The dendritic number, length, crossings and spine density of neurons in hippocampi and prefrontal cortices were assessed by Golgi staining. And the protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured by Western blotting. We showed that chronic OSA successfully induced significant brain hypoxia evidenced by increased HIF-1α levels in CA1 region and dentate gyrus of hippocampi, as well as in prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, OSA led to markedly decreased dendrite number, length and intersections, spine loss as well as reduced BDNF levels. Administration of metoprolol effectively prevented the dendritic remodeling and spine loss induced by chronic OSA. In addition, administration of metoprolol reversed the decreased BDNF, which might be associated with the metoprolol-induced neuronal protection. In conclusion, metoprolol protects against neuronal dendritic remodeling in hippocampi and prefrontal cortices induced by chronic OSA in canine.","Yang, Lin; Zhao, Jing; Qu, Yang; Sun, Qiang; Li, Ting-ting; Yan, Mei-ling; Duan, Ming-jing; Li, Ke-xin; Wang, Yan-ru; Huang, Si-yu; Zhang, Shuai; Li, Yue; Ai, Jing",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470867/,138

At a cellular level, we examined EDI metabolism across three cancer cell lines (B16 melanoma, TC2 prostate, and 4T1 breast cancer). Comparing the relative immunogenicity elicited by each EDI/cancer cell combination, we found that B16 cells produced the highest EDI prodrug immunogenicity, achieving >95% of that elicited by unmodified resiquimod, followed by TC2 and 4T1 cells (40% and 30%, respectively). Immunogenicity elicited was comparable for a given cell type and independent of the glycosidase substrate in the EDIs or differences in functional glycosidase activity between cell lines. Measuring drug efflux of the immunostimulant payload and efflux protein expression revealed that EDI/cancer cell-mediated immunogenicity was governed by efflux potential of the cancer cells. We determined that, following EDI conversion, immunostimulant efflux occurred through both P-glycoprotein-dependent and P-glycoprotein-independent transport mechanisms. Overall, this study highlights the broad ability of EDIs to couple immunogenicity to the metabolism of many cancers that exhibit drug efflux and suggests that designing future generations of EDIs with immunostimulant payloads that are optimized for drug efflux could be particularly beneficial.","Ryan, Austin T; Pulukuri, Anunay J; Davaritouchaee, Maryam; Abbasi, Armina; Hendricksen, Aaron T; Opp, Larissa K; Burt, Anthony J; Nielsen, Amy E; Mancini, Rock J",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470892/,138

12922,TLR4 deficiency has a protective effect in the MPTP/probenecid mouse model of Parkinson’s disease,2019-08-06,"The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways, especially the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, play vital roles in the development of many malignancies. Overactivation of STAT3 promotes cancer cell survival and proliferation. Therefore, the JAK2/STAT3-signaling pathway has been considered a promising target for cancer therapy. In this study, we identified a natural compound 3-deoxy-2β,16-dihydroxynagilactone E (B6) from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Podocarpus nagi as a potent inhibitor of STAT3 signaling. B6 preferentially inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 by interacting with and inactivating JAK2, the main upstream kinase of STAT3. B6 dose-dependently inhibited IL-6-induced STAT3 signaling with an IC(50) of 0.2 μM. In contrast to other JAK2 inhibitors, B6 did not interact with the catalytic domain but instead with the FERM-SH2 domain of JAK2. This interaction was JAK-specific since B6 had little effect on other tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, B6 potently inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells with overactivated STAT3. Taken together, our study uncovers a novel compound and a novel mechanism for the regulation of JAK2 and offers a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancers with overactivated JAK2/STAT3.","Shan, Hui; Yao, Sheng; Ye, Yang; Yu, Qiang",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471446/,138
12942,Recent advances in dopaminergic strategies for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease,2020-02-28,"Sunitinib is an oral small molecule multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which is currently used to treat severe cancers. Clinical research has shown that patients treated with sunitinib develop hypertension. As soon as sunitinib-induced hypertension appears, it is usual to administer anti-hypertension agent. But this treatment may cause acute blood pressure fluctuation which may lead to additional cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study is to establish a mathematical model for managing sunitinib-induced hypertension and blood pressure fluctuation. A mechanism-based PK/PD model was developed based on animal experiments. Then this model was used to perform simulations, thus to propose an anti-hypertension indication, according to which the anti-hypertension treatment might yield relative low-level AUC and fluctuation of blood pressure. The simulation results suggest that the anti-hypertension agent may yield low-level AUC and fluctuation of blood pressure when relative ET-1 level ranges from −15% to 5% and relative NO level is more than 10% compared to control group. Finally, animal experiments were conducted to verify the simulation results. Macitentan (30 mg/kg) was administered based on the above anti-hypertension indication. Compared with the untreated group, the optimized treatment significantly reduced the AUC of blood pressure; meanwhile the fluctuation of blood pressure in optimized treatment group was 70% less than that in immediate treatment group. This work provides a novel model with potential translational value for managing sunitinib-induced hypertension.","Liu, Hao-chen; Zhou, Xiao-ting; Zheng, Yun-si; He, Hua; Liu, Xiao-quan",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471499/,138

Cryo-electron microscopy reveals a large assembly at the ribosome exit tunnel organized around a central membrane cavity. Similar to protein-conducting channels that facilitate movement of transmembrane segments, cytosolic and luminal funnels in TMCO1 and TMEM147, respectively, suggest routes into the central membrane cavity. High-throughput mRNA sequencing shows selective translocon engagement with hundreds of different multi-pass membrane proteins. Consistent with a role in multi-pass membrane protein biogenesis, cells lacking different accessory components show reduced levels of one such client, the glutamate transporter EAAT1.

13257,An overview of moonlighting proteins in Staphylococcus aureus infection,2020-10-13,"This review summarizes the latest advancements in phytochemicals as functional antiviral agents. We focused on flavonoids, like apigenin, vitexin, quercetin, rutin and naringenin, which have shown a wide range of biological effects including antiviral activities. The molecular mechanisms of their antiviral effects mainly consist in the inhibition of viral neuraminidase, proteases and DNA/RNA polymerases, as well as in the modification of various viral proteins. Mixtures of different flavonoids or combination of flavonoids with antiviral synthetic drugs provide an enhancement of their antiviral effects. Recent strategies in drug delivery significantly contribute to overcoming the low bioavailability of flavonoids. Frequent viral infections worldwide have led to the need for new effective antiviral agents, which can be identified among the various phytochemicals. In this light, screening the antiviral activities of a cocktail of flavonoids would be advantageous in order to prevent viral infections and improve current antiviral therapies.","Ninfali, Paolino; Antonelli, Antonella; Magnani, Mauro; Scarpa, Emanuele Salvatore",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551920/,138

Surveillance studies often pose questions about malaria parasite ancestry (e.g. how antimalarial resistance has spread) and employ statistical methods that characterise parasite population structure. Many of the methods used to characterise structure are unsupervised machine learning algorithms which depend on a genetic distance matrix, notably principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC). PCoA and HAC are sensitive to both the definition of genetic distance and algorithmic specification. Importantly, neither algorithm infers malaria parasite ancestry. As such, PCoA and HAC can inform (e.g. via exploratory data visualisation and hypothesis generation), but not answer comprehensively, key questions about malaria parasite ancestry. We illustrate the sensitivity of PCoA and HAC using 393 Plasmodium falciparum whole genome sequences collected from Cambodia and neighbouring regions (where antimalarial resistance has emerged and spread recently) and we provide tentative guidance for the use and interpretation of PCoA and HAC in malaria parasite genetic epidemiology. This guidance includes a call for fully transparent and reproducible analysis pipelines that feature (i) a clearly outlined scientific question; (ii) a clear justification of analytical methods used to answer the scientific question along with discussion of any inferential limitations; (iii) publicly available genetic distance matrices when downstream analyses depend on them; and (iv) sensitivity analyses. To bridge the inferential disconnect between the output of non-inferential unsupervised learning algorithms and the scientific questions of interest, tailor-made statistical models are needed to infer malaria parasite ancestry. In the absence of such models speculative reasoning should feature only as discussion but not as results.","Watson, James A.; Taylor, Aimee R.; Ashley, Elizabeth A.; Dondorp, Arjen; Buckee, Caroline O.; White, Nicholas J.; Holmes, Chris C.",PLoS Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7577480/,138

However, in the context of increasingly pressurised clinics, there is a tendency to resort to written information leaflets not suited to patients with visual impairment, non-English speakers or those with low levels of literacy. Video-based media could be harnessed to enhance clinician-patient communication. This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy of using video-based media for patient education in ophthalmology. A pre-defined search strategy was used by two independent researchers to systematically review the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases. Eligible articles included peer-reviewed studies involving ophthalmology patients, who received a solely video-based educational intervention to assess for improvement in patient knowledge, behaviour and overall health-related outcomes. The search yielded 481 studies of which 31 passed initial screening. Following full-text analysis, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which seven studies (58.3%) were randomised controlled trials. The majority of studies (58.3%) reported outcomes on patient comprehension with 5/7 (71%) showing statistically significant improvement after video intervention. Four studies (33.3%) reported on patient performance in a task (e.g. drop application method) or overall health-related outcome with 2/4 (50%) showing statistically significant improvement after intervention. Though more evidence is needed, the use of video-based media appears to be effective in improving patient understanding and in certain cases may ameliorate overall outcome. There is a paucity of well-designed studies and future research is required to fully examine the role of video-based media in patient education.","Farwana, Reem; Sheriff, Adam; Manzar, Haider; Farwana, Mohammad; Yusuf, Ammar; Sheriff, Ibrahim",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608108/,138

Genetic knowledge and knowledge gained from experience influence decision making on participation in genetic testing and understanding carrier test results. In this study we assessed whether parents and relatives of patients with the severe AR condition mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), who are expected to have genetic and experiential knowledge, have more positive attitudes toward ECS than the Dutch reference group. Parents of all MPS III patients known to the Dutch expert center were invited to participate and asked to invite first and second degree relatives. The online questionnaire started with an educational text, and assessed attitudes toward ECS, genetic knowledge and perceived MPS III severity. Results were compared with the Dutch population. Parents and relatives of MPS III patients (n = 159) scored higher on the genetic knowledge test and perceived MPS III as more severe compared with the general Dutch population (n = 781). Parents and relatives reported to be more likely to participate in ECS (84.3% and 62.5%, respectively) compared with the public (31%) (p < 0.001). Being a relative of a MPS III patient was the strongest variable in the regression analyses for intended ECS participation. Our results show that genetic knowledge influences ECS decision making.

These trials have been superseded by larger, more carefully designed and conducted multi-centre trials. Progress in trial conduct has been facilitated by a greater understanding of statistical concepts and methodological design.

Although there are a few studies that assessed mental disorders, suicide or suicidal behaviors are not investigated yet. Hence, the present study for the first time investigated suicidal behaviors and its relationship with socio-demographics, flood effects and psychopathology. METHODS: A cross-sectional interview study was carried out between November and December 2019, after 4/5 months of the flood occurrence. Two completely affected villages from two districts residing in two parts of the country were randomly selected (whereas Manikganj district was less affected by the recent flood compared to Kurigram), and a total of 348 flood survivors were interviewed (45.53 ± 14.85 years). Questions related to basic socio-demographics, flood effects, psychological impacts, and suicidal behaviors were asked in the interviews. RESULTS: In the total sample, 57.5% of flood survivors reported having suicidal ideation, whereas 5.7% and 2.0% madea suicide plan and suicide attempt, respectively. Within two study sites, participants belonging to Kurigram reported significantly higher suicidal ideation compared to Manikganj (84.8% vs 33.2%, χ(2) = 94.475, p<0.001). Belonging to a lower-class family, having less education, and less earning members in the family, being affected severely by the flood, suffering from depression, anxiety, and PTSD, and experiencing financial threat, and economic hardship were suicidal behavior risk factors in the total sample. CONCLUSION: Considering the present findings (ie, suicidality commensurately increases with flood effects), a multi-sectoral policy and its effective implementation should be adopted for alleviating the flood-related psychological burdens.","Mamun, Mohammed A; Safiq, Mariam Binte; Hosen, Ismail; al Mamun, Firoj",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7812054/,138

We analyzed 360 measurements from 36 patients. The mean of the differences between PPV(INV−CNAP) and PPV(INV) was −0.1% (95% limits of agreement (95%-LoA) −2.5 to 2.3%). Deming regression showed a slope of 0.99 (95% confidence interval (95%-CI) 0.91 to 1.06) and intercept of −0.02 (95%-CI −0.52 to 0.47). The predictive agreement between PPV(INV−CNAP) and PPV(INV) was 92% and Cohen’s kappa was 0.79. The mean of the differences between PPV(CNAP) and PPV(INV) was −1.0% (95%-LoA−6.3 to 4.3%). Deming regression showed a slope of 0.85 (95%-CI 0.78 to 0.91) and intercept of 0.10 (95%-CI −0.34 to 0.55). The predictive agreement between PPV(CNAP) and PPV(INV) was 82% and Cohen’s kappa was 0.48. The PPV(CNAP)-algorithm reliably calculates pulse pressure variation compared to manual offline pulse pressure variation calculation when applied on the same arterial blood pressure waveform. The absolute and predictive agreement between PPV(CNAP) and PPV(INV) are moderate.","Flick, Moritz; Hoppe, Phillip; Matin Mehr, Jasmin; Briesenick, Luisa; Kouz, Karim; Greiwe, Gillis; Fortin, Jürgen; Saugel, Bernd",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7905968/,138
15645,Bacterial-Derived Outer Membrane Vesicles are Potent Adjuvants that Drive Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses,2021-01-20,"Nipah virus is a bat-borne paramyxovirus that produces yearly outbreaks of fatal encephalitis in Bangladesh. Understanding the ecological conditions that lead to spillover from bats to humans can assist in designing effective interventions. To investigate the current and historical processes that drive Nipah spillover in Bangladesh, we analyzed the relationship among spillover events and climatic conditions, the spatial distribution and size of Pteropus medius roosts, and patterns of land-use change in Bangladesh over the last 300 years. We found that 53% of annual variation in winter spillovers is explained by winter temperature, which may affect bat behavior, physiology, and human risk behaviors. We infer from changes in forest cover that a progressive shift in bat roosting behavior occurred over hundreds of years, producing the current system where a majority of P. medius populations are small (median of 150 bats), occupy roost sites for 10 years or more, live in areas of high human population density, and opportunistically feed on cultivated food resources—conditions that promote viral spillover. Without interventions, continuing anthropogenic pressure on bat populations similar to what has occurred in Bangladesh could result in more regular spillovers of other bat viruses, including Hendra and Ebola viruses.","McKee, Clifton D.; Islam, Ausraful; Luby, Stephen P.; Salje, Henrik; Hudson, Peter J.; Plowright, Raina K.; Gurley, Emily S.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7910977/,138

Interestingly, the morbidity/mortality paradox points to females having a worse healthy life expectancy. Since bidirectional interactions between cardiovascular and Alzheimer’s diseases (AD) have been reported, the study of this emerging field is promising. In the present work, we further explored the cardiovascular–brain interactions in mice survivors of two cohorts of non-transgenic and 3xTg-AD mice, including both sexes, to investigate the frailty/survival through their life span. Survival, monitored from birth, showed exceptionally worse mortality rates in females than males, independently of the genotype. This mortality selection provided a “survivors” cohort that could unveil brain–cardiovascular interaction mechanisms relevant for normal and neurodegenerative aging processes restricted to long-lived animals. The results show sex-dependent distinct physical (worse in 3xTg-AD males), neuropsychiatric-like and cognitive phenotypes (worse in 3xTg-AD females), and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activation (higher in females), with higher cerebral blood flow and improved cardiovascular phenotype in 3xTg-AD female mice survivors. The present study provides an experimental scenario to study the suggested potential compensatory hemodynamic mechanisms in end-of-life dementia, which is sex-dependent and can be a target for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.","Muntsant, Aida; Jiménez-Altayó, Francesc; Puertas-Umbert, Lidia; Jiménez-Xarrie, Elena; Vila, Elisabet; Giménez-Llort, Lydia",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7911097/,138

In humans, the disease follows infection by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and begins as flu-like symptoms that can rapidly progress to hemorrhaging and death. Case fatality rates can be as high as 30%. An important gap in our understanding of CCHF are the host immune responses necessary to control the infection. A better understanding of these responses is needed to direct therapeutic strategies to limit the often-severe morbidity and mortality seen in humans. In this report, we have utilized a mouse model in which mice develop severe disease but ultimately recover. T-cells were robustly activated, differentiated to produce antiviral cytokines, and were critical for survival following CCHFV infection. We further identified a key role for interferon gamma (IFNγ) in survival following CCHFV infection. These results significantly improve our understanding of the host adaptive immune response to severe CCHFV infection.","Hawman, David W.; Meade-White, Kimberly; Leventhal, Shanna; Carmody, Aaron; Haddock, Elaine; Hasenkrug, Kim; Feldmann, Heinz",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912317/,138

As of December 2020, a total of 69,874,432 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 1,553,000 deaths have been reported. Different regions of the world have reported varying intensity of COVID-19 severity. The disease burden for COVID-19 depends on multiple factors like the local infection rate, susceptible population, mortality rate, and so on. The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving emergency and is a subject of regular debate and advanced research. As of today, there is a lack of definitive treatment options for COVID-19 pneumonia. In search of alternative options, few drugs are being tested for their efficacy and repurposing. Preliminary reports have shown positive outcomes with Remdesivir and tocilizumab, but this needs further confirmation.

Health status can also be a powerful marker for subsequent clinical outcomes, but its prognostic importance around the time of both TAVR and transcatheter mitral valve repair has not been fully defined. METHODS: Among 73 699 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR or transcatheter mitral valve repair between 2011 and 2018 (mean age, 81.9±7.0 years, 53% men, 92% TAVR), we constructed sequential models examining the association of health status (as assessed with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire–Overall Summary Score; KCCQ-OS) at baseline, 30 days, change from baseline to 30 days, and combinations of these assessments with death and heart failure (HF) hospitalization from 30 days to 1 year. RESULTS: Although higher baseline KCCQ-OS and 30-day KCCQ-OS scores were each associated with lower risk of death and HF hospitalization (in individual models and in a model including both measures), the 30-day KCCQ-OS was most predictive (death: hazard ratio, 0.89 per 5-point increase [95% CI, 0.89–0.90]; HF hospitalization: hazard ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.90–0.91]). The 30-day KCCQ-OS also was most predictive when included in a separate model with change in KCCQ from baseline to 30 days. Similar findings were noted for the outcomes of death and of HF hospitalization, unadjusted and adjusted for patient factors. All interaction terms between procedure type and KCCQ were not significant, suggesting that health status provided similar prognostic information in both procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The patient’s assessment of their health status immediately before and 30 days after TAVR and transcatheter mitral valve repair is associated with subsequent risk of death and HF hospitalization, with the 30-day assessment being most strongly associated with outcomes. Our findings support the routine use of KCCQ data as a prognostic tool.","Hejjaji, Vittal; Cohen, David J.; Carroll, John D.; Li, Zhuokai; Manandhar, Pratik; Vemulapalli, Sreekanth; Nelson, Adam J.; Malik, Ali O.; Mack, Michael J.; Spertus, John A.; Arnold, Suzanne V.",Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982132/,138

16335,The expansive effects of polyamines on the metabolism and virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae,2021-03-25,"OBJECTIVE: Sleep plays an important role in the health and well-being of middle aged and elderly people, and social capital may be one of the important factors for sleep disorders. This study aimed to understand the relationship between social capital and sleep disorders in a unique region of China –Tibet that generally has the disadvantaged economic status compared to other parts of China. METHODS: The study was based on Tibetan data from The China Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) and was conducted from May 2018 to September 2019. A total of 3194 Tibetans aged > 50 were selected from the community population by multi-stage stratified cluster sampling. Social capital was measured using two validated health-related social capital scales, family/community and society.. Sleep disorders were measured as the presence of disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, or daytime dysfunction. Logistic regression models were applied to examine the association between social capital and sleep disorders. RESULTS: 39.9% (1271/3194) of the participants had sleep disorders. In addition, after controlling for all potential variables, family social capital was significantly negatively associated with sleep disorders (OR = 0.95, P < 0.05), while community and society social capital was not associated with sleep disorders. Then, when we did all the sex-stratified analyses, the significant association between social capital and sleep disorders was found only in women (OR = 0.94, P < 0.05), while no association was found in males; neither males nor females showed any association with community and society social capital. CONCLUSION: Our study would help to better understand the extent of health inequality in China, and guide future interventions, strategies and policies to promote sleep quality in low-income areas, taking into account both the role of Tibetan specific cultural traditions, lifestyles and religious beliefs in social capital and the gender differences in social capital.

However, the therapeutic efficacy of RIC in humans with sepsis remains unknown. We hypothesized that RIC might improve sublingual microcirculation in patients with sepsis. METHODS: This prospective single-arm trial was performed in a mixed ICU at a tertiary teaching hospital. We included patients with sepsis or septic shock within 24 h of ICU admission. The RIC procedure comprised 3 cycles of brachial cuff inflation to 200 mmHg for 5 min followed by deflation to 0 mmHg for another 5 min. The procedure took 30 min. RIC was performed at the time of study inclusion and repeated after 12 and 24 h. Sublingual microcirculatory measurements were obtained before and after each RIC procedure using a Cytocam(®)-incident dark-field (IDF) device (Braedius Medical, Huizen, The Netherlands). The microcirculatory data were compared with a historical control. Data are reported as the medians along with the 25th and 75th percentiles. RESULTS: Twenty-six septic patients with a median age of 65 (57–81) years were enrolled in this study. The median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores at admission were 20 (13–23) and 10 (9–12), respectively. All patients were receiving vasopressors. After the 1st RIC procedure, the microvascular flow index (MFI) and the proportion of perfused vessels (PPV) among small vessels were significantly higher than before the procedure, with pre- and post-treatment values of 2.17 (1.81–2.69) and 2.59 (2.21–2.83), respectively, for MFI (p = 0.003) and 87.9 (82.4–93.8) and 92.5 (87.9–96.1) %, respectively, for PPV (p = 0.026). This result was confirmed by comparison with a historical control group. We found no change in microcirculatory flow or density parameters during repeated RIC after 12 h and 24 h. CONCLUSION: In patients with sepsis, the first remote ischemic conditioning procedure improved microcirculatory flow, whereas later procedures did not affect sublingual microcirculation.

17158,The transcriptional landscape of the cultured murine middle ear epithelium in vitro,2021-04-23,"A model based upon mechanics is used in a re-analysis of historical acarine morphological work augmented by an extra seven zoophagous mesostigmatid species. This review shows that predatory mesostigmatids do have cheliceral designs with clear rational purposes. Almost invariably within an overall body size class, the switch in predatory style from a worm-like prey feeding (‘crushing/mashing’ kill) functional group to a micro-arthropod feeding (‘active prey cutting/slicing/slashing' kill) functional group is matched by: an increased cheliceral reach, a bigger chelal gape, a larger morphologically estimated chelal crunch force, and a drop in the adductive lever arm velocity ratio of the chela. Small size matters. Several uropodines (Eviphis ostrinus, the omnivore Trachytes aegrota, Urodiaspis tecta and, Uropoda orbicularis) have more elongate chelicerae (greater reach) than their chelal gape would suggest, even allowing for allometry across mesostigmatids. They may be: plesiosaur-like high-speed strikers of prey, scavenging carrion feeders (like long-necked vultures), probing/burrowing crevice feeders of cryptic nematodes, or small morsel/fragmentary food feeders. Some uropodoids have chelicerae and chelae which probably work like a construction-site mechanical excavator-digger with its small bucket. Possible hoeing/bulldozing, spore-cracking and tiny sabre-tooth cat-like striking actions are discussed for others. Subtle changes lead small mesostigmatids to be predator–scavengers (mesocarnivores) or to be predator–fungivores (hypocarnivores). Some uropodines (e.g., the worm-like prey feeder Alliphis siculus and, Uropoda orbicularis) show chelae similar in design to astigmatids and cryptostigmatids indicating possible facultative saprophagy. Scale matters—obligate predatory designs (hypercarnivory) start for mesostigmatids with chelal gape > 150 μm and cheliceral reach > 350 μm (i.e., about 500–650 μm in body size). Commonality of trophic design in these larger species with solifugids is indicated. Veigaia species with low chelal velocity ratio and other morphological strengthening specialisms, appear specially adapted in a concerted way for predating active soft and fast moving springtails (Collembola). Veigaia cerva shows a markedly bigger chelal gape than its cheliceral reach would proportionately infer suggesting it is a crocodile-like sit-and-wait or ambush predator par excellence. A small chelal gape, low cheliceral reach, moderate velocity ratio variant of the worm-like feeding habit design is supported for phytoseiid pollenophagy. Evidence for a resource partitioning model in the evolution of gnathosomal development is found. A comparison to crustacean claws and vertebrate mandibles is made. Alliphis siculus and Rhodacarus strenzkei are surprisingly powerful mega-cephalics for their small size. Parasitids show a canid-like trophic design. The chelicera of the nematophagous Alliphis halleri shows felid-like features. Glyphtholaspis confusa has hyaena-like cheliceral dentition. The latter species has a markedly smaller chelal gape than its cheliceral reach would suggest proportionately, which together with a high chelal velocity ratio and a high estimated chelal crunch force matches a power specialism of feeding on immobile tough fly eggs/pupae by crushing (durophagy). A consideration of gnathosomal orientation is made. Predatory specialisms appear to often match genera especially in larger mesostigmatids, which may scale quite differently. Comparison to holothyrids and opilioacarids indicates that the cheliceral chelae of the former are cutting-style and those of the latter are crushing-style. A simple validated easy-to-use ‘2:1 on’ predictive algorithm of feeding habit type is included based on a strength-speed tradeoff in chelal velocity ratio for ecologists to test in the field.","Bowman, Clive E.",Exp Appl Acarol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8085810/,138

Not much is known about the burden of EuDKA in patients on SGLT2i or the associated factors. This retrospective cohort study tries to delineate the differences in factors associated with the development of EuDKA as compared to hyperglycemic DKA. We conducted a multicentre, retrospective study across three tertiary care centers under Weill Cornell affiliated-Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar. The cohort comprised of T2D patients on SGLT2i who developed DKA between January 2015 to December 2020. The differences between the subjects who developed EuDKA or hyperglycaemic DKA (hDKA) were analyzed. A total of 9940 T2D patients were on SGLT2i during 2015–2020, out of which 43 developed DKA (0.43%). 25 developed EuKDA, whereas 18 had hDKA. The point prevalence of EuDKA in our cohort was 58.1%. EuDKA was most common in patients using canagliflozin, followed by empagliflozin and Dapagliflozin (100%, 77%, and 48.3%, respectively). Overall, infection (32.6%) was the most common trigger for DKA, followed by insulin non-compliance (13.7%). Infection was the only risk factor with a significant point estimate between the two groups, being more common in hDKA patients (p-value 0.006, RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.07–5.98). Canagliflozin had the strongest association with the development of EuDKA and was associated with the highest medical intensive care unit (MICU) admission rates (66.6%). In T2D patients on SGLT2i, infection is probably associated with an increased risk of developing EuDKA. The differential role of individual SGLT2i analogs is less clear and will need exploration by more extensive prospective studies.","Ata, Fateen; Yousaf, Zohaib; Khan, Adeel Ahmad; Razok, Almurtada; Akram, Jaweria; Ali, Elrazi Awadelkarim Hamid; Abdalhadi, Ahmed; Ibrahim, Diaeldin Abdelgalil; Al Mohanadi, Dabia Hamad S.

18060,Responding and navigating racialized microaggressions in STEM,2021-05-28,"7-Dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) is the direct precursor to manufacture vitamin D(3). Our previous study has achieved 7-DHC synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on the endogenous post-squalene pathway. However, the distribution of post-squalene enzymes between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid bodies (LD) might raise difficulties for ERG proteins to catalyze and deliver sterol intermediates, resulting in unbalanced metabolic flow and low product yield. Herein, we intended to rearrange the subcellular location of post-squalene enzymes to alleviate metabolic bottleneck and boost 7-DHC production. After identifying the location of DHCR24 (C-24 reductase, the only heterologous protein for 7-DHC biosynthesis) on ER, all the ER-located enzymes were grouped into four modules: ERG1/11/24, ERG25/26/27, ERG2/3, and DHCR24. These modules attempted to be overexpressed either on ER or on LDs. As a result, expression of LD-targeted DHCR24 and ER-located ERG1/11/24 could promote the conversion efficiency among the sterol intermediates to 7-DHC, while locating module ERG2/3 into LDs improved the whole metabolic flux of the post-squalene pathway. Coexpressing LD-targeted ERG2/3 and DHCR24 (generating strain SyBE_Sc01250035) improved 7-DHC production from 187.7 to 308.2 mg/L at shake-flask level. Further expressing ER-targeted module ERG1/11/24 in strain SyBE_Sc01250035 dramatically reduced squalene accumulation from 620.2 mg/L to the lowest level (by 93.8%) as well as improved 7-DHC production to the highest level (to 342.2 mg/L). Then targeting module ERG25/26/27 to LDs further increased 7-DHC titer to 360.6 mg/L, which is the highest shake-flask level production for 7-DHC ever reported. Our study not only proposes and further proves the concept of pathway compartmentalized reconstitution to regulate metabolic flux but also provides a promising chassis to produce other steroidal compounds through the post-squalene pathway.","Guo, Xiao-Jing; Yao, Ming-Dong; Xiao, Wen-Hai; Wang, Ying; Zhao, Guang-Rong; Yuan, Ying-Jin",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175624/,138

Moreover, the effect of Adam17 deletion in an in vitro 3D cell culture from human proximal tubular cells under high glucose conditions was evaluated. eAdam17 deletion attenuates renal fibrosis and inflammation, whereas tAdam17 deletion decreases podocyte loss, attenuates the RAS, and decreases macrophage infiltration, α-SMA and collagen accumulation. The 3D in vitro cell culture reinforced the findings obtained in tAdam17KO mice with decreased fibrosis in the Adam17 knockout spheroids. In conclusion, Adam17 deletion either in the endothelial or the tubular cells mitigates kidney injury in the diabetic mice by targeting different pathways.

It was proposed recently that fingerprints of fractional excitations are encoded in the phonon spectra of Kitaev quantum spin liquids through a novel fractional-excitation-phonon coupling. Here, we detect anomalous phonon effects in α-RuCl(3) using inelastic X-ray scattering with meV resolution. At high temperature, we discover interlaced optical phonons intercepting a transverse acoustic phonon between 3 and 7 meV. Upon decreasing temperature, the optical phonons display a large intensity enhancement near the Kitaev energy, J(K)~8 meV, that coincides with a giant acoustic phonon softening near the Z(2) gauge flux energy scale. These phonon anomalies signify the coupling of phonon and Kitaev magnetic excitations in α-RuCl(3) and demonstrates a proof-of-principle method to detect anomalous excitations in topological quantum materials.","Li, Haoxiang; Zhang, T.

However, the overuse of Cu makes it a common environmental pollutant. In order to investigate the testicular toxicity of Cu, the pigs were divided into three groups and were given Cu at 10 (control), 125, and 250 mg/kg body weight, respectively. The feeding period was 80 days. Serum hormone results showed that Cu exposure decreased the concentrations of follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and increased the concentration of thyroxine (T4). Meanwhile, Cu exposure upregulated the expression of Cu transporter mRNA (Slc31a1, ATP7A, and ATP7B) in the testis, leading to increase in testicular Cu and led to spermatogenesis disorder. The Cu exposure led to an increased expression of antioxidant-related mRNA (Gpx4, TRX, HO-1, SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, CAT), along with increase in the MDA concentration in the testis. In LG group, the ROS in the testis was significantly increased. Furthermore, the apoptotic-related mRNA (Caspase3, Caspase8, Caspase9, Bax, Cytc, Bak1, APAF1, p53) and protein (Active Caspase3) and the autophagy-related mRNA (Beclin1, ATG5, LC3, and LC3B) expression increased after Cu exposure. The mitochondrial membrane potential in the testicular tissue decreased, while the number of apoptotic cells increased, as a result of oxidative stress. Overall, our study indicated that the Cu exposure promotes testicular apoptosis and autophagy by mediating oxidative stress, which is considered as the key mechanism causing testicular degeneration as well as dysfunction.","Li, Yuanliang; Chen, Hanming; Liao, Jianzhao; Chen, Keli; Javed, Muhammad Tariq; Qiao, Na; Zeng, Qiwen; Liu, Bingxian; Yi, Jiangnan; Tang, Zhaoxin; Li, Ying",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8203493/,138

However, in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and random blood glucose/sugar (RBS) values, significant differences were recorded. Histopathological evaluation of liver, kidney, pancreas and heart tissues revealed mild to severe changes in the form of steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, necrosis and myofibrillary damages on 11th and 21st days of treatment. In conclusion, the median lethal dose of the tested compound was expected to be greater than 500 mg/kg. No significant change occurred in selected biomarkers, except BUN and RBS levels, but a histopathological study showed moderate toxic effect on liver, kidney, pancreas and heart tissues by the cyclohexenone derivative.","Kamil, Muhammad; Fatima, Arifa; Ullah, Sami; Ali, Gowhar; Khan, Rasool; Ismail, Naila; Qayum, Mughal; Irimie, Marius; Dinu, Catalina Georgeta; Ahmedah, Hanadi Talal; Cocuz, Maria Elena",Toxics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8227666/,138
18638,Priming with intranasal lactobacilli prevents Pseudomonas aeruginosa acute pneumonia in mice,2021-06-28,"Genetically modified animals, especially rodents, are widely used in biomedical research. However, non-rodent models are required for efficient translational medicine and preclinical studies. Owing to the similarity in the physiological traits of pigs and humans, genetically modified pigs may be a valuable resource for biomedical research. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) using genetically modified somatic cells has been the primary method for the generation of genetically modified pigs. However, site-specific gene modification in porcine cells is inefficient and requires laborious and time-consuming processes. Recent improvements in gene-editing systems, such as zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) system, represent major advances. The efficient introduction of site-specific modifications into cells via gene editors dramatically reduces the effort and time required to generate genetically modified pigs. Furthermore, gene editors enable direct gene modification during embryogenesis, bypassing the SCNT procedure. The application of gene editors has progressively expanded, and a range of strategies is now available for porcine gene engineering. This review provides an overview of approaches for the generation of genetically modified pigs using gene editors, and highlights the current trends, as well as the limitations, of gene editing in pigs.","TANIHARA, Fuminori; HIRATA, Maki; OTOI, Takeshige",J Reprod Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8238678/,138

19171,T Cell Specificity: A Great Challenge in Chagas Disease,2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: Providing access to pediatric healthcare services in British Columbia, Canada, presents unique challenges given low population densities spread across large geographic distances combined with a lack of availability of specialist providers in remote areas, leading to quality of care shortcomings and inequalities in care delivery. The study objective was to develop a framework that provides a common language and methodology for defining and planning child and youth healthcare services across the province. METHODS: The framework was developed in two phases. In Phase 1, a literature and jurisdictional review was completed using the following inclusion criteria: (i) description of a framework focusing on organizing service delivery systems (ii) that supports health service planning, (iii) includes specialty or subspecialty services and (iv) has been published since 2008. In Phase 2, a series of meetings with key provincial stakeholders were held to receive feedback on the developed Tiers of Service framework versions that were based on the literature and jurisdictional review and adjusted to the British Columbian health care context. The final version was endorsed by the Child Health BC Steering Committee. RESULTS: Ten medical articles and thirteen jurisdictional papers met the established selection criteria and were included in this study. Most frameworks were developed by the Australian national or state jurisdictions and published in jurisdictional papers (n = 8). Frameworks identified in the medical literature were mainly developed in Canada (n = 3) and the US (n = 3) and focused on maternity, neonatal, critical care and oncology services. Based on feedback received from the expert group, the framework was expanded to include community-based services, prevention and health determinants. The final version of the Tiers of Service framework describes the specific services to be delivered at each tier, which are categorized as Tier 1 (community services) through Tier 6 (sub-specialized services). Two consecutive steps were identified to effectively use the framework for operational and system planning: (i) development of a ‘module’ outlining the responsibilities and requirements to be delivered at each tier; and (ii) assessment of services provided at the health care facility against those described in the module, alignment to a specific tier, identification of gaps at the local, regional and provincial level, and implementation of quality improvement initiatives to effectively address the gaps. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of the Tiers of Service framework and accompanying modules for health service planning are being increasingly recognized. Planning and coordinating pediatric health services across the province will help to optimize flow and improve access to high-quality services for children living in British Columbia.

19247,Protective Effect of Nicorandil on Cardiac Microvascular Injury: Role of Mitochondrial Integrity,2021-07-03,"The Arctic is warming at approximately twice the global rate, with well-documented indirect effects on wildlife. However, few studies have examined the direct effects of warming temperatures on Arctic wildlife, leaving the importance of heat stress unclear. Here, we assessed the direct effects of increasing air temperatures on the physiology of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), an Arctic seabird with reported mortalities due to heat stress while nesting on sun-exposed cliffs. We used flow-through respirometry to measure the response of body temperature, resting metabolic rate, evaporative water loss and evaporative cooling efficiency (the ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic heat production) in murres while experimentally increasing air temperature. Murres had limited heat tolerance, exhibiting: (1) a low maximum body temperature (43.3°C); (2) a moderate increase in resting metabolic rate relative that within their thermoneutral zone (1.57 times); (3) a small increase in evaporative water loss rate relative that within their thermoneutral zone (1.26 times); and (4) a low maximum evaporative cooling efficiency (0.33). Moreover, evaporative cooling efficiency decreased with increasing air temperature, suggesting murres were producing heat at a faster rate than they were dissipating it. Larger murres also had a higher rate of increase in resting metabolic rate and a lower rate of increase in evaporative water loss than smaller murres; therefore, evaporative cooling efficiency declined with increasing body mass. As a cold-adapted bird, murres' limited heat tolerance likely explains their mortality on warm days. Direct effects of overheating on Arctic wildlife may be an important but under-reported impact of climate change.","Choy, Emily S.; O'Connor, Ryan S.; Gilchrist, H.

Furthermore, the standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) between the theoretical value and the measured value of the self-made simulated rapid test became smaller, and the linearity became higher. The results thus indicated that the immunodetection system became more reliable. In the present research, a camera was used to capture an image containing the control line (C line) and the test line (T line) in the self-made simulated rapid test. The captured image was then analyzed, and the grayscales of the C line and T line were calculated. The Taguchi method was used to adjust the light intensity of the light-emitting diode (LED) and the camera parameters in the immunodetection system to determine the optimal parameters by which to optimize the performance of the immunodetection system. The goal of the present research was to obtain a measurement with a minimum SD and CV between the detected grayscales and the grayscales of the self-made simulated rapid test, thus indicating successful development of a practical, stable, and accurate immunodetection system. To mimic the color expression in an actual rapid test, the ratio of the red, green, blue (RGB) components of the self-made simulated rapid test had to be adjusted to closely fit the color expression of the actual rapid test. After the RGB ratio was set, the Taguchi method was used to optimize the parameters for the purpose of detection. When the optimal parameters were found, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio) had been increased from −12.89 dB to −10.91 dB, which means the accuracy of the color detection had been improved. Compared to the original detection system, the quality loss had been reduced to 33.1%.","Lin, Kai-Wen; Chang, Yu-Chi",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8307726/,138

Early diagnosis through non-invasive biomarkers may render GBM more easily treatable, improving the prognosis of this currently incurable disease. We suggest the use of serum extracellular vesicle (sEV)-derived circular RNAs (circRNAs) as highly stable minimally invasive diagnostic biomarkers for GBM diagnosis. EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography from sera of 23 GBM and 5 grade 3 glioma (GIII) patients, and 10 unaffected controls (UC). The expression of two candidate circRNAs (circSMARCA5 and circHIPK3) was assayed by droplet digital PCR. CircSMARCA5 and circHIPK3 were significantly less abundant in sEVs from GBM patients with respect to UC (fold-change (FC) of −2.15 and −1.92, respectively) and GIII (FC of −1.75 and −1.4, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, based on the expression of sEV-derived circSMARCA5 and circHIPK3, allowed us to distinguish GBM from UC (area under the curve (AUC) 0.823 (0.667–0.979) and 0.855 (0.704 to 1.000), with a 95% confidence interval (CI), respectively). Multivariable ROC analysis, performed by combining the expression of sEV-derived circSMARCA5 and circHIPK3 with preoperative neutrophil to lymphocyte (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte (PLR) and lymphocyte to monocyte (LMR) ratios, three known diagnostic and prognostic GBM markers, allowed an improvement in the GBM diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.901 (0.7912 to 1.000), 95% CI). Our data suggest sEV-derived circSMARCA5 and circHIPK3 as good diagnostic biomarkers for GBM, especially when associated with preoperative NLR, PLR and LMR.","Stella, Michele; Falzone, Luca; Caponnetto, Angela; Gattuso, Giuseppe; Barbagallo, Cristina; Battaglia, Rosalia; Mirabella, Federica; Broggi, Giuseppe; Altieri, Roberto; Certo, Francesco; Caltabiano, Rosario; Barbagallo, Giuseppe Maria Vincenzo; Musumeci, Paolo; Ragusa, Marco; Pietro, Cinzia Di; Libra, Massimo; Purrello, Michele; Barbagallo, Davide",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8308516/,138
19540,A Network Pharmacology-Based Investigation to the Pharmacodynamic Material Basis and Mechanisms of the Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Viral Effect of Isatis indigotica,2021-07-20,"Avian chlamydiosis is one of the important neglected diseases with critical zoonotic potential. Chlamydia psittaci, the causative agent, affects most categories of birds, livestock, companion animals, and humans. It has many obscured characters and epidemiological dimensions, which makes it unique among other bacterial agents. Recent reports on transmission from equine to humans alarmed the public health authorities, and it necessitates the importance of routine screening of this infectious disease. High prevalence of spill-over infection in equines was associated with reproductive losses. Newer avian chlamydial species are being reported in the recent years. It is a potential biological warfare agent and the disease is an occupational hazard mainly to custom officers handling exotic birds. Prevalence of the disease in wild birds, pet birds, and poultry causes economic losses to the poultry industry and the pet bird trade. Interestingly, there are speculations on the ‘legal’ and ‘illegal’ bird trade that may be the global source of some of the most virulent strains of this pathogen. The mortality rate generally ranges from 5 to 40% in untreated cases, but it can sometimes be higher in co-infection. The intracellular lifestyle of this pathogen makes the diagnosis more complicated and there is also lack of accurate diagnostics. Resistance to antibiotics is reported only in some pathogens of the Chlamydiaceae family, but routine screening may assess the actual situation in all pathogens. Due to the diverse nature of the pathogen, the organism necessitates the One Health partnerships to have complete understanding. The present review focuses on the zoonotic aspects of avian chlamydiosis with its new insights into the pathogenesis, transmission, treatment, prevention, and control strategies. The review also briefs on the basic understandings and complex epidemiology of avian chlamydiosis, highlighting the need for research on emerging one health perspectives.","Ravichandran, Karthikeyan; Anbazhagan, Subbaiyan; Karthik, Kumaragurubaran; Angappan, Madesh; Dhayananth, Balusamy",Trop Anim Health Prod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8313243/,138
19589,Targeted immune epitope prediction to HHLA2 and MAGEB5 protein variants as therapeutic approach to related viral diseases,2021-07-28,"Norovirus is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Over 30 different genotypes, mostly from genogroup I (GI) and II (GII), have been shown to infect humans. Despite three decades of genome sequencing, our understanding of the role of genomic diversification across continents and time is incomplete. To close the spatiotemporal gap of genomic information of human noroviruses, we conducted a large-scale genome-wide analyses that included the nearly full-length sequencing of 281 archival viruses circulating since the 1970s in over 10 countries from four continents, with a major emphasis on norovirus genotypes that are currently underrepresented in public genome databases. We provided new genome information for 24 distinct genotypes, including the oldest genome information from 12 norovirus genotypes. Analyses of this new genomic information, together with those publicly available, showed that (i) noroviruses evolve at similar rates across genomic regions and genotypes; (ii) emerging viruses evolved from transiently-circulating intermediate viruses; (iii) diversifying selection on the VP1 protein was recorded in genotypes with multiple variants; (iv) non-structural proteins showed a similar branching on their phylogenetic trees; and (v) contrary to the current understanding, there are restrictions on the ability to recombine different genomic regions, which results in co-circulating populations of viruses evolving independently in human communities. This study provides a comprehensive genetic analysis of diverse norovirus genotypes and the role of non-structural proteins on viral diversification, shedding new light on the mechanisms of norovirus evolution and transmission.","Tohma, Kentaro; Lepore, Cara J.; Martinez, Magaly; Degiuseppe, Juan I.; Khamrin, Pattara; Saito, Mayuko; Mayta, Holger; Nwaba, Amy U.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study (June 2018-March 2019) describes screening results (Roche Linear Array HPV test and Pap smear liquid based cytology) and history of screening (known HIV status, antiretroviral therapy [ART] use, previous Pap smears). Data were stratified by age group (18–29, 30+ years), HIV status, Pap smear results and tested for statistical significance. RESULTS: Of 280 women, 20.4% were HIV-positive, 18.2% had abnormal Pap smears, 41.8% had HR-HPV. Of older women, 48.2% (n = 78/162) had never had a Pap smear. Of younger women, 89.0% (n = 105/118) never had a Pap smear, but had significantly more low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and other HR-HPV infection than older women (12.7%[n = 15/118] vs 4.9%[n = 8/162], p = 0.0193; and 49.2%[n = 58/118] vs 29.0%[n = 47/162], p = 0.0006; respectively). HIV-positive women had more abnormal cytology results and infection with other HR-HPV types or co-infection with other HR-HPV type(s)/HPV-16 compared to HIV-negative women (35.1%[n = 20/57] vs 13.9%[n = 31/223], p = 0.0002; 56.1%[n = 32/57] vs 32.7%[n = 73/223], p = 0.001; and 12.3%[n = 7/57] vs 4.9%[n = 11/223], p = 0.044; respectively). Of 57 HIV-positive women, 45.6% (n = 26) already knew their HIV status; of which 69.2% were on ART and 34.6% never had a Pap smear. CONCLUSION: South African women have high rates of HIV, Pap smear abnormalities and HR-HPV, with low cervical cancer screening coverage. SA cervical cancer screening policy excludes (undiagnosed) HIV-positive and HIV-negative women <30 years, both populations found to have high prevalence of HR-HPV. HPV-based primary screening from 25 years could improve outcomes.","Hopkins, Kathryn L.; Jaffer, Maya; Hlongwane, Khuthadzo E.; Otwombe, Kennedy; Dietrich, Janan; Cheyip, Mireille; Olivier, Jacobus; Doherty, Tanya; Gray, Glenda E.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323926/,138

It is, therefore, necessary to integrate multiple data sources, using the strengths of each source to compensate for the weaknesses of others. In this study, we propose a method incorporating outputs of NASA’s GEOS Composition Forecasting model system with satellite information from the TROPOMI instrument and ground measurement data on surface concentrations. Although we use ground monitoring data from the Environmental Protection Agency network in the continental United States, the model and satellite data sources used have the potential to allow for global application. This method is demonstrated using surface measurements of nitrogen dioxide as a test case in regions surrounding five major US cities. The proposed method is assessed through cross‐validation against withheld ground monitoring sites. In these assessments, the proposed method demonstrates major improvements over two baseline approaches which use ground‐based measurements only. Results also indicate the potential for near‐term updating of forecasts based on recent ground measurements.","Malings, C.; Knowland, K. E.; Keller, C. A.; Cohn, S.

Exposure to caustic agents is a lifelong problem associated with severe tissue and mucous membrane injuries. In pediatrics, corrosive exposure is the most common cause of nonpharmaceutical exposure presenting to poison control centers. Therefore, this study evaluated the role of the Pediatric Early Warning System (PEWS) and Drooling Reluctance Oropharynx Others Leukocytosis (DROOL) scores as early in-hospital outcome predictors following corrosive ingestion. The current study was a two-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study carried out among pediatric patients diagnosed with acute caustic ingestion during the past 4 years. Most exposure occurred accidentally among boys (59.4%) living in rural areas (51.9%) of preschool age (50% were 2–4 years old). Residence, body temperature, respiratory rate, vomiting, skin and mucosal burns, retrosternal pain, respiratory distress, Oxygen (O2) saturation, Glasgow Coma Scale score, HCO(3) level, total bilirubin level, anemia, leukocytosis, and presence of free peritoneal fluid were significant predictors of esophageal injuries (p < 0.05). DROOL and PEWS scoring were the most significant predictors of esophageal injuries with worthy predictive power, where odds ratio (95% confidence interval (CI)) was 1.76 (0.97–3.17) and 0.47 (0.21–0.99) for PEWS and DROOL, respectively. At a cutoff of < 6.5, the DROOL score could predict esophageal injuries excellently, with AUC = 0.931; sensitivity, 91.7%; specificity, 72.5%; and overall accuracy, 91.3%. At a cutoff of > 6.5, PEWS could significantly predict unfavorable outcomes, with AUC = 0.893; sensitivity, 94.4%; specificity, 71.9%; and overall accuracy, 89.3%. However, PEWS better predicted the need for admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). Pediatric Early Warning System (PEWS) and Drooling Reluctance Oropharynx Others Leukocytosis (DROOL) are potentially useful accurate scorings that could predict the esophageal injuries and ICU admission following corrosive ingestion in pediatrics.","Sharif, Asmaa Fady; Gameel, Dina El Gameel El; Abdo, Sanaa Abd El-Fatah; Elgebally, Elsayed Ibrahim; Fayed, Manar Maher",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8380116/,138

The imagistic diagnosis still uses chest X-ray (CXR), but lung ultrasound (LUS) proves to be reliable for pneumonia diagnosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of LUS compared to CXR in consolidated pneumonia. Methods: Children with clinical suspicion of bacterial pneumonia were screened by LUS for pneumonia, followed by CXR. The agreement relation between LUS and CXR regarding the detection of consolidation was evaluated by Cohen’s kappa test. Results: A total of 128 patients with clinical suspicion of pneumonia were evaluated; 74 of them were confirmed by imagery and biological inflammatory markers. The highest frequency of pneumonia was in the 0–3 years age group (37.83%). Statistical estimation of the agreement between LUS and CXR in detection of the consolidation found an almost perfect agreement, with a Cohen’s kappa coefficient of K = 0.89 ± 0.04 SD, p = 0.000. Sensitivity of LUS was superior to CXR in detection of consolidations. Conclusion: Lung ultrasound is a reliable method for the detection of pneumonia consolidation in hospitalized children, with sensitivity and specificity superior to CXR.

20476,Rapid Genomic Diagnosis of Fungal Infections in the Age of Next-Generation Sequencing,2021-08-05,"β-barrel membrane proteins have several important biological functions, including transporting water and solutes across the membrane. They are active in the highly hydrophobic environment of the lipid membrane, as opposed to soluble proteins, which function in a more polar, aqueous environment. Globular soluble proteins typically have a hydrophobic core and a polar surface that interacts favorably with water. In the fuzzy oil drop (FOD) model, this distribution is represented by the 3D Gauss function (3DG). In contrast, membrane proteins expose hydrophobic residues on the surface, and, in the case of ion channels, the polar residues face inwards towards a central pore. The distribution of hydrophobic residues in membrane proteins can be characterized by means of 1–3DG, a complementary 3D Gauss function. Such an analysis was carried out on the transmembrane proteins of bacteria, which, despite the considerable similarities of their super-secondary structure (β-barrel), have highly differentiated properties in terms of stabilization based on hydrophobic interactions. The biological activity and substrate specificity of these proteins are determined by the distribution of the polar and nonpolar amino acids. The present analysis allowed us to compare the ways in which the different proteins interact with antibiotics and helped us understand their relative importance in the development of the resistance mechanism. We showed that beta barrel membrane proteins with a hydrophobic core interact less strongly with the molecules they transport.","Roterman, Irena; Stapor, Katarzyna; Fabian, Piotr; Konieczny, Leszek",Membranes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8399255/,138

20821,Towards manufactured red blood cells for the treatment of inherited anemia,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND: Glaucoma is the second most-common blinding ophthalmic disease in the world, and its incidence has been rising year by year in recent years. Currently, the main treatment of glaucoma still relies on surgery. Glaucoma patients often suffer from various psychological problems like anxiety and depression not only because of the lack of understanding of the surgical treatment of glaucoma, but also the long-term stress and the poor prognosis. As alternative therapies, non-pharmacological interventions can greatly alleviate psychological burdens and improve sleep quality in surgically treated glaucoma patients. Randomized controlled trials of non-pharmacologic interventions for glaucoma have been reported, although the results remain conflicting. Evidences for determining the efficacy of non-pharmacologic interventions for glaucoma are scant. This study aims to assess the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in patients with postoperative glaucoma through a network meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search of relevant literatures published before August 2021 about the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in patients with postoperative glaucoma will be performed in Wanfang, VP Information Chinese Journal Service Platform, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese BioMedicine Literature Database, Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of science. Two reviewers will be independently responsible for literature screening and selection, quality assessment, and data extraction. WinBUGS 1.4 will be used for the network meta-analysis. RESULTS: This meta-analysis will provide additional and stronger evidences for non-pharmacological interventions on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in patients with postoperative glaucoma, which will help clinicians and decision makers to make an optimal therapeutic strategy. CONCLUSION: This study will provide a reliable evidence-based basis for the clinical application of non-pharmacological interventions on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in patients with postoperative glaucoma.

Sequence alignment is the central and fundamental problem in many sequence analysis procedure, while local alignment is often the kernel of these algorithms. Usually, Smith–Waterman algorithm is used to find the best subsequence match between given sequences. However, the high time complexity makes the algorithm time-consuming. A lot of approaches have been developed to accelerate and parallelize it, such as vector-level parallelization, thread-level parallelization, process-level parallelization, and heterogeneous acceleration, but the current researches seem unsystematic, which hinders the further research of parallelizing the algorithm. In this paper, we summarize the current research status of parallel local alignments and describe the data layout in these work. Based on the research status, we emphasize large-scale genomic comparisons. By surveying some typical alignment tools’ performance, we discuss some possible directions in the future. We hope our work will provide the developers of the alignment tool with technical principle support, and help researchers choose proper alignment tools.

METHODS AND RESULTS : Observational (informing association) and Mendelian randomization (MR) (informing causality) studies were assessed to gather mutually complementary insights and elucidate perplexing epidemiological relationships. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational and MR studies that were published until January 2021 and evaluated the association between obesity-related indices and CVD risk were searched. Twelve systematic reviews with 53 meta-analyses results (including over 501 cohort studies) and 12 MR studies were included in the analysis. A body mass index (BMI) increase was associated with higher risks of coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, all-cause stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke, hypertension, aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism, and venous thrombo-embolism. The MR study results demonstrated a causal effect of obesity on all indices but stroke. The CVD risk increase for every 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI varied from 10% [relative risk (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.21; certainty of evidence, low] for haemorrhagic stroke to 49% (RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.40–1.60; certainty of evidence, high) for hypertension. The all-cause and CVD-specific mortality risks increased with adiposity in cohorts, but the MR studies demonstrated no causal effect of adiposity on all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION : High adiposity is associated with increased CVD risk despite divergent evidence gradients. Adiposity was a causal risk factor for CVD except all-cause mortality and stroke. Half (49%; 26/53) of the associations were supported by high-level evidence. The associations were consistent between sexes and across global regions. This study provides guidance on how to integrate evidence from observational (association) and genetics-driven (causation) studies accumulated to date, to enable a more reliable interpretation of epidemiological relationships.","Kim, Min Seo; Kim, Won Jun; Khera, Amit V; Kim, Jong Yeob; Yon, Dong Keon; Lee, Seung Won; Shin, Jae Il; Won, Hong-Hee",Eur Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8423481/,138

This study aimed to evaluate the repair of the trachea with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) differentiated in chondrocytes, grown on an experimental model. Tracheal defects were induced by surgical tracheostomy in 30 New Zealand rabbits, and the acellular amniotic membrane, with or without cells, was covering the defect. The hucMSCs were isolated and cultivated with chondrogenic differentiation over the culture of 14 days, and then grown on the AM. In this study, the AM was biocompatible and hucMSCs differentiated into chondrocytes. Our results demonstrated an important role for AM with cultured cells in the promotion of immature collagen, known to produce tissue regeneration. In addition, cartilaginous tissue was found at the tracheal defects, demonstrated by immunohistology results. This study suggests that this biomaterial implantation can be an effective future therapeutic alternative for patients with tracheal injury.","Baggio Simeoni, Paulo Ricardo; Simeoni, Rossana Baggio; Bispo Machado Júnior, Paulo André; de Almeida, Meila Bastos; Dziedzic, Dilcele Silva Moreira; da Rosa, Nádia Nascimento; Ferreira Stricker, Priscila E.; dos Santos Miggiolaro, Anna Flávia Ribeiro; Naves, Guilherme; Neto, Nelson Bergonse; de Noronha, Lucia; Francisco, Julio Cesar; Teixeira de Carvalho, Katherine Athayde; Guarita-Souza, Luiz Cesar",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8466253/,138

These pathogens can provoke clinical signs, known as porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). A sampling technique on live animals, namely tracheobronchial swab (TBS) sampling, was applied to detect different PRDC pathogens in pigs using PCR. The objective was to determine prevalence of different PRDC pathogens and their variations during different seasons, including correlations with local weather conditions. A total of 974 pig farms and 22,266 pigs were sampled using TBS over a 5-year period. TBS samples were analyzed using mPCR and results were categorized and analyzed according to the season of sampling and local weather data. In samples of peri-weaned and post-weaned piglets, influenza A virus in swine (IAV-S), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus—European strain (PRRSV1), and M. hyopneumoniae were found as predominant pathogens. In fattening pigs, M. hyopneumoniae, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) and PRRSV1 were predominant pathogens. Pathogen prevalence in post-weaned and finishing pigs was highest during winter, except for IAV-S and A. pleuropneumoniae, which were more prevalent during autumn. Associations between prevalence of several PRDC pathogens, i.e., M. hyopneumoniae, PCV-2 and PRRSV, and specific weather conditions could be demonstrated. In conclusion, the present study showed that many respiratory pathogens are present during the peri-weaning, post-weaning, and fattening periods, which may complicate the clinical picture of respiratory diseases. Interactions between PRDC pathogens and local weather conditions over the 5-year study period were demonstrated.","Vangroenweghe, Frédéric A. C.

21740,Drivers and Distribution of Henipavirus-Induced Syncytia: What Do We Know?,2021-09-02,"Programmed cell death pathways eliminate infected cells and regulate infection-associated inflammation during pathogen invasion. Cytomegaloviruses encode several distinct suppressors that block intrinsic apoptosis, extrinsic apoptosis, and necroptosis, pathways that impact pathogenesis of this ubiquitous herpesvirus. Here, we expanded the understanding of three cell autonomous suppression mechanisms on which murine cytomegalovirus relies: (i) M38.5-encoded viral mitochondrial inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA), a BAX suppressor that functions in concert with M41.1-encoded viral inhibitor of BAK oligomerization (vIBO), (ii) M36-encoded viral inhibitor of caspase-8 activation (vICA), and (iii) M45-encoded viral inhibitor of RIP/RHIM activation (vIRA). Following infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages, the virus initially deflected receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)3-dependent necroptosis, the most potent of the three cell death pathways. This process remained independent of caspase-8, although suppression of this apoptotic protease enhances necroptosis in most cell types. Second, the virus deflected TNF-mediated extrinsic apoptosis, a pathway dependent on autocrine TNF production by macrophages that proceeds independently of mitochondrial death machinery or RIPK3. Third, cytomegalovirus deflected BCL-2 family protein-dependent mitochondrial cell death through combined TNF-dependent and -independent signaling even in the absence of RIPK1, RIPK3, and caspase-8. Furthermore, each of these cell death pathways dictated a distinct pattern of cytokine and chemokine activation. Therefore, cytomegalovirus employs sequential, non-redundant suppression strategies to specifically modulate the timing and execution of necroptosis, extrinsic apoptosis, and intrinsic apoptosis within infected cells to orchestrate virus control and infection-dependent inflammation. Virus-encoded death suppressors together hold control over an intricate network that upends host defense and supports pathogenesis in the intact mammalian host.","Mandal, Pratyusha; Nagrani, Lynsey N.; Hernandez, Liliana; McCormick, Anita Louise; Dillon, Christopher P.; Koehler, Heather S.; Roback, Linda; Alnemri, Emad S.; Green, Douglas R.; Mocarski, Edward S.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473406/,138

However, incomplete, aborted plasmodesmata were occasionally seen in the common guard/epidermal cell wall, usually connected to the epidermal cell protoplast, in mature tissue. Plasmodesmatal connections between neighbouring epidermal cells were commonly observed in tissue at all stages of development. In all locations, the plasmodesmata were usually unbranched occurring singly or in small pit fields; very rarely branched, incomplete plasmodesmata were also seen in the wall between mature guard and epidermal cells. The significance of these findings were related to stomatal functioning and to the development of plasmodesmata in general.","Willmer, C.

23864,Pneumonia Caused by Emerging Viral Agents,2020-02-01,"DNA catalysts are synthetic single-stranded DNA molecules that have been identified by in vitro selection from random sequence DNA pools. The most prominent representatives of DNA catalysts (also known as DNA enzymes, deoxyribozymes, or DNAzymes) catalyze the site-specific cleavage of RNA substrates. Two distinct groups of RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes are the 10-23 and 8-17 enzymes. A typical RNA-cleaving DNA enzyme consists of a catalytic core and two short binding arms which form Watson–Crick base pairs with the RNA targets. RNA cleavage is usually achieved with the assistance of metal ions such as Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Mn(2+), Pb(2+), or Zn(2+), but several chemically modified DNA enzymes can cleave RNA in the absence of divalent metal ions. A number of studies have shown the use of 10-23 DNA enzymes for modest downregulation of therapeutically relevant RNA targets in cultured cells and in whole mammals. Here we focus on mechanistic aspects of RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes and their potential to silence therapeutically appealing viral and bacterial gene targets.

24315,Diagnosis of Viral Infections,2017-05-05,"It is generally expected that in developing countries the epidemiological transition, with improved health and lower mortality rates, will eventually lead to a demographic transition with lower fertility rates. The reductions in mortality characterising the epidemiological transition are often associated with controlling the infectious diseases within populations, which leaves the chronic diseases associated with old age, cancer and heart disease dominating the causes of death. However, if the demographic transition does not occur quickly, populations can grow rapidly, creating an increased potential for spread of infectious disease. These infectious diseases could, in turn, increase death rates amongst young people and reverse the epidemiological transition. The relationship between population growth, size and infection depends upon the changes in contact pattern associated with there being more people. If facilities can keep pace with growth, then the increase in contact rates can be kept to a minimum, and the potential reversal in the epidemic transition prevented. This makes development a crucial adjunct to population growth if the global community is not to be increasingly exposed to pandemics of infectious disease. Here we review the epidemiological and demographic theory which relates population growth and infectious disease.","Garnett, Geoffrey P.; Lewis, James J.

24510,How Does Biodiversity Influence the Ecology of Infectious Disease?,2011-06-28,"Patients with acute leukemia are at increased risk of developing infections both as a result of the leukemia and its treatment. Neutropenia is the primary risk factor associated with the development of infection, with the severity and frequency of infection increasing as the absolute neutrophil count drops below 500 cells/mm(3), as initially described by Bodey and colleagues. Other risk factors may be present including impaired cellular or humoral immunity, breakdown of normal barriers such as the skin and mucosal surfaces, and vascular access catheters and other foreign medical devices. Multiple risk factors are often present in the same patient. Additionally, the frequent use of antimicrobial agents for various indications (prophylaxis, empiric therapy, pre-emptive administration, specific or targeted therapy, and occasionally maintenance or suppressive therapy) has an impact on the nature and spectrum of infections, with the emergence/selection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms being of particular concern. Bacterial infections tend to occur early on in a neutropenic episode, with fungal infections being uncommon at this stage. If neutropenia persists, the risk for fungal infections increases. There are periodic changes in the epidemiology/spectrum of infection in patients with leukemia. It is important to conduct periodic epidemiologic and susceptibility/resistance surveys, especially at institutions dealing with large numbers of such patients, in order to detect these shifts and changes in susceptibility/resistance patterns, since empiric therapy is largely based on this information. Such surveys are conducted every 3–5 years at our institution.","Rolston, Kenneth V. I.",Infections in Hematology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120847/,138

In particular, respiratory tract infections can be caused by numerous different viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens that are indistinguishable by clinical diagnosis. Respiratory tract infections are also among the most common infections in humans, with approximately 6−9 episodes per year in children and 2−4 episodes per year in adults [1]. These infections cause considerable morbidity and mortality as well as high healthcare costs associated with doctor visits, hospitalizations, treatment, and absences from work and school.

Although many of these emerging conditions appear in the literature as case reports or case series, these sentinel cases frequently raise the public awareness that drives social movements or, in some situations, represent a warning sign for subsequent outbreaks. The emerging environmental and occupational lung diseases (EOLD) may be grouped arbitrarily into two categories: (1) conditions caused by novel utilization or routes of exposure to agents known to cause EOLD and (2) conditions caused by novel agents not known to cause specific EOLD in the past. Conditions in the first category may include those caused by new exposure scenarios in nonindustrial settings and thus a large population may be at risk. The second category includes new risk factor(s) that were not known to be associated with a specific EOLD, and thus the association between the agent and the new condition could be easily missed.

Тhis new method of outbreak analysis is based on our original model of bioterrorism risk assessment. The intention was to develop a model of quick and accurate evaluation of an unusual epidemiologic event (UEE) that would save time, money, human and material resources and reduce confusion and panic. This UEE analysis is a subtle and detailed differentiation through assessment of BA feasibility in comparison with three other types of outbreak scenarios. There are two types of differences between these four scenarios: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative and quantitative differences are defined with 23 and 10 indicators, respectively. Both types of indicators can have three different values: N/A, 0 or 1. We have carried out a feasibility analysis for subtle and detailed differentiation among four outbreak scenarios. As a tool for feasibility analysis we have introduced a “system of elimination”. System elimination is applied if one component contains all indicators scored with 0 or as N/A – the related scenario is then eliminated from further consideration. The system was applied to four UEEs: (1) an intentional attack by a deliberate use of a biological agent (Amerithrax), (2) a spontaneous outbreak of a new or re-emerging disease (“swine flu”), (3) a spontaneous outbreak by an accidental release of a pathogen (Sverdlovsk anthrax), and (4) a spontaneous natural outbreak of a known endemic disease that may mimic bioterrorism or biowarfare (Kosovo tularemia). It was found that “agent” was the most important and the most informative UEE component of the new scoring system. This system might be helpful in the analysis of unusual epidemic events and a quick differentiation between biological attacks and other epidemics.","Radosavljevic, Vladan",Biopreparedness and Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121225/,138

Neutropenia predisposes patients to fungal, bacterial and viral infections. Antibacterial antifungal and antiviral prophylaxis have caused a significant reduction in some of these infections. There are two main types of cutaneous infections : primary cutaneous infections and cutaneous manifestations of a disseminated infection. In the latter, skin lesions may be the window to disseminated bloodstream infection and the first and only evidence of a disseminated life threatening infection. The diagnosis may be at your fingertips; therefore a thorough skin exam is the clue. However, it’s also important to know the characteristic lesions associated with different infections. It will help expedite diagnosis so appropriate treatment is initiated promptly in neutropenic patients, which can be lifesaving. In a retrospective study of 43 neutropenic febrile patients with cutaneous lesions, fungal infections were the most frequent, and nodular lesions on the lower extremities were the most prevalent (Naorungroj and Aiempanakit, J Am Acad Dermatol 74:AB166, 2016). Skin biopsy for pathological study and culture remains the gold standard and should be obtained early to confirm the suspected diagnosis. In these immunocompromised patients the inflammatory response is altered by either the primary disease or its treatment. Therefore, routine pathogens may present in an atypical fashion, with diminished or absent induration, erythema, or pustulation in response to bacterial resulting cutaneous infection without typical cellulitis (Urabe, Clin Infect Dis 39:S53–S55, 2004). Skin lesions are evaluated not only by morphology, but also in the context of the clinical setting and biopsy result. The skin biopsy is inexpensive, relatively noninvasive and without contraindication, and may avoid the need for more invasive procedures such an open lung biopsy (Grossman, et al., Cutaneous manifestations of infection in the immunocompromised host. Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, New York, 2012). In addition to antimicrobial therapy, surgery should not be postponed in the face of progressive skin and soft tissue infection in this population (Brzozowski and Ross, J Hand Surg Br 22:679–680, 1997).","Rihana, Nancy; Sampson, Mindy",Infections in Neutropenic Cancer Patients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121505/,138

25670,Introduction to Socioecological Dimensions of Infectious Diseases and Health in Southeast Asia,2015-04-01,"Climate change is projected to impact human health in many ways including changes in water availability and quality, air quality and sanitation, availability and access to food and nutrition and transmission of vector-borne diseases. Environmental consequences of climate change, such as extreme heat waves, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation resulting in flooding and droughts, intense hurricanes (cyclones, typhoons) and degraded air quality, can affect directly and indirectly the physical, social and psychological health of humans. Climate change and human health have emerged as an important focus of research in the World Health Organization since 2008. However, the First International Conference on Health and Climate organised by the WHO in August 2014 in Geneva recognises the relevance of the impact of climate change on human health from a global-change and health perspective. This chapter also highlights policies of the United States, China and India towards GHG emission reduction and the successful climate agreement in Paris in December 2015.","Akhtar, Rais",Climate Change and Human Health Scenario in South and Southeast Asia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122334/,138
25672,"Epidemiology and Control: Principles, Practice and Programs",2014-02-27,"Lower respiratory tract infections in children are often viral in origin. Unfortunately in this time of significant antimicrobial resistance of infectious organisms, especially bacteria, there is still a tendency for clinicians to manage a child who coughs with antibiotics. In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined “pneumonia” as a condition that only occurs in children who have “fast breathing or chest wall indrawing”. That would delineate upper respiratory tract infections from those in the lower airway. However, in addition to pneumonia another important entity exists in the lower respiratory tract that is almost always viral in origin. This condition is acute viral bronchiolitis. The concept of “acute lower respiratory tract infection” (ALRTI) has emerged and it is becoming increasing evident from a number of studies that the infectious base of both acute pneumonia (AP) and acute bronchiolitis in children has a mixed etiology of microorganisms. Therefore, whilst certain clinical phenotypes do not require antibiotics the actual microbial etiology is much less distinct.","Green, Robin J.; Zar, Heather J.; White, Debbie A.; Madhi, Shabir A.","Viral Infections in Children, Volume II",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122336/,138

The main focus of this discussion is on the relationship between GHG and leadership summits, including both the “G8” and “G20.” The discussion first notes that while GHG has become a central focus for international diplomacy it has become ever more fragmented as new actors and venues negotiate aspects of global health without apparent reference to a central agency or process. It then briefly reviews the growing role of foundations before focusing on the role of G8 summitry in GHG. The final section and conclusion consider how the G20 could provide a further venue for GHG.","Cooper, Andrew F.",Global Health Diplomacy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122370/,138

25813,Viral Hepatitis B,2019-07-10,"There are many positive attributes to DNA vaccination that make it a conceptually desirable platform. In clinical studies, however, standard DNA injection alone generally induces low levels of transgene-specific immunity when compared to other vaccine approaches. In order to boost the immunogenicity of this platform, next-generation DNA vaccines require additional techniques such as the administration of electroporation. This new method involves the generation of a brief electric field in tissue around a local injection site that results in the transient poration, or permeabilization, of the cellular membranes. As a result, antigen-specific immune responses are greatly enhanced and are likely due to increased DNA uptake and antigen expression. Thus, electroporation-mediated DNA vaccination represents a promising new strategy for the elicitation of strong immune responses directed against the expressed antigen(s) and not the vector, and ongoing studies are currently underway to optimize the working parameters of this technique. Here, we review the uses of this technology in conjunction with vaccination and suggest future directions for its further exploration.","Fagone, Paolo; Shedlock, Devon J.; Kemmerer, Stephen; Rabussay, Dietmar; Weiner, David B.",Clinical Aspects of Electroporation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122510/,138

26389,The Respiratory System,2007,"Anesthesia for liver transplantation pertains to a continuum of critical care of patients with end-stage liver disease. Hence, anesthesiologists, armed with a comprehensive understanding of pathophysiology and physiologic effects of liver transplantation on recipients, are expected to maintain homeostasis of all organ function. Specifically, patients with fulminant hepatic failure develop significant changes in cerebral function, and cerebral perfusion is maintained by monitoring cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, and intracranial pressure. Hyperdynamic circulation is challenged by the postreperfusion syndrome, which may lead to cardiovascular collapse. The goal of circulatory support is to maintain tissue perfusion via optimal preload, contractility, and heart rate using the guidance of right-heart catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography. Portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome have high morbidity and mortality, and they should be properly evaluated preoperatively. Major bleeding is a common occurrence, and euvolemia is maintained using a rapid infusion device. Pre-existing coagulopathy is compounded by dilution, fibrinolysis, heparin effect, and excessive activation. It is treated using selective component or pharmacologic therapy based on the viscoelastic properties of whole blood. Hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia from massive transfusion, lack of hepatic function, and the postreperfusion syndrome should be aggressively treated. Close communication between all parties involved in liver transplantation is also equally valuable in achieving a successful outcome.","Kang, Yoogoo; Elia, Elia",Contemporary Liver Transplantation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123279/,138

There has not been any systematic empirical study of the dynamics of emerging coordination behaviour and knowledge transfer process during a disease outbreak. In this paper, we first introduce our approach for the analysis of multi-agency intervention during a disease outbreak using the study of social networks. Using social networks and its analytic framework, we explore questions such as: How does the multi-agency coordination emerge for supporting the complex knowledge transfer process during different phases of disease outbreak? How effective are these formal and informal coordination mechanisms in achieving a robust outcome in response coordination through effective knowledge transfer process during the outbreak? What are the key lessons learned by studying the emerging coordination and knowledge transfer process during past disease outbreak in improving the multi-agency preparedness for dealing with future outbreaks? The discussion is supported by a qualitative study of the implementation of the results of the analysis. We reveal that profound understanding of social network behaviour and emerging coordination concepts are pivotal to the optimisation of knowledge transfer process which is a prerequisite for successful outbreak intervention. We look qualitatively at how Hunter New England Area Health Services applied these concepts to lead a successful coordination plan during an H1N109 endemic.","Bdeir, Fadl; Hossain, Liaquat; Crawford, John",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149177/,138

While agents have their initial preferences on issues, they may influence others and be influenced by others, consequently changing their preferences or choices on these issues in the process of decision-making. Though the influence among multiple agents making decisions on one issue and the dependency (influence) among multiple issues decided by one agent have been fully discussed in previous work, the influence from multiple sources across both agents and issues in the context of combinatorial and collective decision-making has been ignored. In this paper, we proposed a preliminary framework to address the influence transcending multiple agents and multiple issues with two rules: weighted influence and one dominant influence.","Luo, Hang",Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215191/,138

It takes as input a set of objects (learning set) described with respect to a collection of condition and decision attributes. It generates a set of if-then decision rules. Initial versions of dominance based rough set approximation methods assume a single decision maker. Furthermore, the proposed extensions to group decision making mainly use an input oriented aggregation strategy, which requires a high level of agreement between the decision makers. In this paper, we propose an output oriented aggregation strategy to coherently combine different sets of decision rules obtained from different decision makers. The proposed aggregation algorithm is illustrated by using real-world data relative to a business school admission where two decision makers are involved. Results show that aggregation algorithm is able to reproduce the individual assignments of students with a very limited preferential information loss.","Saad, Inès; Chakhar, Salem",Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215197/,138

We estimate cooperation of each node with different groups of vertices that surround it via construction of belief functions. The obtained intensities of cooperation are further redistributed over all elements of a particular group of nodes that results in pignistic probabilities of node-to-node interactions. Finally, pairwise interactions can be aggregated into the centrality vector that ranks nodes with respect to derived values. We also adapt the proposed model to multiplex networks. In this type of networks nodes can be differently connected with each other on several levels of interaction. Various combination rules help to analyze such systems as a single entity, that has many advantages in the study of complex systems. In particular, Dempster rule takes into account the inconsistency in initial data that has an impact on the final centrality ranking. We also provide a numerical example that illustrates the distinctive features of the proposed model. Additionally, we establish analytical relations between a proposed measure and classical centrality measures for particular graph configurations.","Lepskiy, Alexander; Meshcheryakova, Natalia",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274755/,138

It is expected that there will be a large increase in passenger traffic at airports and railway stations and other public places. This paper proposes one solution to reduce the transmission of the disease through fomites such as passenger luggage and packages at bus/train stations and airports in the country. A tunnel system similar to the X-ray machines used for passenger luggage at airports has been proposed for disinfection of fomites. The system consists of eight 36 W T8 TUV bulbs illuminating each square meter area of the fomites on a conveyor belt for 10 s. For the standard airline luggage dimensions, 24 such bulbs will be distributed evenly on all four sides of the tunnel. The entry and exit points on the conveyor are shielded from the UV-C light leakage by placing thin plastic (such as acrylic) curtains. An optional non-foaming soap solution spray system may be used as an additional disinfection step. The toxic sodium hypochlorite solutions are not used in this design. Non-foaming soap solutions which are very effective against coronavirus and are non-toxic and biodegradable may be used as an optional disinfectant. It is to be noted that while the disinfection systems are designed to effectively mitigate the threat of coronavirus on the passenger fomite surfaces, these are purely based on theoretical calculations and have not been tested with actual viral particles. However, considering the time-sensitive emergency with COVID-19 pandemic, these systems will be very useful even without rigorous campaign of testing.","Murthy, Ganti S.",Trans Indian Natl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7305480/,138
35266,Introduction to Acute Infective Diarrhoea,2020-06-22,"Mesostructured silica, dendrimers, and allotropes of carbon were exhaustively used in biomedical, cosmetics, semiconductors, and food industry applications. Considering the huge prospect of nanomaterials, their potential hazards on exposure to humans and their related ecotoxicological effects needs to be summarized. Nanoparticles with size below 100 nm could pass into the lung and then to blood through inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. As nanotechnology innovation is expected to achieve $ 2231 million by 2025, humans will be exposed ever increasingly in day-to-day life and in industries. In this review, the latest synthetic methodology of silica, dendrimers, and CNTs, their biological applications (in vitro and in vivo) related to toxicity were discussed. In terms of structured silica, the toxic and non-toxic effect induced by specific templates (cetylpyridinium bromide, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, C16L-tryptophan, C16-L-histidine, and C16-L-poline) that are used to generate mesoporous silica, silica nanoparticle sizes (25, 50, 60, 115, and 500 nm), and silane functionalization (NH(2) and COOH) were discussed. The recent applications of different generations (G3, G4, G5, and G6) of amphiphilic Janus dendrimers were discussed along with toxicity effect of different charged dendrimers (cationic and anionic) and effect of PEGylation. Recent synthesis, advantages, and disadvantages of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were presented for structures like single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The influence of diameter of SWCNTs (linear and short), thickness (thin and thick), effect of oxidation, metal oxide species (TiO(2), Fe, and Au), and biocompatible polymers (polyethylene glycol, bisphosphonate, and alendronate) were shown in relation to molecular pathways in animal cells.","Ravinayagam, Vijaya; Jermy, B.

Here, we discuss the theory’s implications for understanding the widely varying ways in which people have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that regardless of whether one consciously believes that the virus is a major threat to life or only a minor inconvenience, fear of death plays an important role in driving one’s attitudes and behavior related to the virus. We focus on the terror management theory distinction between proximal defenses, which are activated when thoughts of death are in current focal attention and are logically related to the threat at hand, and distal defenses, which are activated when thoughts of death are on the fringes of one’s consciousness and entail the pursuit of meaning, personal value, and close relationships. We use this framework to discuss the many ways in which COVID-19 undermines psychological equanimity, the diverse ways people have responded to this threat, and the role of ineffective terror management in psychological distress and disorder that may emerge in response to the virus.","Pyszczynski, Tom; Lockett, McKenzie; Greenberg, Jeff; Solomon, Sheldon",J Humanist Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498956/,138

Spatiotemporal analysis was adopted to explore the spatial patterns of the spread of COVID-19 during the period from 29th April to 30th June 2020. Our assessment was made using five geospatial techniques wifin a Geographical Information System (GIS) context, including a weighted mean centre (WMC), standard deviational ellipses, Moran’s I autocorrelation coefficient, Getis-Ord General-G high/low clustering, and Getis-Ord [Formula: see text] statistic. The Moran’s me-/G- statistics proved dat COVID-19 cases in datasets (numbers of cases) were clustered throughout the study period. The Moran’s me and Z scores were above the 2.25 threshold (a confidence level above 95%), ranging from 2274 cases on 29th April to 40,070 cases on 30th June 2020. The results of [Formula: see text] showed varying rates of infections, wif a large spatial variability between the different wilayats (district). The epidemic situation in some wilayats, such as Mutrah, As-Seeb, and Bowsher in the Muscat Governorate, was more severe, wif Z score higher TEMPthan 5, and the current transmission still presents an increasing trend. dis study indicated dat the directional pattern of COVID-19 cases TEMPhas moved from northeast to northwest and southwest, wif the total impacted region increasing over time. Also, the results indicate dat the rate of COVID-19 infections is higher in the most populated areas. The findings of dis paper provide a solid basis for future study by investigating the most resolute hotspots in more detail and may help decision-makers identify targeted zones for alleviation plans.

The multiplex polymerase chain reaction BioFire Pneumonia (PN) panel detects 15 common bacterial species semiquantitatively as copy number/mL, 8 viral species, and 7 resistance genes in about an hour within the clinical laboratory. METHODS: We tested 396 unique endotracheal or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens with the BioFire Pneumonia panel and compared the bacterial detections to conventional gram stain and culture results. RESULTS: Of the 396 patients, 138 grew at least 1 bacterium that had a target on the PN panel, and 136/138 (98.6%) were detected by the panel. A total of 177 isolates were recovered in culture and the PN panel detected 174/177 (98.3%). A further 20% of patients had additional targets detected that were not found on standard culture (specificity 69%, positive predictive value 63%, and negative predictive value 98.9%). Copy number was strongly related to standard semiquantitative growth on plates reported by the laboratory (eg, 1+, 2+, 3+ growths) and was significantly higher in those specimens that grew a potential pathogen. Both higher copy number and bacterial detections found by the PN panel, but not found in culture, were strongly positively related to the level of white blood cells reported in the initial gram stain. CONCLUSIONS: Higher copy number and bacterial detections by the PN panel are related to the host respiratory tract inflammatory response. If laboratories can achieve a rapid turnaround time, the PN panel should have a significant impact both on patient management and on antibiotic stewardship.","Rand, Kenneth H; Beal, Stacy G; Cherabuddi, Kartikeya; Couturier, Brianne; Lingenfelter, Beth; Rindlisbacher, Cory; Jones, Jay; Houck, Herbert J; Lessard, Kylie J; Tremblay, Elizabeth E",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7793460/,138

Using simulations anchored in data and the existing literature, we conclude that baby bonds would have the single largest effect.

At first glance, the health promotion perspective might seem far away from handling the serious impacts caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, as health promotion is about enabling people to increase control over their health and its determinants, paradoxically health promotion seems to be ever more important in times of crisis and pandemics. Probably, in the future, pandemics will be a part of the global picture along with the non-communicable diseases. These facts strongly demand the health care services to reorient in a health promoting direction. The IUHPE Global Working Group on Salutogenesis suggests that health promotion competencies along with a reorientation of professional leadership towards salutogenesis, empowerment and participation are required.

50802,Discovery of Staphylococcus aureus Adhesion Inhibitors by Automated Imaging and Their Characterization in a Mouse Model of Persistent Nasal Colonization,2021-03-18,"Recently, Castryck, Lange, Martindale, Panny, and Renes proposed CSIDH (pronounced “sea-side”) as a candidate post-quantum “commutative group action.” It has attracted much attention and interest, in part because it enables noninteractive Diffie–Hellman-like key exchange with quite small communication. Subsequently, CSIDH has also been used as a foundation for digital signatures. In 2003–04, Kuperberg and then Regev gave asymptotically subexponential quantum algorithms for “hidden shift” problems, which can be used to recover the CSIDH secret key from a public key. In late 2011, Kuperberg gave a follow-up quantum algorithm called the collimation sieve (“c-sieve” for short), which improves the prior ones, in particular by using exponentially less quantum memory and offering more parameter tradeoffs. While recent works have analyzed the concrete cost of the original algorithms (and variants) against CSIDH, nothing of this nature was previously available for the c-sieve. This work fills that gap. Specifically, we generalize Kuperberg’s collimation sieve to work for arbitrary finite cyclic groups, provide some practical efficiency improvements, give a classical (i.e., non-quantum) simulator, run experiments for a wide range of parameters up to the actual CSIDH-512 group order, and concretely quantify the complexity of the c-sieve against CSIDH. Our main conclusion is that the proposed CSIDH parameters provide relatively little quantum security beyond what is given by the cost of quantumly evaluating the CSIDH group action itself (on a uniform superposition). For example, the cost of CSIDH-512 key recovery is only about [Formula: see text] quantum evaluations using [Formula: see text] bits of quantumly accessible classical memory (plus relatively small other resources). This improves upon a prior estimate of [Formula: see text] evaluations and [Formula: see text] qubits of quantum memory, for a variant of Kuperberg’s original sieve. Under the plausible assumption that quantum evaluation does not cost much more than what is given by a recent “best case” analysis, CSIDH-512 can therefore be broken using significantly less than [Formula: see text] quantum T-gates. This strongly invalidates its claimed NIST level 1 quantum security, especially when accounting for the MAXDEPTH restriction. Moreover, under analogous assumptions for CSIDH-1024 and -1792, which target higher NIST security levels, except near the high end of the MAXDEPTH range even these instantiations fall short of level 1.","Peikert, Chris",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991657/,138

Modeling results stipulate that the mortality rate increase as the age increase and it is found that most of the death cases belong to the age group 60–80. Cluster-based analysis of age groups is also conducted to analyze the maximum targeted age-groups. An association between positive COVID-19 cases and deceased cases are also presented, with the impact on male and female death cases due to corona. Additionally, we have also presented an artificial intelligence-based statistical approach to predict the survival chances of corona infected people in South Korea with the analysis of the impact on the exploratory factors, including age-groups, gender, temporal evolution, etc. To analyze the coronavirus cases, we applied machine learning with hyperparameters tuning and deep learning models with an autoencoder-based approach for estimating the influence of the disparate features on the spread of the disease and predict the survival possibilities of the quarantined patients in isolation. The model calibrated in the study is based on positive corona infection cases and presents the analysis over different aspects that proven to be impactful to analyze the temporal trends in the current situation along with the exploration of deceased cases due to coronavirus.

Therefore, many smog removal (i.e., desmogging) models are proposed so far to remove the effect of smog from images. The desmogging models are based upon a physical model, it means it requires efficient estimation of transmission map and atmospheric veil from a single smoggy image. Therefore, many prior based restoration models are proposed in the literature to estimate the transmission map and an atmospheric veil. However, these models utilized computationally extensive minimization of an energy function. Also, the existing restoration models suffer from various issues such as distortion of texture, edges, and colors. Therefore, in this paper, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to estimate the physical attributes of smoggy images. Oblique gradient channel prior (OGCP) is utilized to restore the smoggy images. Initially, a dataset of smoggy and sunny images are obtained. Thereafter, we have trained CNN to estimate the smog gradient from smoggy images. Finally, based upon the computed smog gradient, OGCP is utilized to restore the still smoggy images. Performance analyses reveal that the proposed CNN-OGCP based desmogging model outperforms the existing desmogging models in terms of various performance metrics.

Interactions between sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. The spike glycoprotein binds to respiratory epithelium through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which endogenously interacts with Angiotensin (Ang) II to yield Angiotensin 1‐7. Stimulation of human vascular smooth muscle cells by Ang II leads to increased mRNA expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for synthesis of chondroitin 4‐sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6‐disulfate (CSE), respectively. Total sulfated GAGs, increased sulfotransferase activity, and increased expression of the proteoglycans biglycan, syndecan‐1, perlecan, and versican followed treatment by Ang II. Candesartan, an Angiotensin II receptor blocker (Arb), largely, but incompletely, inhibited these increases, and the differences from baseline remained significant. These results suggest that another effect of Ang II also contributes to the increased expression of chondroitin sulfotransferases, total sulfated GAGs, and proteoglycans. We hypothesize that activation of ACE2 may contribute to these increases and suggest that the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike glycoprotein interaction with ACE2 may also increase chondroitin sulfotransferases, sulfated GAGs, and proteoglycans and thereby contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to respiratory compromise in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Tobacman, Joanne; Bhattacharyya, Sumit; Kotlo, Kumar",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239765/,138

Fortunately, a vaccine has recently been approved, yet there are no therapeutics for infected individuals. From advances in biotechnology, the genome and structure of SARS‐CoV‐2 is known. Three proteins are anchored in the viral envelope, Spike (S), Envelope (E), and Membrane (M), which is linked to the Nucleocapsid (N) protein connecting to the viral RNA genome. Our lab is developing an innovative therapy that delivers multiple therapeutic microRNAs to simultaneously block the expression of these distinct viral proteins. In the current work, we propose an anti‐Covid microRNA therapy designed to degrade each of the mRNA transcripts of these critical genes, stopping viral assembly, and reducing the severity of infection. The design of the anti‐Covid microRNAs 1) mimics human microRNA cluster 17‐92a structural stability, 2) forms guide‐RNA substrates for the RNA induced silencing complex, and 3) are complementary to specific regions of the SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA genome without off‐targets effects in the human genome. Twenty‐one microRNA sequences were designed to target the S gene, six for N, two for M, and one for E. These were cloned into our microRNA‐17‐92 therapy vector which expresses six distinct anti‐Covid RNA therapeutics simultaneously. We have stably transfected the S and N gene into our tissue culture model to measure the efficacy of the anti‐Covid microRNA therapy to down‐regulate the S and N protein expression. We will be presenting on the efficacy of the anti‐Covid microRNA to knockdown the expression of the viral proteins, S and N. In addition, we are examining the secondary structure of our RNA therapy using SHAPE‐MAP to optimize RNA therapeutic stability in comparison to the stable structure of the original Mir‐17‐92a.","Gawargi, Flobater; Sine, Laura; Hicks, Martin",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239770/,138

Blood. 2015;125(20):3144-3152.",2015-07-16,"The SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, which causes the COVID‐19 disease, has been a focus of concern around the world, setting records as a modern‐day pandemic. The Center for Disease Control has confirmed over 86 million cases in the world with over 1.9 million confirmed deaths as of January 5, 2021. SARS‐CoV‐2 continues to be a serious threat to global public health, leaving a distinct footprint in human history. Our research visualizes and contextualizes the mechanism of remdesivir, an antiviral nucleotide analog prodrug. Remdesivir targets the viral RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to inhibit replication of the virus. This process is facilitated by a subunit replication‐and‐transcription complex of three major nonstructural proteins (nsps): nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12. With our three‐dimensional model (PDB ID 7BV2), we depict the mechanism of remdesivir inhibition of the copying of the viral RNA template through the central channel of RdRp by terminating chain elongation. Our protein model will guide other researchers and students through the mechanism of action of remdesivir and emphasizes the role of this adenosine nucleotide analogue as it binds to the RNA primer. Our model illustrates how remdesivir impacts viral replication by inhibiting the viral RdRp of SARS‐CoV‐2.","Eid, Asal; Kalyanaraman, Karshana; Nguyen, Binh; Dale, Sierra; Rusch‐Salazar, Laura",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239791/,138

Additionally, we investigated whether variation in participants’ goal appraisals and the motivational qualities emergent in their goal descriptions would predict variation in dimensions of identity development, both concurrently at age 18 and prospectively at age 23. Results of an exploratory, mixed method analysis of participants’ (N = 129, 56.6% male, M(age) = 18.24, SD = 0.37) goal data revealed diversity in education and work goals, strong potentials for intentional self-development reflected across goal appraisals, and more nuanced reflections of intentional self-development across the motivational qualities emergent in goal descriptions. Results partially supported the hypothesis that goal appraisals and motivational qualities that reflect potentials for intentional self-development would predict kindred processes of identity development across the first five years of EA. These findings contribute to a nascent empirical literature focused on the interrelationship of goal and identity constructs during EA and suggest new avenues for future research.

In recent years priority was given to the minimization of treatment-associated toxicity. For induction of remission of severe granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), glucocorticoids are used as well as cyclophosphamide and rituximab. The current recommendations enable a more rapid tapering of steroid dose and advise caution in the use of plasmapheresis. Rituximab and azathioprine are available options for maintenance of remission. The choice of medication and duration of remission maintenance are oriented particularly to the risk of recurrence. The importance of low-dose steroids has not yet been finally clarified. New treatment approaches, such as the C5a receptor inhibitor avacopan could enable a minimized steroid treatment in the future. The treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is less evidence-based and consists of glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive agents depending on the severity and increasingly more biologics, e.g. interleukin‑5 blockade. Supportive measures (e.g. vaccinations, infection prophylaxis, cardiovascular risk management) are increasing in importance. Future treatment strategies must take the individual risk (e.g. ANCA subtype, relapse risk) more into consideration for selection and duration of treatment.","Schönermarck, Ulf; Vielhauer, Volker",Nephrologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8404175/,138

An assessment of the past versus the present of the social scientific study of Jewry is offered, for which I note that the way to understand the social and religious adjustments of American Jews is to examine their economic and political adjustments first. 2. The changes across a 50-year time span of ASSJ as a professional organization are charted and reveal that between 1970 and 2020 the organization had more than tripled in size, became much more gender-balanced, and initiated a journal (Contemporary Jewry), which published dozens of articles in the latest 3-year cycle. 3. Grounds for optimism versus pessimism in viewing the future of American Jewry are examined as follows: a. Antisemitism is increasing, but Jews are the most warmly regarded US religious group. b. Interfaith marriage continues, but a majority of children are receiving a Jewish upbringing. c. The religious “nones” are growing, but the great majority of them feel proud to be Jewish. d. Geographic mobility and residential dispersion continue, but new means of internet connections are growing. 4. Recommendations for the future of the social scientific study of US Jewry are offered. 5. Recommendations for the future of ASSJ are suggested.

57779,Non-Coding RNAs in Human Breast Milk: A Systematic Review,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Digital technological development in the last 20 years has led to significant growth in digital collection, use, and sharing of health data. To maintain public trust in the digital society and to enable acceptable policy-making in the future, it is important to investigate people’s preferences for sharing digital health data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to elicit the preferences of the public in different Northern European countries (the United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland, and Sweden) for sharing health information in different contexts. METHODS: Respondents in this discrete choice experiment completed several choice tasks, in which they were asked if data sharing in the described hypothetical situation was acceptable to them. Latent class logistic regression models were used to determine attribute-level estimates and heterogeneity in preferences. We calculated the relative importance of the attributes and the predicted acceptability for different contexts in which the data were shared from the estimates. RESULTS: In the final analysis, we used 37.83% (1967/5199) questionnaires. All attributes influenced the respondents’ willingness to share health information (P<.001). The most important attribute was whether the respondents were informed about their data being shared. The possibility of opting out from sharing data was preferred over the opportunity to consent (opt-in). Four classes were identified in the latent class model, and the average probabilities of belonging were 27% for class 1, 32% for class 2, 23% for class 3, and 18% for class 4. The uptake probability varied between 14% and 85%, depending on the least to most preferred combination of levels. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents from different countries have different preferences for sharing their health data regarding the value of a review process and the reason for their new use. Offering respondents information about the use of their data and the possibility to opt out is the most preferred governance mechanism.","Viberg Johansson, Jennifer; Bentzen, Heidi Beate; Shah, Nisha; Haraldsdóttir, Eik; Jónsdóttir, Guðbjörg Andrea; Kaye, Jane; Mascalzoni, Deborah; Veldwijk, Jorien",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406119/,138

Herein, we report the clinical, etiological, and immunological characteristics of 62 children age < 1 year. We measured 27 cytokines in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from 62 children age < 1 year who were diagnosed with CAP, and then, we analyzed correlations among disease severity, clinical parameters, and etiology. Of the entire cohort, three cytokines associated with interleukin-17- (IL-17-) producing helper T cells (T(h)17 cells), IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17, were significantly elevated in sCAP patients with high fold changes (FCs); in BAL, these cytokines were intercorrelated and associated with blood neutrophil counts, Hb levels, and mixed bacterial-viral infections. BAL IL-1β (area under the curve (AUC) 0.820), BAL IL-17 (AUC 0.779), and plasma IL-6 (AUC 0.778) had remarkable predictive power for sCAP.

Reflecting on experiences conducting twenty-seven remote interviews with former British mineworkers, this article explores how meaningful interviews can be produced with certain groups via video conferencing software and over the telephone. While some of the observational benefits of in-person interviewing were lost, there were gains in terms of the comfort of interviewees and interviewer alike. The reciprocity of video conferencing software went some way to disrupt the power dynamics of oral history interviews. Likewise, interviewees seemed more self-reflexive and willing to discuss sensitive topics when talking via online video-conferencing platforms than over the telephone, or inperson. My experience demands that we rethink orthodox methodological advice concerning best practice. The remote oral history interview can allow access to groups who are hard to reach, and offers a means through which vulnerable interviewees can regain some sense of identity and agency in a time of social dislocation.","Peirson-Webber, Emily",Hist Workshop J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500157/,138
60048,RNAi therapeutics: an antiviral strategy for human infections.,2020-11-07,"Background Rhomboid domain containing 1 (RHBDD1) plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Silibinin, which is a natural extract from milk thistle, has shown anti-tumor effects against various tumors. Here, we investigate whether silibinin affects the function of RHBDD1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Methods The Oncomine database and an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay were used to determine the RHBDD1 expression levels in lung cancer tissues. The associations between RHBDD1 and overall survival rate or clinicopathological parameters were respectively assessed using the Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis or Chi-squared test. CCK-8 and Transwell assays were applied to analyze cell proliferation, migration and invasion. A549 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of silibinin. RHBDD1 knockdown and overexpression were achieved via transfection with si-RHBDD1 or RHBDD1 overexpression plasmid, respectively. Western blotting was performed to measure the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Results We found that overexpression of RHBDD1 in lung cancer tissues correlates with a poor prognosis of survival. Clinical specimen analysis showed that upregulation of RHBDD1 correlates remarkably well with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Silibinin suppresses A549 cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, RHBDD1 was downregulated in silibinin-treated A549 cells. RHBDD1 overexpression reversed the suppressive effects of silibinin on A549 cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT expression, while its knockdown enhanced them. Conclusions These findings shown an anti-tumor impact of silibinin on NSCLC cells via repression of RHBDD1.","Xu, Suyan; Zhang, Hongyan; Wang, Aifeng; Ma, Yongcheng; Gan, Yuan; Li, Guofeng",Cellular & molecular biology letters,https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-020-00229-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528541/,138

CF involves the inflammatory processes and is considered as a multisystem disorder that is not confined to lungs, but it also affects other vital organs that leads to numerous co-morbidities. The respiratory disorder in the CF results in mortality and morbidity which is characterized by series of serious events involving mucus hypersecretion, microbial infections, airways obstruction, inflammation, destruction of epithelium, tissue remodeling and terminal lung diseases. Mucins are the high molecular weight glycoproteins important for the viscoelastic properties of the mucus, play a significant role in the disease mechanisms. Determining the functional association between the CFTR and mucins might help to identify the putative target for specific therapeutic approach. In fact, furin enzyme which helps in the entry of novel COVID-19 virus into the cell, is upregulated in CF and this can also serve as a potential target for CF treatment. Moreover, the use of nano-formulations for CF treatment is an area of research being widely studied as they have also demonstrated promising outcomes. The in-depth knowledge of non-coding RNAs like miRNAs and lncRNAs and their functional association with CFTR gene expression and mutation can provide a different range of opportunity to identify the promising therapeutic approaches for CF.","Kotnala, Sudhir; Dhasmana, Anupam; Kashyap, Vivek K; Chauhan, Subhash C; Yallapu, Murali M; Jaggi, Meena",Life sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33383045/,138

Subjects' perceived risk of procedure related loss and fetal chromosomal problem were obtained via survey where patients rated risk from 0 (no risk) to 10 (highest risk). RESULTS There were no differences in sociodemographic factors between women undergoing a diagnostic procedure compared to those not undergoing a procedure. As the perceived risk for having a baby with genetic problem increased by 1 point, the estimated odds of having the diagnostic procedure increased by 43% controlling for the perceived risk of procedure related loss (p<.0001). Similarly, as the perceived risk of miscarriage increased by 1 point, the odds of having the diagnostic procedure decreased by 40%, controlling for the perceived risk of having a baby with a genetic problem (p<.0001). The main reason women cited for not undergoing a procedure was fear of procedure related loss.

Attempts to reduce LLF have led to the development of various anti-fogging fluids and warming devices. Limited literature exists directly comparing these techniques. We constructed a model peritoneum to simulate LLF and to compare the efficacy of various anti-fogging techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS Intraperitoneal space was simulated using a suction bag suspended within an 8 L container of water. LLF was induced by varying the temperature and humidity within the model peritoneum. Various anti-fogging techniques were assessed including scope warmers, FREDTM, ResoclearTM, chlorhexidine, betadine and immersion in heated saline. These products were trialled with and without the use of a disposable scope warmer. Vision scores were evaluated by the same investigator for all tests and rated according to a predetermined scale. Fogging was assessed for each product or technique 30 times and a mean vision rating was recorded. RESULTS All products tested imparted some benefit, but FREDTM performed better than all other techniques. Betadine and ResoclearTM performed no better than the use of a scope warmer alone. Immersion in saline prior to insertion resulted in decreased vision ratings. The robotic scope did not result in LLF within the model. CONCLUSIONS In standard laparoscopes, the most superior preventative measure was FREDTM utilised on a pre-warmed scope. Despite improvements in LLF with other products FREDTM was better than all other techniques. The robotic laparoscope performed superiorly regarding LLF compared to standard laparoscope.","Manning, Todd G; Papa, Nathan; Perera, Marlon; McGrath, Shannon; Christidis, Daniel; Khan, Munad; O'Beirne, Richard; Campbell, Nicholas; Bolton, Damien; Lawrentschuk, Nathan",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5772-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28791559/,138

This study aimed to (a) understand the satisfaction level of the online information related to COVID-19 in people with and without chronic diseases; (b) explore information-searching behavior and digital health literacy in PWCD; and (3) identify the possible predictors of information satisfaction among PWCD. METHODS This was a multicity, cross-sectional study using an online survey with a convenience sample of people who (a) were 15 years of age or older and (b) had access to the Internet in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. FINDINGS Four thousand four hundred and seventy-two subjects completed the survey, of whom less than 50% felt satisfied with the online information. About 20% of respondents (n = 882) were diagnosed with at least one chronic disease and reported a lower level of information satisfaction (p = .003) than the people without chronic diseases. The majority of the PWCD obtained their online health information from social media. Higher digital health literacy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.07), higher frequency of searches regarding symptoms of COVID-19 (adjusted OR = 2.07), higher perceived importance of quickly learning from the information searched (adjusted OR = 1.63), and lower frequency of searches on the topic of dealing with psychological stress (adjusted OR = 0.54) were found to be predictors of information satisfaction among PWCD. CONCLUSIONS The majority of PWCD sought online information related to COVID-19 from social media, and their level of information satisfaction was significantly lower than among people without chronic diseases. Digital health literacy is a strong and significant predictor of information satisfaction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE To support PWCD, we not only have to provide them with clear and accurate information, but also promote their digital health literacy so that they may seek, understand, and appraise health information from the Internet to make appropriate health-related judgments and decisions.","Kor, Patrick Pui Kin; Leung, Angela Yee Man; Parial, Laurence Lloyd; Wong, Eliza Mi Ling; Dadaczynski, Kevin; Okan, Orkan; Amoah, Padmore Adusei; Wang, Shan Shan; Deng, Renli; Cheung, Teris Cheuk Chi; Molassiotis, Alex",Journal of nursing scholarship : an official publication of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316121/,138

A literature review and expert opinion.,2021-01-28,"Safe, therapeutically effective, and patient-compliant drug delivery systems are needed to design novel tools and strategies to combat the deadliest of diseases such as cancer, SARS, H7N9 avian influenza, and dengue infection. The major challenges in drug delivery are cytotoxicity, poor biodistribution, insufficient functionality, ineffective drug incorporation in delivery devices, and subsequent drug release. Clay minerals are a class of nanolayered silicates that have good biocompatibility, high specific surface area, chemical inertness, colloid, and thixotropy, and are attractive practical and potential nanomaterials in medicine. These properties enable the usage of nanoclays as drug carriers for the delivery of antibiotics, antihypertensive drugs, anti-psychotic, and anticancer drugs. The review examines the latest advances in nanoclay-based drug delivery systems and related applications in gene therapy and tissue engineering. Clay minerals, particularly montmorillonite, kaolinite, and halloysite are used to delay and/or target drug release or even improve drug dissolution due to their surface charge. Chemical modification of clay minerals such as intercalation of ions into the interlayer space of clay minerals or surface modification of clay minerals is a strategy to tune the properties of nanoclays for the loading and release of a drug. The modified nanoclay can take up drugs by encapsulation, immobilization, ion exchange reaction, or electrostatic interactions. Controlled drug release from the drug-clay originates from the incorporation and interactions between the drug and inorganic layers, including electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Montmorillonite has proven non-toxic through hematological, biochemical, and histopathological analyses in rat. Montmorillonite can also act as a potent detoxifier. Halloysite nanotubes can bind synthetic and biological components such as chitosan, gelatin, and alginate innate nanocarriers for the improved loading and controlled release of drugs, proteins, and DNA. The peculiar properties of clay nanoparticles lead to promising applications in drug delivery, gene delivery, tissue engineering, cancer and stem cell isolation, and bioimaging.","Khatoon, Nafeesa; Chu, Mao Quan; Zhou, Chun Hui",Journal of materials chemistry.

68340,Adipose stromal cells repair pressure ulcers in both young and elderly mice: potential role of adipogenesis in skin repair.,2015,"BACKGROUND There are inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between body mass index (BMI), fear of falling and body balance, especially on unstable surfaces. OBJECTIVES To investigate whether obesity is associated with worse postural balance and fear of falling in older adults. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted with 201 older adults, classified as normal weight, overweight, or obese according to BMI. Postural balance was evaluated on stable and unstable surfaces on the Biodex Balance System platform under three visual conditions: with and without visual feedback and with eyes closed. Fear of falling was identified by a dichotomous question and the Falls Efficacy Scale. These data were compared between groups and included in adjusted multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS The study showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) in body oscillations on a stable surface between the three groups. On an unstable surface, the obese older adults exhibited body oscillations from 0.61° [95% CI 0.07, 1.30] to 1.63° [95% CI 0.84, 2.41] greater than those with normal weight in the three visual conditions. The obese older adults also displayed larger mediolateral oscillations with visual feedback (mean difference: 0.50° [95% CI 0.01, 0.98]) as well as greater global oscillations without visual feedback (mean difference of 0.82° [95% CI 0.18, 1.81]) and with progressive instability (mean difference: 0.80° [95% CI 0.05, 1.66]) than the overweight older adults. BMI explained from 6 to 12% of body swings investigated on unstable surface. Obesity was not associated with fear of falling. CONCLUSION Obesity was associated with reduced postural stability on unstable surfaces but not with fear of falling in older adults.","Garcia, Patrícia Azevedo; Queiroz, Letícia Lopes de; Caetano, Mônica Batista Duarte; Silva, Karla Helena Coelho Vilaça E; Hamu, Tânia Cristina Dias da Silva",Brazilian journal of physical therapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjpt.2020.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830064/,138

68978,Distal esophageal spasm.,2015,"UNLABELLED Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) isolates JHM.WU and JHM.SD promote severe central nervous system disease. However, while JHM.WU replicates robustly and induces hepatitis, JHM.SD fails to replicate or induce pathology in the liver. These two JHM variants encode homologous proteins with few polymorphisms, and little is known about which viral proteins(s) is responsible for the liver tropism of JHM.WU. We constructed reverse genetic systems for JHM.SD and JHM.WU and, utilizing these full-length cDNA clones, constructed chimeric viruses and mapped the virulence factors involved in liver tropism. Exchanging the spike proteins of the two viruses neither increased replication of JHM.SD in the liver nor attenuated JHM.WU. By further mapping, we found that polymorphisms in JHM.WU structural protein M and nonstructural replicase proteins nsp1 and nsp13 are essential for liver pathogenesis. M protein and nsp13, the helicase, of JHM.WU are required for efficient replication in vitro and in the liver in vivo. The JHM.SD nsp1 protein contains a K194R substitution of Lys194, a residue conserved among all other MHV strains. The K194R polymorphism has no effect on in vitro replication but influences hepatotropism, and introduction of R194K into JHM.SD promotes replication in the liver. Conversely, a K194R substitution in nsp1 of JHM.WU or A59, another hepatotropic strain, significantly attenuates replication of each strain in the liver and increases IFN-β expression in macrophages in culture. Our data indicate that both structural and nonstructural proteins contribute to MHV liver pathogenesis and support previous reports that nsp1 is a Betacoronavirus virulence factor. IMPORTANCE The Betacoronavirus genus includes human pathogens, some of which cause severe respiratory disease. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) into human populations demonstrates the zoonotic potential of emerging coronaviruses, and there are currently no vaccines or effective antivirals for human coronaviruses. Thus, it is important to understand the virus-host interaction that regulates coronavirus pathogenesis. Murine coronavirus infection of mice provides a useful model for the study of coronavirus-host interactions, including the determinants of tropism and virulence. We found that very small changes in coronavirus proteins can profoundly affect tropism and virulence. Furthermore, the hepatotropism of MHV-JHM depends not on the spike protein and viral entry but rather on a combination of the structural protein M and nonstructural replicase-associated proteins nsp1 and nsp13, which are conserved among betacoronaviruses. Understanding virulence determinants will aid in the design of vaccines and antiviral strategies.","Zhang, Rong; Li, Yize; Cowley, Timothy J; Steinbrenner, Adam D; Phillips, Judith M; Yount, Boyd L; Baric, Ralph S; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03535-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589656/,138

The use of many and different outcome measures in human studies may contribute to this disagreement. METHODS We conducted a systematic review to identify all measures used to assess long-term neurocognitive outcomes following general anaesthesia (GA) and surgery in children. The quality of studies was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies investigating neurocognitive outcome after GA in children <18 yr. RESULTS Sixty-seven studies were identified from 19 countries during 1990-2017. Most assessments were performed within cognition, sensory-motor development, academic achievement or neuropsychological diagnosis. Few studies assessed other outcomes (magnetic resonance imaging, serum-biomarkers, mortality, neurological examination, measurement of head circumference, impairment of vision). Rating according to the NOS rewarded a mean of six stars out of nine. Some concerns prevail regarding potential inter-rater variability because of equivocal description of rating criteria. Specific features such as stability over lifetime and inter-relations of outcomes (e.g. prediction of subsequent development or diagnosis of neuropsychological conditions) are discussed. The importance of validity and reliability of the various test instruments are described. The studies vary immensely in important characteristics. CONCLUSIONS Future observational studies should be more consistent in the choice of study population, age at exposure, follow-up, indication for and type of surgery, and outcomes. Assessment of sensory-motor development seems feasible in young children (age <4 yr), and intelligence/cognition in older children.","Clausen, N G; Kähler, S; Hansen, T G",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2017.11.107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29793593/,138

The ED plays an important part in detecting an increasing number of new contagious diseases, which could potentially lead to an epidemic or pandemic.During a pandemic, the ED's main task is to detect infected individuals. These patients then need to be isolated and an adequate treatment is required. The ED must be prepared in order to perform well in such a situation. One major part for readiness is communication in an open manner to all partners within the department, as well as with emergency medical services and other departments of the hospital.The ED must be restructured to withstand the rising number of infected patients. These patients must be separated from other critically ill patients. Strategies for a diagnostic workup depending on the kind of infection have to be put in place. Pathways for the outpatient and inpatient management must be defined to avoid overcrowding in the ED. Depending on the number of patients, escalation and de-escalation strategies have to be set up within the hospital.Over the whole course of the pandemic, all staff members are the key resources for the ED and the entire hospital. The ED can only cope with a pandemic situation if staff are working together as a whole. This implies several important steps to get the staff prepared: Recurring, open conversations about fears, problems, and successes are critical for staff morale. Training must be continually provided, and protection strategies implemented. In the chronic phase of the pandemic the focus should shift more towards strategies on how to create possibilities for recuperation, domestic support measures, and mental health care for staff.","Schmid, Bonaventura; Lang, Corinna N; Danner, Timo; Kramer, Katharina; Hans, Felix P; Busch, Hans-Jörg",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1226-8701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33957687/,138

The device measures transit in the stomach, small intestine, and colon by detecting characteristic pH transitions; and quantifies pressure waves in each gut region. WMC gastric emptying times correlate with scintigraphic measures. Incremental benefits of WMC testing in patients with suspected gastroparesis include delineation of pressure abnormalities and small intestinal and colonic transit delays. Acceptance of trial data confirming usefulness of WMC testing in suspected gastric motor disorders has been hampered by small sample sizes and design limitations.

Undocumented workers that might choose not to comply would risk the loss of employment (with no access to unemployment benefits due to their immigration status) and eviction from employer provided housing. Due to the nature of working and living conditions on farms, social distancing among farmworkers is nearly impossible and farmworkers were not provided with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) until infections were at an alarmingly high rate in NYS. Once infected, farmworkers were directed to contact County Health Departments that were frequently unfamiliar with the farmworker population and often lacked the necessary language or cultural competency skills to provide services to that community. Local community members expressed opinions that immigrant farmworkers were transmitters of the virus contributing to high levels of fear and mistrust in rural communities. Trusted organizations such as the Cornell Farmworker Program (CFP) mobilized to provide information, PPE, and other needed supports during the coronavirus pandemic. To support these efforts, the Cornell Farmworker Program transitioned from face-to-face interactions to large-scale two-way communications through cell phones and text messages and partnered with Finger Lakes Community Health, a federally designated migrant farmworker health provider to bridge the gaps in rural health provision to farmworkers.","Dudley, Mary Jo",Journal of agromedicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924x.2020.1815625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894685/,138

We evaluated a novel, user-friendly and cost-effective technique utilizing a Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) tool that is readily available in the electronic medical record (EMR), using skeletal muscle density (SMD) to detect myosteatosis and then compared PACS results with those derived from widely used body composition software (SliceOMatic, QC, Canada). METHODS Using retrospective data from a sample of women with early BC (Stage I-III) who had CT scan and received chemotherapy. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to compare SliceOMatic with PACS results. Associations of PACS results with chemotherapy-related adverse events were evaluated using multivariable (MV) log-binomial models adjusted for age, race, BMI, anthracycline-based therapy, and number of comorbidities. RESULTS In 338 patients, mean age was 51, 32% were non-white, and 40% had obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). Correlation of SMD using SliceOMatic whole muscle measurements with PACS psoas muscle was 0.76 (p < .0001) and with PACS erector spinae muscle 0.91 (p < .0001). Using PACS psoas muscle, myosteatosis was associated with any adverse event [RR 1.66, CI 1.22-2.26 (p < .0001)], dose reduction [RR 1.63, CI 1.01-2.65 (p = .05)], and early treatment discontinuation [RR 2.14, CI 1.10-4.14 (p = 0.03)]. Using PACS erector spinae muscle, myosteatosis was associated any adverse event [RR 1.59, CI 1.11-2.27 (p = 0.01)] and dose reduction [RR 1.91, CI 1.07-3.42 (p = .03)].

The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions to increase provision of preventive care by mental health services; by care element (ask, assess, advice, assist, arrange) and risk behaviour (tobacco smoking, poor nutrition, harmful alcohol consumption, physical inactivity). Electronic bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, relevant journals, and included study reference lists were searched. Eligible studies were of any design with a comparison group that reported the effectiveness of an intervention to increase the provision of at least one element of preventive care for at least one risk behaviour in a mental health setting. Twenty studies were included, most commonly examining smoking (n = 20) and 'ask' (n = 12). Meta-analysis found interventions involving task shifting were effective in increasing smoking 'advice' (n = 2 RCTs; p = 0.009) and physical activity 'advice' (n = 2 RCTs; p = 0.002). Overall, meta-analysis and narrative synthesis indicated that effective intervention strategies (categorised according to the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care taxonomy) were: task shifting, educational meetings, health information systems, local consensus processes, authority and accountability, and reminders. The most consistent findings across studies were with regard to preventive care for smoking, while conflicting or limited evidence was found regarding other risk behaviours. While further rigorous research examining key risk behaviours is recommended, the findings may inform the selection of strategies for future interventions and service delivery initiatives.","Fehily, Caitlin; Hodder, Rebecca; Bartlem, Kate; Wiggers, John; Wolfenden, Luke; Dray, Julia; Bailey, Jacqueline; Wilczynska, Magda; Stockings, Emily; Clinton-McHarg, Tara; Regan, Timothy; Bowman, Jenny",Preventive medicine reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32477852/,138

The syndrome may be precipitated by sudden weight loss secondary to other pathologies, such as trauma, malignancy or eating disorders. Diagnosis is confirmed by angiography, which reveals a reduced aorto-SMA angle and distance, and contrast studies showing duodenal obstruction. Conservative management aims to increase intra-abdominal fat by dietary manipulation and thereby increase the angle between the SMA and aorta. Where surgery is indicated, division of the ligament of Treitz, anterior transposition of the third part of the duodenum and duodenojejunostomy have been described. METHODS We present four cases of SMA syndrome where the intention of treatment was laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy. The procedure was completed successfully in three patients, who recovered quickly with no short-term complications. A fourth patient underwent open gastrojejunostomy (complicated by an anastomotic bleed) when dense adhesions prevented duodenojejunostomy. CONCLUSIONS The superior mesenteric artery syndrome should be considered in patients with epigastric pain, prolonged vomiting and weight loss. Laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy is a safe and effective operation for management of the syndrome. A multi-speciality team approach including gastrointestinal, vascular and radiological specialists should be invoked in the management of these patients.","Kirby, G C; Faulconer, E R; Robinson, S J; Perry, A; Downing, R",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2017.0063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28660836/,138

A field deployable molecular detection method could enhance both environmental surveillance and clinical diagnosis of this emerging pathogen. Accordingly, RPAcan3990, a recombinase polymerase assay (RPA) was developed to target a region predicted to be highly repeated in the Ac genome. The assay was then adapted to produce a visually interpretable fluorescent readout using an orange camera lens filter and a blue light. Using Ac genomic DNA, the limit of detection was found to be 1fg/μl by both fluorometer measurement and visual reading. All clinical samples known to be positive for Ac from various areas of the globe were positive by RPAcan3990. Cerebrospinal fluid samples from other etiologies of eosinophilic meningitis (i.e. Toxocara sp., Gnathostoma sp.) were negative in the RPAcan3990 assay. The optimal incubation temperature range for the reaction was between 35-40°C. The assay successfully detected 1fg/μl of Ac genomic DNA after incubation at human body temperature (in a shirt pocket). In conclusion, these data suggest RPAcan3990 is potentially a point of contact molecular assay capable of sensitively detecting Ac by producing visually interpretable results with minimal instrumentation.","Sears, William J; Qvarnstrom, Yvonne; Nutman, Thomas B",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01185-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34132583/,138

Ibuprofen acts as a potential inhibitor for cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2). In the past few decades, research on this small molecule has led to identifying other possible therapeutic benefits. Anti-tumorigenic and neuroprotective functions of Ibuprofen are majorly recognized in recent literature and need further consideration. Additionally, several other roles of this anti-inflammatory molecule have been discovered and subjected to experimental assessment in various diseases. However, the major challenge faced by Ibuprofen and other drugs of similar classes is their side effects, and tendency to cause gastrointestinal injury, generate cardiovascular risks, modulate hepatic and acute kidney diseases. Future research should also be conducted to deduce new methods and approaches of suppressing the unwanted toxic changes mediated by these drugs and develop new therapeutic avenues so that these small molecules continue to serve the purposes.

Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS Quality in Prognostic Studies validated tool. RESULTS Thirteen papers with a total of 1735 participants were included in data extraction. A total of 7 studies examined the association between CPX variables and postoperative mortality. Patients undergoing gastro-intestinal surgery with lower anaerobic threshold values were found to have an increased risk of postoperative mortality. Similarly, a lower rate of oxygen consumption was found to be associated with higher mortality. There was conflicting evidence regarding the association between CPX variables and postoperative morbidity. The evidence did not demonstrate any association between preoperative CPX variables and hospital length of stay. CONCLUSION Studies report an association between CPX variables and postoperative mortality; however, there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between CPX variables and postoperative morbidity.","Sheill, G; Reynolds, S; O'Neill, L; Mockler, D; Reynolds, J V; Hussey, J; Guinan, E",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-020-04696-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32632727/,138
80009,Blood type and the microbiome- untangling a complex relationship with lessons from pathogens.,2020-07-11,"BACKGROUND Arterial perforation has inevitably increased as endovascular treatments have become more common for intracranial large vessel occlusions, and even distal, medium vessel occlusions. A distal, medium vessel has a tortuous course and thinner wall compared to large arteries, making it more susceptible to damage. Here, we review the treatment strategies for arterial perforation during mechanical thrombectomy, and we report the case of a patient treated with gelfoam embolization. CASE SUMMARY A 63-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with sudden neurologic symptoms of right hemiparesis and global aphasia. The initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 15. Computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography revealed hyperacute infarction and emergent arterial occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery M2-3 portion. During endovascular mechanical thrombectomy, arterial rupture occurred. The patient's vital signs were stable, but delayed angiography showed persistent active bleeding. Therefore, selective embolization of the injured artery was performed using gelfoam. Subsequent left vertebral and internal carotid angiography was performed to confirm hemostasis. A localized subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was confirmed on a follow-up CT scan. A repeated CT scan after 12 d showed resolution of the SAH, and rebleeding did not occur. CONCLUSION Rescue embolization with gelfoam could be considered an additional option in distal, medium vessel perforation.","Kang, Ji Yun; Yi, Kyung Sik; Cha, Sang-Hoon; Choi, Chi-Hoon; Kim, Yook; Lee, Jisun; Cho, Bum Sang",World journal of clinical cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i20.5668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307623/,138

This study examines trends in editorial and peer review processes in an ophthalmological journal over the last decade. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of editorial data from the journal Acta Ophthalmologica containing all manuscript submissions between 2010 and 2020. RESULTS The number of yearly submissions grew between 2010 and 2019 from 1014 to 1623, and in 2020, the number of submissions increased to 2449. In total, the number of submissions increased by 142% between 2010 and 2020. Similarly, the proportion of desk-rejected manuscripts increased from 48% to 67% during the period 2010-2020. The number of invitations needed to obtain one review showed an increase from 1.9 to 2.6 between 2010 and 2019, but remained stable between 2019 and 2020. However, the number of reviewers per reviewed manuscript, reviewed manuscripts per reviewer and time from invitation to completed review assignment remained almost constant between 2010 and 2020. Researchers based in North American were disproportionally often invited to review (18%) compared to their share of published articles (7%), and they also declined review invitation more frequently compared to scholars in other parts of the world. CONCLUSIONS The study revealed an increase in submitted manuscripts to an ophthalmological journal over the last decade, with a further increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of reviewer invitations needed to obtain one review grew during the study period but remained constant between 2019 and 2020, despite a vast increase in submitted manuscripts. Hence, the burden for unique reviewers did not increase. Instead, the proportion of desk-rejected manuscripts grew, and the reviewer pool expanded, which allowed the annual average number of reviews by individual reviewers to remain stable.","Bro, Tomas; Hammarfelt, Björn",Acta ophthalmologica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.15033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608758/,138
80663,Editorial: Are we ready? Preparing nurses to respond to disasters and emerging infectious diseases.,2010,"Burnout is a major occupational problem among healthcare providers, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. The frontline health workforce is experiencing a high workload and multiple psychosocial stressors which may affect their mental and emotional health, leading to burnout symptoms. Moreover, sleep deprivation and a critical lack of psychosocial support may aggravate such symptoms amidst Covid-19. From an ethical viewpoint, healthcare providers may experience moral distress while safeguarding patient welfare and autonomy. Moreover, social injustice and structural inequities may affect their emotional health while tackling a high volume of new cases and mortality. Global evidence indicates the need for adopting multipronged evidence-based approaches to address burnout during this pandemic, which may include increasing the awareness of work-related stress and burnout, promoting mindfulness and self-care practices for promoting mental wellbeing, ensuring optimal mental health services, using digital technologies to address workplace stress and deliver mental health interventions, and improving organisational policies and practices focusing on burnout among healthcare providers.","Sultana, Abida; Sharma, Rachit; Hossain, Md Mahbub; Bhattacharya, Sudip; Purohit, Neetu",Indian journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.20529/ijme.2020.73; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34018959/,138

METHODS A total of 1297 patients, admitted between 18 March and 8 April 2020, were stratified according to their risk of developing COVID-19 using their responses to a questionnaire designed to evaluate symptoms and risk conditions. RESULTS Anosmia/hyposmia (p<0.0001), fever (p<0.0001), body pain (p<0.0001) and chills (p=0.001) were all independent predictors for COVID-19, with a 72% estimated probability for detecting COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal swab samples. Leucopenia, relative monocytosis, decreased eosinophil values, C reactive protein (CRP) and platelets were also shown to be significant independent predictors for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The significant clinical features for COVID-19 were identified as anosmia, fever, chills and body pain. Elevated CRP, leucocytes under 5400×109/L and relative monocytosis (>9%) were common among patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. These variables may help, in the absence of reverse transcriptase PCR tests, to identify possible COVID-19 infections during pandemic outbreaks. SUMMARY From 19 March to 8 April 2020, 1297 patients attended the Polyclinic Piquet Carneiro for COVID-19 detection. HCP data were analysed, and significant clinical features were anosmia, fever, chills and body pain.

Methods: The efficacy and safety of fibrinolysis were retrospectively analyzed in 7 patients with acute STEM, who hospitalized from February 29, 2020 to April 3, 2020 in the Department of Cardiology, Wuhan Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. To optimize the fibrinolytic process on the premise of prevention and control of COVID-19 transmission, including self-protection of medical staff, a full-time medical team in charge of fibrinolysis under third-grade protection was established. The acute STEMI patients were treated immediately in a fixed and isolated area in emergency department before receiving green channel fibrinolysis. Blood samples for complete blood count, COVID-19 antibody test and nasopharyngeal swab samples for COVID-19 nucleic acid test were made before fibrinolysis, while the chest CT examination was accomplished after fibrinolysis. By comparing differences of time from the first electrocardiogram (ECG) to fibrinolysis before and after the improvement of fibrinolytic process, the effect of optimization of the fibrinolytic process was evaluated. Results: In the present study, seven patients with acute STEMI received fibrinolysis therapy, 6 of them achieved reperfusion and no bleeding was observed in all of the patients. Five out of the 7 patients were hospitalized after fibrinolysis, and the hospitalization days were 19.6 days on average. By following up to April 14, 2020, none of the 7 patients died. The first 2 patients were treated according to the routine medical procedure and the time from the first ECG to fibrinolysis were 201 and 106 minutes, respectively. After the optimization of the fibrinolytic process, the time from the first ECG to fibrinolysis of the last 5 patients were 42, 46, 51, 43 and 54 minutes, respectively，which was significantly shorter than that before optimization. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 epidemic, fibrinolysis in patients with acute STEMI is safe, effective and easy to implement. Therefore, it is recommended as the top priority for the patients with acute STEMI with indications for fibrinolysis. On the premise of prevention and control of COVID-19 transmission, including self-protection of medical staff, the duration of myocardial ischemia can be shortened by optimization of the fibrinolytic process.","Wei, F; Shuai, X X; Chen, Z J; Cao, G L; Wang, L; Qiu, T; Hu, T; Wu, L; Zhang, Q; Huang, H X; Zhang, Y W; Zhu, L; Cheng, X",Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20200331-00268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842256/,138

Patients on dialysis may be exposed to greater risk of infection due to an inability to isolate. Consideration of these competing risks is important before restarting suspended transplant programs. This study compared outcomes in kidney and kidney/pancreas transplant recipients with those on the waiting list, following admission with COVID-19 in a high prevalence region. METHODS Audit data from all 6 London transplant centres were amalgamated. Demographic and laboratory data were collected and outcomes included mortality, intensive care (ITU) admission and ventilation. Adult patients who had undergone a kidney or kidney/pancreas transplant, and those active on the transplant waiting list at the start of the pandemic were included. RESULTS 121 transplant recipients (TR) and 52 waiting list patients (WL) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 36 TR died (30%), whilst 14 WL patients died (27% p=0.71). There was no difference in rates of admission to ITU or ventilation. 24% of TR required renal replacement therapy, and 12% lost their grafts. Lymphocyte nadir and D-dimer peak showed no difference in those who did and did not die. No other co-morbidities or demographic factors were associated with mortality, except for age (odds ratio of 4.3 [95% CI 1.8 - 10.2] for mortality if aged over 60 years) in TR. CONCLUSIONS Transplant recipients and waiting list patients have similar mortality rates after hospital admission with COVID-19. Mortality was higher in older transplant recipients. These data should inform decisions about transplantation in the COVID era.","Mamode, N; Ahmed, Zubir; Jones, Gareth; Banga, Neal; Motallebzadeh, Reza; Tolley, Hannah; Marks, Steve; Stojanovic, Jelena; Khurram, Muhammad A; Thuraisingham, Raj; Popoola, Joyce; Ghazanfar, Abbas; Game, David; Sran, Kiran; Dor, Frank J M F; Lucisano, Gaetano; Sinha, Manish; Olsburgh, Jonathon; Willicombe, Michelle",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196624/,138
81733,Morinda citrifolia (Noni) Juice Suppresses A549 Human Lung Cancer Cells via Inhibiting AKT/Nuclear Factor-κ B Signaling Pathway.,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND The recent unprecedented emergence of arboviruses transmitted by Culicoides biting midges in northern Europe has necessitated the development of techniques to differentiate competent vector species. At present these techniques are entirely reliant upon interpretation of semi-quantitative RT-PCR (sqPCR) data in the form of Cq values used to infer the presence of viral RNA in samples. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS This study investigates the advantages and limitations of sqPCR in this role by comparing infection and dissemination rates of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in two colony lines of Culicoides. Through the use of these behaviorally malleable lines we provide tools for demarcating arbovirus infection and dissemination rates in Culicoides which to date have prevented clear implication of primary vector species in northern Europe. The study demonstrates biological transmission of SBV in an arthropod vector, supporting the conclusions from field-caught Culicoides and provides a general framework for future assessment of vector competence of Culicoides for arboviruses using sqPCR. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE When adopting novel diagnostic technologies, correctly implicating vectors of arboviral pathogens requires a coherent laboratory framework to fully understand the implications of results produced in the field. This study illustrates these difficulties and provides a full examination of sqPCR in this role for the Culicoides-arbovirus system.","Veronesi, Eva; Henstock, Mark; Gubbins, Simon; Batten, Carrie; Manley, Robyn; Barber, James; Hoffmann, Bernd; Beer, Martin; Attoui, Houssam; Mertens, Peter Paul Clement; Carpenter, Simon",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23520481/,138

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV as a bait, the C terminus (amino acids 251 to 422) of the N protein was found to interact with human elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1alpha), an essential component of the translational machinery with an important role in cytokinesis, promoting the bundling of filamentous actin (F-actin). In vitro and in vivo interaction was then confirmed by immuno-coprecipitation, far-Western blotting, and surface plasmon resonance. It was demonstrated that the N protein of SARS-CoV induces aggregation of EF1alpha, inhibiting protein translation and cytokinesis by blocking F-actin bundling. Proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and other human cell lines was significantly inhibited by the infection of recombinant retrovirus expressing SARS-CoV N protein.","Zhou, Bing; Liu, Junli; Wang, Qiuna; Liu, Xuan; Li, Xiaorong; Li, Ping; Ma, Qingjun; Cao, Cheng",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00133-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18448518/,138

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS An observational cohort of obese participants was studied using generalized linear mixed models to examine the associations of bariatric surgery type and diabetes remission rates for up to 3 years. Of 2,458 obese participants enrolled, 1,868 (76%) had complete data to assess diabetes status at both baseline and at least one follow-up visit. Of these, 627 participants (34%) were classified with diabetes: 466 underwent RYGBP and 140 underwent LAGB. RESULTS After 3 years, 68.7% of RYGBP and 30.2% of LAGB participants were in diabetes remission. Baseline factors associated with diabetes remission included a lower weight for LAGB, greater fasting C-peptide, lower leptin-to-fat mass ratio for RYGBP, and a lower hemoglobin A1c without need for insulin for both procedures. After both procedures, greater postsurgical weight loss was associated with remission. However, even after controlling for differences in amount of weight lost, relative diabetes remission rates remained nearly twofold higher after RYGBP than LAGB. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes remission up to 3 years after RYGBP and LAGB was proportionally higher with increasing postsurgical weight loss. However, the nearly twofold greater weight loss-adjusted likelihood of diabetes remission in subjects undergoing RYGBP than LAGB suggests unique mechanisms contributing to improved glucose metabolism beyond weight loss after RYGBP.","Purnell, Jonathan Q; Selzer, Faith; Wahed, Abdus S; Pender, John; Pories, Walter; Pomp, Alfons; Dakin, Greg; Mitchell, James; Garcia, Luis; Staten, Myrlene A; McCloskey, Carol; Cummings, David E; Flum, David R; Courcoulas, Anita; Wolfe, Bruce M",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc15-2138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27289123/,138

News and debate on hot topics trend on Twitter much before visual or print media. Scientists and researchers are increasingly utilizing various social media platforms including Facebook , Twitter and WhatsApp to engage readers. There are several barriers to social media usage by researchers like lack of time, poor understanding of the potential of social media, fear of criticism or not being tech-savvy. The benefits of social media for academics and research are potentially huge and largely untapped. Many specialists on Twitter, for example, actively educate others (sharing research or explaining difficult concepts through #tweetorials), discuss and critique research articles, live-tweet presentations during conferences, promote new ideas and trends, and collaborate with peers.

83839,Sodium Phenylbutyrate-Taurursodiol for ALS. Reply.,2020-12-03,"PURPOSE Contrast-enhanced MR images are widely used to confirm the adequacy of ablation margin after liver ablation for early prediction of local recurrence. However, quantitative assessment of the ablation margin by comparing pre- and post-procedural images remains challenging. We developed and tested a novel method for three-dimensional quantitative assessment of ablation margin based on non-rigid image registration and 3D distance map. METHODS Our method was tested with pre- and post-procedural MR images acquired in 21 patients who underwent image-guided percutaneous liver ablation. The two images were co-registered using non-rigid intensity-based registration. After the tumor and ablation volumes were segmented, target volume coverage, percent of tumor coverage, and Dice similarity coefficient were calculated as metrics representing overall adequacy of ablation. In addition, 3D distance map around the tumor was computed and superimposed on the ablation volume to identify the area with insufficient margins. For patients with local recurrences, the follow-up images were registered to the post-procedural image. Three-dimensional minimum distance between the recurrence and the areas with insufficient margins was quantified. RESULTS The percent tumor coverage for all nonrecurrent cases was 100 %. Five cases had tumor recurrences, and the 3D distance map revealed insufficient tumor coverage or a 0-mm margin. It also showed that two recurrences were remote to the insufficient margin. CONCLUSIONS Non-rigid registration and 3D distance map allow us to quantitatively evaluate the adequacy of the ablation margin after percutaneous liver ablation. The method may be useful to predict local recurrences immediately following ablation procedure.","Tani, Soichiro; Tatli, Servet; Hata, Nobuhiko; Garcia-Rojas, Xavier; Olubiyi, Olutayo I; Silverman, Stuart G; Tokuda, Junichi",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-016-1398-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27038962/,138

METHODS We evaluated 22 benign thyroid nodules from 19 patients treated with RF ablation between March 2010 and January 2013. The internal and external factors of these nodules were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with the therapeutic success and the volume reduction ratio (VRR). The volume and size of the nodules were determined before treatment, and the VRR was calculated at 6-month and 1-year follow-up examinations after RF ablation. Therapeutic success was defined as a >50% volume reduction. RESULTS The mean VRRs were 66.1±18.7% at 6 months and 74.3±16.7% at 1 year. The therapeutic success rate after 6 months and 1 year was 81.8% and 90.9%, respectively. At the 1-year follow-up, the margin of the nodule correlated with therapeutic success. Most of the successfully ablated nodules showed well-defined margins on initial ultrasonography (18/20, 90%) (P=0.026). In addition, nodules with ill-defined margins showed a tendency toward having a low VRR at the 6-month and 1-year follow-up examinations. CONCLUSION RF ablation was effective in decreasing the volume of benign thyroid nodules. Thyroid nodules with well-defined margins tended to show successful outcomes at the 1-year follow-up examination after RF ablation.","Ahn, Hye Shin; Kim, Soo Jin; Park, Sung Hee; Seo, Mirinae",Ultrasonography,https://doi.org/10.14366/usg.15083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27101983/,138

84193,"World health observances in September 2020: sepsis, the lung and heart, and pulmonary fibrosis in focus.",2020-08-12,"Change of DNA sequence that fuels evolution is, to a certain extent, a deterministic process because mutagenesis does not occur in an absolutely random manner. So far, it has not been possible to decipher the rules that govern DNA sequence evolution due to the extreme complexity of the entire process. In our attempt to approach this issue we focus solely on the mechanisms of mutagenesis and deliberately disregard the role of natural selection. Hence, in this analysis, evolution refers to the accumulation of genetic alterations that originate from mutations and are transmitted through generations without being subjected to natural selection. We have developed a software tool that allows modelling of a DNA sequence as a one-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) with four states per cell which correspond to the four DNA bases, i.e. A, C, T and G. The four states are represented by numbers of the quaternary number system. Moreover, we have developed genetic algorithms (GAs) in order to determine the rules of CA evolution that simulate the DNA evolution process. Linear evolution rules were considered and square matrices were used to represent them. If DNA sequences of different evolution steps are available, our approach allows the determination of the underlying evolution rule(s). Conversely, once the evolution rules are deciphered, our tool may reconstruct the DNA sequence in any previous evolution step for which the exact sequence information was unknown. The developed tool may be used to test various parameters that could influence evolution. We describe a paradigm relying on the assumption that mutagenesis is governed by a near-neighbour-dependent mechanism. Based on the satisfactory performance of our system in the deliberately simplified example, we propose that our approach could offer a starting point for future attempts to understand the mechanisms that govern evolution. The developed software is open-source and has a user-friendly graphical input interface.","Mizas, Ch; Sirakoulis, G Ch; Mardiris, V; Karafyllidis, I; Glykos, N; Sandaltzopoulos, R",Bio Systems,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2007.12.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18243517/,138

85183,Update on influenza diagnostics: lessons from the novel H1N1 influenza A pandemic.,2012,"In this paper we document some of the practical aspects of implementing medical assistance in dying (MAiD) since it became legal in Canada in 2016. The percentage of annual deaths in Canada due to MAiD varies widely, ranging from less than 0.5% in some areas to over 5% in others. By the end of 2019, approximately 13,000 people had an assisted death in Canada (1.6% of all deaths). The average age is 73 years and the majority have cancer (64%), followed by end-stage organ failure (17%), and neurological disease (11%). The safeguards in Canadian law include having two witnesses sign the patient request form, having two independent clinicians agree that the patient is eligible, and requiring a 10-day waiting period after the request is made. Although the criminal law is federal and applies throughout the nation, health services managed provincially, and there are many different models of care being used. Some provinces have standardized prescriptions and procedures for assisted dying with centralized care coordinators supporting both patients and providers. Other provinces expect individual providers to manage all aspects of assisted dying. The procedure and medications are provided free of charge to patients, but it took years before many providers were remunerated for their services. Access for patients has been a problem because there are too few providers of care (especially in rural areas), and many people have difficulty getting accurate information about the process. Many faith-based health care facilities continue to refuse to allow assisted dying within their facilities, so patients requesting MAiD need to be transferred to other locations in their last hours of life. Solutions to these problems have included the development of more training and support for providers and the creation of coordinating centres that provide information and support for patients throughout the process. Telemedicine is used for assessment of eligibility when required, especially during the COVID pandemic. There are similarities in problems of access to all end of life care options, including palliative care and residential hospices. The relationships between providers of assisted dying and specialists in palliative care vary, and examples exist throughout the spectrum from collegial to hostile. This is slowly improving, as individual clinicians gain more experience with patients choosing assisted dying. Public culture is changing as there are more conversations occurring about death and dying.","Wiebe, Ellen; Green, Stefanie; Wiebe, Kim",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-19-681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32787381/,138

Attaching filters that remove viral particles in air from the expiratory limb of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices should theoretically decrease the risk. However, adding filters to the expiratory limb could add to expiratory resistance and thereby increase the imposed work of breathing (WOB). OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects on imposed WOB when attaching filters to the expiratory limb of CPAP devices. METHODS Two filters were tested on three CPAP systems at two levels of CPAP in a mechanical lung model. Main outcome was imposed WOB. RESULTS There was a minor increase in imposed WOB when attaching the filters. The differences between the two filters were small. CONCLUSION To minimise contaminated aerosol generation during CPAP treatment, filters can be attached to expiratory tubing with only a minimal increase in imposed WOB in a non-humidified environment. Care has to be taken to avoid filter obstruction and replace filters as recommended.","Donaldsson, Snorri; Naver, Lars; Jonsson, Baldvin; Drevhammar, Thomas",Archives of disease in childhood.

87365,Restoring antiviral immunity with adoptive transfer of ex-vivo generated T cells.,2018,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Debate persists over whether surgery to correct pelvic organ prolapse (POP) should be combined with midurethral sling (MUS) insertion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) up to 12 months after transvaginal mesh surgery, with or without MUS, and to identify risk factors for postoperative SUI. METHODS This retrospective single-center study included patients who underwent transvaginal mesh surgery with Uphold™ between October 2010 and December 2017. The primary outcome was the prevalence of SUI at 12 months postoperatively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risks factors for postoperative SUI. RESULTS Of the 308 women included, 123 (40%) were continent (no SUI), 108 (35%) had SUI, and 76 (25%) had occult SUI. Forty-nine patients (15.9%) had a concomitant MUS procedure. At 12 months after surgery, 35.9% of patients without concomitant MUS had SUI vs 14.3% with (p = 0.003). Thirty-five patients (29%) developed de novo SUI. Postoperative complications were more common in patients with concomitant MUS (30.6% vs 17%; p = 0.003). The best predictor of postoperative SUI was the presence of preoperative SUI (OR 2.52 (1.25-5.09). Concomitant MUS (p < 0.001), and prior POP surgery (p = 0.034) were protective factors for postoperative SUI. CONCLUSION Preoperative SUI is the most important risk factor for postoperative SUI. However, given the higher risk of postoperative complications with concomitant MUS and the acceptable rate of de novo SUI rate without it, two-stage surgery seems preferable for patients with preoperative SUI.","Bideau, Mathilde; Allègre, Lucie; Callewaert, Geertje; Fatton, Brigitte; de Tayrac, Renaud",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-020-04363-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533213/,138

Nevertheless, its benefits compared to conventional laparoscopy still need to be assess. The aim of this study was to compare SPA to conventional colorectal laparoscopic surgery in a single institutional case-matched study. METHODS From July 2009 to July 2010, 25 SPA colorectal resections were matched on main predictive risk factors of postoperative complications, in a one to two fashion, with patient having the same procedure for the same indication by conventional laparoscopy. RESULTS Patient characteristics were comparable between both groups. SPA was successfully performed in 24 of 25 patients, with a need to conversion to standard laparoscopy in one case (4%). SPA was associated with a significantly shorter median operative time (130 vs 180 min, p = 0.04) and hospital stay (6 vs 7 days, p = 0.005). Postoperative morbidity rates were similar between the two groups (4% vs 16%, p = 0.25). CONCLUSION SPA colorectal resection can be safely performed in selected patients with results comparable to those observed after conventional laparoscopic surgery. However, larger studies including randomized controlled trail are needed to demonstrate possible benefits of SPA colorectal resection over conventional colorectal laparoscopic surgery.","Gaujoux, Sébastien; Maggiori, Léon; Bretagnol, Frédéric; Ferron, Marianne; Panis, Yves",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1780-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22125169/,138

The NCD Mobile Phone Survey uses Surveda to administer the survey; Surveda is an open-source, multi-modal software specifically developed for the project. The objective of the paper is to describe Surveda, review data collection methods used in participating countries and discuss how Surveda and similar approaches can improve public health surveillance. Methods Surveda features full-service survey design and implementation through a web application and collects data via Short Messaging Service (SMS), Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and/or mobile web. Surveda's survey design process employs five steps: creating a project, creating questionnaires, designing and starting a survey, monitoring survey progress, and exporting survey results. Results The NCD Mobile Phone Survey has been successfully conducted in five countries, Zambia (2017), Philippines (2018), Morocco (2019), Malawi (2019), and Sri Lanka (2019), with a total of 23,682 interviews completed. Discussion This approach to data collection demonstrates that mobile phone surveys can supplement face-to-face data collection methods. Furthermore, Surveda offers major advantages including automated mode-switch, question randomization and comparison features. Conclusion Accurate and timely survey data informs a country's abilities to make targeted policy decisions while prioritizing limited resources. The high acceptance of Surveda demonstrates that the use of mobile phones for surveillance can deliver accurate and timely data collection.","Song, Yang; Phadnis, Rachael; Favaloro, Jennifer; Lee, Juliette; Lau, Charles Q; Moreira, Manuel; Marks, Leenisha; Isaía, Matías García; Kim, Jason; Lea, Veronica",Online journal of public health informatics,https://doi.org/10.5210/ojphi.v12i2.10574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33381279/,138

METHOD This was a retrospective chart review of 263 COVID-19 positive patients requiring intubation in the intensive care units at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and MedStar Washington Hospital Center between March 1st and July 26th , 2020. Information regarding proning status, duration of proning, presence or absence of facial pressure injuries and interventions were collected. Paired two tailed t-test was used to evaluate differences between proned patients who developed pressure injuries with those who did not. RESULTS Overall, 143 COVID-19 positive patients required proning while intubated with the average duration of proning being 5.15 days. Of those proned, 68 (47.6%) developed a facial pressure injury. The most common site involved was the cheek with a total of 57 (84%) followed by ears (50%). The average duration of proning for patients who developed a pressure injury was significantly longer when compared to those who did not develop pressure injuries (6.79 days vs 3.64 days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Facial pressure injuries occur with high incidence in patients with COVID-19 who undergo prone positioning. Longer duration of proning appears to confer greater risk for developing these pressure injuries. Hence, improved preventative measures and early interventions are needed.

METHODS Parents of children who presented between 2014 and 2019, underwent a lumbar puncture and whose cerebrospinal fluid was polymerase chain reaction positive for EV or hPeV, were asked to complete a care-giver-administered neurodevelopmental assessment tool (The Ages and Stages Instrument [ASQ3]). Clinical data of the infective episode were collected from patient notes. RESULTS Of 101 children, 43 (10 hPeV+, 33 EV+) submitted ASQ3 results. Median age at assessment was 38.9 months (interquartile range, 15.4-54.8), the follow-up interval 3 years (median 37 months; interquartile range, 13.9-53.1). Age, inflammatory markers, and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis during the infective event were not associated with ASQ3 scores. In 23 children (17 EV+, 6 hPeV+), no neurodevelopmental concerns were reported. Two more had preexisting developmental delay and were excluded. Of the remaining, 18/41 (43.9%) reported ASQ3 scores indicating need for monitoring or professional review in at least 1 category, not differing by pathogen (EV 14/31, 45.2%; hPeV 4/10, 40%; P = 0.71). Seven children will require formal review, scoring ≥2 SD below the mean in at least 1 category (6/31 EV+, 1/10 hPeV+, P = 0.7), 3 scored ≥2 SD below the mean in more than 1 area. CONCLUSIONS Parent-administered developmental assessment of children with a history of early picornavirus infection of the CNS identified a subgroup that requires formal neurodevelopmental review.

As the pandemic continues, clinical practices have discovered ways to resume operations. Opportunities exist to understand patient preferences for telehealth clinical services and to tailor offerings to different demographic groups. METHODS We conducted a survey of patients receiving telehealth services through our outpatient practice to understand the types of healthcare services for which patients report preferences for telehealth. RESULTS We received 551 survey responses (response rate = 20.8%; 551/2650). More than half of patients indicated being 'very likely' to use telehealth services to refill medication(s) (67.3%), prepare for an upcoming visit (66.1%), review test results (60.3%), or receive education (54.2%). Males had lower odds of preferring telehealth services for reviewing test results (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-0.94) or mental health issues (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.38-0.77). Respondents who received a video visit were significantly more likely than those who received a telephone visit to report preferences for using telehealth for education, care plan discussions, long-term health issues, and mental health. DISCUSSION Patient preferences for telehealth services vary by services provided and respondent demographics. Experience with telehealth increases the likelihood for future use of these services.","Ebbert, Jon O; Ramar, Priya; Tulledge-Scheitel, Sidna M; Njeru, Jane W; Rosedahl, Jordan K; Roellinger, Daniel; Philpot, Lindsey M",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x20980302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33461397/,138
91112,Insight Into The Acute hepatitis A Outbreak In Indiana.,2021-03-24,"This study firstly aimed to describe bicyclists' return to cycling after a hospitalisation crash. Secondly, it aimed to determine factors associated with reduced cycling post-crash. A study of 83 cyclists hospitalised due to an on-road crash was undertaken in Perth, Western Australia. Participants completed a questionnaire shortly following the crash and were followed up approximately 12 months after the crash. Injury information was obtained from the WA State Trauma Registry. A binary logistic regression model was used to examine factors associated with 'reduced cycling exposure' at follow-up. Sixty percent of participants had 'reduced cycling exposure' and 40% had 'no reduction in cycling exposure' at follow up. Twenty-two percent of participants had not cycled at all since the crash. Despite 46% reporting fear of crashing/ lack of confidence as a reason for 'reduced cycling exposure', only 7% of all participants had received any counselling. After controlling for confounding factors, those who participated in group riding before the crash (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.08-0.66, p = 0.006) and those who had a 'complete functional recovery' (OR: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.04-0.64, p = 0.011), had lower odds of 'reduced cycling exposure' at follow-up. In addition, those who were not employed full time at baseline had higher odds of 'reduced cycling exposure' at follow up (OR: 3.72, 95% CI: 1.22-11.33, p = 0.021). Provision of psychological services following a bicycle crash may be an important intervention for improving levels of fear and confidence surrounding cycling and assisting cyclists in returning to their pre-crash level of participation. In addition, interventions promoting return to cycling, should be targeted towards non-group riders who cycle for either commuting or recreational purposes.","L Fraser, Michelle; Meuleners, Lynn B",Accident; analysis and prevention,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2020.105726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818761/,138
91205,Clinical Evaluation of the Luminex NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel.,2016,"Cholesterol is an integral component of eukaryotic cell membranes and a key molecule in controlling membrane fluidity, organization, and other physicochemical parameters. It also plays a regulatory function in antibiotic drug resistance and the immune response of cells against viruses, by stabilizing the membrane against structural damage. While it is well understood that, structurally, cholesterol exhibits a densification effect on fluid lipid membranes, its effects on membrane bending rigidity are assumed to be nonuniversal; i.e., cholesterol stiffens saturated lipid membranes, but has no stiffening effect on membranes populated by unsaturated lipids, such as 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC). This observation presents a clear challenge to structure-property relationships and to our understanding of cholesterol-mediated biological functions. Here, using a comprehensive approach-combining neutron spin-echo (NSE) spectroscopy, solid-state deuterium NMR (2H NMR) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations-we report that cholesterol locally increases the bending rigidity of DOPC membranes, similar to saturated membranes, by increasing the bilayer's packing density. All three techniques, inherently sensitive to mesoscale bending fluctuations, show up to a threefold increase in effective bending rigidity with increasing cholesterol content approaching a mole fraction of 50%. Our observations are in good agreement with the known effects of cholesterol on the area-compressibility modulus and membrane structure, reaffirming membrane structure-property relationships. The current findings point to a scale-dependent manifestation of membrane properties, highlighting the need to reassess cholesterol's role in controlling membrane bending rigidity over mesoscopic length and time scales of important biological functions, such as viral budding and lipid-protein interactions.","Chakraborty, Saptarshi; Doktorova, Milka; Molugu, Trivikram R; Heberle, Frederick A; Scott, Haden L; Dzikovski, Boris; Nagao, Michihiro; Stingaciu, Laura-Roxana; Standaert, Robert F; Barrera, Francisco N; Katsaras, John; Khelashvili, George; Brown, Michael F; Ashkar, Rana",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004807117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32843347/,138

MATERIALS AND METHODS Using terms related to novel coronavirus 2019 and human milk, a systematic search was performed in three electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science) for studies published between December 2019 and 15 October 2020. Published peer-reviewed studies reporting the results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human milk in mothers with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Proportion meta-analysis of case series and prospective cohort studies was performed using STATA version 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and pooled estimate (with 95% confidence interval) of overall incidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was calculated. RESULTS We identified 936 records, of which 34 studies (24 case-reports, 10 cohort studies) were eligible for this systematic review. A total of 116 confirmed COVID-19 lactating women (88 in cohort and 28 in case-reports) underwent RT-PCR testing in human milk, and 10 (six in case reports) were detected to have SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The overall pooled proportion (from cohort studies) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in human milk was 2.16% (95% CI: 0.0-8.81%, I 2: 0%). Four studies (six patients) also reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (along with RT-PCR) in human milk. CONCLUSIONS The limited low-quality evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in human milk in an extremely low proportion, however, based on current evidence no conclusion can be drawn about its infectivity and impact on the infants. In concordance with World Health Organization recommendations, exclusive breastfeeding should be considered in all cases unless any other contraindication exists.","Kumar, Jogender; Meena, Jitendra; Yadav, Arushi; Kumar, Praveen","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1882984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550866/,138

The purpose of this review is to highlight the ever-increasing intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and ophthalmic microsurgery. RECENT FINDINGS Deep learning algorithms are being applied to help evaluate and teach surgical trainees. Artificial intelligence tools are improving real-time surgical instrument tracking, phase segmentation, as well as enhancing the safety of robotic-assisted vitreoretinal surgery. SUMMARY Similar to strides appreciated in ophthalmic medical disease, artificial intelligence will continue to become an important part of surgical management of ocular conditions. Machine learning applications will help push the boundaries of what surgeons can accomplish to improve patient outcomes.","Mishra, Kapil; Leng, Theodore",Current opinion in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34397576/,138
92870,The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) as an animal model for respiratory tract infections with human pathogens.,2013,"BACKGROUND Balloon-assisted techniques can improve the endovascular treatment of cerebrospinal vascular malformations. The aim of this study was to report the first clinical multicenter experience with the new Scepter Mini dual-lumen microballoon catheter. METHODS Patients with cerebral or spinal vascular malformations treated with the Scepter Mini at seven European neurovascular centers were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data, angiographic features of the vascular malformations, procedural parameters including the type of application, navigability, technical failures, complications and embolization success were assessed. RESULTS The usage of 34 Scepter Mini microballoon catheters in 20 patients was analyzed. Most treated malformations (80.0%) were cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Four different applications were reported: embolization via Scepter Mini (n=23, 67.6%), balloon-occlusion with simultaneous embolization via a second microcatheter (n=3, 8.8%), diagnostic angiography with simultaneous balloon-inflation for flow arrest (n=4, 11.8%), and navigation support (n=4, 11.8%). The mean diameter of the blood vessels in which the Scepter Mini was inflated was 1.9±0.5 mm. The navigability of the Scepter Mini was rated as 'easy' or 'very easy' in 88.2% of cases. Complete occlusion of the malformation was achieved in 60.9% of cases. Technical failures occurred in 4/23 embolization procedures, and all were related to insufficient stability of the balloon within the vessel. No complications related to the Scepter Mini were observed, while unrelated complications occurred in three patients (15.0%). CONCLUSIONS The Scepter Mini is a promising new device for balloon-assisted embolization of cerebrospinal vascular malformations via small feeders. Beyond embolization, the Scepter Mini can also be used for other applications, such as superselective flow arrest and navigation support.","Vollherbst, Dominik F; Chapot, René; Wallocha, Marta; Saatci, Isil; Cekirge, Saruhan; Rouchaud, Aymeric; Mounayer, Charbel; Kocer, Naci; Kizilkilic, Osman; Sourour, Nader A; Shotar, Eimad; Psychogios, Marios N; Brehm, Alex; Bendszus, Martin; Möhlenbruch, Markus A",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32546639/,138
93302,Linoleic acid attenuates cardioprotection induced by resolvin D1.,2016,"Perinatal asphyxia is a significant cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that around 23% of all newborn deaths are caused by birth asphyxia. Each year, between four and nine million newborns develop birth asphyxia worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, despite major advances in monitoring and knowledge of fetal and neonatal physiology and development, perinatal asphyxia remains a serious condition that causes significant mortality and long-term morbidity. However, to date no single marker of perinatal asphyxia has shown good predictive efficacy in prediction and early diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia. On the other hand, ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is a new biomarker in identification of myocardial ischemia of myocardial necrosis. IMA may also increase in the ischemia of liver, brain, kidney and bowel. Ischemia of these organs may also seen in perinatal asphyxia as well. Reactive oxygen species, produced during ischaemia/reperfusion which is essential steps of perinatal asphyxia, may generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. These hydroxyl radicals modify the albumin and transforms it into IMA. Therefore, IMA might be useful for the prediction and diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia. Further studies are urgently needed to determine the role of IMA in the prediction of perinatal asphyxia.","Dursun, Arzu; Okumus, Nurullah; Zenciroglu, Aysegul","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2012.697943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22642562/,138
93603,Human Washington University Polyomavirus in Patients with Respiratory Tract Infection in Kuwait.,2017,"BACKGROUND Incidental findings (IF) are reported in 20% or more of trauma CT scans. In addition to the importance of patient disclosure, there is significant legal pressure to avoid missed diagnoses. We reported previously 63.5% of IF were disclosed prior to discharge, with 20% non-disclosed. We initiated a multi-disciplinary systemic plan to effect pre-discharge disclosure by synoptic CT reports with American College of Radiology (ACR) recommended follow-up, EMR discharge prompts, and provider education. STUDY DESIGN Prospective observational series patients from November 2019-February 2020. Statistical analysis performed with SPSS statistical package web version 21. RESULTS 877 patients (pts) with CT (507 males/370 females) Average age was 57 years (range: 14-99) and 96% had blunt injury. In 315 pts there were 523 IF (1.7 per pt.), the most common being lung (17.5%), kidney (13%) and liver (11%). Radiology report compliance was 210 of 249 (84%). There were 66 studies from outside facilities. Sixteen IF were suspicious for malignancy. A total of 151 pts needed no follow-up and 148 pts needed future follow-up evaluation. Pre-discharge IF disclosure compliance was 90.1% (286 patients), with 25 post-discharge. Four pts remain undisclosed. Compared to our previous report, clearer reporting and EMR prompts increased pre-discharge disclosure from 63.5% to 90.1% (p < 0.01, Chi-square test) and decreased days to notification from 29.5 (0-277) to 5.2 (range 0-59) (p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test.) CONCLUSION: Timely, complete disclosure of IF improves patient outcome and reduces medicolegal risk. Collaboration between trauma, radiology, and IT promotes improved disclosure in trauma populations.","Smith, Lou M; King, Sarah A; Shealy, Jordan A; Heidel, Robert E; Morin-Ducote, Garnetta I; Husband, Leland D; Callison, John C; Rosen, Brenton A; Savoy, Rachel A; Daley, Brian J",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.11.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385568/,138

METHODS All 124 items of the English source PRO-CTCAE item library were translated into Simplified Chinese using internationally established translation procedures. Two rounds of cognitive interviews were conducted with 96 cancer patients undergoing adjuvant treatment to determine if the translations adequately captured the PRO-CTCAE source concepts, and to evaluate comprehension, clarity and ease of judgement. Interview probes addressed the 78 PRO-CTCAE symptom terms (e.g. fatigue), as well as the attributes (e.g. severity), response choices, and phrasing of 'at its worst'. Items that met the a priori threshold of ≥20% of participants with comprehension difficulties were considered for rephrasing and retesting. Items where < 20% of the sample experienced comprehension difficulties were also considered for rephrasing if better phrasing options were available. RESULTS A majority of PRO-CTCAE-Simplified Chinese items were well comprehended by participants in Round 1. One item posed difficulties in ≥20% and was revised. Two items presented difficulties in < 20% but were revised as there were preferred alternative phrasings. Twenty-four items presented difficulties in < 10% of respondents. Of these, eleven items were revised to an alternative preferred phrasing, four items were revised to include synonyms. Revised items were tested in Round 2 and demonstrated satisfactory comprehension.

95846,Neural correlates of reversal learning in frontotemporal dementia.,2021-07-23,"INTRODUCTION Self-Help Plus (SH+) is a group-based psychological intervention developed by the World Health Organization for managing stress. OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of SH+ in preventing mental disorders in refugees and asylum seekers in Western Europe. METHODS We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 5 European countries. Refugees and asylum seekers with psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire score ≥3), but without a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) or ICD/10 diagnosis of mental disorder, as assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), were randomized to SH+ or enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU). The primary outcome was the frequency of mental disorders with the MINI at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the frequency of mental disorders at postintervention, self-identified problems, psychological symptoms, and other outcomes. RESULTS Four hundred fifty-nine individuals were randomly assigned to SH+ or ETAU. For the primary outcome, we found no difference in the frequency of mental disorders at 6 months (Cramer V = 0.007, p = 0.90, RR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.52-1.78), while the difference significantly favored SH+ at after the intervention (secondary outcome, measured within 2 weeks from the last session; Cramer V = 0.13, p = 0.01, RR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.29-0.87). CONCLUSIONS This is the first randomized indicated prevention study with the aim of preventing the onset of mental disorders in asylum seekers and refugees in Western Europe. As a prevention effect of SH+ was not observed at 6 months, but rather after the intervention only, modalities to maintain its beneficial effect in the long term need to be identified.","Purgato, Marianna; Carswell, Kenneth; Tedeschi, Federico; Acarturk, Ceren; Anttila, Minna; Au, Teresa; Bajbouj, Malek; Baumgartner, Josef; Biondi, Massimo; Churchill, Rachel; Cuijpers, Pim; Koesters, Markus; Gastaldon, Chiara; Ilkkursun, Zeynep; Lantta, Tella; Nosè, Michela; Ostuzzi, Giovanni; Papola, Davide; Popa, Mariana; Roselli, Valentina; Sijbrandij, Marit; Tarsitani, Lorenzo; Turrini, Giulia; Välimäki, Maritta; Walker, Lauren; Wancata, Johannes; Zanini, Elisa; White, Ross; van Ommeren, Mark; Barbui, Corrado",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,https://doi.org/10.1159/000517504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350902/,138
96073,Furoxan derivatives demonstrated in vivo efficacy by reducing Mycobacterium tuberculosis to undetectable levels in a mouse model of infection.,2020-08-04,"This study investigated the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of indigo in mice and explored the possible related mechanisms. Xylene-induced ear edema, carrageenan-induced paw edema, and acetic acid-induced vascular permeability tests were used in investigating the anti-inflammatory activities. The anti-nociceptive effects of indigo were assessed through acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate test, and formalin test, and spontaneous locomotor activity and motor performance were evaluated. The mechanisms of activities of indigo were explored by evaluating the expression levels of IκB kinase (IKK)β, p-IKKβ, inhibitor κB (IκB)α, p-IκBα, p65 nuclear factor (NF)-kB, p-p65 NF-κB, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) through western blotting and the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that indigo significantly reduced xylene-induced ear edema, carrageenan-induced paw edema, and acetic acid-induced vascular permeation. In addition, indigo significantly inhibited nociception induced by acetic acid and formalin. However, the level of nociception was not decreased by indigo in the hot plate test, and indigo did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity and motor performance. The expression levels of p-IKKβ, p-IκBα, p65 NF-kB, p-p65 NF-κB, COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and PGE2 decreased, whereas the expression level of IκBα increased obviously after indigo treatment. In conclusion, indigo exerts significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities in mice by inhibiting IKKβ phosphorylation and reducing the production of important pain mediators, such as PGE2 and COX-2, via the IKKβ/IκB/NF-κB pathway.","Liu, Ning; Zhang, Guo-Xin; Niu, Ya-Ting; Wang, Qing; Zheng, Jie; Yang, Jia-Mei; Sun, Tao; Niu, Jian-Guo; Yu, Jian-Qiang",Food & function,https://doi.org/10.1039/c9fo02574j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084638/,138

METHODS Children under 2 years admitted with fever and/or respiratory symptoms were enrolled from 2010 to 2013 in Amman, Jordan. Nasal/throat swabs were collected and stored for testing. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected through parent/guardian interviews and medical chart abstractions. Prior stored specimens were tested for HCoVs (HKU1, OC43, 229E and NL63) by qRT-PCR. RESULTS Of the 3168 children enrolled, 6.7% were HCoVs-positive. Among HCoV-positive children, the median age was 3.8 (1.9-8.4) months, 59% were male, 14% were premature, 11% had underlying medical conditions and 76% had viral-codetection. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, fever, wheezing and shortness of breath. HCoVs were detected year-round, peaking in winter-spring months. Overall, 56%, 22%, 13% and 6% were OC43, NL63, HKU1 and 229E, respectively. There was no difference in disease severity between the species, except higher intensive care unit admission frequency in NL63-positive subjects. CONCLUSIONS HCoVs were detected in around 7% of children enrolled in our study. Despite HCoV detection in children with ARI with highest peaks in respiratory seasons, the actual burden and pathogenic role of HCoVs in ARI merits further evaluation given the high frequency of viral codetection.","Haddadin, Zaid; Chappell, James; McHenry, Rendie; Pulido, Claudia Guevara; Rahman, Herdi; Gu, Wenying; Rankin, Danielle A; Talj, Rana; Howard, Leigh M; Williams, John V; Faouri, Samir; Shehabi, Asem; Khuri-Bulos, Najwa; Halasa, Natasha B",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165274/,138

The precise mechanisms underlying adhesion formation are poorly understood. Many compounds and physical barriers have been tested for their ability to prevent adhesions after surgery with varying levels of success. The mouse and rat are important models for the study of abdominal adhesions. Several different techniques for the creation of adhesions in the mouse and rat exist in the literature. Here we describe a protocol utilizing abrasion of the cecum with sandpaper and sutures placed in the right abdominal sidewall. The mouse is anesthetized and the abdomen is prepped. A midline laparotomy is created and the cecum is identified. Sandpaper is used to gently abrade the surface of the cecum. Next, several figure-of-eight sutures are placed into the peritoneum of the right abdominal sidewall. The abdominal cavity is irrigated, a small amount of starch is applied, and the incision is closed. We have found that this technique produces the most consistent adhesions with the lowest mortality rate.","Marshall, Clement D; Hu, Michael S; Leavitt, Tripp; Barnes, Leandra A; Cheung, Alexander T M; Malhotra, Samir; Lorenz, H Peter; Longaker, Michael T",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/54450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27685681/,138

METHODS Data from flight itineraries for travellers who flew from Mexico were used to estimate the number of international airports where health screening measures would have been needed, and the number of travellers who would have had to be screened, to assess all air travellers who could have transported the H1N1 influenza virus out of Mexico during the initial stages of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. FINDINGS Exit screening at 36 airports in Mexico, or entry screening of travellers arriving on direct flights from Mexico at 82 airports in 26 other countries, would have resulted in the assessment of all air travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico at the start of the pandemic. Entry screening of 116 travellers arriving from Mexico by direct or connecting flights would have been necessary for every one traveller at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09. Screening at just eight airports would have resulted in the assessment of 90% of all air travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico in the early stages of the pandemic. CONCLUSION During the earliest stages of the A(H1N1) pandemic, most public health benefits potentially attainable through the screening of air travellers could have been achieved by screening travellers at only eight airports.","Khan, Kamran; Eckhardt, Rose; Brownstein, John S; Naqvi, Raza; Hu, Wei; Kossowsky, David; Scales, David; Arino, Julien; MacDonald, Michael; Wang, Jun; Sears, Jennifer; Cetron, Martin S",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.12.114777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23678200/,138

To support clinical development of BMS-986178 (an OX40 agonist antibody), two repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. In the first study, BMS-986178 was administered intravenously (IV) once weekly for one month at doses from 30 to 120 mg/kg. BMS-986178 was well tolerated; surprisingly, immune function was suppressed rather than increased based on pharmacodynamic (PD) and flow cytometry readouts (e.g. T-cell dependent antibody response [TDAR]). To determine whether immune suppression was due to a bi-phasic response, a follow-up study was conducted at lower doses (1 and 10 mg/kg). Although receptor engagement was confirmed, immune function was still suppressed at both doses. In addition, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at 1 mg/kg resulted in hypersensitivity reactions and reduced BMS-986178 exposure after repeated dosing, which precluded a full PD assessment at this dose. In conclusion, BMS-986178 was clinically well-tolerated by monkeys at weekly IV doses from 10 to 120 mg/kg (AUC[0-168] ≤ 712,000 μg●h/mL). However, despite target engagement, PD assays and other immune endpoints demonstrated immune suppression, not stimulation. Due to the inverted immune response at higher doses and the onset of ADAs, additional repeat-dose toxicity studies of BMS-986178 in monkeys (that would typically be required to support Phase 3 clinical trials and registration) would not add value for human safety assessment.","Gamse, Joshua T; Freebern, Wendy; Haynes Ii, Rashade; Simutis, Frank; Pazian, Mary; Crona, James; Haggerty, Helen G; Graziano, Michael; Bunch, Roderick Todd",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2020.115285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069749/,138

We determined the total organic C (TOC) concentrations (filtered <1-7 µm) and the ratios of TOC/dissolved organic N (DON) concentrations, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH in all major ecosystem solutions of a tropical montane forest from 1998 to 2013. The forest was located on the rim of the Amazon basin in Ecuador and experienced increasing numbers of days with >25°C, decreasing soil moisture, and rising N deposition from the atmosphere during the study period. In rainfall, throughfall, mineral soil solutions (at the 0.15- and 0.30-m depths), and streamflow, TOC concentrations and fluxes decreased significantly from 1998 to 2013, while they increased in stemflow. TOC/DON ratios decreased significantly in rainfall, throughfall, soil solution at the 0.15-m depth, and streamflow. Based on Δ14 C values, the TOC in rainfall and mineral soil solutions was 1 yr old and that of litter leachate 10 yr old. The pH in litter leachate decreased with time, that in mineral soil solutions increased, while those in the other ecosystem solutions did not change. Thus, reduced TOC solubility because of lower pH values cannot explain the negative trends of TOC concentrations in most ecosystem solutions. The increasing TOC concentrations and EC in stemflow pointed at an increased leaching of TOC and other ions from the bark. Our results suggest an accelerated degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM), particularly of young DOM, associated with the production of N-rich compounds simultaneously to changing climatic conditions and increasing N availability. Thus, environmental change increased the CO2 release to the atmosphere but reduced DOM export to surface and groundwater.","Wilcke, Wolfgang; Velescu, Andre; Leimer, Sophia; Blotevogel, Simon; Alvarez, Pablo; Valarezo, Carlos",Global change biology,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939921/,138

Using a pig model of severe lung injury, we tested the feasibility and physiological responses to a novel fully closed-loop mechanical ventilation algorithm based on the ""open lung"" concept. Lung injury was induced by surfactant washout in pigs (n = 8). Animals were ventilated following the principles of the ""open lung approach"" (OLA) using a fully closed-loop physiological feedback algorithm for mechanical ventilation. Standard gas exchange, respiratory- and hemodynamic parameters were measured. Electrical impedance tomography was used to quantify regional ventilation distribution during mechanical ventilation. Automatized mechanical ventilation provided strict adherence to low VT-ventilation for 6 h in severely lung injured pigs. Using the ""open lung"" approach, tidal volume delivery required low lung distending pressures, increased recruitment and ventilation of dorsal lung regions and improved arterial blood oxygenation. Physiological feedback closed-loop mechanical ventilation according to the principles of the open lung concept is feasible and provides low tidal volume ventilation without human intervention. Of importance, the ""open lung approach""-ventilation improved gas exchange and reduced lung driving pressures by opening atelectasis and shifting of ventilation to dorsal lung regions.","Schwaiberger, David; Pickerodt, Philipp A; Pomprapa, Anake; Tjarks, Onno; Kork, Felix; Boemke, Willehad; Francis, Roland C E; Leonhardt, Steffen; Lachmann, Burkhard",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-017-0040-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28653135/,138
99899,Sepsis: a frequent topic in a new Editorial Section in INFECTION.,2019,"We examined the effects of regional scale land use and local scale environmental and biotic stressors on alpha, beta and zeta diversities of native fish communities in wadeable streams and non-wadeable rivers in the Danube basin, Hungary. Relationships among land use and local scale environmental and biotic stressors were weak both in streams and rivers, suggesting that these stressors act relatively independently. Alpha diversity decreased strongly with increasing local scale environmental stressor intensity in rivers. On the contrary, its response to stressors was more obscure in streams, where the best-fit statistical model indicated the importance of the interaction between land use, local scale environmental and biotic stressors, while the secondly ranked model highlighted the negative impact of local scale environmental stressors. Analysis of variance using distance matrices provided evidence that stressors alone and in interactions explained compositional differences of pairs of study sites (beta diversity). Considering the degree of overall degradation, both local (alpha) and among-site (beta and zeta) diversity indices responded to increasing stressor intensity, generally negatively. Riverine fish communities showed higher degrees of similarity (lower beta and higher zeta) than stream fish communities. They also showed increasing similarity (i.e. homogenization) with increasing overall stressor intensity, unlike stream fish communities, which showed no relationship with overall stressor intensity. Our results suggest that the relationships between land use and local scale environmental and biotic stressors can be complex and so do their effects on biodiversity. While stressor specific indices can provide information on the role of specific stressors in some cases, the examination of overall stressor effects is needed to assess realistically the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on native fish diversity. Diversity indices that quantify among-site changes in species composition, such as measures of beta and zeta diversity, can be fruitful for better understanding the role of multiple stressors in structuring ecological communities.","Erős, Tibor; Czeglédi, István; Tóth, Rita; Schmera, Dénes",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818892/,138

Our objective was to further define the development of the ""dying-back"" oligodendrocyte lesion in situ and to model the development and potential reversibility of such responses using dissociated cultures of adult human brain-derived oligodendrocytes. METHODS In situ analyses were performed on glutaraldehyde-fixed thin sections of clinically acute and pathologically active cases of MS. In vitro studies were conducted using adult human brain-derived oligodendrocytes challenged by metabolic stress conditions (low nutrient/glucose). RESULTS In situ analyses indicated a spectrum of myelin changes in the presence of morphologically intact oligodendrocytes; these included degeneration of the inner cytoplasmic tongue with increasing sizes of intramyelinic bleb formation that could result in radial fractures of the myelin sheath. Macrophages with ingested myelin fragments were identified only once the fragmentation was established. In vitro studies indicated that oligodendrocyte process retraction, which was linked to reduced glycolytic respiratory activity, is reversible until a critical time point. Subsequent cell death was not linked to caspase-3-dependent programs. Gene expression studies conducted at the latest reversible time point revealed reduced expression of pathways associated with cell process outgrowth and myelination, as well as with metabolic activity. INTERPRETATION Our findings reveal the potential to protect and possibly restore myelin elaborated by existent oligodendrocytes in early and evolving MS lesions, and suggest the necessity of ongoing studies of the mechanisms underlying subsequent adult human oligodendrocyte cell death.

While many communities face surging case numbers, others are experiencing case plateaus or even decreasing numbers. Simultaneously, some U.S. school systems face immense infrastructure challenges and resource constraints, while others are better positioned to resume face-to-face instruction. In this review, we first examine potential engineering controls to reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposures; we then present processes whereby local decision-makers can identify and partner with scientists, faculty, students, parents, public health officials, and others to determine the controls most appropriate for their communities. While no solution completely eliminates risks of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and illness, this mini-review discusses engaged decision and communication processes that incorporate current scientific knowledge, school district constraints, local tolerance for health risk, and community priorities to help guide schools in selecting and implementing re-opening strategies that are acceptable, feasible, and context-specific.","Hoover, Anna G; Heiger-Bernays, Wendy; Ojha, Sweta; Pennell, Kelly G",Reviews on environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1515/reveh-2020-0092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33001857/,138

So far, it has killed 7,37,417 number of individuals. High variability in the viral genome and its greater ability to spread in the human community is badly affecting the comorbid individuals. Although infected individuals are mainly possessing respiratory issues, neurological manifestations in these individuals cannot be overlooked. The literature search is based on the recent development in the concerned field. We searched databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""neurological manifestations"", ""CNS"", and ""PNS"". The major neurological complications observed in these patients are encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, Guillain Barre Syndrome, smell/taste impairment, epileptic seizures, and abnormal states of consciousness.

Epigenetic mechanisms contribute to many aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, including expression levels of viral receptor ACE2, expression of cytokine genes as part of the host immune response, and the implication of various histone modifications in several aspects of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 proteins physically associate with many different host proteins over the course of infection, and notably there are several interactions between viral proteins and epigenetic enzymes such as HDACs and bromodomain-containing proteins as shown by correlation-based studies. The many contributions of epigenetic mechanisms to the viral life cycle and the host immune response to infection have resulted in epigenetic factors being identified as emerging biomarkers for COVID-19, and project epigenetic modifiers as promising therapeutic targets to combat COVID-19.

Reactive movements in response to a loss of balance are altered in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and are critical for fall prevention. Further, falls are more common while attention is divided. Although divided attention has been shown to impact postural responses in healthy older adults, the impact of dividing attention on reactive balance, and the natural prioritization across postural and cognitive tasks in people with PD is largely unknown. Objectives. To characterize (1) the impact of a secondary cognitive task on reactive postural control and (2) the prioritization across stepping and cognitive tasks in people with PD. Methods. Sixteen people with PD and 14 age-matched controls underwent step-inducing, support-surface perturbations from stance, with and without an auditory Stroop secondary cognitive task. Cognitive, neuromuscular, and protective stepping performance were calculated for single and dual task scenarios. Results. In PD and control participants, cognitive reaction times (P = .001) and muscle onset latency (P = .007), but not protective step outcomes (P > .12 for all) were worse during dual tasking compared with single-task scenarios. Both PD and control groups prioritized the protective stepping task over the cognitive task. Overall, people with PD exhibited worse first-step margin of stability (a measure of protective step performance) than controls (P = .044). Conclusion. This study provides preliminary evidence that people with PD, like age-matched controls, exhibit cognitive and neuromuscular, but not protective step, dual-task interference. The lack of dual-task interference on step performance indicates a postural prioritization for PD and healthy older adults during dual-task protective stepping.","Peterson, Daniel S; Barajas, Jordan S; Denney, Linda; Mehta, Shyamal H",Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,https://doi.org/10.1177/1545968320935814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633614/,138

The high cardiovascular risk strategy is carried out at the individual level in outpatient structures as a part of primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, and is also implemented in hospitals when performing elective surgical procedures, including high-tech interventions. Improving this strategy within the framework of primary health care involves the development of a system of high-risk offices, telemedicine consulting, remote monitoring of physiological parameters on the basis of a regional medical information system, and in the future, on the basis of a uniform vertically integrated medical information system.

The study included all sequentially hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, inclusive of these dates. Exposures Confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring admission. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy, and death. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected. Results A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7% female). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6%), obesity (1737; 41.7%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8%). At triage, 30.7% of patients were febrile, 17.3% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/minute, and 27.8% received supplemental oxygen. The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1%. Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point. During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2%) (median age, 68 years [IQR, 56-78]; 33.5% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21%) died. Mortality for those requiring mechanical ventilation was 88.1%. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3).

As an important reproductive trait, litter size relates to estrogen synthesis. Therefore, it is important to investigate the association between RORA gene and sheep litter size. In this study, one 23-bp nucleotide sequence mutation was identified in intron 1 of RORA gene in 532 female Australian White Sheep. Moreover, the polymorphic information content (PIC) values of this locus was 0.219. The litter size of ID genotype was significantly better than II genotype and DD genotype in the second born litter size (p < 0.05). This loci was related to third born litter size and the ID is the dominant genotype (p < 0.05). The association between combined genotypes and average litter size showed that sheep with heterozygote (ID) genotypes had larger lamb than homozygous (DD and II) genotypes. To sum, this study provided theoretical references for the comprehensively research of the function of RORA gene and the breeding of Australian White Sheep. The 23-bp indel variants could be considered as molecular markers for the second and third born litter size of sheep for MAS breeding.","Yang, Yuta; Hu, Huina; Mao, Cui; Jiang, Fugui; Lu, Xiaofang; Han, Xufei; Hao, Kunjie; Lan, Xianyong; Zhang, Qingfeng; Pan, Chuanying",Animal biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1080/10495398.2020.1770273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32731793/,138

As localities enforce lockdowns and pass emergency OUD treatment regulations, questions arise about how these changes will affect access and retention in care. In this study, we explore the influence of COVID-19 on access to, experiences with, and motivations for OUD treatment through a qualitative analysis of public discussion forums on Reddit. METHODS We collected data from Reddit, a free and international online platform dedicated to public discussions and user-generated content. We extracted 1000 of the most recent posts uploaded between March 5th and May 13th, 2020 from each of the two most popular opioid subreddits ""r/Opiates"" and ""r/OpiatesRecovery"" (total 2000). We reviewed posts for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use and coded content using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Thematic analysis identified common themes related to study questions of interest. RESULTS Of 2000 posts reviewed, 300 (15%) discussed topics related to the intersection of opioid use and COVID-19. Five major themes related to OUD treatment were identified: Concern about closure of OUD treatment services; transition to telehealth and virtual care; methadone treatment requirements and increased exposure to COVID-19; reactions to changing regulations on medications for OUD; and influences of the pandemic on treatment motivation and progress. CONCLUSION In the face of unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19, reactions of Reddit opioid forum users ranged from increased distress in accessing and sustaining treatment, to encouragement surrounding new modes of treatment and opportunities to engage in care. New and less restrictive avenues for treatment were welcomed by many, but questions remain about how new norms and policy changes will be sustained beyond this pandemic and impact OUD treatment access and outcomes long-term.","Krawczyk, Noa; Bunting, Amanda M; Frank, David; Arshonsky, Joshua; Gu, Yuanqi; Friedman, Samuel R; Bragg, Marie A",The International journal on drug policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558165/,138

A potential area localized behind the mesh and extending from the inguinal cord into the scrotum may be one of the major etiological factors of this complication. Our aim is to describe a novel technique in preventing pseudorecurrence by using fibrin sealant to close that potential dead space. METHODS Forty male patients who underwent laparoscopic TEP for indirect inguinal hernia with at least 100-mL volume were included in this prospective clinical study. While fibrin sealant was used to close the potential dead space in the study group, nothing was used in the control group. The volume of postoperative fluid collection on ultrasound was compared between the groups. RESULTS Patient characteristics and the volumes of hernia sac were similar between the 2 groups. The mean volume of postoperative fluid collection was found as 120.2 mL in the control group and 53.7 mL in the study group, indicating a statistical significance (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Minimizing the potential dead space with a fibrin sealant can reduce the amount of postoperative fluid collection, namely the incidence of pseudorecurrence.","Sürgit, Önder; Çavuşoğlu, Nadir Turgut; Kılıç, Murat Özgür; Ünal, Yılmaz; Koşar, Pınar Nergis; İçen, Duygu",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2016.91.3.127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27617253/,138

Six observers graded red bands of photographs of the readout window in MMP-9 immunoassay kit (InflammaDry) two times with 2-week interval based on the 5-scale grading system (i.e. grade 0-4). Interobserver and intraobserver reliability were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients. The interobserver agreements were analyzed according to the severity of tear MMP-9 expression. To validate the system, a concentration calibration curve was made using MMP-9 solutions with reference concentrations, then the distribution of MMP-9 concentrations was analyzed according to the 5-scale grading system. Both intraobserver and interobserver reliability was excellent. The readout grades were significantly correlated with the quantified colorimetric densities. The interobserver variance of readout grades had no correlation with the severity of the measured densities. The band density continued to increase up to a maximal concentration (i.e. 5000 ng/mL) according to the calibration curve. The difference of grades reflected the change of MMP-9 concentrations sensitively, especially between grade 2 and 4.

Messages posted on Twitter provide an insight into the state of mind of citizens affected by such disasters and provide useful data on the emotional impact on groups of people. In 2015, Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu state in southern India, experienced unprecedented flooding, which subsequently triggered economic losses and had considerable psychological impact on citizens. The objectives of this study are to (i) mine posts to Twitter to extract negative emotions of those posting tweets before, during and after the floods; (ii) examine the spatial and temporal variations of negative emotions across Chennai city via tweets; and (iii) analyse associations in the posts between the emotions observed before, during and after the disaster. METHODS Using Twitter's application programming interface, tweets posted at the time of floods were aggregated for detailed categorisation and analysis. The different emotions were extracted and classified by using the National Research Council emotion lexicon. Both an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mixed-effect analysis were performed to assess the temporal variations in negative emotion rates. Global and local Moran's I statistic were used to understand the spatial distribution and clusters of negative emotions across the Chennai region. Spatial regression was used to analyse over time the association in negative emotion rates from the tweets. RESULTS In the 5696 tweets analysed around the time of the floods, negative emotions were in evidence 17.02% before, 29.45% during and 11.39% after the floods. The rates of negative emotions showed significant variation between tweets sent before, during and after the disaster. Negative emotions were highest at the time of disaster's peak and reduced considerably post disaster in all wards of Chennai. Spatial clusters of wards with high negative emotion rates were identified. CONCLUSIONS Spatial analysis of emotions expressed on Twitter during disasters helps to identify geographic areas with high negative emotions and areas needing immediate emotional support. Analysing emotions temporally provides insight into early identification of mental health issues, and their consequences, for those affected by disasters.","Karmegam, Dhivya; Mappillairaju, Bagavandas",International journal of health geographics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-020-00214-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32466764/,138
107030,Long non-coding RNA FGD5-AS1 promotes cell viability and metastasis in osteosarcoma by regulating miR-520c-3p.,2021-02-17,"The outbreak of piglet diarrhoea caused by porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) began to spread in Southern China in late 2010 and resulted in significant economic losses throughout the country. To determine the prevalence and the molecular characteristics of common PEDV strains in China, 1272 faeces and small intestine samples in pigs were collected from 17 provinces and inspected for PEDV; the full-length spike (S) gene of 18 detected PEDV strains collected from five eastern provinces were sequenced and analysed. The epidemiological data revealed that the PEDV-positive rate in diarrhoea specimens was 28.93%. Phylogenetic analysis of the S genes showed that the CH-JSYC-1-2016 strain was clustered into a G2-a subgroup (US and Asian non-S-INDEL), and other seventeen virus strains was clustered into a new subgroup G2-b (Chinese non-S-INDEL). The G2-b subgroup only contained Chinese PEDV strains that were isolated after 2014. Compared with the CV777 vaccine strain, Eastern China PEDVs were genetically distinct and had various amino acid differences in the neutralizing epitope domain of the S protein, as well as different patterns of predicted high-specificity N-glycosylation sites. The prevalence of Chinese non-S-INDEL strains may be responsible for the immunization failure by using currently available commercial vaccines (based on attenuated CV777 strain), and the development of novel vaccines based on these newly identified PEDV variants may contribute to the control of PED outbreaks in China.","Yu, Jing; Chai, Xulan; Cheng, Yao; Xing, Gang; Liao, Ao; Du, Liuyang; Wang, Yue; Lei, Jing; Gu, Jinyan; Zhou, Jiyong",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.01.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29412159/,138

Food Navigators followed a program Playbook, though unlike many similar programs, the program did not offer incentives to subsidize FM purchases. To inform program design and understand outcomes, data were collected from Food Navigators, shoppers, FM managers, and FM vendors. Food Navigators supported five to seven FMs each season (May through October), spending 590 days in FMs over three seasons. Due to their interaction with Food Navigators, shoppers in Season 3 (n = 689) indicated that they would: shop more at the FM (80%); eat more vegetables (52%); and purchase more vegetables (50%). Of shoppers who interacted with Food Navigators more than once (n = 55), 26% reported a higher frequency of vegetable consumption on their last survey compared with their first. In Season 3, at least half of FM managers (n = 4, 50%) and vendors (n = 68, 57%) agreed that food navigators helped increase overall market fruit and vegetables sales. Findings indicated the program did influence multiple levels of a social ecological framework as intended. FM nutrition programs can have success at increasing market sales and improving health-related behaviors without offering incentives. As a result, programs could operate with smaller budgets and be more likely to have increased shopper fruit and vegetable consumption sustainably beyond the direct subsidy of purchases.","Scott, Marci K; Gutuskey, Lila; Zwemer, Teresa; Gallington, Kyli",Health promotion practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839920978163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305636/,138
107901,Morphological and functional characteristics of satellite glial cells in the peripheral nervous system.,2020-12-17,"INTRODUCTION EDs are often the first line of contact with individuals infected with COVID-19 and play a key role in triage. However, there is currently little specific guidance for deciding when patients with COVID-19 require hospitalisation and when they may be safely observed as an outpatient. METHODS In this retrospective study, we characterised all patients with COVID-19 discharged home from EDs in our US multisite healthcare system from March 2020 to August 2020, focusing on individuals who returned within 2 weeks and required hospital admission. We restricted analyses to first-encounter data that do not depend on laboratory or imaging diagnostics in order to inform point-of-care assessments in resource-limited environments. Vitals and comorbidities were extracted from the electronic health record. We performed ordinal logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of inpatient admission, intensive care and intubation. RESULTS Of n=923 patients who were COVID-19 positive discharged from the ED, n=107 (11.6%) returned within 2 weeks and were admitted. In a multivariable-adjusted model including n=788 patients with complete risk factor information, history of hypertension increased odds of hospitalisation and severe illness by 1.92-fold (95% CI 1.07 to 3.41), diabetes by 2.20-fold (1.18 to 4.02), chronic lung disease by 2.21-fold (1.22 to 3.92) and fever by 2.89-fold (1.71 to 4.82). Having at least two of these risk factors increased the odds of future hospitalisation by 6.68-fold (3.54 to 12.70). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease or fever had significantly longer hospital stays (median 5.92 days, 3.08-10.95 vs 3.21, 1.10-5.75, p<0.01) with numerically higher but not significantly different rates of intensive care unit admission (27.02% vs 14.30%, p=0.27) and intubation (12.16% vs 7.14%, p=0.71). DISCUSSION Patients infected with COVID-19 may appear clinically safe for home convalescence. However, those with hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease and fever may in fact be only 'pseudo-safe' and are most at risk for subsequent hospitalisation with more severe illness and longer hospital stays.","Yuan, Neal; Ji, Hongwei; Sun, Nancy; Botting, Patrick; Nguyen, Trevor; Torbati, Sam; Cheng, Susan; Ebinger, Joseph",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-210041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33602725/,138
108733,Annotated patent selections.,2005,"BACKGROUND The effects of ABO incompatibility on cord blood transplantation (CBT) have not been confirmed. We retrospectively investigated the effect of ABO incompatibility on the clinical outcomes and changes of isoagglutinin titres of 261 consecutive patients who underwent CBT in a single centre. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied patients with haematological malignancies undergoing unrelated CBT following myeloablative conditioning. There were 80 matched, 72 major mismatched, 72 minor mismatched, and 37 bidirectional mismatched transplants. Risk factors that could potentially influence the patients' outcomes were evaluated. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) isohaemagglutinin antibody (IHA) titres were determined 1 day before and 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after the transplant. RESULTS ABO mismatches did not influence engraftment, transfusion requirements, event-free survival or overall survival following CBT. The anti-donor IgM serum IHA titres fell to ≤1:8 at week 8 after CBT in all patients with ABO major and bidirectional mismatches. The percentages of patients requiring platelet and red blood cell transfusions in the period 31-61 days after CBT were markedly lower than in the period 0-30 days after CBT, being 15% vs 99% for platelets and 23% vs 78% for red blood cells, respectively. Of the 69 recipients of minor mismatched CBT tested, only three with AB blood type developed low titres of anti-recipient IHA after 5 months. DISCUSSION In this study ABO incompatibility did not affect clinical outcomes after CBT. A higher number of CD34+ cells infused was correlated with earlier engraftment. Severe acute graft-versus-host disease was associated with poor overall survival. As the IHA titre decreased, so did the number of patients requiring blood transfusion. Rapidly decreasing anti-donor IHA titres and the non-production of donor anti-recipient A and/or B antibodies might contribute to a good outcome of ABO-incompatible CBT with myeloablative conditioning for haematological malignancies.","Chen, Yang; Wan, Xiaoju; Cao, Yuan; Wang, Huiru; Han, Dandan; Zhang, Yuangyuang; Yao, Wen; Song, Kaidi; Fan, Qian; Zhu, Xiaoyu; Sun, Ziming; Liu, Huilan",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,https://doi.org/10.2450/2021.0080-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369864/,138
108907,Exosomal therapy-a new frontier in regenerative medicine.,2021,"NAC protein is a large plant specific transcription factor family, which plays important roles in the response to abiotic stresses. However, the regulation mechanism of most NAC proteins in drought stress remains to be further uncovered. In this study, we elucidated the molecular functions of a NAC protein, GhirNAC2, in response to drought stress in cotton. GhirNAC2 was greatly induced by drought and phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). Subcellular localization demonstrated that GhirNAC2 was located in the nucleus. Co-suppression of GhirNAC2 in cotton led to larger stomata aperture, elevated water loss and finally reduced transgenic plants tolerance to drought stress. Furthermore, the endogenous ABA content was significantly lower in GhirNAC2-suppressed transgenic plant leaves compared to wild type. in vivo and in vitro studies showed that GhirNAC2 directly binds to the promoter of GhNCED3a/3c, key genes in ABA biosynthesis, which were both down-regulated in GhirNAC2-suppressed transgenic lines. Transient silencing of GhNCED3a/3c also significantly reduced the resistance to drought stress in cotton plants. However, ectopic expression of GhirNAC2 in tobacco significantly enhanced seed germination, root growth and plant survival under drought stress. Taken together, GhirNAC2 plays a positive role in cotton drought tolerance, which functions by modulating ABA biosynthesis and stomata closure via regulating GhNCED3a/3c expression.","Shang, Xiaoguang; Yu, Yujia; Zhu, Lijie; Liu, Hanqiao; Chai, Qichao; Guo, Wangzhen",Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2020.110498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32540016/,138

110230,Endoscopic solutions for weight loss.,2011,"BACKGROUND Professional identity development is an area of contemporary interest within medical education. It can be defined as 'the foundational process one experiences during the transformation from lay person to physician'. In order for this transformation to occur, medical values and principles are internalised. A robust professional identity is key to confident practice as a medical professional. As such, research regarding what works to encourage identity development is popular. New models of educational delivery, such as the increasingly popular Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship model (LICs), present an interesting opportunity to investigate impact on identity. As no previous literature reviews focus on identity development within LICs, it is unclear what is already known about their impact. Therefore, a scoping review synthesising current knowledge and mapping areas for future research is necessary. METHODS Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review steps will be used as a methodological framework. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, ERIC, PsychINFO, Google Scholar, JSTOR, Scopus, and Web of science will be searched (from inception onwards). We will include single studies of any design (e.g. quantitative and qualitative) and reviews examining professional identity within Longitudinal Integrated Clerkships involving health profession students. Two reviewers will complete all screening and data abstraction independently. Deductive coding will be presented as a quantitative textual meta-analysis. Inductive coding will be presented in narrative format. DISCUSSION This scoping review will explore professional identity formation within LICs, evaluating any known impact of the educational model and mapping the ways in which identity within LICs has been researched. Mapping of current knowledge should highlight whether LICs as an educational model can influence professional identity development and outline gaps in what is known about their impact to date. Theory used in LIC-based identity research will also be mapped, in order to summarise the main theoretical orientations of research to date. It is anticipated that through such evidence synthesis, directions for future research will become clear.

In acute bronchitis and asthma exacerbations their role is less well defined than with patients with COPD. The clinical features, causative pathogens and therapies of common acute respiratory tract infections are detailed in this review. AREAS COVERED This article covers medical literature published in any language from 2000 to 2014, on 'lower respiratory tract infections', identified using PubMed, MEDLINE and ClinicalTrial.gov. The search terms used were 'COPD exacerbations', 'bronchiectasis', 'macrolides' and 'inhaled antibiotics'. EXPERT OPINION Given that almost half of AECOPD are caused by bacteria, administration of antibacterial agents is recommended for patients with severe exacerbations or severe underlying COPD. Chronic prophylactic use of macrolides seems to be of benefit, particularly in patients with bronchiectasis and chronic mucous hypersecretion. In an effort to manage chronic airway infection non-CF bronchiectasis due to drug-resistant pathogens, aerosolized antibiotics may be of value, and the data from recent studies are examined to demonstrate the potential value of this therapy, which is often used as an adjunctive measure to systemic antimicrobial therapy.","Liapikou, Adamantia; Torres, Antoni",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1517/14656566.2014.959927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25216725/,138
111527,HLA-Restriction of Human Treg Cells Is Not Required for Therapeutic Efficacy of Low-Dose IL-2 in Humanized Mice.,2021,"INTRODUCTION Attenuated adult hippocampal neurogenesis may manifest in affective symptomatology and/or resistance to antidepressant treatment. While early-life adversity and the short variant ('s') of the serotonin transporter gene's long polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) are suggested as interacting risk factors for affective disorders, no studies have examined whether their superposed risk effectuates neurogenic changes into adulthood. Similarly, it is not established whether reduced hippocampal volume in adolescence, variously identified as a marker and antecedent of affective disorders, anticipates diminished adult neurogenesis. We investigate these potential developmental precursors of neurogenic alterations using a bonnet macaque model. METHODS Twenty-five male infant bonnet macaques were randomized to stressed [variable foraging demand (VFD)] or normative [low foraging demand (LFD)] rearing protocols and genotyped for 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms. Adolescent MRI brain scans (mean age 4.2y) were available for 14 subjects. Adult-born neurons were detected post-mortem (mean age 8.6y) via immunohistochemistry targeting the microtubule protein doublecortin (DCX). Models were adjusted for age and weight. RESULTS A putative vulnerability group (VG) of VFD-reared 's'-carriers (all 's/l') exhibited reduced neurogenesis compared to non-VG subjects. Neurogenesis levels were positively predicted by ipsilateral hippocampal volume normalized for total brain volume, but not by contralateral or raw hippocampal volume. LIMITATIONS No 's'-carriers were identified in LFD-reared subjects, precluding a 2×2 factorial analysis. CONCLUSION The 's' allele (with adverse rearing) and low adolescent hippocampal volume portend a neurogenic deficit in adult macaques, suggesting persistent alterations in hippocampal plasticity may contribute to these developmental factors' affective risk in humans.","Schoenfeld, Eric M; Gupta, Nishant K; Syed, Shariful A; Rozenboym, Anna V; Fulton, Sasha L; Jackowski, Andrea P; Perera, Tarique D; Coplan, Jeremy D",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740637/,138

METHODS We conducted a systematic review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on Global Health Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases using keywords and MeSH terms to identify articles pertaining to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A narrative synthesis was then undertaken to identify the key themes. RESULTS A total of 25 articles met the inclusion criteria of this systematic review. Three main themes were identified following the data extraction: (a) evidence against/inconclusive regarding ECMO for COVID-19, (b) evidence supporting ECMO for COVID-19, and finally (c) VV-ECMO and VA-ECMO. After combining the data, there were 3428 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 95 ECMO-associated deaths (19.83%). CONCLUSION Our study highlights the paucity of evidence and the need for further data to consolidate the efficacy of ECMO in improving patient outcomes. Although ECMO has been shown to be beneficial in a selected group of patients, the recuperative effects of ECMO remain inconclusive. We must ensure that risk-benefit analysis for each candidate is conducted thoroughly so that patients that have increased probability of survival can benefit from this scarce resource.","Haiduc, Ana Alina; Alom, Samiha; Melamed, Naomi; Harky, Amer",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32717771/,138

However, there are few tools to detect microstructural changes after AKI. Here, cationic ferritin-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CFE-MRI) was applied to examine the heterogeneity of kidney pathology in the transition from AKI to CKD. Adult male mice received folic acid followed by cationic ferritin and were euthanized at four days (AKI), four weeks (CKD-4) or 12 weeks (CKD-12). Kidneys were examined by histologic methods and CFE-MRI. In the CKD-4 and CKD-12 groups, glomerular number was reduced and atubular cortical lesions were observed. Apparent glomerular volume was larger in the AKI, CKD-4 and CKD-12 groups compared to controls. Glomerular hypertrophy occurred with ageing. Interglomerular distance and glomerular density were combined with other MRI metrics to distinguish the AKI and CKD groups from controls. Despite significant heterogeneity, the noninvasive (MRI-based) metrics were as accurate as invasive (histological) metrics at distinguishing AKI and CKD from controls. To assess the toxicity of cationic ferritin in a CKD model, CKD-4 mice received cationic ferritin and were examined one week later. The CKD-4 groups with and without cationic ferritin were similar, except the iron content of the kidney, liver, and spleen was greater in the CKD-4 plus cationic ferritin group. Thus, our study demonstrates the accuracy and safety of CFE-MRI to detect whole kidney pathology allowing for the development of novel biomarkers of kidney disease and providing a foundation for future in vivo longitudinal studies in mouse models of AKI and CKD to track nephron fate.","Charlton, Jennifer R; Xu, Yanzhe; Wu, Teresa; deRonde, Kim A; Hughes, Jillian L; Dutta, Shourik; Oxley, Gavin T; Cwiek, Aleksandra; Cathro, Helen P; Charlton, Nathan P; Conaway, Mark R; Baldelomar, Edwin J; Parvin, Neda; Bennett, Kevin M",Kidney international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.08.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916180/,138

115669,63 days detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from a recovered patient in Southern Italy: A Case Report.,2020,"UNLABELLED Coronaviruses are RNA viruses with a large zoonotic reservoir and propensity for host switching, representing a real threat for public health, as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Cellular factors required for their replication are poorly understood. Using genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening, we identified 83 novel genes supporting infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) replication in human cells. Thirty of these hits can be placed in a network of interactions with viral proteins and are involved in RNA splicing, membrane trafficking, and ubiquitin conjugation. In addition, our screen reveals an unexpected role for valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) in early steps of infection. Loss of VCP inhibits a previously uncharacterized degradation of the nucleocapsid N protein. This inhibition derives from virus accumulation in early endosomes, suggesting a role for VCP in the maturation of virus-loaded endosomes. The several host factors identified in this study may provide avenues for targeted therapeutics.

IL-12Rβ1 is a receptor chain of both the IL-12 and the IL-23 receptor and deficiency of IL-12Rβ1 thus abolishes both IL-12 and IL-23 signaling. IL-12Rβ1 deficiency is caused by bi-allelic mutations in the IL12RB1 gene. Mutations resulting in premature stop codons, such as nonsense, frame shift, and splice site mutations, represent the majority of IL-12Rβ1 deficiency causing mutations (66%; 46/70). Also every other morbid mutation completely inactivates the IL-12Rβ1 protein. In addition to disease-causing mutations, rare and common variations with unknown functional effect have been reported in IL12RB1.

116795,Infectious Disease Research in China.,2020-04-24,"BACKGROUND Under the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) adjusts the target price for total hip arthroplasty (THA) based upon the historical proportion of fracture cases. Concerns exist that hospitals that care for hip fracture patients may be penalized in BPCI. The purpose of this study is to compare the episode-of-care (EOC) costs of hip fracture patients to elective THA patients. METHODS We reviewed a consecutive series of 4096 THA patients from 2015 to 2018. Patients were grouped into elective THA (n = 3686), fracture THA (n = 176), and hemiarthroplasty (n = 274). Using CMS claims data, we compared EOC costs, postacute care costs, and performance against the target price between the groups. To control for confounding variables, we performed a multivariate analysis to identify the effect of hip fracture diagnosis on costs. RESULTS Elective THA patients had lower EOC ($18,200 vs $42,605 vs $38,371; P < .001) and postacute care costs ($4477 vs $28,093 vs $23,217; P < .001) than both hemiarthroplasty and THA for fracture. Patients undergoing arthroplasty for fracture lost an average of $23,122 (vs $1648 profit for elective THA; P < .001) with 91% of cases exceeding the target price (vs 20% for elective THA; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, patients undergoing arthroplasty for fracture had higher EOC costs by $19,492 (P < .001). CONCLUSION Patients undergoing arthroplasty for fracture cost over twice as much as elective THA patients. CMS should change their methodology or exclude fracture patients from BPCI, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Skibicki, Hope; Yayac, Michael; Krueger, Chad A; Courtney, P Maxwell",The Journal of arthroplasty,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.07.069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32829971/,138

To understand transmission into human populations, filovirus dynamics within reservoir host populations must be understood. Studies have directly linked filoviruses to bats, but the mechanisms allowing viral persistence within bat populations are poorly understood. Theory suggests seasonal birthing may decrease the probability of pathogen persistence within populations, but data suggest MARV may persist within colonies of seasonally breeding Egyptian fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus. I synthesize available filovirus and bat data in a stochastic compartmental model to explore fundamental questions relating to filovirus ecology: can filoviruses persist within isolated bat colonies; do critical community sizes exist; and how do host-pathogen relationships affect spillover transmission potential? Synchronous annual breeding and shorter incubation periods did not allow filovirus persistence, whereas bi-annual breeding and longer incubation periods, such as reported for Egyptian fruit bats and EBOV in experimental studies, allowed persistence in colony sizes often found in nature. Serological data support the findings, with bats from species with two annual birth pulses more likely to be seropositive (odds ratio (OR) 4.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5-8.7) than those with one, suggesting that biannual birthing is necessary for filovirus persistence.","Hayman, David T S",Proceedings.

119499,Identification of novel diagnostic serum biomarkers for Chagas' disease in asymptomatic subjects by mass spectrometric profiling.,2010,"Magnesium (Mg) based temporary implants are an appealing new solution to counter the problems associated with the currently available temporary orthopaedic implants, used in fracture fixing. To make the extensive use of Mg-based implants in-vivo, mechanical integrity in the physiological environment is a prerequisite. This study presents an insight into the biomechanical stability of Mg-3Zn/HA (0, 5, and 15 wt % of HA) composites in two different milieus (simulated body fluid (SBF) and serum contained SBF (m-SBF)). After 14 days of static immersion in SBF, ~65% mechanical strength was compromised in the case of 15 wt % HA reinforcement. However, the degradation rate was slowed down by ~35% with the addition of 15 wt % HA in Mg-3Zn. Mg-3Zn/HA composite, when soaked in both fluids, was found to induce apatite layer formation on the surfaces for several days. However, in the case of m-SBF immersion, 15 wt % HA facilitated less precipitation of apatite growth when compared to SBF immersion. Nevertheless, m-SBF immersed 15 wt % HA composite facilitated better corrosion resistance and excellent mechanical stability after 14 days of immersion. The approach thereby assists in establishing an effective mechanism between the degradation and mechanical stability in in-vitro immersion. In addition, this study has also developed a semi-empirical model for prediction of the compressive strength of these composites as a function of the number of days of immersion and the content of hydroxyapatite (HA). This semi-empirical model will help in predicting the biomechanical stability for long-term in-vitro exposures, which might be of use in evaluating the effect of the in-vivo environment.","Dubey, Anshu; Jaiswal, Satish; Lahiri, Debrupa",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2020.103980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830104/,138

This single-center study presents the authors' preliminary experience using the LVIS stent to treat saccular aneurysms with parent arteries smaller than 2.5 mm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aneurysms with a LVIS stent used in a small parent vessel (<2.5 mm in diameter) between October 2014 and April 2016 were included. Procedure-related complications, angiographic results, clinical outcomes, and midterm follow-up data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS A total of 22 patients was studied, including 5 ruptured and 17 unruptured aneurysms. Most of the aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation (90.9%). Stent placement in the parent arteries measuring 1.7-2.4 mm in diameter (mean, 2.1 mm) was successful in 100% of cases. Procedure-related complication developed in 1 patient (4.5%) who presented with aneurysm rupture. No permanent morbidity and mortality occurred. Immediate angiographic outcome showed complete occlusion in 8 aneurysms (36.4%), neck residual in 8 (36.4%), and residual aneurysm in 6 (27.3%). All patients underwent angiographic follow-up at a mean of 8.3 months, which revealed complete occlusion in 18 (81.8%) patients, neck remnant in 3 (13.6%), and residual sac in 1 (4.5%). No recanalization of the target aneurysm was observed. There was 1 case with asymptomatic in-stent stenosis. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary results show that the deployment of LVIS stents in small vessels is feasible, safe, and effective in the midterm. Larger studies with long-term follow-up are needed to validate our promising results.","Wang, C-C; Li, W; Feng, Z-Z; Hong, B; Xu, Y; Liu, J-M; Huang, Q-H",AJNR.

Genetic factors, such as polymorphisms of CYP genes, may increase the likelihood of a patient experiencing such adverse drug reactions. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we synthesised evidence for associations between CYP genetic variants and anti-tuberculosis drug-related toxicity outcomes. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSIS and Web of Science to identify relevant studies. We performed meta-analyses to obtain an effect estimate for each genetic variant on each outcome, and stratified all analyses by country. We qualitatively assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS We included data from 28 distinct cohorts of patients in the review. We identified many areas of concern with regard to the quality of included studies. Patients with homozygous mutant-type or heterozygous genotype at the CYP2E1 RsaI polymorphism were significantly less likely to experience hepatotoxicity than patients with homozygous wild-type genotype (odds ratio [OR] = 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-1.00; p = 0.047, I2 = 58.2%). No significant differences were observed for the CYP2E1 DraI and PstI polymorphisms. For the 96-bp deletion-insertion single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the CYP2E1 gene, homozygous mutant-type significantly increased hepatotoxicity risk compared with homozygous wild-type (OR = 8.20, 95% CI 1.38-48.68, I2 = 0%); no significant difference was observed for heterozygous genotype compared with homozygous wild-type (OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.19-3.21, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS Generally, we identified that coverage of the association between SNPs of CYP genes and anti-tuberculosis drug-related toxicity outcomes is incomplete. We observed significant associations between the RsaI and 96-bp deletion-insertion SNPs of the CYP2E1 gene and anti-tuberculosis drug-related hepatotoxicity.

Methods In a randomized controlled trial, participants in three UK centres were randomized with concealed allocation to a NIRS (INVOS 5100; Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA)-based 'patient-specific' algorithm that included a restrictive red cell transfusion threshold (haematocrit 18%) or to a 'generic' non-NIRS-based algorithm (standard care). The NIRS algorithm aimed to maintain cerebral oxygenation at an absolute value of > 50% or at > 70% of baseline values. The primary outcome for the trial was cognitive function measured up to 3 months postsurgery. Results The analysis population comprised eligible randomized patients who underwent valve or combined valve surgery and coronary artery bypass grafts using cardiopulmonary bypass between December 2009 and January 2014 ( n =98 patient-specific algorithm; n =106 generic algorithm). There was no difference between the groups for the three core cognitive domains (attention, verbal memory, and motor coordination) or for the non-core domains psychomotor speed and visuo-spatial skills. The NIRS group had higher scores for verbal fluency; mean difference 3.73 (95% confidence interval 1.50, 5.96). Red cell transfusions, biomarkers of brain, kidney, and myocardial injury, adverse events, and health-care costs were similar between the groups.

OBJECTIVES To determine the frequency, degree, character and possible cause of influenza-associated HLH in critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to influenza A(H1N1) infection requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support at our hospital. DESIGN A retrospective observational study. PATIENTS AND SETTING Medical data were retrieved retrospectively from 11 consenting patients of thirteen adults infected with pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 requiring ECMO between July 2009 and January 2010 at the ECMO Centre of Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. All patients were evaluated for HLH using HLH-2004 criteria and HScore. RESULTS Eleven patients (median age 31 years) were included in the study and all survived. All patients showed signs of multiple organ dysfunction and pronounced inflammation, more severe in the four patients with HLH who had significantly higher peak serum concentrations of ferritin (P = 0.024), alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.012) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (P = 0.024), lower concentration of albumin (P = 0.0086) and more frequently hepatomegaly (P = 0.048). Abnormal lymphocyte cytotoxicity (lytic units <10) and a low proportion of natural killer (NK) cells were observed in three of four patients with HLH. Notably, we found a significant inverse correlation between serum ferritin concentration and NK cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte percentages (rs = -0.74, P = 0.0013 and rs = -0.79, P = 0.0025, respectively). One HLH patient received HLH-directed cytotoxic therapy, another intravenous immunoglobulin and the other two no specific HLH-directed therapy. CONCLUSION Critically ill patients, including healthy young adults, with pandemic influenza may develop HLH and should be monitored for signs of hyperinflammation and increasing organ dysfunction, and evaluated promptly for HLH because HLH-directed therapy may then be beneficial. The association of low NK percentages with hyperferritinaemia may suggest a role for reduced NK cell numbers, possibly also cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and subsequently reduced lymphocyte cytotoxicity, in the pathogenesis of hyperinflammation and secondary HLH.","von Bahr Greenwood, Tatiana; Holzgraefe, Bernhard; Chiang, Samuel C C; Wang, Yini; Tesi, Bianca; Bryceson, Yenan T; Henter, Jan-Inge",European journal of anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/eja.0000000000001386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186307/,138

This is particularly relevant in the olfactory system as additional odorant receptors typically respond with increasing stimulus concentrations. Thus, perceptual measures of olfactory sensitivity provide an important guide for functional experiments. This study focuses on aliphatic alcohols because they are commonly used to survey neural activity in a variety of olfactory regions, probe the behavioral limits of odor discrimination and assess odor-structure activity relationships in mice. However, despite their frequent use, a systematic study of the relative sensitivity of these odorants in mice is not available. Thus, we assayed the ability of C57BL/6J mice to detect a homologous series of primary aliphatic alcohols (1-propanol to 1-heptanol) using a head-fixed Go / No-Go operant conditioning assay combined with highly reproducible stimulus delivery. To aid in the accessibility of our data, we report the animal's threshold to each odorant according to the 1) ideal gas condition, 2) non-ideal gas condition (factoring in the activity of the odorant in the solvent), and 3) the liquid dilution of the odorant in the olfactometer.

125243,"Emerging, evolving, and established infectious diseases and interventions.",2014,"The aim of this study is to describe the way that the Brazilian press reports on episodes of violence involving people with substance-related problems or psychiatric disorders. To develop this documentary study, we analyzed news reports from September 2009 to August 2015 in two major Brazilian newspaper who make their published articles available electronically in the Lexis Nexis Academic® database. The analyses were conducted using descriptive statistics and association tests. We identified 269 news stories related to these themes during the study period. The reported events occurred mainly in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and 68% of the stories suggested a causal relationship between substance use or mental illness and violence. A marked minority (10%) of the stories made reference to prevention or treatment for the conditions studied. We concluded that the Brazilian press issues incomplete reports on episodes of violence involving people with substance-related problems or psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the relationships between these conditions and potential danger, particularly in cases involving drugs.","Souza, Jacqueline de; Almeida, Letícia Yamawaka de; Oliveira, Jaqueline Lemos de; Cazella, Larissa Giovanna; Guiral, Elaine Cristina Vilioni de Souza; Gaino, Loraine Vivian; Strobbe, Stephen",Journal of ethnicity in substance abuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/15332640.2020.1852144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243097/,138
125430,Two Aspects of Feedforward Control During a Fencing Lunge: Early and Anticipatory Postural Adjustments.,2021,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to characterize the CT findings of 30 children from mainland China who had laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Although recent American College of Radiology recommendations assert that CT should not be used as a screening or diagnostic tool for patients with suspected COVID-19, radiologists should be familiar with the imaging appearance of this disease to identify its presence in patients undergoing CT for other reasons. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We retrospectively reviewed the CT findings and clinical symptoms of 30 pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were seen at six centers in China from January 23, 2020, to February 8, 2020. Patient age ranged from 10 months to 18 years. Patients older than 18 years of age or those without chest CT examinations were excluded. Two cardiothoracic radiologists and a cardiothoracic imaging fellow characterized and scored the extent of lung involvement. Cohen kappa coefficient was used to calculate interobserver agreement between the readers. RESULTS. Among children, CT findings were often negative (77%). Positive CT findings seen in children included ground-glass opacities with a peripheral lung distribution, a crazy paving pattern, and the halo and reverse halo signs. There was a correlation between increasing age and increasing severity of findings, consistent with reported symptomatology in children. Eleven of 30 patients (37%) underwent follow-up chest CT, with 10 of 11 examinations (91%) showing no change, raising questions about the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in children. CONCLUSION. The present study describes the chest CT findings encountered in children with COVID-19 and questions the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients.","Steinberger, Sharon; Lin, Bin; Bernheim, Adam; Chung, Michael; Gao, Yuantong; Xie, Zongyu; Zhao, Tongtong; Xia, Junli; Mei, Xueyan; Little, Brent P",AJR.

METHODS Twenty elderly people were recruited for this study. The backward adjustable thoracic support sitting posture was compared with the slumped, normal, and lumbar support sitting postures. Spinal curvatures (pelvic, lumbar, and thoracic angles) and muscle activations of 4 back muscles on both sides (maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the lumbar multifidus, lumbar erector spinae, iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis, and thoracic erector spinae at T9) were measured and compared between the different sitting postures using one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. RESULTS The backward adjustable thoracic support sitting posture showed a relatively neutral pelvic tilt (-0.32±4.80°) when compared with the slumped (22.84±5.27°) and lumbar support (-8.97±3.31°) sitting postures (P<0.001), and showed relatively higher lumbar lordosis (-23.38±6.50°) when compared with the slumped (14.77±7.83°), normal (0.44±7.47°), and lumbar support (-16.76±4.77°) sitting postures (P<0.05). It also showed relatively lower back muscle activity when compared with the normal and lumbar support sitting postures (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The backward adjustable thoracic support sitting concept was suggested because it maintains a more neutral pelvic tilt, higher lumbar lordosis, and lower back muscle activation, which may help maintain a better sitting posture and reduce the risk of back pain.","Li, Chun-Ting; Chen, Yen-Nien; Chang, Chih-Han; Tsai, Kuen-Horng",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0113644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480152/,138

METHODOLOGY All children hospitalized with adiagnosis of influenza-like illness had been investigated for Influenza A and other respiratory antigens in pharengeal/nasopharyngeal secretions. RESULTS A total of 132 hospitalized children between December 2013-May 2014 and December 2014-May 2015 were enrolled in this study. At least one respiratory virus was found to be positive by RT-PCR in 78 (59%) patients, influenza A (H3N2) was detected in only 8 (6%) patients. In 54 (41%) patients samples no respiratory viral pathogen was detected and in 70 (53%) patients, one non- influenza A virus was detected. The respiratory viral pathogens detected in decreasing rates were:RSV (n = 46, 35%), HCoV (n = 10, 7.5%), adenovirüs (n = 7, 5%), rhinovirüs (n = 6, 4.5%), HMPV (n = 5, 4%), Influenza B (n = 4, 3%) ve human Bocavirus (n = 2, 1.5%). In 10 patients, coinfection was detected, however none was with H3N2. In the H3N2 (+) group, the following risk factors were identified: age older than three years (p < 0.05), asthma history (p < 0.05) and chronic lung diseases (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Influenza A virus was detected in 6% of hospitalized patients with influenza-like illness. Viruses other then Influenza, especially RSV, can cause similar symptoms compatible with Influenza-like-illness.","Girit, Saniye; Karaaslan, Ayşe; Gençer, Serap; Yılmaz, Emel; Ayhan, Yetkin; Vayvada, Elif Ruşen; Akçay Ciblak, Meral; Badur, Selim; Akın, Yasemin",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.8867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626600/,138

This report describes timing of antibody generation and disease progression following infection with a US PEDV isolate by assessing fecal viral shedding, morphometric analysis of intestinal lesions, and magnitude of immunohistochemical staining. Sixty-three, 3-week-old pigs were randomly allocated into control (n=27) and challenged (n=36) groups. Challenged pigs were administered 1 mL of 1 × 10(3) PFU/mL of US/Iowa/18984/2013 PEDV isolate by oro-gastric gavage. Three control and four challenged pigs were necropsied on days post-inoculation (dpi) 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and weekly thereafter, until study termination on dpi 35. Clinical disease, fecal shedding, body weight, and temperature were monitored during the study period. Diarrhea was observed in challenged pigs beginning for some on dpi 2, affecting a majority of pigs by dpi 6 and subsiding by dpi 10. Average daily gain was significantly lower (P<0.001) for one week post-infection in challenged pigs. PEDV was detected in feces by PCR on dpi 1 and continued in a subset of pigs until dpi 24. PEDV-specific antigen was detected in villous enterocytes of challenged pigs by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on dpi 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 14. Microscopic lesions included severe diffuse atrophic enteritis with significantly reduced (P<0.001) villous length observed on dpi 3, 4, and 7. Under the conditions of this study, fecal shedding of PEDV and IHC staining can precede and continue beyond the observation of clinical signs, thus increasing the risk of viral transmission.","Madson, D M; Magstadt, D R; Arruda, P H E; Hoang, H; Sun, D; Bower, L P; Bhandari, M; Burrough, E R; Gauger, P C; Pillatzki, A E; Stevenson, G W; Wilberts, B L; Brodie, J; Harmon, K M; Wang, C; Main, R G; Zhang, J; Yoon, K J",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25278366/,138

We also wish to evaluate the possible horizontal transmission after hospital discharge, by means of a follow-up of all the newborns included at 1 month of age. METHODS This multicenter descriptive study involved 16 Spanish hospitals. We reviewed the medical records of 242 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 13 to May 31, 2020, when they were in their third trimester of pregnancy. They and their 248 newborn infants were monitored until the infant was 1 month old. RESULTS Caesarean sections (C-sections) were performed on 63 (26%) women. The initial clinical symptoms were coughing (33%) and fever (29.7%). Mothers hospitalized due to COVID-19 pathology had a higher risk of ending their pregnancy via C-section (P = 0.027). Newborns whose mothers had been admitted due to their COVID-19 infection had a higher risk of premature delivery (P = 0.006). We admitted 115 (46.3%) newborn infants to the neonatal unit, of those, 87 (75.6%) were only admitted due to organizational circumstances. No infants died and no vertical or horizontal transmission was detected. Regarding type of feeding, 41.7% of the newborns received exclusive breast-feeding at discharge and 40.4% at 1 month. CONCLUSIONS We did not detect COVID-19 transmission during delivery or throughout the first month of life in the newborns included in our study. Exclusive breast-feeding rates at discharge and at 1 month of age were lower than expected.","Marín Gabriel, Miguel A; Reyne Vergeli, Mar; Caserío Carbonero, Sonia; Sole, Laia; Carrizosa Molina, Tamara; Rivero Calle, Irene; Cuadrado Pérez, Irene; Álvarez Fernández, Blanca; Forti Buratti, Azul; Fernández-Cañadas Morillo, Aurora",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32947599/,138

This lineage C betacoronavirus has been reported to cause a wide range of disease severity in humans, ranging from asymptomatic to progressive fatal pneumonia that may be accompanied by renal or multiorgan failure. Although the clinical presentation of human MERS-CoV infection has been documented, many facets of this emerging disease are still unknown and could be studied with animal models. Several animal models of MERS-CoV have been developed, including New Zealand white rabbits, transduced or transgenic mice that express human dipeptidyl peptidase 4, rhesus macaques, and common marmosets. This review provides an overview of the current state of knowledge on human MERS-CoV infections, the probable origin of MERS-CoV, and the available animal models of MERS-CoV infection. Evaluation of the benefits and limitations of these models will aid in appropriate model selection for studying viral pathogenesis and transmission, as well as for testing vaccines and antivirals against MERS-CoV.","Baseler, L; de Wit, E; Feldmann, H",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985815620845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26869154/,138

METHODS One hundred and thirty-four subjects (30.0% of women and 70.0% of men) from Nuevo León, Mexico, took part in the study (2014). They filled out structured, analytical, self-administered, anonymous questionnaires. Besides the sociodemographic variables, the perception regarding public and private dental services and related professionals was evaluated, as well as the perceived stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, through a Likert-type scale. The statistical evaluation included a factorial and a non-hierarchical cluster analysis. RESULTS Social inequalities were found regarding the search for public and private dental professionals and services. Most subjects reported omitting their HIV serodiagnosis and agreed that dentists must be trained and qualified to treat patients with HIV/AIDS. The factorial analysis revealed two elements: experiences of stigma and discrimination in dental appointments and feelings of concern regarding the attitudes of professionals or their teams concerning patients' HIV serodiagnosis. The cluster analysis identified three groups: users who have not experienced stigma or discrimination (85.0%); the ones who have not had those experiences, but feel somewhat concerned (12.7%); and the ones who underwent stigma and discrimination and feel concerned (2.3%). CONCLUSIONS We observed a low percentage of stigma and discrimination in dental appointments; however, most HIV/AIDS patients do not reveal their serodiagnosis to dentists out of fear of being rejected. Such fact implies a workplace hazard to dental professionals, but especially to the very own health of HIV/AIDS patients, as dentists will not be able to provide them a proper clinical and pharmaceutical treatment.","Elizondo, Jesus Eduardo; Treviño, Ana Cecilia; Violant, Deborah",Revista de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/s0034-8910.2015049005877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26538100/,138

129927,Longitudinal monitoring of asthma in the clinic using respiratory oscillometry.,2021-04-01,"With increasing age, naive CD4 T cells acquire intrinsic defects that compromise their ability to respond and differentiate. Type I IFNs, pervasive constituents of the environment in which adaptive immune responses occur, are known to regulate T cell differentiation and survival. Activated naive CD4 T cells from older individuals have reduced responses to type I IFN, a defect that develops during activation and that is not observed in quiescent naive CD4 T cells. Naive CD4 T cells from young adults upregulate the expression of STAT1 and STAT5 after activation, lowering their threshold to respond to type I IFN stimulation. The heightened STAT signaling is critical to maintain the expression of CD69 that regulates lymphocyte egress and the ability to produce IL-2 and to survive. Although activation of T cells from older adults also induces transcription of STAT1 and STAT5, failure to exclude SHP-1 from the signaling complex blunts their type I IFN response. In summary, our data show that type I IFN signaling thresholds in naive CD4 T cells after activation are dynamically regulated to respond to environmental cues for clonal expansion and memory cell differentiation. Naive CD4 T cells from older adults have a defect in this threshold calibration. Restoring their ability to respond to type I IFN emerges as a promising target to restore T cell responses and to improve the induction of T cell memory.","Li, Guangjin; Ju, Jihang; Weyand, Cornelia M; Goronzy, Jörg J",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1402389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091718/,138

Health issues, particularly infectious diseases, are potential threats for the species. Health information from 65 wild tapirs from two Brazilian biomes, Atlantic Forest (AF) and Pantanal (PA), were collected during a long-term study (1996-2012). The study included physic, hematologic and biochemical evaluations, microbiologic cultures, urinalysis, and serologic analyses for antibodies against 13 infectious agents (viral and bacterial). The AF and PA tapirs were significantly different for several hematologic and biochemical parameters. Ten bacteria taxa were identified in the AF and 26 in the PA. Antibodies against five viruses were detected: Bluetongue virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, western equine encephalitis virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, and porcine parvovirus. A high prevalence of exposure to Leptospira interrogans (10 serovars: Autumnalis, Bratislava, Canicola, Copenhageni, Grippotyphosa, Hardjo, Hebdomadis, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona, and Pyrogenes) was detected in both the AF and PA sites. A greater diversity of serovars and higher antibody titers were found in the PA. Statistically significant differences between sites were found for L. interrogans, equine encephalitis virus, and porcine parvovirus. Based on physical evaluations, both AF and PA populations were healthy. The differences in the overall health profile of the AF and PA tapir populations appear to be associated with environmental factors and infectious diseases ecology. The extensive datasets on hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, and microbiology results from this paper can be used as reference values for wild tapirs.","Medici, Emília Patrícia; Mangini, Paulo Rogerio; Fernandes-Santos, Renata Carolina",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://doi.org/10.7589/2014-02-029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25105810/,138
131089,Epidemiology and clinical associations of human parechovirus respiratory infections.,2008,"Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with breast cancer. Systemic drug therapy, which is usually effective against peripheral breast cancers, is often ineffective on BCBM due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB). In this study, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with internalization function was found to be specifically up-regulated on BCBM-associated BTB while barely detectable in normal blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, a nanotechnology approach is reported that can overcome the BTB through ACUPA (A) and cyclic TT1 (cT) co-functionalized nanoparticles (A-NPs-cT). A-NPs-cT selectively target PSMA on BTB for specific BTB crossing and specially bind with p32 for BCBM targeting. We disclosed the effectual synergism of doxorubicin (DOX) and lapatinib (LAP) for BCBM combined therapy. A-NPs-cT exhibited boosted uptake than integrin-targeting RGD-modified NPs in BTB endothelial cells and displayed about 4.57-fold stronger penetration through the BCBM-associated BTB as compared to the normal BBB. In vivo studies showed specific BTB crossing, and remission of BCBM and prolonged survival with DOX and LAP combinatorial regimen. A-NPs-cT based DOX and LAP innovative combined therapy envisioned improved therapeutic intervention for clinical management of BCBM, for which surgery is generally inapplicable and insufficient.","Ni, Jiang; Miao, Tongtong; Su, Ma; Khan, Naveed Ullah; Ju, Xiufeng; Chen, Haiyan; Liu, Feng; Han, Liang",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.10.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069744/,138

Currently, there are uncertainty and concerns about the maternal and fetal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. METHODS A cross-sectional web survey was carried out including pregnant women in seven cities in Colombia. Women were evaluated during the mitigation phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic between April 13 and May 18, 2020. The questions evaluated demographic, knowledge, psychological symptoms, and attitudes data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS A total of 1021 patients were invited to participate, obtaining 946 valid surveys for analysis. The rate of psychological consequences of the pandemic was much larger than the number of patients clinically affected by the virus, with 50.4% of the entire cohort reporting symptoms of anxiety, 49.1% insomnia, and 25% reporting depressive symptoms. Poorly informed women were more likely to be younger, affiliated to the subsidized regime, and with lower levels of education. CONCLUSION The knowledge of pregnant women about SARS-CoV-2 infection is far from reality and this seems to be associated with an indirect effect on the concern and psychological stress of pregnant women in Colombia.","Parra-Saavedra, Miguel; Villa-Villa, Isis; Pérez-Olivo, José; Guzman-Polania, Leidy; Galvis-Centurion, Pablo; Cumplido-Romero, Álvaro; Santacruz-Vargas, Dario; Rivera-Moreno, Eliana; Molina-Giraldo, Saulo; Guillen-Burgos, Hernán; Navarro, Edgar; Flórez-Lozano, Karen; Barrero-Ortega, Amanda; Sanz-Cortes, Magdalena; Miranda, Jezid",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32799318/,138

METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted on data obtained from the review of medical charts of all consecutive patients treated with CERAB technique for AIOD between January 2016 and December 2019 in San Giovanni-Addolorata Hospital (Rome, Italy). Clinical examination, duplex ultrasound with ankle-brachial index measurement and contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography were performed preoperatively. A clinical and ultrasound follow-up was carried out at one month and then half yearly after the intervention to evaluate patients' clinical status, limb salvage, target lesion revascularization rate, primary and secondary patency rate. RESULTS During the study period, 24 patients (14 men, 58.3%; 10 women, 41.7%; median age 59 years, range 37-79 years) underwent CERAB for AIOD (TASC II C 29.2%, TASC II D 70.8%). Indications for treatment were: intermittent claudication in 18 patients (75%) and critical limb ischemia in 6 (25%). Technical success was achieved in all cases. Perioperative minor complications occurred in three cases (12.5%). One patient reported an intraoperative iliac rupture requiring adjunctive covered stenting. Median hospital length of stay was two days (range 1-9). No patient died perioperatively nor at the last follow-up. At a median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-48 months), mean ankle-brachial index increased significantly (from 0.62 ± 0.15 before the procedure to 0.84 ± 0.18) (P < 0.001) and target lesion revascularization rate was 12.5%. At two years, the limb salvage rate was 100%, and primary and secondary patency rates were 87.5% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION CERAB technique demonstrated to be effective at the mid-term follow-up with low rate of complications and short length of stay. Long-term results and more robust data are needed to affirm this technique as the first-line treatment for extensive AIOD. However, it could become the preferred option especially in fragile patients and during contemporary COVID-19 pandemic due to the current limitations in vascular and critical care bed capacity.","Borghese, Ottavia; Ferrer, Ciro; Coscarella, Carlo; Spataro, Claudio; Diotallevi, Nicolò; Giudice, Rocco",Vascular,https://doi.org/10.1177/17085381211018336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056974/,138

134844,MicroRNA-155 coordinates the immunological landscape within murine melanoma and correlates with immunity in human cancers.,2019,"Objective Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a leading cause of mortality and disease burden. Preventative interventions to augment the population-level adoption of health lifestyle behaviours that reduce CVD risk are a priority. Face-to-face interventions afford individualisation and are effective for improving health-related behaviours and outcomes, but they are costly and resource intensive. Electronic and mobile health (e- and mHealth) approaches aimed at modifying lifestyle risk factors may be an effective and scalable approach to reach many individuals while preserving individualisation. This systematic review aims to (a) determine the effectiveness of multifactorial e- and mHealth interventions on CVD risk and on lifestyle-related cardiometabolic risk factors and self-management behaviours among adults without CVD; and (b) describe the evidence on adverse events and on the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Methods Methods were detailed prior to the start of the review in order to improve conduct and prevent inconsistent decision making throughout the review. This protocol was prepared following the PRISMA-P 2015 statement. MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register and CENTRAL electronic databases will be searched between 1991 and September 2019. Eligibility criteria are: (a) population: community-dwelling adults; (b) intervention/comparison: randomised controlled trials comparing e- or mHealth CVD risk preventative interventions with usual care; and (c) outcomes: modifiable CVD risk factors. Selection of study reports will involve two authors independently screening titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text review of potentially eligible reports. Two authors will independently undertake data extraction and assess risk of bias. Where appropriate, meta-analysis of outcome data will be performed. Discussion This protocol describes the pre-specified methods for a systematic review that will provide quantitative and narrative syntheses of current multifactorial e- and mHealth CVD preventative interventions. A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted following the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to PRISMA guidelines.","Direito, Artur; Rawstorn, Jonathan; Mair, Jacqueline; Daryabeygi-Khotbehsara, Reza; Maddison, Ralph; Tai, E Shyong",Digital health,https://doi.org/10.1177/2055207619890480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803491/,138

We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the treatment efficacy of dapagliflozin versus placebo in patients with type 1 diabetes. Methods We have searched PubMed, EMbase, Web of science, EBSCO and Cochrane library databases through May 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of dapagliflozin versus placebo for type 1 diabetes. This meta-analysis is performed using the random-effect model. Results Six RCTs are included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with control group for type 1 diabetes, dapagliflozin treatment shows favorable impact on glycated hemoglobin HbA1c (standard mean difference SMD=-3.93; 95% confidence interval CI =-4.44 to -3.48; P<0.00001), HbA1c reduction of ≥0.5% (risk ratio RR=1.98; 95% CI=1.65 to 2.39; P<0.00001), and fasting plasma glucose FPG (SMD=-0.93; 95% CI=-1.77 to -0.10; P=0.03).

Roma, Gypsies and Travellers are ethnic minorities who experience extreme health inequalities. OBJECTIVE To explore the experiences of cancer diagnosis, treatment and care among people who self-identify as Roma or Gypsies and Travellers. METHODS A participatory qualitative approach was taken. Peer researchers conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 37) and one focus group (n = 4) with community members in Wales and England, UK. RESULTS Cancer fatalism is declining, but Roma, Gypsies and Travellers experience barriers to cancer healthcare at service user, service provider and organisational levels. Communication was problematic for all groups, and Roma participants reported lack of access to interpreters within primary care. Clear communication and trusting relationships with health professionals are highly valued and most frequently found in tertiary care. CONCLUSION This study suggests that Roma, Gypsies and Travellers are motivated to access health care for cancer diagnosis and treatment, but barriers experienced in primary care can prevent or delay access to diagnostic and treatment services. Organisational changes, plus increased cultural competence among health professionals, have the potential to reduce inequalities in early detection of cancer.","Condon, Louise; Curejova, Jolana; Leeanne Morgan, Donna; Fenlon, Deborah",European journal of cancer care,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955101/,138

136401,Factors associated with symptomatic rhinovirus infection in patients with COPD.,2012,"OBJECTIVE The Haitian Annual Assembly of Orthopaedic Trauma (HAAOT) is an annual continuing medical education (CME) conference for Haitian orthopedists and trainees converted to a pilot virtual format in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated this virtual format's effectiveness at teaching, facilitating bilingual discussion, and encouraging cross-cultural exchange of experiences - all aimed at improving orthopedic knowledge in a low-resource country like Haiti. DESIGN Planned collaboratively between North American and Haitian colleagues, the conference involved 4 bilingual weekly Zoom meetings comprised of 4 to 6 prerecorded presentations and live-translated discussion. Pre- and postmeeting knowledge assessments in French (Haitian language of medical instruction) were administered weekly with results compared via 2-sample t-tests. An online postconference survey evaluated attendee satisfaction with the virtual format. SETTING Virtual. PARTICIPANTS Weekly attendance involved approximately 50 Haitian orthopedists and trainees, with 20 to 25 completing pre- and postmeeting assessments. RESULTS Statistically significant increases between pre/post scores were seen during 3 of 4 sessions. Session-wide significant score increases occurred for residents and attending surgeons with <10 years of experience. 85.7% of attendees reported the virtual platform exceeded expectations and 100% indicated likely or extremely likely participation in further virtual events. CONCLUSIONS The pilot virtual HAAOT was extremely well received with high desire for future sessions. Beyond short-term knowledge retention among attendees, nonmeasurable benefits included collaboration between orthopedists and trainees in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Haiti, and Burkina Faso. As COVID-19 spurs online learning in high-income nations, the successful low-resource context adjustments and local partnership underlying this model attest that travel restrictions need not impede delivery of virtual CME conferences in lower-income nations. Attendee learning and the decreased cost and travel requirements allude to this platform's sustainability and reproducibility in facilitating future international education and capacity building.

137751,The hepatocyte clock and feeding control chronophysiology of multiple liver cell types.,2020-07-30,"Approximately 13% of the total UK workforce is employed in the health and care sector. Despite substantial workforce planning efforts, the effectiveness of this planning has been criticised. Education, training, and workforce plans have typically considered each health-care profession in isolation and have not adequately responded to changing health and care needs. The results are persistent vacancies, poor morale, and low retention. Areas of particular concern highlighted in this Health Policy paper include primary care, mental health, nursing, clinical and non-clinical support, and social care. Responses to workforce shortfalls have included a high reliance on foreign and temporary staff, small-scale changes in skill mix, and enhanced recruitment drives. Impending challenges for the UK health and care workforce include growing multimorbidity, an increasing shortfall in the supply of unpaid carers, and the relative decline of the attractiveness of the National Health Service (NHS) as an employer internationally. We argue that to secure a sustainable and fit-for-purpose health and care workforce, integrated workforce approaches need to be developed alongside reforms to education and training that reflect changes in roles and skill mix, as well as the trend towards multidisciplinary working. Enhancing career development opportunities, promoting staff wellbeing, and tackling discrimination in the NHS are all needed to improve recruitment, retention, and morale of staff. An urgent priority is to offer sufficient aftercare and support to staff who have been exposed to high-risk situations and traumatic experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to growing calls to recognise and reward health and care staff, growth in pay must at least keep pace with projected rises in average earnings, which in turn will require linking future NHS funding allocations to rises in pay. Through illustrative projections, we show that, to sustain annual growth in the workforce at approximately 2·4%, increases in NHS expenditure of 4% annually in real terms will be required. Above all, a radical long-term strategic vision is needed to ensure that the future NHS workforce is fit for purpose.","Anderson, Michael; O'Neill, Ciaran; Macleod Clark, Jill; Street, Andrew; Woods, Michael; Johnston-Webber, Charlotte; Charlesworth, Anita; Whyte, Moira; Foster, Margaret; Majeed, Azeem; Pitchforth, Emma; Mossialos, Elias; Asaria, Miqdad; McGuire, Alistair",Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(21)00231-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965066/,138
137993,A review of the pathology and treatment of canine respiratory infections.,2012,"The sediment record from Lake Ohrid (Southwestern Balkans) represents the longest continuous lake archive in Europe, extending back to 1.36 Ma. We reconstruct the vegetation history based on pollen analysis of the DEEP core to reveal changes in vegetation cover and forest diversity during glacial-interglacial (G-IG) cycles and early basin development. The earliest lake phase saw a significantly different composition rich in relict tree taxa and few herbs. Subsequent establishment of a permanent steppic herb association around 1.2 Ma implies a threshold response to changes in moisture availability and temperature and gradual adjustment of the basin morphology. A change in the character of G-IG cycles during the Early-Middle Pleistocene Transition is reflected in the record by reorganization of the vegetation from obliquity- to eccentricity-paced cycles. Based on a quantitative analysis of tree taxa richness, the first large-scale decline in tree diversity occurred around 0.94 Ma. Subsequent variations in tree richness were largely driven by the amplitude and duration of G-IG cycles. Significant tree richness declines occurred in periods with abundant dry herb associations, pointing to aridity affecting tree population survival. Assessment of long-term legacy effects between global climate and regional vegetation change reveals a significant influence of cool interglacial conditions on subsequent glacial vegetation composition and diversity. This effect is contrary to observations at high latitudes, where glacial intensity is known to control subsequent interglacial vegetation, and the evidence demonstrates that the Lake Ohrid catchment functioned as a refugium for both thermophilous and temperate tree species.","Donders, Timme; Panagiotopoulos, Konstantinos; Koutsodendris, Andreas; Bertini, Adele; Mercuri, Anna Maria; Masi, Alessia; Combourieu-Nebout, Nathalie; Joannin, Sébastien; Kouli, Katerina; Kousis, Ilias; Peyron, Odile; Torri, Paola; Florenzano, Assunta; Francke, Alexander; Wagner, Bernd; Sadori, Laura",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2026111118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400496/,138

Targeting an allosteric binding pocket can allow a modulator to have protein subtype selectivity and low drug resistance. Utilizing covalent warheads further enables the modulator to increase the binding potency and extend the duration of action. This review starts with GPCR allosteric modulation to discuss the structural biology of allosteric binding pockets, the different types of allosteric modulators, as well as the advantages of employing allosteric modulation. This is followed by a discussion on covalent modulators to clarify how covalent ligands can benefit the receptor modulation and to illustrate moieties that can commonly be used as covalent warheads.

This study sought to qualitatively investigate, in inpatients with SMI, carer and staff groups, perspectives on implementing HIIT interventions for patient groups in inpatient settings. METHODS Seven focus groups and one individual interview were conducted. These included three focus groups held with inpatients with SMI (n=13), two held with carers (n=15), and two held with healthcare professionals working in inpatient settings (n=11). An additional individual interview was conducted with one patient participant. RESULTS Two key themes emerged from the data, across all participants, that reflected the 'Positivity' in the application of HIIT interventions in psychiatric inpatient settings with beliefs that it would help patients feel more relaxed, build their fitness, and provide a break from the monotony of ward environments. The second theme related to 'Implementation concerns', that reflected subthemes about i) patient motivation, ii) patient safety and iii) practical logistical factors, including having access to the right sports clothing and staff availability. LIMITATIONS Investigations were limited to one mental health service provider and participants might already be those with an interest in exercise-based interventions. CONCLUSIONS HIIT interventions for SMI inpatients were perceived positively by key stakeholders.

139730,"Absence of Neospora caninum DNA in Human Clinical Samples, Spain.",2019,"Human Interleukin-6 (hIL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates immune and inflammatory responses in addition to metabolic and regenerative processes and cancer. hIL-6 binding to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6Rα) induces homodimerization and recruitment of the glycoprotein (gp130) to form a hexameric signalling complex. Anti-IL-6 and IL-6R antibodies are clinically approved inhibitors of IL-6 signalling pathway for treating rheumatoid arthritis and Castleman's disease, respectively. There is a potential to develop novel small molecule IL-6 antagonists derived from understanding the structural basis for IL-6/IL-6Rα interactions. Here, we combine homology modelling with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the association of hIL-6 with IL-6Rα. A comparison with MD of apo hIL-6 reveals that the binding of hIL-6 to IL-6Rα induces structural and dynamic rearrangements in the AB loop region of hIL-6, disrupting intra-protein contacts and increasing the flexibility of residues 48-58 of the AB loop. In contrast, due to the involvement of residues 59-78 in forming contacts with the receptor, these residues of the AB loop are observed to rigidify in the presence of the receptor. The binary complex is primarily stabilized by two pairs of salt bridges, Arg181 (hIL-6)- Glu182 (IL-6Rα) and Arg184 (hIL-6)- Glu183 (IL-6Rα) as well as hydrophobic and aromatic stacking interactions mediated essentially by Phe residues in both proteins. An interplay of electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking interactions facilitates the formation of the hIL-6/IL-6Rα complex. This article is protected by copyright.

139964,"Growth factors, stem cells and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.",2011,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is responsible for the global corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic enters host cells via a mechanism that includes binding to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 (ACE2). Membrane-bound ACE2 is depleted as a result of this entry mechanism. The consequence is that the protective renin-angiotensin system (RAS), of which ACE2 is an essential component, is compromised through lack of production of the protective peptides angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin-(1-9), and therefore decreased stimulation of Mas (receptor Mas) and angiotensin AT2-receptors (AT2Rs), while angiotensin AT1-receptors (AT1Rs) are overstimulated due to less degradation of angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE2. The protective RAS has numerous beneficial actions, including anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulative, anti-fibrotic effects along with endothelial and neural protection; opposite to the deleterious effects caused by heightened stimulation of angiotensin AT1R. Given that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit an excessive immune response, endothelial dysfunction, increased clotting, thromboses and stroke, enhancing the activity of the protective RAS is likely beneficial. In this article, we discuss the evidence for a dysfunctional protective RAS in COVID and develop a rationale that the protective RAS imbalance in COVID-19 may be corrected by using AT2R agonists. We further review preclinical studies with AT2R agonists which suggest that AT2R stimulation may be therapeutically effective to treat COVID-19-induced disorders of various organ systems such as lung, vasculature, or the brain. Finally, we provide information on the design of a clinical trial in which patients with COVID-19 were treated with the AT2R agonist Compound 21 (C21).

Despite many efforts a specific virus responsible for canine idiopathic hepatitis has not been identified. The discovery of a viral etiology in canine hepatitis will promote the development of specific drugs and vaccines for the treatment of idiopathic hepatitis in dogs. The objective of this study was the application of the sequence-independent Virus Discovery cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (VIDISCA) technique combined with high through-put sequencing on a Roche-454 sequencer to identify unknown viruses. Liver tissue of a dog with idiopathic acute hepatitis was cultured on a canine liver cell line and the cell culture medium was submitted to the VIDISCA-454 technique. Without prior knowledge of the viral species involved, this technique identified Canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1) as the infecting agent. This demonstrates the power of VIDISCA-454 to identify viruses, independent of preliminary information about the genomic sequence. Consequently, the strategy of propagation in this cell line followed by the VIDISCA-454 technique is valuable to identify the viral etiology of idiopathic hepatitis in dogs.","van der Heijden, Mitzi; de Vries, Michel; van Steenbeek, Frank G; Favier, Robert P; Deijs, Martin; Brinkhof, Bas; Rothuizen, Jan; van der Hoek, Lia; Penning, Louis C",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.05.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22664180/,138

Lopinavir is the main responsible for viral load suppression, whereas ritonavir is a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Both of them have recently gained relevance as candidate drugs against severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, significant beneficial effects were not observed in randomized clinical trials. This review summarizes the main physical-chemical, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic properties of ritonavir and lopinavir, along with the analytical methodologies applied for biological matrices, pharmaceutical formulations, and stability studies. The work also aimed to provide a comprehensive impurity profile for the combined formulation. Several analytical methods in four different pharmacopeias and 37 articles in literature were evaluated and summarized. Chromatographic methods for these drugs frequently use C8 or C18 stationary phases with acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (with ultraviolet detection) or acetate buffer (with tandem mass spectrometry detection) as the mobile phase. Official compendia methods show disadvantages as extended total run time and complex mobile phases. HPLC tandem-mass spectrometry provided high sensitivity in methodologies applied for human plasma and serum samples, supporting the therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV patients. Ritonavir and lopinavir major degradation products arise in alkaline and acidic environments, respectively. Other non-chromatographic methods were also summarized.

Recommendations against extended VTE prophylaxis in medical patients from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in 2018 and the withholding of approval of betrixiban by the European Medicines Agency also in 2018 may have been influential in this regard. Furthermore, rivaroxaban the other drug approved for this indication in the U.S has not yet been approved in Europe. In addition, hospital administrators, those monitoring expenses in the U.S, have been reluctant to support a treatment which will mostly involve outpatients.

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. PATIENTS—PARTICIPANTS A systematic search was done. Randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials, where rhBMP-2 was used in the reconstruction of human alveolar cleft were included. INTERVENTIONS Reconstruction of alveolar cleft with rhBMP-2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Average bone volume formation and average bone height formation in the alveolar cleft. Mean difference was calculated and pooled by meta-analysis. RESULTS Of 709 identified articles, 5 studies met the inclusion criteria. The average bone volume formation was higher in the rhBMP-2 group than in the control group (61.11% vs 59.12%). The average bone height formation was higher in the control group compared to the rhBMP-2 group (75.4% vs 61.5%). The risk of bias in the selected articles was high.

Each LSN should have a variety of career stages represented with initial meetings face-to-face, but virtual meetings can then be utilised to continue the group relationship.Conclusion: LSNs can benefit all stages of a GP career, with further implementation across a larger geographical area considered and evaluated as an adjunct to formal mentoring and support already available.","Imtiaz-Umer, Shehla; Taggar, Jaspal; Allsopp, Gail","Education for primary care : an official publication of the Association of Course Organisers, National Association of GP Tutors, World Organisation of Family Doctors",https://doi.org/10.1080/14739879.2021.1897955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843478/,138
142671,Change in rotavirus epidemiology in northeast Florida after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine.,2010,"INTRODUCTION Intracranial saccular aneurysms, if untreated, carry a high risk of morbidity and mortality from intracranial bleeding. Embolization coils are the most common treatment. We describe the periprocedural safety and performance of the initial human experience with the next generation Medina Coil System. METHODS The Medina Coil System is a layered three-dimensional coil made from a radiopaque, shape set core wire, and shape memory alloy outer coil filaments. Nine aneurysms in five patients were selected for treatment with the Medina Coil System. RESULTS Nine aneurysms in five patients, ranging from 5 to 17 mm in size in various locations, were treated with the Medina Coil System. No procedural or periprocedural complications were encountered. Procedure times, number of coils used to treat the aneurysm, and use of adjunctive devices were much less than anticipated if conventional coil technology had been used. CONCLUSIONS The Medina Coil System is a next generation coil that combines all of the familiar and expected procedural safety and technique concepts associated with conventional coils. We found improved circumferential aneurysm filling, which may lead to improved long term outcomes, with fewer devices and faster operating times.","Turk, Aquilla S; Maia, Orlando; Ferreira, Christian Candido; Freitas, Diogo; Mocco, J; Hanel, Ricardo",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25628374/,138
142730,Engineered adenovirus serotypes for overcoming anti-vector immunity.,2009,"OBJECTIVE We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to address benefits and harms of using elastic compression stockings after lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis. METHODS We searched 7 electronic databases through January 15, 2015, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs)/quasi-randomized trials reporting on elastic compression stocking efficacy on postthrombotic syndrome incidence, recurrent venous thromboembolism, mortality, and acute pain after deep vein thrombosis. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed confidence in effect estimates using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. We applied random-effects meta-analysis models. RESULTS We included 5 RCTs (n = 1418) reporting on postthrombotic syndrome. The hazard ratio (HR) for postthrombotic syndrome with elastic compression stockings was 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47-1.02). We have very low confidence in this estimate due to heterogeneity and inclusion of unblinded studies at high risk of bias. Excluding high risk of bias studies, a single large RCT at low risk of bias provided moderate-quality evidence of no effect on postthrombotic syndrome (HR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.81-1.24). Moderate-quality evidence including all 5 studies suggests no effect of elastic compression stockings on recurrent venous thromboembolism (relative risk [RR] 0.88; 95% CI, 0.63-1.24) or mortality (RR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.73-1.37, 5 studies). Moderate-quality evidence from one large RCT does not suggest effect on acute pain after deep vein thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS The highest-quality evidence available suggests no effect of elastic compression stockings on postthrombotic syndrome or pain relief, from a single large RCT. However, results for preventing postthrombotic syndrome differ substantially across studies, and future guideline updates should reflect uncertainty about treatment effects. Elastic compression stockings are unlikely to prevent death or recurrent venous thromboembolism.","Berntsen, Christopher Friis; Kristiansen, Annette; Akl, Elie A; Sandset, Per Morten; Jacobsen, Eva-Marie; Guyatt, Gordon; Vandvik, Per Olav",The American journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.11.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26747198/,138
142765,Angiotensin (1-7) Inhibits Ang II-mediated ERK1/2 Activation by Stimulating MKP-1 Activation in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells.,2020,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid shift to virtual (video and telephone) delivery of mental health care, disrupting established processes for identifying people at increased risk of suicidal behavior. METHODS Following the shift to virtual care, Kaiser Permanente Washington implemented a series of workflow changes to administer standard screening and monitoring questionnaires at virtual visits and to complete structured suicide risk assessments for patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation. These new workflows included automated distribution of questionnaires via the electronic health record (EHR) patient portal and automated alerts to clinicians regarding indicators of high risk. RESULTS In March 2020, in-person mental health visits were rapidly and completely replaced by video and telephone visits. The proportion of mental health visits with completed screening and monitoring questionnaires fell from approximately 80% in early 2020 to approximately 30% in late March, then gradually recovered to approximately 60% by the end of 2020. Among patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation on monitoring questionnaires, the proportion with a recorded suicide risk assessment fell from over 90% in early 2020 to approximately 40% in late March, then gradually recovered to nearly 100% by the end of 2020. CONCLUSION Use of EHR patient portal messaging capabilities can facilitate systematic identification and assessment of suicide risk for patients receiving mental health care by telephone or video visit.","Simon, Gregory E; Stewart, Christine C; Gary, Megan C; Richards, Julie E",Joint Commission journal on quality and patient safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjq.2021.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994334/,138
142974,Detection of cryptic CCND1 rearrangements in mantle cell lymphoma by next generation sequencing.,2020-05-06,"RATIONALE Laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair is a rapidly evolving, minimally invasive treatment modality for inguinal hernia. Compared with open hernia repair, this method requires a smaller incision, has cosmetic advantages, and facilitates rapid recovery and early return to daily activities because of less postoperative pain. Because general anesthesia is essential for TEP hernia repair, it cannot be performed on patients who have an increased risk of developing complications when placed under general anesthesia. PATIENT CONCERNS We report 2 cases of single-port laparoscopic TEP (SP TEP) that were performed using only an abdominal peripheral nerve block (PNB) at our institute. General anesthesia and neuraxial block were dangerous for both patients owing to severe heart failure and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). DIAGNOSES They were diagnosed with an inguinal hernia requiring surgery. INTERVENTIONS Hence, the anesthesiologist and surgeon decided to attempt a PNB to avoid complications from general anesthesia and allow faster recovery. An ipsilateral transversus abdominis plane block as well as a rectus sheath block and inguinal canal block were administered via ultrasound guidance. OUTCOMES The patients did not report any pain, and no rescue drug was administrated. The operation times were 65 and 62minutes in patients 1 and 2, respectively. No intraoperative complications were noted. Patient 1 was discharged the day after the surgery, whereas patient 2 was discharged on the same day as the surgery. LESSONS TEP hernia repair using abdominal PNB anesthesia seemed to be a safe and feasible technique without causing any additional complications. However, the use of abdominal PNB anesthesia alone for TEP hernia repair as an alternative to general anesthesia requires further investigation using a larger cohort.","Kwon, Woojin; Bang, Seunguk; Soh, Hyojung; Jeong, Won Jun; Lee, Sang Chul; Choi, Byung Jo",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000010964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29901585/,138

Critical-sized segmental defects are challenging to treat clinically, and research efforts could benefit from a reliable, ambulatory small animal model of a segmental femoral defect. In this study, we present an optimized surgical protocol for the consistent and reproducible creation of a 5 mm critical diaphyseal defect in a rat femur stabilized with an external fixator. The diaphyseal ostectomy was performed using a custom jig to place 4 Kirschner wires bicortically, which were stabilized with an adapted external fixator device. An oscillating bone saw was used to create the defect. Either a collagen sponge alone or a collagen sponge soaked in rhBMP-2 was implanted into the defect, and the bone healing was monitored over 12 weeks using radiographs. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed, and histological analysis was performed on the excised control and treated femurs. Bone defects containing only collagen sponge resulted in non-union, while rhBMP-2 treatment yielded the formation of a periosteal callous and new bone remodeling. Animals recovered well after implantation, and external fixation proved successful in stabilizing the femoral defects over 12 weeks. This streamlined surgical model could be readily applied to study bone healing and test new orthopedic biomaterials and regenerative therapies in vivo.","Kerzner, Benjamin; Martin, Hannah L; Weiser, Michael; Fontana, Gianluca; Russell, Nicholas; Murphy, William L; Lund, Erik A; Doro, Christopher J",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/59206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30958483/,138

This is a difficult task since there is a marked variability regarding the methodology of the few, large epidemiological, and observational studies on ARDS. RECENT FINDINGS The review will mainly focus on publications from the past 18 months. We have reviewed new epidemiological studies reporting population-based incidence of ARDS. Also, we have reviewed the data on survival reported in observational and randomized controlled trials, discussed how the current ARDS definition modifies the true incidence of ARDS, and briefly mentioned recent approaches that appear to improve ARDS outcome. SUMMARY On the basis of current evidence, it seems that the incidence and overall hospital mortality of ARDS has not changed substantially in the last decade. Independent of the definition used for identification of ARDS patients, reported population-based incidence of ARDS is an order of magnitude lower in Europe than in the USA. Current hospital mortality of combined moderate and severe ARDS reported in observational studies is greater than 40%.","Villar, Jesús; Blanco, Jesús; Kacmarek, Robert M",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26645551/,138

144173,Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Gain Suppressive Function during Neonatal Bacterial Sepsis.,2021-06-30,"Background Every anatomical lung resection requires the airtight closure of at least one bronchus. In current clinical practice, these bronchi are sealed with sutures or staplers. This study investigated in an ex vivo pig model whether a new bipolar sealing device MARSEAL (KLS Martin, Tuttlingen, Germany) could be an alternative for this purpose. Methods Complete bronchial trees were prepared free from pig heart-lung blocks that were removed at a slaughterhouse. These preparations were taken to the laboratory, and main, lobar, and segmental bronchi were closed using sutures, staples, or bipolar sealing. Each trachea was then intubated and connected to a ventilating device. The initial airtight closure of the bronchus was first tested with lung-protective ventilation. After 15 minutes of ventilation, the inspiratory ventilation pressure was slowly increased and the burst pressure (in mbar) was recorded. Each group included 12 bronchus closures. Group mean burst pressures were compared using a nonparametric test (Mann-Whitney U test). The significance level was p < 0.05. Results The main bronchi closed both stapler magazines or sutures were all initially airtight during ventilation. The mean burst pressure was 60 ± 0 mbar for staplers and 57.92 ± 5.8 mbar for sutures. In contrast, 50% of main bronchi sealed with MARSEAL devices (5 or 10 mm) leaked air from the beginning. This was also noted in all lobar bronchi sealed with the MARSEAL 5-mm device and 80% of those sealed with the MARSEAL 10-mm device. The mean burst pressure of initially airtight lobar bronchi was 12.7 ± 7.25 mbar. In contrast, all segmental bronchi (mean width: 1.6 cm) were airtight when ventilated. Mean burst pressure was 14.64 ± 9.1 mbar with the MARSEAL 5-mm device and 29.64 ± 21.3 mbar with the MARSEAL 10-mm device. Histological investigation of the preparations (with hematoxylin and eosin staining) showed intact cartilaginous structures that were largely unaffected by bipolar coagulation. The airtight sealing of the segmental bronchi resulted from fusion of the peribronchial tissue and not the cartilage. Conclusion Bipolar sealing is an inappropriate tool for the closure of the bronchi in comparison to suture or stapling.","Kirschbaum, Andreas; Waubke, Katharina; Pehl, Anika; Steinfeldt, Thorsten; Bartsch, Detlef K",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0036-1584951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27380379/,138

145232,Reversal of sepsis-induced T cell dysfunction: OX-40 to the rescue?,2020-09-29,"Background Sepsis is a global health priority. Interventions to reduce the burden of sepsis need to be both effective and cost-effective. We performed a systematic review of the literature on health economic evaluations of sepsis treatments in critically ill adult patients and summarised the evidence for cost-effectiveness. Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library using thesaurus (e.g. MeSH) and free-text terms related to sepsis and economic evaluations. We included all articles that reported, in any language, an economic evaluation of an intervention for the management of sepsis in critically ill adult patients. Data extracted included study details, intervention details, economic evaluation methodology, and outcomes. Included studies were appraised for reporting quality using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Results We identified 50 records representing 46 economic evaluations for a variety of interventions including antibiotics (n = 5), fluid therapy (n = 2), early goal-directed therapy and other resuscitation protocols (n = 8), immunoglobulins (n = 2), and interventions no longer in clinical use such as monoclonal antibodies (n = 7) and drotrecogin alfa (n = 13). Twelve (26%) evaluations were of excellent reporting quality. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from dominant (lower costs and higher effectiveness) for early goal-directed therapy, albumin, and a multifaceted sepsis education program to dominated (higher costs and lower effectiveness) for polymerase chain reaction assays (LightCycler SeptiFast testing MGRADE®, SepsiTest™, and IRIDICA BAC BSI assay). ICERs varied widely across evaluations, particularly in subgroup analyses. Conclusions There is wide variation in the cost-effectiveness of sepsis interventions. There remain important gaps in the literature, with no economic evaluations identified for several interventions routinely used in sepsis. Given the high economic and social burden of sepsis, high-quality economic evaluations are needed to increase our understanding of the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in routine clinical practice and to inform decision makers.

Hybrid NOTES (hNOTES) has some potential advantages for treating rectal cancer. METHODS Between May 2013 and November 2013, a total of 20 patients (11 males) who received hNOTES at two institutes participating in the study were documented and reviewed. Surgical outcomes, including complications and pathological outcomes, were analyzed. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 57.8 ± 10.1 years (range 34-78). Eleven patients received preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, with the mean distance between tumor and anal verge being 5.9 ± 1.7 cm (mean 2-8). The mean estimated intraoperative blood loss was 68 ± 106 ml (range 30-500), with one case converted to open procedure due to uncontrolled bleeding. Eight cases underwent simultaneous two-team approach. The mean operative time was 200.8 ± 47.7 min (range 110-285). Circular stapling was performed for 14 cases (70 %) as the anastomosis, and protective stoma performed for 17 cases (85 %). The overall postoperative complication rate was 25 %. Two cases (10 %) develop pelvic abscess due to leakage, which were controlled by medical treatments. The distal and circumferential margins were all free of tumor cells, and the mean distal margin length was 2.4 ± 0.98 cm (range 0.5-4). CONCLUSIONS Hybrid NOTES for rectal cancer is safe and feasible. Rapid experience-building accelerates its evolution, as reflected here by the high stapling rate and the idea of a two-team approach. It has the potential to become an option of treating rectal cancers.","Chen, Chien-Chih; Lai, Yi-Ling; Jiang, Jeng-Kae; Chu, Chun-Ho; Huang, I-Ping; Chen, Wei-Shone; Cheng, Andy Yi-Ming; Yang, Shung-Haur",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3659-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986014/,138

145886,Updating the epidemiological transition model.,2018,"BACKGROUND LSG is widely accepted as a definitive treatment for obesity. Due to lack of large series with long-term follow-up, disagreement remains regarding its safety and efficacy. We present a series of 1020 consecutive LSGs performed with long-term follow-up. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was conducted on patients who underwent LSG from January 2005 to February 2014. Data included weight, height, BMI, ideal body weight, comorbid conditions, intraoperative complications, mean length of hospital stay (LOS), early (<30 days) readmission, early and late (>30 days) postoperative complications, and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL). RESULTS Of the 1020 patients, 66.6 % (n = 679) were female, with a mean age of 38.4 ± 16.5 years. Mean BMI at the time of first visit was 43.4 ± 5.8 kg/m(2). The most common comorbid conditions identified were diabetes mellitus (89.4 %), sleep apnea (86.4 %), hypertension (80.3 %), and hyperlipidemia (70 %). Over the entire follow-up period, 57 % of diabetic patients experienced significant improvement or remission. There was no mortality in this series. Early postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery included leak in 0.1 % (n = 1), stricture in 0.1 % (n = 1), emesis in 23 % (n = 234), dehydration in 19 % (n = 194), prolonged ileus in 18 % (183), and self-limited bleeding in 3 % (n = 30). Mean LOS was of 3.4 ± 2.1 days, with a 3.8 % overall rate of early readmissions. Long-term morbidity was found in 3.9 % of patients (n = 40) and included stricture in 0.49 % (n = 5) and GERD in 6 % (n = 61). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0 %. Mean %EWL at 3 months to 1, 3, 5, and 8 years was 72 ± 16.8, 86 ± 22.3, 63 ± 19, 61 ± 11, and 52 ± 9.2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms that LSG is safe and has very low rates of early and long-term complications when compared to other well-established procedures.

METHODS Between November 2013 and December 2016, a total of 57 patients who presented with carotid siphon aneurysms were treated with the Willis covered stent. Results of the procedures, technical events, and complications were recorded. Clinical and imaging follow-ups were performed at 3 months following the endovascular procedures. RESULTS Placement of the Willis covered stent was successful in all patients. Immediate angiography revealed complete exclusion of aneurysms in 48 patients (84%), while endoleak occurred in nine patients (16%). Procedure-related complications occurred in three cases, including displacement of the covered stent in one patient, acute in-stent thrombosis in one patient, and microwire-related intracranial hemorrhage in one patient. Angiographic follow-ups were done in 49 patients, with complete exclusion of aneurysms in 47 patients. Endoleak was present in two patients. No aneurysm recurrence occurred. Forty-four patients showed good parent artery patency, while the other five patients showed mild to moderate asymptomatic in-stent stenosis. During the follow-up period, no ischemic or hemorrhagic event occurred. The modified Rankin Scale scores at follow-up were 0-2 in 56 patients and >2 in one patient. CONCLUSIONS The treatment of siphon aneurysms with Willis covered stent implantation resulted in satisfactory clinical outcomes. The Willis covered stent seems safe and feasible for the treatment of siphon aneurysms, which still needs to be confirmed by longer follow-up periods and controlled studies with larger samples.","Ma, Lin; Xu, Ji-Chong; Yan, Shuo; Feng, Hao; Han, Hong-Jie; Tan, Hua-Qiao; Fang, Chun; Huang, Hong-En",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29680819/,138

One-hundred trending videos were identified from the hashtag #covidvaccine and were coded for content. Collectively, these videos garnered over 35 million views. The coding category with the highest number of videos was ""Discouraged a Vaccine"" (n = 38), followed by ""Encouraged a Vaccine"" (n = 36). While only 36 videos encouraged a vaccine, these videos garnered over 50% of the total cumulative views and just under 50% of the total likes; the 38 videos that discouraged a vaccine garnered 39.6% of the total cumulative views, 44.3% of likes, and 47.4% of comments.

147203,Exposure to bushfire and biomass smoke and the risk of bacterial and viral lung infection.,2020-07-13,"Injury to descending autonomic (sympathetic) pathways is common after high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) and associated with abnormal blood pressure and heart rate regulation. In individuals with high-level SCI, abnormal sympathovagal balance (such as during autonomic dysreflexia; paroxysmal hypertension provoked by sensory stimuli below the injury) is proarrhythmogenic. Exercise training is a key component of SCI rehabilitation and management of cardiovascular disease risk, but it is unclear whether exercise training influences susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia. We aimed to evaluate: (i) whether susceptibility to arrhythmia increases in a rodent-model of SCI; (ii) the impact of the sympathomimetic drug dobutamine (DOB) on arrhythmia risk; (iii) whether exercise training ameliorates arrhythmia risk. Twenty-one Wistar rats were divided into 3 subgroups: T2-contusive SCI (T2, n = 7), T2-contusive SCI completing passive hindlimb cycling training (PHLC, n = 7), and T10-contusive SCI (T10, n = 7). Known electrocardiographic arrhythmia markers and heart rate variability parameters were evaluated before (PRE), 1-week (POST) and 5-weeks post-SCI (TERM) at baseline and during DOB infusion (30 μg/kg/min). Baseline markers of arrhythmia risk were increased in both T2 and T10 animals. DOB decreased R-R interval (p < 0.001), and increased markers of risk for ventricular arrhythmia, particularly in high-level (T2) animals (p < 0.05). Exercise training blunted the exacerbation of markers of arrhythmia risk in the presence of DOB. Markers of risk for cardiac arrhythmia are increased in experimental SCI, and DOB further increases arrhythmia risk in high-level SCI. Exercise training did not improve markers of arrhythmia risk at rest, but did ameliorate markers of arrhythmia risk during sympathetic stimulation.","Lucci, Vera-Ellen M; Harrison, Emma L; DeVeau, Kathryn M; Harman, Kathryn A; Squair, Jordan W; Krassioukov, Andrei; Magnuson, David S K; West, Christopher R; Claydon, Victoria E",Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autneu.2021.102867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399294/,138

Although various mechanical, biological, and synthetic aids have been used to reduce the risk of POPF, none have a proven benefit. MATERIALS AND METHODS The authors describe (and present a video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/SLE/A256) a novel technique in which the autologous falciform ligament was harvested, wrapped around the pancreas at the site of proposed pancreatic transection, and secured with sutures to buttress the pancreatic transection staple line. The pancreas was then transected with a triple-row stapler. RESULTS Two male patients aged 40 and 57 years each with a 4.3 and 4.2 cm solid mass in the body of the pancreas respectively underwent laparoscopic anterior radical antegrade modular pancreaticosplenectomy, the former patient underwent an en block transverse colectomy for suspected malignancy. Both patients had soft pancreata. They experienced no POPF, made an uneventful recovery, and were discharged from the hospital on the second and fourth postoperative days, respectively. No pancreatic complications were encountered at 5 and 6 months follow-up, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The use of the falciform ligament to buttress the staple line at the time of pancreatic transection is a novel technique. Its potential benefit in reducing the risk of POPF warrants further assessment.","Ammori, Basil J","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941356/,138

Since emergent treatment of tandem lesions has not been specifically addressed in randomized trials, there is an absence of standardized management. OBJECTIVE We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of acute endovascular treatment in stroke due to tandem occlusions in our center and compare the results with previous reports. METHODS From a prospective registry we analyzed data of 99 consecutive patients (males: 77.7%, mean age ± SD: 67.5 ± 9.5 years) with stroke due to tandem occlusions who underwent treatment with emergent carotid stenting and intracranial mechanical thrombectomy. Successful recanalization was defined as a TICI score of 2b-3 and a good functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score ≤2 at 90 days. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) was considered when associated with worsening on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (≥4 points). RESULTS A successful recanalization rate was achieved in 87.8 and 48.5% of the patients had a good functional outcome. sICH and mortality rates were 12.1 and 20.2%, respectively, and 21.2% of the patients received combined treatment with intravenous thrombolysis, which did not affect neither the prognosis nor the recanalization or sICH rates. The time from symptom onset to recanalization and the degree of recanalization were the main factors associated with prognosis and the occurrence of sICH. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that endovascular treatment with emergent carotid stenting and intracranial thrombectomy in patients with acute stroke due to tandem occlusions is an effective and safe procedure.","Fernández Menéndez, Santiago; Murias Quintana, Eduardo; Vega Valdés, Pedro; Morales Deza, Edison; López-Cancio, Elena; Benavente Fernández, Lorena; González Delgado, Montserrat; Rico-Santos, Maria; Calleja Puerta, Sergio; Larrosa Campo, Davinia",Cerebrovascular diseases extra,https://doi.org/10.1159/000507919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32580191/,138

Using a cross-sectional, anonymous survey, we examined patterns of naturalistic CBD use among individuals with fibromyalgia (FM) and other chronic pain conditions. Our objective was to better understand rates of CBD use, reasons for use and discontinuation, communication with healthcare professionals about CBD, and perceptions of CBD effectiveness and safety among people with FM. After excluding incomplete surveys, our study population consisted of N = 2701 participants with fibromyalgia, primarily in the United States. Overall, 38.1% reported never using CBD, 29.4% reported past CBD use, and 32.4% reported current CBD use. Past-year cannabis use was strongly associated with past or current CBD use. Those using CBD typically did so due to inadequate symptom relief, while those not using CBD typically cited safety concerns as their reason for not using CBD. Two-thirds of participants disclosed CBD use to their physician, although only 33% asked for physician advice on using CBD. Participants used CBD for numerous FM-related symptoms (most commonly pain), and generally reported slight to much improvement across symptom domains. Around half of participants reported side effects, which were typically minor. Our findings are limited by selection bias and our cross-sectional design, which prevents causal associations. In conclusion, CBD use is common among individuals with FM and many individuals using CBD report improvements across numerous FM-related symptoms. Our findings highlight the need for additional rigorous studies to better understand CBD's potential for FM management. Perspective: This article indicates that that CBD use is common among people with fibromyalgia, and the results suggest that many derive benefit from using CBD across multiple symptoms domains. Clinicians should discuss CBD use with fibromyalgia patients, and future studies are needed to rigorously assess CBD's therapeutic value for fibromyalgia symptoms.","Boehnke, Kevin F; Gagnier, Joel J; Matallana, Lynne; Williams, David A",The journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2020.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400996/,138

Recent studies in neuroscience highlighted the important role of touch for the control of hand movement while reaching for a target. We present a novel device, the HaptiTrack device, to physically decouple tactile slip motion and hand movements. The new device generates precisely controlled 2D motion of a contact plate, measures contact forces, and provides hand and finger tracking through an external tracking system. By means of a control algorithm described in this manuscript, the velocity of tactile slip can be changed independently from the velocity of the hand sliding on the device's surface. Due to these multiple features, the device can be a powerful tool for the evaluation of tactile sense during hand reaching movements in healthy and pathological conditions.","Ciotti, Simone; Ryan, Colleen Patricia; Bianchi, Matteo; Lacquaniti, Francesco; Moscatelli, Alessandro",IEEE transactions on haptics,https://doi.org/10.1109/toh.2021.3075024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886474/,138

This review summarizes the existing literature regarding this issue, identifies gaps in current knowledge, and suggests opportunities for future research. In humans, host characteristics including age, sex, comorbidities, smoking, and pregnancy are associated with severe COVID-19. Similarly in animals, host factors are strong determinants of disease severity although most animal infection models manifest clinically with mild to moderate respiratory disease. The influence of variants of concern as it relates to minimal infectious dose, consequence of overall pathogenicity, and disease outcome in dose-response remain unknown. Epidemiologic data suggest a dose-response relationship for infection contrasting with limited and inconsistent surrogate-based evidence between dose and disease severity. Recommendations include the design of future infection studies in animal models to investigate inoculating dose on outcomes and the use of better proxies for dose in human epidemiology studies.","Brosseau, Lisa M; Escandón, Kevin; Ulrich, Angela K; Rasmussen, Angela L; Roy, Chad J; Bix, Gregory J; Popescu, Saskia V; Moore, Kristine; Osterholm, Michael T",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651164/,138

METHODS Adolescents (N = 51) completed measures at baseline, post-treatment (N = 45), and 6 months later (N = 39). RESULTS Adolescents were geographically diverse, 41% female, and 76% White. Adolescents randomized to the intervention had greater improvements from baseline to post-test in stress compared to those in control; these were maintained through 6 months. Those randomized to intervention also reported greater improvement in life satisfaction from baseline to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS The NF tailored mind-body program resulted in sustained reduction in stress and improved life satisfaction.

Some patients in the US have developed delayed localized cutaneous vaccine reactions that have been dubbed ""COVID arm."" Objective To describe the course of localized cutaneous injection-site reactions to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, subsequent reactions to the second vaccine dose, and to characterize the findings of histopathologic examination of the reaction. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective case series study was performed at Yale New Haven Hospital, a tertiary medical center in New Haven, Connecticut, with 16 patients referred with localized cutaneous injection-site reactions from January 20 through February 12, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures We collected each patient's demographic information, a brief relevant medical history, clinical course, and treatment (if any); and considered the findings of a histopathologic examination of 1 skin biopsy specimen. Results Of 16 patients (median [range] age, 38 [25-89] years; 13 [81%] women), 14 patients self-identified as White and 2 as Asian. The delayed localized cutaneous reactions developed in a median (range) of 7 (2-12) days after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. These reactions occurred at or near the injection site and were described as pruritic, painful, and edematous pink plaques. None of the participants had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Results of a skin biopsy specimen demonstrated a mild predominantly perivascular mixed infiltrate with lymphocytes and eosinophils, consistent with a dermal hypersensitivity reaction. Of participants who had a reaction to first vaccine dose (15 of 16 patients), most (11 patients) developed a similar localized injection-site reaction to the second vaccine dose; most (10 patients) also developed the second reaction sooner as compared with the first-dose reaction. Conclusions and Relevance Clinical and histopathologic findings of this case series study indicate that the localized injection-site reactions to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. These reactions may occur sooner after the second dose, but they are self-limited and not associated with serious vaccine adverse effects. In contrast to immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, urticaria), these delayed reactions (dubbed ""COVID arm"") are not a contraindication to subsequent vaccination.","Johnston, Margaret S; Galan, Anjela; Watsky, Kalman L; Little, Alicia J",JAMA dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamadermatol.2021.1214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33978670/,138

METHODS Retrospective/prospective study conducted in a hepatic transplant unit from 2009 to 2019. LT recipients with CMV specific or suggestive elements in histopathology of hepatic biopsies were included. Immunohistochemistry (IHQ) was performed in tissue samples of the studied cohort as well as in a control one. RESULTS 41 patients met the inclusion criteria. IHQ was diagnostic in 6 (14.6%), and was negative in 100% of the control population. The negative predictive value of the histopathology for CMV hepatitis diagnosis was 100% and the positive predictive value was 14.6%. 85% of patients in whom the IHQ was negative had alternative diagnosis Antiviral therapy in the retrospective analysis was indicated in 48% of patients and in 21% of the prospectively analyzed cohort. CONCLUSIONS Histopathology and IHQ combination improves the diagnostic accuracy of CMV hepatitis which translates into a rational us of expensive antiviral therapy and to search for differential diagnosis.","Prieto, Jimena; Masllorens, Ana; Ardao, Gonzalo; Machado, Viviana; López, Martin; Gerona, Solange; Medina, Julio",Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,https://doi.org/10.4067/s0716-10182020000500531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399800/,138

However, the GPL has only been described once in the literature, in 1985. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of the GPL during LSG, describe this structure and assess its effect on the surgical technique. All patients undergoing primary LSG in our institution (n = 240) and patients referred for gastric fistula (GF) after primary LSG (n = 18) between January 2015 and December 2015 were included. The primary endpoint was the incidence of a GPL during primary LSG. The secondary endpoints were the postoperative complication rate, the postoperative GF rate, and the presence of this ligament during reoperation for GF. Among the 240 patients, a GPL was visible in 49 cases (20.4%) and was described as thin in 34 of these (69.4%). Twelve postoperative complications (5%) were observed, including seven major (2.9%). The GF rate was 2% (n = 5), not requiring reoperation. The gastric stenosis rate was 0.4% (n = 1). The GPL had been previously sectioned in one of the five patients (20%) with postoperative GF. During the study period, 18 patients were referred for GF and 14 were reoperated. A non-sectioned GPL, not described in the operating report, was observed in four patients (28.5%). A GPL was identified in 20.4% of cases. Identification of a GPL could be important in the context of LSG, as section of the ligament allows tension-free stapling to be performed and can therefore possibly reduce the risk of postoperative complications, particularly GF.

However, few studies have examined influenza vaccination uptake among adult Japanese patients with cancer; their attitudes toward vaccination, as well as factors related to vaccine hesitancy, are unclear. From September 1 to October 31, 2020, we disseminated a web-based questionnaire to patients with a history of cancer via snowball sampling through e-mails and social media of two Japanese cancer patients associations. A total of 163 surveys were completed. One hundred (61.3%) participants received an influenza vaccination in the 2019/2020 season, and the main reasons for vaccination were as follows: recommendation by medical professionals, positive awareness of vaccination through books or the internet, and provision of vaccination in the workplace. The main reasons for not receiving a vaccination were fear of adverse events, lack of concern about influenza infection, and lack of trust in vaccine effectiveness. In terms of the 2020/2021 season, 120 participants (73.6%) reported their intention to receive an influenza vaccination. Multiple regression analysis showed that significant factors for positive intention were the the treatment without chemotherapy (p = .009), vaccination history in the 2019/2020 season (p < .001), prior experience of influenza infection (p = .043), and the perception that influenza vaccination was more important due to the coronavirus disease pandemic (p = .050). This preliminary survey revealed a relatively modest influenza vaccine coverage among adult Japanese patients with cancer and identified several factors related to positive intention toward vaccination.","Kosaka, Makoto; Kotera, Yasuhiro; Tsuda, Kenji; Takahashi, Kenzo; Hamaki, Tamae; Kusumi, Eiji; Kami, Masahiro; Tanimoto, Tetsuya",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1977569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34613867/,138

MATERIALS AND METHODS Three-dimensional (3D) gradient-recalled echo (GRE) T1W images were obtained on a 3T MR imaging scanner after RF ablations (n = 14) of in vitro blood-perfused bovine livers. The resulting central hypointense and peripheral hyperintense signal regions were measured and compared with the inner tan and outer red zones of the gross specimen. Corresponding ablated hepatic tissue samples were examined microscopically and stained with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to assess for the presence or absence of NADPH diaphorase activity. Bootstrap two-sample hypothesis tests were used to compare MR imaging, gross, and histopathologic measurements. RESULTS The MR imaging inner ablation zone had a mean radius of 0.80 cm (range 0.33-1.14 cm); the inner zone plus the outer ablation zone had a mean radius of 1.40 cm (range 1.01-1.74 cm). Comparison of the measurements of the inner ablation zone on MR imaging versus the gross specimen showed equivalence (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.122 cm, 0.223 cm). Comparison of the measurements of the outer ablation zone on MR imaging versus the gross and histologic specimens also showed equivalence (95% CI -0.095 cm, 0.244 cm, and -0.146 cm, 0.142 cm).

Long-term treatment with azithromycin may help achieve this. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of azithromycin in reducing exacerbations in asthma, and the sub-phenotypes of non-eosinophilic asthma, eosinophilic asthma and severe asthma. METHOD We completed a systematic search of EMBASE, Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrails.gov and reference lists of previous systematic reviews in February 2019. We included parallel-group double-blind randomised controlled trials in adults comparing at least 8 weeks of azithromycin treatment with placebo, where the outcome of exacerbations was assessed over at least 6 months. Data were extracted from published sources, Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied and IPD were sought from authors. Reviews were undertaken in duplicate. We conducted an IPD meta-analysis on the primary outcome of exacerbations and a random effects meta-analysis for secondary outcomes. PROSPERO registration: CRD42018075259. RESULTS Three studies were identified (N=597). In the IPD meta-analysis, treatment with azithromycin was associated with a reduced rate of exacerbations (oral corticosteroid course due to worsening asthma, antibiotic use for lower respiratory tract infection, hospitalisation, and/or emergency room visits) in asthma and in the non-eosinophilic, eosinophilic and severe asthma subgroups. Examining each exacerbation type separately, patients with eosinophilic asthma reported fewer oral corticosteroids courses and patients with non-eosinophilic and severe asthma reported fewer antibiotic courses. Azithromycin was well tolerated.

155623,Production of adenovirus vectors and their use as a delivery system for influenza vaccines.,2010,"BACKGROUND Ischemic water uptake in acute stroke is a reliable indicator of lesion age. Nevertheless, inter-individually varying edema progression has been observed and elevated water uptake has recently been described as predictor of malignant infarction. AIMS We hypothesized that early-elevated lesion water uptake indicates accelerated ""tissue clock"" desynchronized with ""time clock"" and therefore predicts poor clinical outcome despite successful recanalization. METHODS Acute middle cerebral artery stroke patients with multimodal admission-CT who received successful thrombectomy (TICI 2b/3) were analyzed. Net water uptake (NWU), a quantitative imaging biomarker of ischemic edema, was determined in admission-CT and tested as predictor of clinical outcome using modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after 90 days. A binary outcome was defined for mRS 0-4 and mRS 5-6. RESULTS Seventy-two patients were included. The mean NWU (SD) in patients with mRS 0-4 was lower compared to patients with mRS 5-6 (5.0% vs. 12.1%; p < 0.001) with similar time from symptom onset to imaging (2.6 h vs. 2.4 h; p = 0.7). Based on receiver operating curve analysis, NWU above 10% identified patients with very poor outcome with high discriminative power (AUC 0.85), followed by Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) (AUC: 0.72) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (AUC: 0.72). CONCLUSIONS Quantitative NWU may serve as an indicator of ""tissue clock"" and pronounced early brain edema with elevated NWU might suggest a desynchronized ""tissue clock"" with real ""time clock"" and therefore predict futile recanalization with poor clinical outcome.","Nawabi, Jawed; Flottmann, Fabian; Kemmling, Andre; Kniep, Helge; Leischner, Hannes; Sporns, Peter; Schön, Gerhard; Hanning, Uta; Thomalla, Götz; Fiehler, Jens; Broocks, Gabriel",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493019884522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657283/,138

In the present study, we demonstrate that NS1 of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/Duck/Hubei/L-1/2004 (H5N1) virus interacts with human Ubc9, which is the E2 conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, and we show that SUMO1 is conjugated to H5N1 NS1 in both transfected and infected cells. Furthermore, two lysine residues in the C terminus of NS1 were identified as SUMO1 acceptor sites. When the SUMO1 acceptor sites were removed by mutation, NS1 underwent rapid degradation. Studies of different influenza A virus strains of human and avian origin showed that the majority of viruses possess an NS1 protein that is modified by SUMO1, except for the recently emerged swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV) (H1N1). Interestingly, growth of a sumoylation-deficient WSN virus mutant was retarded compared to that of wild-type virus. Together, these results indicate that sumoylation enhances NS1 stability and thus promotes rapid growth of influenza A virus.","Xu, Ke; Klenk, Christoph; Liu, Bin; Keiner, Bjoern; Cheng, Jinke; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Li, Li; Han, Qinglin; Wang, Chen; Li, Tianxian; Chen, Ze; Shu, Yuelong; Liu, Jinhua; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Sun, Bing",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00877-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21047957/,138

The optimal method for radiographic follow-up of patients treated with flow diverters has not been established. The rate and clinical implications of in-stent stenosis for these devices is unclear. We evaluate the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) for follow-up of in-stent stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed 28 patients treated with the Pipeline embolization device (PED) over the course of 42 months from January 2009 to June 2012. Standard conventional cerebral angiograms were performed in all patients. TCD studies were available in 23 patients. RESULTS Angiographic and TCD results were compared and found to correlate well.

We searched for severe pneumonia in the village and hospitals. We interviewed patients and family members about exposures. We tested acute and convalescent sera for antigen and antibody of severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and plague. The only common exposure of the five patients was riding together in the enclosed cab of a truck for 1.5 hours while taking the first patient to the hospital. Seroconversion to plague F1 antigen confirmed plague in three survivors. Unfamiliarity of clinicians with plague and lack of sputum examination, blood culture, or postmortem examination delayed the diagnosis. No plague cases occurred among family and village contacts and health care workers. High infectivity in this cluster was limited to a crowded, poorly ventilated truck.","Luo, Huiming; Dong, Xingqi; Li, Furong; Xie, Xu; Song, Zhizhong; Shao, Zhujun; Li, Zhongjie; Tong, Zhaohui; Wang, Guangfa; Zhang, Hongtao; Yang, Tielong; He, Gao; He, Zeyuan; Fontaine, Robert E; Zeng, Guang",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.12-0163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23509116/,138

However, concerns for the patency of eloquent branch arteries covered by the Pipeline Embolization Device have been raised. We aimed to examine the patency of the anterior choroidal artery and clinical sequelae after ICA aneurysm treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively analyzed all patients among our first 157 patients with ICA aneurysms treated by the Pipeline Embolization Device who required placement of at least 1 device across the ostium of the anterior choroidal artery. The primary outcome measure was angiographic patency of the anterior choroidal artery at last follow-up. Age, sex, type of aneurysm, neurologic examination data, number of Pipeline Embolization Devices used, relationship of the anterior choroidal artery to the aneurysm, and completeness of aneurysm occlusion on follow-up angiograms were also analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-nine aneurysms requiring placement of at least 1 Pipeline Embolization Device (median = 1, range = 1-3) across the anterior choroidal artery ostium were identified. At angiographic follow-up (mean = 15.1 months; range = 12-39 months), the anterior choroidal artery remained patent, with antegrade flow in 28/29 aneurysms (96.5%), while 24/29 (82.7%) of the target aneurysms were angiographically occluded by 1-year follow-up angiography. Anterior choroidal artery occlusion, with retrograde reconstitution of the vessel, was noted in a single case. A significant correlation between the origin of the anterior choroidal artery from the aneurysm dome and failure of the aneurysms to occlude following treatment was found. CONCLUSIONS After placement of 36 Pipeline Embolization Devices across 29 anterior choroidal arteries (median = 1 device, range = 1-3 devices), 1 of 29 anterior choroidal arteries was found occluded on angiographic follow-up. The vessel occlusion did not result in persistent clinical sequelae. Coverage of the anterior choroidal artery origin with the Pipeline Embolization Device, hence, may be considered reasonably safe when deemed necessary for aneurysm treatment.","Raz, E; Shapiro, M; Becske, T; Zumofen, D W; Tanweer, O; Potts, M B; Riina, H A; Nelson, P K",AJNR.

To this end, the Chinese government promulgated the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (the Action Plan) in 2013. However, the health benefits of the Action Plan have not been well explained. In this paper, the underlying causes of changes in premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 pollution and the response of this mitigation policy in China were explored using sensitivity analysis. The simulated annual average PM2.5 concentration reduced by 24.9% over mainland China from 2008 to 2016. Subsequently, national premature mortality would decrease by 14.4% from 1.14 million (95% CI: 0.54, 1.55) in 2008 to 0.98 million (95% CI: 0.44, 1.38) in 2016. Specifically, premature mortality reduced by 209,600 cases (-18.3%) owing to PM2.5 reduction during 2008-2016, of which 188,500 cases were from 2014 to 2016 due to the Action Plan in 2013. Note that the health benefits were limited when compared with air quality improvements, mainly due to that the IER functions have a stable curve at higher concentration intervals. Meanwhile, premature mortality would have increased by 14.2% from 2008 to 2016 owing to demographic changes, substantially weakening the impact of the decrease in PM2.5 and baseline mortality. The effectiveness of China's new air pollution mitigation policy was proved through the research. However, considering the non-linear response of mortality to PM2.5 changes and the aggravation of demography trends, stronger emission control steps should be further taken to protect public health in China.","Li, Yong; Liao, Qin; Zhao, Xiuge; Tao, Yan; Bai, Yun; Peng, Lu",Chemosphere,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818847/,138

159528,"A simple LC-MS method for the determination of iohexol and iothalamate in serum, using ioversol as an internal standard.",2016,"Habitats are changing rapidly around the globe and urbanization is one of the primary drivers. Urbanization changes food availability, environmental stressors, and the prevalence of disease for many species. These changes can lead to divergence in phenotypic traits, including behavioral, physiological, and morphological features between urban and rural populations. Recent research highlights that urbanization is also changing the gut microbial communities found in a diverse group of host species. These changes have not been uniform, leaving uncertainty as to how urban habitats are shaping gut microbial communities. To better understand these effects, we investigated the gut bacterial communities of White-Crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) populations along an urbanization gradient in the San Francisco Bay area. We examined how gut bacterial communities vary with the local environment and host morphological characteristics. We found direct effects of environmental factors, including urban noise levels and territory land cover, as well as indirect effects through body size and condition, on alpha and beta diversity of gut microbial communities. We also found that urban and rural birds' microbiomes differed in which variables predicted their diversity, with urban communities driven by host morphology, and rural communities driven by environmental factors. Elucidating these effects provides a better understanding of how urbanization affects wild avian physiology.","Berlow, Mae; Phillips, Jennifer N; Derryberry, Elizabeth P",Microbial ecology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01569-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803364/,138

We compared the results of a technique that we developed with SILC. MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty-four patients who were diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis were prospectively randomized and divided into two groups. An additional 5-mm port (MCAP: with an additional port using a multi-channel device through the umbilicus) was placed in the subxiphoid area instead of a transabdominal suspension suture in one group of patients. The other group was operated on with the SILC technique. The demographic and surgical data of the patients were compared. RESULTS The MCAP technique shortened the surgery duration by more than half (MCAP: 35.0±12.3, SILC: 79.1±27.7 min) (p<0.05). No difference was found between the two methods in terms of estimated blood loss, length of hospitalization, postoperative day 1 and 7 visual analog scale scores, need for analgesia in the postoperative period, and rate of changing to another technique due to inadequacy of the surgical technique. CONCLUSION MCAP is as safe as SILC for cholecystectomy and is easier for the surgeon to perform.","Sülü, Barlas; Diken, Tülay; Altun, Hasan; Anuk, Turgut; Güvendi, Bülent; İlingi, Elif; Eren, Musa Sinan; Günerhan, Yusuf; Köksal, Neşet",Ulusal cerrahi dergisi,https://doi.org/10.5152/ucd.2014.2717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25931927/,138

The objective of this study was to use gene set enrichment analysis of SNP data (GSEA-SNP) and a network analysis (ingenuity pathway analysis) to identify gene sets, genes within gene sets (leading-edge genes) and upstream regulators associated with BRD in pre-weaned dairy calves and beef feedlot cattle. BRD cases and controls were diagnosed using the McGuirk health scoring system. Holstein calves were sampled from commercial calf-raising facilities in California (1003 cases and 1011 controls) and New Mexico (376 cases and 372 controls). Commercial feedlot cattle were sampled from Colorado (500 cases and 499 controls) and Washington (504 cases and 497 controls). There were 102 and 237 unique leading-edge genes identified in the dairy calf and beef cattle populations respectively. Six leading-edge genes (ADIPOQ, HTR2A, MIF, PDE6G, PRDX3 and SNCA) were associated with BRD in both dairy and beef cattle. Network analysis identified glucose as the most influential upstream regulator in dairy cattle, whereas in beef cattle, TNF was the most influential upstream regulator. The genes, gene sets and upstream regulators associated with BRD have common functions associated with immunity, inflammation and pulmonary disease and provide insights into the mechanisms that are critical to BRD susceptibility in cattle.","Neupane, M; Kiser, J N; Neibergs, H L",Animal genetics,https://doi.org/10.1111/age.12718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30229962/,138

METHODS SILC was performed in 697 cases between April 2010 and July 2014. Seventeen cases (2.4%) underwent conversion to conventional LC. We compared these 2 groups and analyzed the risk factors for conversion to CLC. RESULTS In univariate analysis, American Society of Anesthesiologist score > 3, preoperative percutaneous transhepatic GB drainage status and pathology (acute cholecystitis or GB empyema) were significant risk factors for conversion (P = 0.010, P = 0.019 and P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, pathology (acute cholecystitis or GB empyema) was significant risk factors for conversion to CLC in SILC (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Although SILC is a feasible method for most patients with benign GB disease, CLC has to be considered in patients with acute cholecystitis or GB empyema because it is likely to result in inadequate visualization of the Calot's triangle and greater bleeding risk.","Kim, Sung Gon; Moon, Ju Ik; Choi, In Seok; Lee, Sang Eok; Sung, Nak Song; Chun, Ki Won; Lee, Hye Yoon; Yoon, Dae Sung; Choi, Won Jun",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2016.90.6.303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27274505/,138

Although virus isolation and serology were useful early in the SARS outbreak for diagnosing new cases, these tests are not generally useful because virus culture requires a BSL-3 laboratory and seroconversion is often delayed until 2 to 3 weeks after infection. The first qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-coronavirus (CoV) were sensitive and capable of detecting 1 to 10 genome equivalents. These assays were quickly supplemented with quantitative real-time assays that helped elucidate the natural history of SARS, particularly the initial presence of low viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract. The unique natural history of SARS-CoV infection dictates the testing of both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient, and sending out positives to be confirmed by a reference laboratory. Commercially available reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS have recently appeared; however, meaningful evaluations of these assays have not yet been performed and their true performance has not been determined.

However, private governance in Chinese neighborhoods is a two-way trajectory. This paper examined two types of housing neighborhoods, namely, a work-unit housing neighborhood and gated commodity housing to understand the changes in neighborhood governance. It is interesting to observe that during the Covid-19 epidemic period, the state government enhanced its presence and public trust in neighborhood governance by changing the former ways of self-governance. As a strategy for the state to return to local governance, the grid governance is the reconfiguration of administrative resources at a neighborhood level and professionalizes neighborhood organizations to ensure the capacities of the state to solve social crises and neighborhood governance. The potential side effects of changing neighborhood governance are that while the implementation of grid governance has improved internal connections among residents, the empowered neighborhood governments acting as the “state agent on the ground” leads to an estrangement between residents and private governance. The underdevelopment of neighborhood autonomy is not only due to the restriction of state government, but more importantly, the reciprocal relationship of state-led neighborhood governance in the context of housing privatization development in China.","Zhu, Tianke Zhu Xigang Jin Jian",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137089,138

Therefore, we designed and built a stand which provides remote secure access to the target platform, its remote control and makes possible to see the results of its work. We managed to avoid costly solutions and use a regular desktop PC as an auxiliary control computer. As a result the process of developing a visualization system for the cockpit display is not interrupted even when access to the target platform equipment is restricted. © 2021 National Research Nuclear University.

168374,Relationship Between Neuroendocrine and Immune Gene Expression in Small Cell Lung Cancer,2020-07-29,"Introduction: Periodontal disease is a pandemic condition and its severe form affects approximately 10% of the global population. Here, we present a forecast for the economic burden of periodontal disease in 32 European countries and in the United States of America (USA). Material and methods: In an aggregate population-based cost analysis, taken as reference the most recent available data, we estimated the cost of periodontal disease. Under this, global health, dental and periodontal expenditures were estimated. Additionally, indirect estimates accounted for Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) valued at per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), to estimate productivity losses, including periodontal disease, edentulism due to periodontal disease and caries due to periodontal disease. Results: In 2018 the aggregate cost in Europe was estimated at 17.00B euros and 2.35B euros more in the USA (19.35B euros). Indirect costs due to periodontal disease amounted to 132.52B euros in European countries and 103.30B euros in the USA. The majority of the projected indirect costs were due to edentulism related to periodontal disease and periodontal disease. Indirect costs were the major portion of the estimated economic impact with an average of 0.66% of GDP in Europe and 0.50% in the USA. For the overall costs (direct and indirect), the value amounted to 0.75% of GDP in Europe and 0.60% in the USA. Conclusion: Periodontal disease caused a 149.52B euros loss in Europe and 122.65B euros in the USA, in 2018. These results show that the economic burden of periodontal disease is increasing.","Botelho, J.; Proenca, L.; Leira, Y.; Chambrone, L.; Mendes, J.

168810,Aging-related olfactory loss is associated with olfactory stem cell transcriptional alterations in humans,2021-08-10,"To understand the nature of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, we analyzed at single cell level the B cell responses of five naïve and five convalescent people immunized with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Convalescents had higher frequency of spike protein specific memory B cells and by cell sorting delivered 3,532 B cells, compared with 2,352 from naïve people. Of these, 944 from naïve and 2,299 from convalescents produced monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein and 411 of them neutralized the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus. More than 75% of the monoclonal antibodies from naïve people lost their neutralization activity against the B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) variants while this happened only for 61% of those from convalescents. The overall loss of neutralization was lower for the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants, however it was always significantly higher in those of naïve people. In part this was due to the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline, which was found only in convalescents and generated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies. Overall, vaccination of seropositive people increases the frequency of B cells encoding antibodies with high potency and that are not susceptible to escape by any of the four variants of concern. Our data suggest that people that are seropositive following infection or primary vaccination will produce antibodies with increased potency and breadth and will be able to better control SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants.","Andreano, Emanuele; Paciello, Ida; Piccini, Giulia; Manganaro, Noemi; Pileri, Piero; Hyseni, Inesa; Leonardi, Margherita; Pantano, Elisa; Abbiento, Valentina; Benincasa, Linda; Giglioli, Ginevra; De Santi, Concetta; Fabbiani, Massimiliano; Rancan, Ilaria; Tumbarello, Mario; Montagnani, Francesca; Sala, Claudia; Montomoli, Emanuele; Rappuoli, Rino",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.12.456077,138

European countries experienced a tragic growth in the number of Covid-19 cases although several restrictions have been imposed.ObjectivesThe study is aimed to describe the first experience of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in the city of Bergamo, Northern Italy.MethodsThe most relevant clinical characteristics of aged patients with COVID-19 and mental disorders have been described.ResultsAccording to the experience of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII, medical departments, after appropriate training of all healthcare workers, have been rapidly converted into specific units aimed at treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Specifically, we directly observed a rapidly growing request of psychiatric interventions in aged patients with COVID-19 infection due to the emergence of severe delirium (mainly hyperkinetic) which was reported in approximately 30−50% of cases increasing with age, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. When compared with younger subjects, we found that subjects aged 65 or above with prolonged hospitalization in our hospital are more vulnerable to: 1) environmental factors (e.g., social isolation and distance from family members, stay in intensive/subintensive units, communication difficulties due to therapeutic devices);2) individual factors (e.g., COVID-19 possible neurotropic properties, impairments in insight and cognitive dysfunctions, comorbid medical conditions, and use of multiple medications).ConclusionsThe main implications of the present findings have been discussed.","Serafini, G.; Bondi, E.; Locatelli, C.; Amore, M.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.698,138
170350,Uncertainty due to infectious diseases and forecastability of the realized variance of United States real estate investment trusts: A note,2021,"Bosnia and Herzegovina has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing quarantine and other social distancing measures. These measures, however, have mental, social, and economic consequences on diet and food behaviors. The Bosnian case is particularly pertinent since the country has one of the highest global mortality rates relative to its population. In addition, its health system is fragmented and under-resourced. Consequently, in this study, we analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bosnians’ behaviors relating to food. It is based on an online survey performed during October–November 2020 with 3133 adult respondents. The statistical analysis encompassed descriptive statistics (means, percentages, and frequencies), as well as cluster analysis. The results reveal that the pandemic transformed consumers’ shopping behaviors and food sourcing, reducing shopping frequency and increasing food bought on each trip. Furthermore, there was an increase in the consumption of local food items due to food safety concerns. Additionally, the pandemic improved the awareness of Bosnians towards food with a decrease in food waste. Regarding diets, Bosnians tried to have healthier diets during the pandemic. Therefore, COVID-19 might have opened a ‘window of opportunity’ to promote the shift towards more sustainable food consumption and lifestyles.","Ben Hassen, Tarek El Bilali Hamid Allahyari Mohammad S.; Karabašević, Darjan Radosavac Adriana Berjan Sinisa Vaško Željko Radanov Pavle Obhođaš Ibrahim",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158617,138

Research purpose: The main objective of this article was to explore how individual traits and psychological strengths (i.e. adult state hope, meaning in life and work locus of control) moderate or mediate the relationship between job satisfaction and organisational commitment in a Botswana local government institution. Motivation for the study: The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced employers to rely on the foundations of positive organisational psychology to navigate employee well-being more effectively during times of unprecedented crisis. Research approach/design and method: A quantitative research approach was followed. An adapted Minnesota job satisfaction questionnaire, organisational commitment questionnaire, adult state hope scale, meaning in life questionnaire and work locus of control scale were distributed to public sector officials of a Botswana local government institution (N = 405). Main findings: Adult state hope, meaning in life and work locus of control partially mediated the relationship between job satisfaction and organisational commitment. Practical/managerial implications: Management should create a workplace culture that can promote job satisfaction amongst public officials. Job satisfaction influences essential individual and outcomes organisational in public sector institutions.

Methods: We prospectively evaluated a novel digital immunoassay (RapidTesta SARS-CoV-2). Two nasopharyngeal samples were simultaneously collected for antigen tests and RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, using a method developed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan, served as the reference RT-PCR method. Results: During the study period, 1,127 nasopharyngeal samples (symptomatic patients: 802, asymptomatic patients: 325) were evaluated. For digital immunoassay antigen tests, the sensitivity was 78.3% (95% CI: 67.3%-87.1%) and the specificity was 97.6% (95% CI: 96.5%-98.5%). When technicians visually analyzed the antigen test results, the sensitivity was 71.6% (95% CI: 59.9%-81.5%) and the specificity was 99.2% (95% CI: 98.5%-99.7%). Among symptomatic patients, the sensitivity was 89.4% (95% CI; 76.9%-96.5%) with digital immunoassay antigen tests, and 85.1% (95% CI; 71.7%-93.8%) with visually analyzed the antigen test, respectively. Conclusions: The findings indicated that RapidTesta SARS-CoV-2 analysis with the DIA device had sufficient analytical performance for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples. When positive DIA results are recorded without a visually recognizable red line at the positive line location on the test cassette, additional RT-PCR evaluation should be performed.","Suzuki, H.; Akashi, Y.; Ueda, A.; Kiyasu, Y.; Takeuchi, Y.; Maehara, Y.; Ochiai, Y.; Okuyama, S.; Notake, S.; Nakamura, K.; Ishikawa, H.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.26.21261162v1?rss=1,138

It uses the lens of vulnerability theory to examine the ways in which this crisis exposed pre-existing fragilities between the state and its relationship with the advice sector, and the individuals who experience social welfare problems. The paper commences by exploring Fineman?s vulnerability thesis and its application to those experiencing social welfare-related issues, as well as the vulnerability of the systems operating to give advice. The paper then considers the specific context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on needs, and the ability of the sector to meet these needs. Drawing on policy documents, reports and three case studies from law centres in England and Wales, it discusses the concept of legal need and the realities being experienced. These case studies assist us in being able to critically consider the topics of vulnerability, changing needs and the role that technology is, and can play during the pandemic and beyond. Lastly, the paper points to the need for a critical consideration of the sustainability and format of legal advice in addressing legal need in the post-COVID-19 landscape.","Newman, Daniel Mant Jess Gordon Faith",International Journal of Discrimination and the Law,https://doi.org/10.1177/13582291211031375,138
174085,Jointly learning T-cell receptor and transcriptomic information to decipher the immune response,2021-06-25,"In viruses, post-translational modifications (PTMs) are essential for their life cycle. Recognizing viral PTMs is very important for better understanding the mechanism of viral infections and finding potential drug targets. However, few studies have investigated the roles of viral PTMs in virus-human interactions using comprehensive viral PTM datasets. To fill this gap, firstly, we developed a viral post-translational modification database (VPTMdb) for collecting systematic information of viral PTM data. The VPTMdb contains 912 PTM sites that integrate 414 experimental-confirmed PTM sites with 98 proteins in 45 human viruses manually extracted from 162 publications and 498 PTMs extracted from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Secondly, we investigated the viral PTM sequence motifs, the function of target human proteins, and characteristics of PTM protein domains. The results showed that (i) viral PTMs have the consensus motifs with human proteins in phosphorylation, SUMOylation and N-glycosylation. (ii) The function of human proteins that targeted by viral PTM proteins are related to protein targeting, translation, and localization. (iii) Viral PTMs are more likely to be enriched in protein domains. The findings should make an important contribution to the field of virus-human interaction. Moreover, we created a novel sequence-based classifier named VPTMpre to help users predict viral protein phosphorylation sites. Finally, an online web server was implemented for users to download viral protein PTM data and predict phosphorylation sites of interest. Author summary Post-translational modifications (PTMs) plays an important role in the regulation of viral proteins; However, due to the limitation of data sets, there has been no detailed investigation of viral protein PTMs characteristics. In this manuscript, we collected experimentally verified viral protein post-translational modification sites and analysed viral PTMs data from a bioinformatics perspective. Besides, we constructed a novel feature-based machine learning model for predicting phosphorylation site. This is the first study to explore the roles of viral protein modification in virus infection using computational methods. The valuable viral protein PTM data resource will provide new insights into virus-host interaction.","Xiang, Yujia; Zou, Quan; Zhao, Lilin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.019562,138

With the number of confirmed cases and deaths still rising daily, it is now crucial to quickly detect the positive cases and provide them with the necessary treatment. Presently, several research investigations are being conducted to help control the spread of this epidemic. One research topic is to create faster and more accurate detection. Recent studies have demonstrated that chest CT images encompass the distinctive COVID-19 features, which can be utilized for achieving an efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. However, manually reading these images on a large scale can be laborious and is intractable. Thus, using an artificial intelligence-based system that can help capture the precise information and give an accurate diagnosis would be beneficial.

Data were analyzed using content analysis. While Portuguese teachers perceived ERTL with concern, a majority also saw it as an opportunity. Workload, work conditions, and time management were the most frequently mentioned difficulties. Regarding students’ constraints, teachers emphasized participation, the role of parents, lack of contact, and autonomy. Despite the constraints and difficulties, teachers highlighted gains such as the development of digital competencies and the opportunity to transform teaching and learning. Only 18 teachers suggested there were no positive outcomes from this experience.

This question is of greater importance when it comes to ethnic minority communities that may be disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 in light of inequities, discrimination and marginality. This study examined action strategies adopted by social workers in the public service in response to the challenges faced by ethnic minorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, twenty-five in-depth interviews were conducted with social workers employed in the public welfare services in Israel, who work with Arab communities. Research findings revealed seven action strategies that have the potential to provide protection and support to a minority population group during the pandemic, bridge language and cultural gaps and promote policies that strive for social justice. The discussion emphasises the need and importance of social workers to act in a socio-cultural–political context-sensitive manner in pandemic conditions, whilst demonstrating flexibility in addressing the changing and unique needs of their clients.

Logically, this absence of social or political participation can promote response actions against them, either traditional (strikes, demonstrations, withdrawal of parliamentary support in adoption of legislative measures etc.), or new types (spontaneous concentrations in public places, general assemblies of citizens without a defined convener, appearance of social and political formations of less visible typology, or other similar ones). The financial crisis unleashed at the end of 2007 and the one derived from the health emergency situation due to the global spread of Covid-19, at the beginning of 2020, have precisely encouraged the use of conditionality in the European Union space. However, the way in which conditionality has been developed in one and another crisis in the Spanish State can be said that it has not been identical. Neither have been the reactions of social and political subjects, because if in the first crisis these subjects have experienced a reduction in their functions of participation or intervention in legislative action and in the proposal of political actions, in the second the possibilities of action have been much more significant, and also their contribution to efforts to overcome the crisis situation.","Guerrero, F.

In this study, we examined anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic in a large sample of pregnant individuals (n=8602). For a sub-sample of participants, their infants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3-months of age to examine whether this prenatal maternal distress was associated with infant brain changes. We found significantly elevated prenatal maternal distress compared to pre-pandemic rates, with 47% and 33% of participants reporting clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Importantly, we identified social support as a protective factor for clinically elevated prenatal maternal distress. We found significant relationships between prenatal maternal distress and infant amygdala-prefrontal microstructural and functional connectivity and demonstrate for the first time that social support moderates this relationship. Our findings suggest a potentially long-lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and show that social support acts as a protective factor not just for pregnant individuals, but also for their developing infants.

Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses. To elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human alveolus-on-a-chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including the interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was no infected and did neither show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types are damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear. In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier function and viral dissemination.","Deinhardt-Emmer, Stefanie; Böttcher, Sarah; Häring, Clio; Giebeler, Liane; Henke, Andreas; Zell, Roland; Hornung, Franziska; Brandt, Christian; Marquet, Mike; Mosig, Alexander S.; Pletz, Mathias W.; Schacke, Michael; Rödel, Jürgen; Heller, Regine; Nietzsche, Sandor; Löffler, Bettina; Ehrhardt, Christina",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.276725,138

Twelve future teachers (four women and eight men), who were completing a practicum during their last year at university, participated in the study. A qualitative methodology was employed, in which data were obtained through individual online interviews and online focus groups. The data were analysed using a thematic content analysis and a constant comparison method. The results show, among other aspects, that future teachers understand that the teaching of PE has to be carried out face-to-face in order not to lose its meaning, that there are implicit shortcomings in the virtual teaching model, and that there is a greater probability of suffering from teacher stress and disenchantment with the profession when following an online teaching methodology. The results can be used to foster a critical dialogue regarding the difficulty faced by PE teachers today, at a crucial moment when the political, social and cultural aspects surrounding it are changing.

182793,Differential tumor necrosis factor alpha expression by astrocytes from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-susceptible and -resistant rat strains,1991-04-01,"The type I interferon (IFN) response is an important component of the innate immune response to viral infection. Precise control of interferon responses is critical; insufficient levels of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) can lead to a failure to restrict viral spread while excessive ISG activation can result in interferon-related pathologies. While both positive and negative regulatory factors control the magnitude and duration of IFN signaling, it is also appreciated that a number of ISGs regulate aspects of the interferon response themselves. However, the mechanisms underlying these ISG regulatory networks remain incompletely defined. In this study, we performed a CRISPR activation screen to identify new regulators of the type I IFN response. We identified ETS variant transcription factor 7 (ETV7), a strongly induced ISG, as a protein that acts as a negative regulator of the type I IFN response; however, ETV7 did not uniformly suppress ISG transcription. Instead, ETV7 preferentially targeted a subset of known antiviral ISGs. Further, we showed the subset of ETV7-modulated ISGs was particularly important for IFN-mediated control of some viruses including influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. Together, our data assign a function for ETV7 as an IFN response regulator and also identify ETV7 as a therapeutic target to increase innate responses and potentiate the efficacy of interferon-based antiviral therapies. One Sentence Summary ETV7 is an interferon-induced, repressive transcription factor that negatively regulates antiviral interferon-stimulated genes essential for controlling influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Froggatt, Heather M.; Harding, Alfred T.; Heaton, Brook E.; Heaton, Nicholas S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/851543,138

Due to the large number of infected cases and rapid spread, it has been declared a global pandemic by World Health Organization on March 2020. There are several methods that identify and detect the COVID patient. However, detection using these methods can be confirmed after up to 10 days of the infection. This research presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classification model for detecting a COVID patient using CT image of patient. The dataset, used for the study, consists of CT images of variable sizes. It is a challenge for building a CNN model for variable sizes of the input image. This research uses a hybrid technique to overcome this challenge. It employs and analyses three different methods (such as Adam optimiser, Stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimiser, and RMSProp optimiser) for building the CNN model. Among the three CNN models, for CT image-based classification for infected or non-infected patient, adam performs better than RMSprop and sgdm. The classification accuracy achieved using adam is 94.9%, while RMSprop achieved an accuracy of 91.8% and sgdm reached 93.1%.","Khan, S.; Thirunavukkarasu, K.; Hammad, R.; Bali, V.; Qader, M.

Exponential model was used to calculate the slope of the regression line while the ARIMA model was used to calculate the initial autocorrelation slope and also to forecast new cases for both waves. The relationship between epidemiologic and CHE/GDP data was used for processing ordinary least square multivariate modeling and classifying countries into different groups using PC analysis, K-means and Hierarchical clustering; (3) Results: Results show that some countries with high CHE/GDP improved their public health strategy against virus during the second wave of the pandemic; and (4) Conclusions: Results revealed that countries who spend more on health infrastructure improved in the tackling of the pandemic in the second wave as they were worst hit in the first wave. This research will help countries to decide on how to increase their CHE/GDP in order to tackle properly other pandemic waves of the present Covid-19 outbreak and future diseases that may occur.

Our COV-VACC study is evaluating the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with B cell malignancies. Eligible patients were either receiving active treatment or had received treatment within the last 24 months. Patients were vaccinated with either the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) (n=41) or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) (n=14) vaccines. The median age of participants was 60 years (range: 27-82) and 50% were receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) at the time of vaccination. This interim analysis from the first 55 participants describes anti-S seropositivity rates, neutralising antibody activity and association with peripheral lymphocyte subsets. After the first vaccine dose, 36% overall had detectable anti-S antibodies rising to 42% after the second dose. Sera from seropositive patients was assessed for neutralisation activity in vitro. Of the seropositive patients after first dose (n=17), only 41% were able to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus with a 50% inhibitory dilution factor (ID50) of >1:50. After two doses (n=21) 57% of the seropositive patients had detectable neutralisation activity (median ID50 of 1:469, range 1:70 - 1:3056). Total blood lymphocyte, CD19, CD4 and CD56 counts were significantly associated with seropositivity. Patients vaccinated more than 6 months after completing therapy were significantly more likely to develop antibodies than those within 6 months of treatment or on active treatment; OR: 5.93 (1.29 - 27.28). Our data has important implications for patients with B cell malignancies as we demonstrate a disconnect between anti-S seropositivity and virus neutralisation in vitro following vaccination against COVID-19. Urgent consideration should be given to revaccinating patients with B-cell malignancies after completion of anti-cancer treatment as large numbers currently remain at high risk of infection with the increasing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in many countries.","Fox, T.

Methods In a case-control study between October 2020 and May 2021, the participating practices were randomized into three groups (two different RPM systems, one control). The doctors were required to enroll patients with acute respiratory infection [≥] 18 years who have a web-enabled device. After a three-month study phase, the doctors were asked to describe the treatment of their patients via online survey. The patients were also questioned. The analysis was carried out descriptively and with group comparisons. Results 51 practices with 121 patients were included. Overall, the results show a positive assessment of digital care on the patient side. As for the doctors, handling and integration of the systems into consisting practice processes seem to be a challenge. Further, the number of patient visits to the practice was not reduced by using the systems and the doctors did not save time, but the relationship to the patients was intensified. Conclusion Even if there were no indications for more efficiency by using the RPM systems, the doctors see great potential to intensify the interaction between doctor and patient. In particular, more intensive contact with patients with chronic diseases (e. g. COPD, long-COVID) could be of long term interest and importance for doctors in outpatient care.

183934,Viruses and bacteria in the etiology of the common cold.,1998,"Skin Marker (SM) based motion capture is the most widespread technique used for motion analysis. Yet, the accuracy is often hindered by Soft Tissue Artifact (STA). This is a major issue in clinical gait analysis where kinematic results are used for decision-making. It also has a considerable influence on the results of rigid body and Finite Element (FE) musculoskeletal models that rely on SM-based kinematics to estimate muscle, contact and ligament forces. Current techniques designed to compensate for STA, in particular multi-body optimization methods, assume anatomical simplifications to define joint constraints. These methods, however, cannot adapt to subjects’ bone morphology, particularly for patients with joint lesions, nor easily can account for subject- and location-dependent STA. In this perspective, we propose to develop a conceptual FE based model of the lower limb for STA compensation and evaluate it for 66 healthy subjects under level walking motor task. Both hip and knee joint kinematics were analyzed, considering both rotational and translational joint motion. Results showed that STA caused underestimation of the hip joint kinematics (up to 2.2°) for all rotational DoF, and overestimation of knee joint kinematics (up to 12°) except in flexion/extension. Joint kinematics, in particular the knee joint, appeared to be sensitive to soft tissue stiffness parameters (rotational and translational mean difference up to 1.5° and 3.4 mm). Analysis of the results using alternative joint representations highlighted the versatility of the proposed modeling approach. This work paves the way for using personalized models to compensate for STA in healthy subjects and different activities.","Lahkar, Bhrigu K.; Rohan, Pierre-Yves; Assi, Ayman; Pillet, Helene; Bonnet, Xavier; Thoreux, Patricia; Skalli, Wafa",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.08.430265,138

Situating our conversation within the context of COVID-19, we discuss peculiar and unchallenged forms of ageism in current times as well as the intersections with other forms of discrimination such as ableism, racism, sexism, and heterosexism. We highlight the limits of current understandings of ageism, specifically those that seek to identify positive aspects of ageism without appreciating how these forms of ageism reinforce inequalities among older adults. With regards to spatial manifestations of ageism, we explore the failure of critiques of institutionalization to include older people. Only in the context of “mass death” during COVID-19 has the public eye turned toward the problems of long-term residential care facilities as spaces of care, yet disabled, mad, and D/deaf people and allies have challenged the mass institutionalization of disabled people for decades, highlighting how physical and social segregation constitutes an obvious form of ableism. Institutions are notorious for their physical, spiritual, and emotional harms, but when it comes to residential long-term care for older people, especially older people living with dementia, responses to segregation and isolation have generally been ambivalent. Even aging studies scholars call for “transformation” but do not call for the elimination of large-scale institutions (e.g., Theurer et al.). We discuss this softer critique from aging studies, raising questions about whether institutionalized and segregated congregate living for older people is inherently discriminatory, and we consider the implications for families, health care administrators, researchers, and scholars working in the field of long-term residential care.","Herron, Rachel Kelly Christine Aubrecht Katie",University of Toronto Quarterly,https://doi.org/10.3138/utq.90.2.09,138

A complication is the rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, presenting 4-6 weeks after infection as high fever, organ dysfunction, and strongly elevated markers of inflammation. The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. Objectives: We report a case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) sepsis due to acute enteritis, observed at end of December 2020 to a tertiary-care center (San Carlo Hospital), in Basilicata region (Italy). Methods: This healthy 12-year-old male patient was tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Clinical presentations was characterized by fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal complaints and evanescent rash. Laboratory values were remarkable for high levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimers, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponin. He also had low albumin levels. Autoantibodies tests were negative. Chest tomography showed ground-glass opacities in less than 25% of the lungs, small bilateral pleural effusion and increased cardiac area;abdominal tomography showed enlargement of the lymphnodes and ascites. Evaluation for other infectious etiologies showed molecular test positivity on fecal samples for EPEC E. coli. He received broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics (macrolids and quinolones and then carbapenems). On the seventh day the enteritis resolved and procalcitonin normalized, however he continued to have lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated levels of CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, troponin, and increased BNP. On the ninth day he was feverish again and developed severe cardiac and respiratory failure requiring advanced respiratory support and admission to the intensive care unit. He received IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin at 2 g/Kg, glucocorticoids (Methylprednisolone 1mg/kg) and enoxaparin. Results: The patient was discharged asymptomatic at home after 28 days of hospital stay. Conclusion: We observed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MISC) in a previously healthy patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection and E.coli sepsis, who became critically ill with multisystem involvement. In this case viral and bacterial infections could be considered as a double hit for the etiopathogenesis of MIS-C. The trend of procalcitonin was better than C-reactive protein for differentiating bacterial from non-bacterial phase of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in this critically ill child. Although the accuracy of both tests is moderate. Diagnostic accuracy could be enhanced by combining these tests with bedside clinical judgment.","Gilio, M.; Morella, S.

It is necessary to study COVID-19 distribution features among the population of the central Orenburg region administrative districts in June–December 2020. Materials And Methods. We analyzed the results of the study of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 of the population of the Central Orenburg region for June-December 2020 (72 484 nasopharyngeal smears from 13 districts of the region). The presence of SARS-CoV2 RNA was detected by real-time reverse transcription PCR. The significance of differences in indicators was assessed using the paired Pearson test (p≤0.05;EPI-INFO, version 7.2.4;CDC). Results. The share of positive findings was 15,5% of the studied material from 12,5% of the population. Registration of COVID 19 cases in the Central Orenburg region began in June 2020. They revealed a significant correlation between the dynamics of the districts population morbidity and the dynamics of examined persons number. The study of morbidity dynamics showed a significant growth with the registration of maximum values in October with a decrease in disease cases in December by 2 times. They identified the highest morbidity rates territories (Aleksandrovsky, Akbulaksky, Sharlyksky, Tyulgansky, Perevolotsky, Sol-Iletsky, Saraktashsky, Belyaevsky dist at the average regional level 2204,90 /0000). The distribution of cases by sex revealed the predominance of women disease cases (56,8%) over the men proportion (43,2%). Women dominated among adults under 65 years of age, while men dominated in the children's and over 65 years of age groups. However, the prevalence analysis for the given period showed the women dominance in all age groups in all the studied territories. They can conclude that there is a great women commitment to medical care. It was not possible to identify significant correlations between the morbidity level and the districts remoteness from Orenburg. It is likely that at modern communication speeds distances of 250–300 km are not a significant barrier to a new infection with a dominant airborne transmission pathway spread. Conclusions. The study showed a mobidity significant growth for 2020. 8 of 13 territories under study became those of increased risk of morbidity. Cases of the disease ratio among men and women responds to the men and women ratio among the population. The age group of 0-18 was least affected.

It seems, however, that asthma is not a particular risk factor for SARS-COV-2 infection nor for death resulting from severe infection. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were found to reduce expression of ACE2 receptor in sputum cells, thereby maybe reducing the risk of lung infection. Only the more severe asthmatic patients treated with oral corticoids or high dose ICS were found to be at risk of death, presumably because of associated comorbidities.

187987,Disappearance of antibodies to SARS-associated coronavirus after recovery.,2007,"The international community is currently facing a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. This syndrome has been named COVID-19 for CoronaVIrus Disease 2019 by the World Health Organization. The starting point of the epidemic is the city of Wuhan (China), where the virus is said to have been transmitted from animals to humans before inter-human transmission. This is the third epidemic caused by a coronavirus after those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) started in 2012. COVID-19 has rapidly spread to China and is currently spreading all over the world. The infection mainly affects patients over 40 years of age and mortality is increased in the presence of comorbidities. Children are pauci- or asymptomatic. The diagnosis is most often based on the detection of the viral genome in the nasopharynx by molecular biology methods. In the absence of specific anti-viral molecules, treatment is currently mainly symptomatic. It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is more difficult to control than what the first data suggested. The key strategy to SARS-CoV-2 is to limit its transmission. Preventive measures are mainly based on the application of adequate hand hygiene measures and disinfection of the environment, as well as measures of social distance aimed at limiting contacts in the population and protecting populations at risk.","Davenne, E; Giot, J B; Huynen, P",Revue medicale de Liege,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267109/,138

A major difference is the lack of a well-developed primary care system. As a result, geriatric service has evolved to encompass primary care, to include outreach geriatrics and psychogeriatric support to long-term residential care homes as well as frail elderly people living at home. There is room for innovation in the provision of community care, led by geriatricians, especially in management of chronic disease, incorporating the components of self management and use of telemedicine. Various models could be developed and evaluated to define which best meet the needs of the ageing population.

Here we propose an integrative maximum likelihood analysis of both cluster data in the ME and importations in a set of European countries to assess the transmission scenario and incidence of sporadic infections. Our approach is based on a spatial-transmission model integrating mobility data worldwide and allows for variations in the zoonotic/environmental transmission and under-ascertainment. Maximum likelihood estimates for the ME, considering outbreak data up to 31 August 2013, indicate the occurrence of a subcritical epidemic with a reproductive number R of 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30-0.77) associated with a daily rate of sporadic introductions psp of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.12-0.85). Infections in the ME appear to be mainly dominated by zoonotic/environmental transmissions, with possible under-ascertainment (ratio of estimated to observed (0.116) sporadic cases equal to 2.41, 95% CI: 1.03-7.32). No time evolution of the situation emerges. Analyses of flight passenger data from ME countries indicate areas at high risk of importation. While dismissing an immediate threat for global health security, this analysis provides a baseline scenario for future reference and updates, suggests reinforced surveillance to limit under-ascertainment, and calls for alertness in high importation risk areas worldwide.","Poletto, C; Pelat, C; Levy-Bruhl, D; Yazdanpanah, Y; Boelle, P Y; Colizza, V",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957746/,138

188297,Infectious diseases. Annual review of significant publications.,1969,"Protein synthesis in the murine hepatitis virus JHM-infected cells was temporarily inhibited by hypertonic shock. When the cells were returned to isotonic medium the synthesis of six virus-specific polypeptides, 150K, 65K, 60K, 30K, 23K and 14K was reinitiated simultaneously. Polyadenylated RNA isolated from the cytoplasm or polysomes of infected cells was translated in vitro and the products included polypeptides with molecular weights (mol. wt.) of 120,000, 60,000, 30,000, 23,000 and 14,000. Immunoprecipitation and fingerprinting of [35S]methionine-containing tryptic peptides showed that the 60,000 and 23,000 mol. wt. products were identical to the 60K and 23K polypeptides found in infected cells; the 120,000 mol. wt. product showed identity with the 150K intracellular polypeptide and a virus-specific 120K polypeptide synthesized in tunicamycin-treated cells. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis strongly suggested that the 30,000 and 14,000 mol. wt. products are equivalent to virus-specific 30K and 14K intracellular polypeptides. [3H]Uridine-labelled polyadenylated virus RNA was isolated from infected cells and sedimented in sucrose gradients containing formamide. The distribution in the gradient of each of the previously identified virus RNAs was determined by gel electrophoresis and gradient fractions enriched for each RNA were translated in vitro. The 120,000, 60,000, 30,000, 23,000 and 14,000 mol. wt. polypeptides were found to be encoded by mRNAs 3, 7, 2, 6, and 4 or 5 respectively. These results demonstrate that the virus-specific polypeptides in JHM-infected cells are encoded in separate subgenomic mRNAs and are translated independently. The assignment of coding functions and the known sequence relationships of JHM RNAs permitted a gene order to be deduced.","Siddell, S",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6130122/,138
188376,Emergency response vaccines: lessons learned in response to communicable diseases.,2003,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repair (LIVHR) is widely accepted and safe but the type of mesh used is still debated. We retrospectively compared postoperative outcomes with two different meshes commonly used in LIVHR. METHODS This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent incisional hernia repair between January 2008 and December 2010. Two meshes were used: Parietex™ Composite (Covidien, New Haven, CT, USA) and the DynaMesh®-IPOM (FEG Textiltechnik mbH, Aachen, Germany). The two groups were compared with respect to recurrence rates, incidence of seroma and intestinal obstruction. RESULTS Among the 88 patients who underwent LIVHR, 75 patients (85.2%) presented with primary incisional hernia, 10 (11.4%) presented with a first recurrence and 3 (3.4%) presented with a second recurrence. Median follow-up was 53.6 months (range 40-61 months). 12.9% of patients had recurrence in the Parietex™ Composite mesh group (n=62) in comparison to 3.8% in the DynaMesh®-IPOM mesh group (n=26; P=0.20). DynaMesh®-IPOM was associated with a significantly higher incidence of intestinal obstruction secondary to adhesions (11.5% vs. 0%, P=0.006) and lower incidence of seroma and haematoma formation compared to Parietex™ composite mesh group (0% vs. 6.4% of patients; P=0.185). CONCLUSIONS LIVHR is a safe and feasible technique. Dynamesh®-IPOM is associated with a significantly higher incidence of adhesion related bowel obstruction, albeit with a lower incidence of recurrence, seroma and haematoma formation compared with Parietex™ Composite mesh. However, there is a need for further well-designed, multicentre randomised controlled studies to investigate the use of these meshes.","Tandon, A; Shahzad, K; Pathak, S; Oommen, C M; Nunes, Q M; Smart, N",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27659375/,138

188855,Hepatobiliary pathology.,2002,"Background Orthopedic surgery is currently the least diverse field in medicine. COVID-19 necessitated a virtual rotation and interview process for orthopedic residency applications in 2020. Given the pressing need to address disparities within the field, any change in the application process should be examined with regard to the potential effects it could have on the diversity of trainees in orthopedic surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of virtual rotations and interviews on the demographic distribution of applicants to orthopedic surgery residency. Methods A retrospective review of orthopedic surgery residency applicants was performed comparing the 2018 and 2020 application cycle. Self-reported ethnicity on Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) forms was recorded for all applicants who met prescreening criteria, were invited to interview and who completed interviews. The proportion of underrepresented minority (URM) applicants was compared between these two cohorts. Results There were no significant differences between the 2018 and 2020 application cohorts in terms of number or proportion of URM applicants that met initial screening criteria (p=0.7598), female applicants that met initial screening criteria (p=0.3106), URM applicants who were invited to interview (p=0.6647), or female applicants who were invited to interview (p=0.63). Overall, applicants in the 2018 cycle were 2.38 times more likely to be invited to interview (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.6886-3.3623, p<0.0001) and applicants who were invited to interview were 20.96 times more likely to interview in the 2020 cycle than in the 2018 cycle (OR 20.96, 95% CI 4.89-90.09, p<0.0001). Conclusion The proportion of URMs applying to orthopedic surgery residency was not significantly different after transitioning to a virtual rotation and interview platform at the single institution studied.

Fecal-oral transmission of Cryptosporidium oocysts occurs through ingestion of contaminated drinking or recreational water, consumption of contaminated food, and contact with infected persons or animals (e.g., cattle or sheep). Unlike bacterial pathogens, Cryptosporidium oocysts are resistant to chlorine disinfection and can survive for days in treated recreational water venues (e.g., public and residential swimming pools and community and commercial water parks) despite adherence to recommended residual chlorine levels (1-3 ppm).

Conclusively linking this outbreak to decreases in the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccination rate (driven by anti-vaccine sentiment) is critical to motivating MMR vaccination. We used the NOVA modeling platform to build a stochastic, spatially-structured, individual-based SEIR model of outbreaks, under the assumption that R0 ≈ 7 for measles. We show this implies that herd immunity requires vaccination coverage of greater than approximately 85%. We used a network structured version of our NOVA model that involved two communities, one at the relatively low coverage of 85% coverage and one at the higher coverage of 95%, both of which had 400-student schools embedded, as well as students occasionally visiting superspreading sites (e.g. high-density theme parks, cinemas, etc.). These two vaccination coverage levels are within the range of values occurring across California counties. Transmission rates at schools and superspreading sites were arbitrarily set to respectively 5 and 15 times background community rates. Simulations of our model demonstrate that a 'send unvaccinated students home' policy in low coverage counties is extremely effective at shutting down outbreaks of measles.","Getz, Wayne M; Carlson, Colin; Dougherty, Eric; Porco Francis, Travis C; Salter, Richard",Agent-Directed Simulation Symposium (ADS).

191235,"Imported cutaneous melioidosis in traveler, Belgium.",2007,"Galectin-1 (gal-1), an endogenous lectin secreted by a variety of cell types, has pleiotropic immunomodulatory functions, including regulation of lymphocyte survival and cytokine secretion in autoimmune, transplant disease, and parasitic infection models. However, the role of gal-1 in viral infections is unknown. Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging pathogen that causes severe, often fatal, febrile encephalitis. The primary targets of NiV are endothelial cells. NiV infection of endothelial cells results in cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation triggered by the fusion (F) and attachment (G) envelope glycoproteins of NiV that bear glycan structures recognized by gal-1. In the present study, we report that NiV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion is blocked by gal-1. This inhibition is specific to the Paramyxoviridae family because gal-1 did not inhibit fusion triggered by envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, including two retroviruses and a pox virus, but inhibited fusion triggered by envelope glycoproteins of the related Hendra virus and another paramyxovirus. The physiologic dimeric form of gal-1 is required for fusion inhibition because a monomeric gal-1 mutant had no inhibitory effect on cell fusion. gal-1 binds to specific N-glycans on NiV glycoproteins and aberrantly oligomerizes NiV-F and NiV-G, indicating a mechanism for fusion inhibition. gal-1 also increases dendritic cell production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, known to be protective in the setting of other viral diseases such as Ebola infections. Thus, gal-1 may have direct antiviral effects and may also augment the innate immune response against this emerging pathogen.","Levroney, Ernest L; Aguilar, Hector C; Fulcher, Jennifer A; Kohatsu, Luciana; Pace, Karen E; Pang, Mabel; Gurney, Kevin B; Baum, Linda G; Lee, Benhur",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15972675/,138

DESIGN Rapid creation of 60 relatively negative pressure isolation rooms for 196 suspected SARS patients transferred from 19 hospitals and daily temperature recordings of 180 volunteer HCWs from 6 medical centers. SETTING A military hospital. RESULTS Of the 196 patients, 34 (17.3%) met the World Health Organization criteria for probable SARS with positive results of serologic testing for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal or throat swabs for SARS-CoV, or both. Seventy-four patients had suspected SARS based on unprotected exposure to SARS patients; three of them had positive results on RT-PCR but negative serologic results. The remaining 88 patients did not meet the criteria for a probable or suspected SARS diagnosis. Of the 34 patients with probable SARS, 13 were transferred to medical centers to receive mechanical ventilation due to rapid deterioration of chest x-ray results, and three patients died of SARS despite intensive therapy in medical centers. During the study period, one nurse developed probable SARS due to violation of infection control measures, but there was no evidence of cross-transmission to other HCWs. CONCLUSIONS Despite the use of full personal protection equipment, the facility failed to totally prevent exposures of HCWs to SARS but minimized the risk of nosocomial transmission.

In Singapore, there were 238 cases of SARS with 33 deaths. A retrospective analysis was performed to identify predictors of poor outcome in patients with SARS locally. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical, laboratory and outcome data of 234 patients admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Singapore General Hospital were collected and analysed. Only data collected at the time of admission were used in the analysis for predictors of poor outcome. Adverse events were defined as admission to the intensive care unit or death. RESULTS Clinical (temperature, FiO2) and laboratory [leukocyte, lymphocyte, neutrophil, platelet, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin] trends in groups with and without an adversarial event were presented. Fifty patients experienced an adverse event. On univariate analysis, male gender, advanced age, presence of comorbidities, neutrophilia, lymphopaenia, hyponatraemia, hypoalbuminaemia, transaminitis and elevated LDH or C-reactive protein were found to be significant predictors. On multivariate analysis, predictors of poor outcome were increased age [odds ratio (OR) 1.73 for every 10-year increase; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.21], neutrophilia (OR 1.06 for every 1 x 10(9)/L increase; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.11) and high LDH (OR 1.17 for every 100 U/L increase; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.34).

Task Force I: direct cardiovascular implications of emerging infectious diseases and biological terrorism threats.,2007,"OBJECTIVE To provide an overview of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto, Ontario, which experienced the largest outbreak outside Asia, and to review what has been learned during the past year. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE search of all studies related to SARS, including review of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization (WHO), and Health Canada Web sites. DATA SYNTHESIS During the SARS outbreak in Toronto, 438 people had been diagnosed as having suspected or probable SARS and 44 people died. Elderly people and those with comorbid illnesses were at greatest risk of complications or death. Transmission was via direct contact with respiratory secretions. The use of gloves, gowns, N95 masks, and eye protection was effective in preventing transmission. No transmission occurred before symptom onset or after recovery. Serologic tests suggest that antibodies may not appear until 28 days after illness onset. Molecular tests give their greatest yield during the second week of illness. The value of ribavirin treatment remains questionable. The combination of interferon plus corticosteroids appears to be better than corticosteroids alone. Postmortem examination revealed pulmonary edema and evidence of diffuse alveolar damage. Very few morphological changes were noted in other organs despite the presence of viral RNA as detected by polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION On July 5, 2003, the WHO declared that the SARS outbreak was over. Since then, new cases of SARS have been reported in Asia. With global travel, the disease can rapidly spread throughout the world. Therefore, we must remain vigilant to prevent another pandemic.","Mazzulli, Tony; Kain, Kevin; Butany, Jagdish",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15578877/,138

POCTs complement other laboratory investigations for pneumonia. Although their sensitivity and specificity are improving, they are generally less sensitive than nucleic acid amplification and culture techniques. Questions remain as to the most cost-effective use of POCTs in clinical practice. To ensure their maximum value for both individual patients and the public health system, POCTs are probably best used as part of laboratory-designed algorithms for investigating pneumonia. POCTs are a valuable tool for surveillance, for rapid investigation of outbreaks, and for use in laboratories with limited diagnostic facilities.","Dwyer, Dominic E; Sintchenko, Vitali",The Medical journal of Australia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17605702/,138
192549,Antisense treatments for biothreat agents.,2006,"61 fecal samples from healthy foxes and 24 from healthy raccoon dogs were examined by RT-nested PCR assays for the presence and genotypic identification of Canine coronaviruses (CCVs). 77.0% fox samples were recognized as CCV positive, 43 of which belonged to type II and 29 to type I, as well as both genotypes were simultaneously detected in 25 samples. Out of the total 24 fecal samples from raccoon dogs, 22 were CCV positive for type II and 16 for type I. M gene fragments of 8 samples were sequenced, 4 of which were confirmed as CCV type I and the other 4 as CCV type II. Sequence analysis showed that the M gene of CCV type I had a high similarity of 96.7% - 98.1% between the fox-and raccoon dog strains and the reported Italian strain from diarrhea dogs. The two genotypes, with an identity of 88.3% - 89.7%, formed two separate branches in phylogenetic tree. Interestingly, the sequence at several nucleic acid sites of CCV type II differed between foxes and raccoon dogs. The co-existence and popularity of the two CCV genotypes in healthy foxes and raccoon dogs were first confirmed in this article.","Ma, Guang-gang; Lu, Cheng-ping",Wei sheng wu xue bao = Acta microbiologica Sinica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15989282/,138

This cross-sectional study was one of the first and foremost ones in Bangladesh to observe the basic perception and attitudes towards vaccination against COVID-19 among the healthcare workers (HCWs) - doctors, interns, nurses, ward boys, cleaners, and medical technologists of major COVID-dedicated hospitals. The cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted in February 2021 among 550 HCWs to assess the perception and attitude towards vaccination against COVID-19. The study participants were targeted as the priority group for COVID-19 vaccination, working in two major COVID-dedicated hospitals, Holy Family Red Crescent Medical College Hospital (HF-center), and Sheikh Russel National Gastro-liver Institute and Hospital (SR-center) in Dhaka, Bangladesh during the pandemic. The questionnaire was structured with a three-point scale of responses from 'true', 'false', and 'do not know'. The responses were calculated on point-score as +1 for the correct response, -1 for the wrong response, and 0 for 'do not know' with an overall highest and the lowest possible score of +5 to -5. Absolute (n) and relative frequencies (%) were presented for qualitative variables, while quantitative variables were presented as mean (± standard deviation). Chi-square test was done for univariate analysis of qualitative variables and Student's t-test for quantitative variables. With the 95.27% response rate, including 204 males and 320 were female and the male: female ratio was 1: 1.56. The majority of the participants were doctors (45.8%) followed by nurses (27.9%), and MLSS (26.3%) respectively. The respondents were between 18 to 64 years of age with a mean of 36.17±10.94 years. Most of the respondents (95.99%) responded correctly about the cost-free availability of a vaccine against COVID-19 in the country, 87.40% preferred vaccination as safe and effective. Again 29.77% HCWs think the vaccine might not be safe or effective due to emergency authorization. Only 38.93% of respondents could respond correctly about the necessity of vaccines for children, 31.10% think the vaccination was not required instead of natural immunity. The positive perception and attitude of the frontline HCWs in COVID-dedicated hospitals in Bangladesh are crucial which will positively influence motivation and wide acceptance among the general population for the attainment of the nationwide vaccination program, and adopt effective strategic modification to minimize the gaps for a low-middle income country like Bangladesh with its resource constrain.","Nasir, M; Perveen, R A; Saha, S K; Nessa, A; Zaman, A; Nazneen, R; Ferdous, J; Farha, N; Majumder, T K; Hossain, M J; Parvin, S; Chowdhury, M R; Begum, H; Ahmed, F",Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226472/,138

MATERIAL AND METHODS We followed 102 patients discharged home with a diagnosis of pneumonia compatible with COVID19 between March 12 and 21, 2020, in our hospital in the southern part of the autonomous community of Madrid. Descriptive statistics (medians and interquartile ranges or frequencies, as appropriate) were compiled for the main variables. Treatments and prognoses were compared with 􀁆2, Kruskal-Wallis, or Mann-Whitney tests. The data then underwent logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Most patients (accounting for 74.5% of the discharges) were treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. The readmission rate was 15.7%; the ED revisiting rate was 25.7%. Admission was associated with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P=.011), elevated creatine kinase (CK) (P=.004), and lymphopenia (P=.034). Hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were also related to admission. Ischemic heart disease was associated with longer duration of symptoms. CONCLUSION Lymphopenia, and elevated LDH and CK levels predicted the need for hospital admission better than other traditional biological markers in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Telephone follow-up proved useful for dealing with the overloading of health care services.","Gutiérrez Gabriel, Sonia; Domínguez García, María Jesús; Pérez Mañas, Gemma; Moreno García, Natalia; Silvan Domínguez, María; Andrés, Eva María",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33978330/,138

194684,Planning for epidemics--the lessons of SARS.,2004,"The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contains a large open reading frame embedded entirely within the 5' half of its nucleocapsid (N) gene. This internal gene (designated I) is in the +1 reading frame with respect to the N gene, and it encodes a mostly hydrophobic 23-kDa polypeptide. We have found that this protein is expressed in MHV-infected cells and that it is a previously unrecognized structural protein of the virion. To analyze the potential biological importance of the I gene, we disrupted its expression by site-directed mutagenesis using targeted RNA recombination. The start codon for I was replaced by a threonine codon, and a stop codon was introduced at a short interval downstream. Both alterations created silent changes in the N reading frame. In vitro translation studies showed that these mutations completely abolished synthesis of I protein, and immunological analysis of infected cell lysates confirmed this conclusion. The MHV I mutant was viable and grew to high titer. However, the I mutant had a reduced plaque size in comparison with its isogenic wild-type counterpart, suggesting that expression of I confers some minor growth advantage to the virus. The engineered mutations were stable during the course of experimental infection in mice, and the I mutant showed no significant differences from wild type in its ability to replicate in the brains or livers of infected animals. These results demonstrate that I protein is not essential for the replication of MHV either in tissue culture or in its natural host.","Fischer, F; Peng, D; Hingley, S T; Weiss, S R; Masters, P S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8995618/,138

194913,"Simultaneous determination of tocotrienols, tocopherols, retinol, and major carotenoids in human plasma.",2003,"In an effort at ethical reform, Taiwan recently revised the Hospice Palliative Care Law authorising family members or physicians to make surrogate decisions to discontinue life-sustaining treatment if an incompetent terminally ill patient did not express their wishes while still competent. In particular, Article 7 of the new law authorises the palliative care team, namely the physicians, to act as sole decision-makers on behalf of the incompetent terminally ill patient's best interests if no family member is available. However, the law fails to provide guidance as to what constitutes the patient's best interests or what specific procedures the treating physicians should follow, and so has raised constitutional concerns. It may be difficult to translate ethical reform into law but it is not impossible if essential requirements are carefully followed. First, there must be substantial nexus between the purpose of the statute and the measures provided under the statute. Second, advocates need to convince the public that futility or waste has amounted to a public health emergency so as to justify lower procedural requirements. Third, a remedy or compensation should be available if the surrogate decisions have not been appropriately made. Fourth,minimum procedural safeguards are necessary even though the statute is intended to reduce the procedural burdens of making surrogate decisions on behalf of incompetent patients who lack family members and did not express their wishes while still competent.","Su, Yi-Chen",Journal of medical ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24131902/,138

The crossover frequencies were determined by coinoculations with pairs of BMV RNA3 variants that carried a duplicated sgp region flanked by marker restriction sites. A region composed of the sgp core, a poly(A) tract, and an upstream enhancer supported homologous exchanges in 25% of the analyzed RNA3 progeny. However, mutations in the sgp core stopped both the transcription of the sgp RNA and homologous recombination. These data provide evidence for an association of RNA recombination with transcription.","Wierzchoslawski, Rafal; Dzianott, Aleksandra; Kunimalayan, Selvi; Bujarski, Jozef J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12767997/,138

To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to such phenotypic variability, we compared the genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of two natural isolates of the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of the human disease melioidosis. Significant intrinsic genomic, transcriptional, and proteomic variations were observed between the two strains involving genes of diverse functions. We identified 16 strain-specific regions in the B. pseudomallei K96243 reference genome, and for eight regions their differential presence could be ascribed to either DNA acquisition or loss. A remarkable 43% of the transcriptional differences between the strains could be attributed to genes that were differentially present between K96243 and Bp15682, demonstrating the importance of lateral gene transfer or gene loss events in contributing to pathogen diversity at the gene expression level. Proteins expressed in a strain-specific manner were similarly correlated at the gene expression level, but up to 38% of the global proteomic variation between strains comprised proteins expressed in both strains but associated with strain-specific protein isoforms. Collectively, >65 hypothetical genes were transcriptionally or proteomically expressed, supporting their bona fide biological presence. Our results provide, for the first time, an integrated framework for classifying the repertoire of natural variations existing at distinct molecular levels for an important human pathogen.","Ou, Keli; Ong, Catherine; Koh, Shze Yung; Rodrigues, Fiona; Sim, Siew Hoon; Wong, Daniel; Ooi, Chia Huey; Ng, Kim Chong; Jikuya, Hiroyuki; Yau, Chin Chin; Soon, Sou Yen; Kesuma, Djohan; Lee, May Ann; Tan, Patrick",Journal of bacteriology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15937190/,138

It is not synonymous with 'job stress', 'fatigue', 'alienation' or 'depression'. Burnout is more common than generally believed and may affect every aspect of the individual's functioning, have a deleterious effect on interpersonal and family relationships and lead to a negative attitude towards life in general. Empirical research suggests that burnout and depression are separate entities, although they may share several 'qualitative' characteristics, especially in the more severe forms of burnout, and in vulnerable individuals, low levels of satisfaction derived from their everyday work.

The reproduction of severe clinical disease with experimental CCV infection has been difficult. We have recently developed a CCV challenge model which reproduced clinical signs of disease in susceptible dogs. The following study was designed to determine whether immunization with an inactivated CCV vaccine would protect dogs from clinical disease induced using this model. Dogs (n = 13) were vaccinated with an inactivated CCV vaccine. Vaccinates and controls (n = 5) were orally inoculated with virulent CCV virus and treated with dexamethasone on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 after virus challenge. Control dogs developed clinical signs including diarrhea, dehydration, anorexia, depression, and nasal and ocular discharge. Diarrhea was noted in 80% of the controls and 60% progressed to a severe watery or bloody diarrhea that persisted for multiple days. Conversely, only 2/13 (15%) vaccinates developed mild diarrhea and none developed bloody diarrhea. The control dogs averaged 10.8 days of diarrhea compared to 1.4 days for vaccinates over the 21 day observation period. In addition to reduced clinical signs, the number of days of virus shedding and the level of CCV in feces was different for controls (100% shed virus) and vaccinates (38% shed virus). This study demonstrates that vaccination with an inactivated CCV vaccine can significantly reduce not only viral replication, but the occurrence of clinical disease following a virulent CCV infection.","Fulker, R; Wasmoen, T; Atchison, R; Chu, H J; Acree, W",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8830484/,138

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been utilized widely due to its superiority over other non-invasive respiratory support techniques. To avoid HFNC failure and intubation delay, the key issues are proper patients, timely application and improving compliance. It should be noted that elder patients are vulnerable for failed HFNC. We applied HFNC for oxygen therapy in severe and critical COVID-19 patients and summarized the following experiences. Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed. Secondly, an initial flow of 60 L/min and 37℃ should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased. Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease. Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.","He, Guojun; Han, Yijiao; Fang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianying; Shen, Jifang; Li, Tong; Pu, Qibing; Chen, Aijun; Qi, Zhiyang; Sun, Lijun; Cai, Hongliu",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

This was based on hydrophobicity, conservation among coronavirus S proteins and the prediction of a sided helix conformation. Using site directed mutagenesis and an in vitro cell to cell fusion assay we showed that substitution of hydrophobic amino acids with charged amino acids, within the predicted hydrophobic face of either of these two peptides eliminated fusion. Within peptide #1 substitution of the same hydrophobic amino acids with other hydrophobic amino acids or substitution of polar amino acids with charged or polar amino acids had little effect on fusion. Thus peptides #1 and #2 remain likely candidates for the MHV fusion peptide. A third previously identified peptide within S2 (Chambers et al., 1990) is unlikely as a fusion peptide as it is not well conserved among coronaviruses and substitution within the hydrophobic face with charged amino acids does not effect fusion.","Luo, Z L; Weiss, S R",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782260/,138

While there is growing interest in using cheaters as antiviral therapeutics, the mechanisms underlying cheating have been rarely explored. During experimental evolution of MS2 phage, we observed the parallel emergence of two independent cheater mutants. The first, a point deletion mutant, lacked polymerase activity but was advantageous in viral packaging. The second synonymous mutant cheater displayed a completely different cheating mechanism, involving an altered RNA structure. Continued evolution revealed the demise of the deletion cheater and rise of the synonymous cheater. A mathematical model inferred that while a single cheater is expected to reach an equilibrium with the wild type, cheater demise arises from antagonistic interactions between coinfecting cheaters. These findings highlight layers of parasitism: viruses parasitizing cells, cheaters parasitizing intact viruses, and cheaters may parasitize other cheaters.","Meir, Moran; Harel, Noam; Miller, Danielle; Gelbart, Maoz; Eldar, Avigdor; Gophna, Uri; Stern, Adi",Sci.

WM has been a valuable adjunct to human clinical testing, and when positive results occur in sewage, community testing has been increased. WM findings allow public health officials to track and respond to the impacts of loosening lockdown restrictions, demonstrating when return to normal social activities might occur without a resurgence of rapid community transmission, and they are particularly useful in areas with low human case numbers and/or low clinical testing rates. New research is required to address several practical knowledge gaps, for example, sampling protocols, prediction of case prevalence from viral numbers by modelling, and determination of detection limits.

MethodsWe conducted an open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial, in Cameroon comparing Doxycycline 100mg, twice daily for 7 days versus Hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg daily for 5 days and Azithromycin 500mg at day 1 and 250mg from day 2 through 5, in mild COVID-19 patients. Clinical improvement, biological parameters and adverse events were assessed. The primary outcome was the proportion of clinical cure at day 3, 10 and 30. Non-inferiority was determined by the clinical cure rate between protocols with a 20 percentage points margin. Results194 participants underwent randomization and were treated with Doxycycline (n=97) or Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin (n=97). At day 3, 74/92 (80.4%) participants on Doxycycline versus 77/95 (81.1%) on Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin -based protocols were asymptomatic (p=0.91). At day 10, 88/92 (95.7%) participants on Doxycycline versus 93/95 (97.9%) on Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin were asymptomatic (p=0.44). At day 30 all participants were asymptomatic. SARS-CoV2 PCR was negative at Day 10 in 60/92 (65.2%) participants allocated to Doxycycline and 63/95 (66.3%) participants allocated to Hydroxychloroquine-Azithromycin. None of the participants were admitted for worsening of the disease after treatment initiation.

Our research examines the impact of such initiatives on tourists' intentions to spread positive word-of-mouth (WOM) and their intentions to visit when the current pandemic ends. Our experimental results suggest community support in the form of providing free accommodation to homeless people increases tourists' intentions to spread positive WOM, bringing reputational benefits. But such initiatives reduce tourists’ intentions to visit, presenting potential business risks. Our results further suggest that community support in the form of providing free accommodation to medical professionals has little impact, as it shows no significant difference to control (no CSR initiatives).","Chen, Zhifeng Hang Haiming",Tourism Management,,138

Clinical findings indicated that a fraction of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients diagnosed as mild early may progress to severe cases. However, it is difficult to distinguish these patients in the early stage. The present study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of these patients, analyze related factors, and explore predictive markers of the disease aggravation. Methods. Clinical and laboratory data of nonsevere adult COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, were collected and analyzed on admission. A logistic regression model was adopted to analyze the association between the disease aggravation and related factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was utilized to analyze the prognostic ability of C-reactive protein (CRP). Results. About 7.7% (16/209) of nonsevere adult COVID-19 patients progressed to severe cases after admission. Compared with nonsevere patients, the aggravated patients had much higher levels of CRP (median [range], 43.8 [12.3-101.9] mg/L vs 12.1 [0.1- 91.4] mg/L; P = .000). A regression analysis showed that CRP was significantly associated with aggravation of nonsevere COVID-19 patients, with an area under the curve of 0.844 (95% confidence interval, 0.761-0.926) and an optimal threshold value of 26.9 mg/L. Conclusions. CRP could be a valuable marker to anticipate the possibility of aggravation of nonsevere adult COVID-19 patients, with an optimal threshold value of 26.9 mg/L.","Wang, Guyi; Wu, Chenfang; Zhang, Quan; Wu, Fang; Yu, Bo; Lv, Jianlei; Li, Yiming; Li, Tiao; Zhang, Siye; Wu, Chao; Wu, Guobao; Zhong, Yanjun",Open Forum Infect.

215951,Diagnostic Considerations in H1N1 Influenza-induced Thrombotic Microangiopathy,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae atypical pneumonia is frequently associated with erythema multiforme. Occasionally, a mycoplasma infection does not trigger any cutaneous but exclusively mucosal lesions. The term mucosal respiratory syndrome is employed to denote the latter condition. Available reviews do not address the possible association of mucosal respiratory syndrome with further atypical bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, or Legionella species. We therefore performed a systematic review of the literature addressing this issue in the National Library of Medicine, Excerpta Medica, and Web of Science databases. SUMMARY: We found 63 patients (&#8804;18 years, n = 36; >18 years, n = 27; 54 males and 9 females) affected by a mucosal respiratory syndrome. Fifty-three cases were temporally associated with a M. pneumoniae and 5 with a C. pneumoniae infection. No cases temporally associated with C. psittaci, C. burnetii, F. tularensis, or Legionella species infection were found. Two cases were temporally associated with Epstein-Barr virus or influenzavirus B, respectively.","De Luigi, Giulia; Meoli, Martina; Zgraggen, Lorenzo; Kottanattu, Lisa; Simonetti, Giacomo D; Terrani, Isabella; Bianchetti, Mario G; Lava, Sebastiano A G; Milani, Gregorio P",Dermatology,,138

On February 23, 2020, the exanthema began in the first confirmed case of measles this year. At the same time, on February 28, 2020, the first case of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was confirmed. Up to June 6, 2020, 176 measles cases have been confirmed: 137 in Mexico City, 37 in the state of Mexico, and two in the state of Campeche. In Mexico City, municipalities with more cases were Gustavo A. Madero, Miguel Hidalgo, and Iztapalapa; in the State of Mexico were Ecatepec, Tlalnepantla, and Netzahualcoyotl; in Campeche, there are only two cases reported. On the other hand, 7,065,133 cases of COVID-19 have been registered worldwide with a global case fatality rate of 5.7%. In Mexico, there have been 113,619 confirmed cases and 13,511 deaths, while in Mexico City, there have been 30,223 cases and 3062 deaths. Iztapalapa and Gustavo A. Madero are the locations with more cases reported. Hence, a campaign of social distancing started as part of the strategies to control the spread of the infection. The potential threat is that as social confinement measures are relaxed and mobility is initiated, both viruses could continue to spread. It is expected that due to the time that has passed since the last reported measles case, control of this disease will be achieved.","Solórzano-Santos, Fortino; Garduño-Espinoza, Juan; Muñoz-Hernández, Onofre",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,138

217504,"Pulmonary fibrosis: something old, something new still waiting for a breakthrough",2020,"AIM: The aims were to describe the development of a modified national online OSCE during COVID-19 and assess related student feedback. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The modified online OSCE comprising of eight question entities was organised simultaneously in all four dental institutes of Finland using the Moodle virtual learning environment. All fourth-year students (n = 179) attended the examination online at home. Student feedback was collected via an anonymous questionnaire with multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions concerning attitudes towards the modified online OSCE, as well as content and usability of the question entities in the examination. Means and standard deviations were calculated for multiple-choice questions. Content analysis was used for open-ended questions. RESULTS: Of 179 students, 119 (66%) consented to the study. Students experienced they had received adequate information (mean 3.8; SD 1.2), had a positive attitude before the examination (4.0; 1.0) and found the practice test useful (3.7; 1.1) (range 1-5). Technical implementation (2.7; 0.7) and the difficulty of the questions (2.9; 0.6) (range 1-4) were found to be good. The teaching students received during their studies was sufficient (3.2; 0.5) (range 1-4). Content (mean 3.2; 0.4) and usability (2.9; 0.4) of the question entities were good (range 1-4). The themes arising from open-ended questions were importance and practicality of the topic (in questions) in relation to the work of a dentist and gratitude for the rapid conversion of the OSCE into an online examination despite COVID-19. The themes arising from negative experiences included difficulties in completing the examination within the time allocated, and dissatisfaction with the model answers provided after the examination. CONCLUSION: The positive student feedback towards the modified online OSCE encourages including an online examination to complement the traditional OSCE.","Hytönen, Hanna; Näpänkangas, Ritva; Karaharju-Suvanto, Terhi; Eväsoja, Taina; Kallio, Anu; Kokkari, Anne; Tuononen, Tiina; Lahti, Satu",Eur. j. dent. educ,,138
217703,Mesenchymal stem cells: Biological characteristics and application in disease therapy,2021,"BACKGROUND: The effect of the COVID19 pandemic on community-based rheumatology care and use of telehealth is unclear. METHODS: Using a community practice-based rheumatologist network, we examined trends in in-person vs. telehealth visits vs. canceled visits in three time periods: pre-COVID19, COVID19-Transition (6-weeks beginning 3/23/20), and post-COVID19-Transition (May-August). In the Transition period, we compared patients who received in-person care vs. telehealth visits vs. cancelled all visits. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with canceled or telehealth visits. RESULTS: Pre-COVID19, there were 7,075 visits/week among 60,002 unique rheumatology patients cared for by approximately 300 providers practicing in 92 offices. This decreased substantially (24.6% reduction) during COVID19-Transition period for in-person but rebounded to pre-COVID19 levels during post-COVID19 transition. There were almost no telehealth visits pre-COVID19, but telehealth increased substantially during the COVID19-Transition (41.4% of all follow-up visits) and slightly decreased during post-COVID19-Transition (27.7% of visits). Older age, female sex, Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and rural residence were associated with greater likelihood of cancelling visits. Most factors were also associated with a lower likelihood of having telehealth vs. in-office visits. Patients living further from the rheumatologists' office were more likely to use telehealth. CONCLUSION: COVID19 led to large disruptions in rheumatology care; these disruptions were only partially offset by increases in telehealth use and disproportionately affected racial/ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. During the COVID-19 era, telehealth continues to be an important part of rheumatology practice, but disparities in access to care exist for some vulnerable groups.","George, Michael; Danila, Maria I; Watrous, Daniel; Reddy, Shanmugapriya; Alper, Jeffrey; Xie, Fenglong; Nowell, W Benjamin; Kallich, Joel; Clinton, Cassie; Saag, Kenneth G; Curtis, Jeffrey R",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),,138

After 25 years of research during emergencies, there are many lessons to build on, including that seed systems, especially informal markets, prove fairly resilient and often function even in high stress contexts. As a wise first step, given the possible volatility in supply, farmers' seed saving should be supported actively and at scale. Rigorous remote assessments will have to become the new norm for gauging seed security, with reviews recognizing that different crops might be affected in different ways by specific seed channel stress or breakdown. Well-known short-term seed security responses, for example, Direct Seed Distribution, will need to be tailored to the new COVID-19 reality, particularly in terms of altering logistics. More fundamentally, three new factors might herald a transformation in response: 1) Choice for farmers has to be the operative principle (especially as markets may fluctuate quickly); 2) Remote two-way 'state of the art' communication has to be built rapidly; and 3) Seed quality options might need to be liberalized, especially given the scale of possible seed security intervention. Covid-19 effects will likely linger several years or potentially six to nine seasons (depending on agricultural calendar). Now might be the time to move from stop-gap responses (and repetitive ones) to more sustainable and powerful market-led support, with particular emphasis on responses that leverage and strengthen the informal sector markets.","Sperling, Louise",Food Secur,,138
230781,Targeting highly pathogenic coronavirus-induced apoptosis reduces viral pathogenesis and disease severity,2021,"From large-scale organizations to decentralized political systems, hierarchical strategic decision making is commonplace. We introduce a novel class of structured hierarchical games (SHGs) that formally capture such hierarchical strategic interactions. In an SHG, each player is a vertex in a tree, and strategic choices of players are sequenced from root to leaves, with root moving first, followed by its children, then followed by their children, and so on until the leaves. A player's utility in an SHG depends on its own decision, and on the choices of its parent and all the tree leaves. SHGs thus generalize simultaneous-move games, as well as Stackelberg games with many followers. We leverage the structure of both the sequence of player moves as well as payoff dependence to develop a novel gradient-based back propagation-style algorithm, which we call Differential Backward Induction (DBI), for approximating equilibria of SHGs.

It is applied for detection and differentiation of, among others, lung cancer, tuberculosis, and pneumonia, the last with importance due to the COVID-19 disease. Integrating computer-aided detection methods into the radiologist diagnostic pipeline, greatly reduces the doctors' workload, increasing reliability and quantitative analysis. Here we present a novel deep learning approach for lung segmentation, a basic, but arduous task in the diagnostic pipeline. Our method uses state-of-the-art fully convolutional neural networks in conjunction with an adversarial critic model. It generalized well to CXR images of unseen datasets with different patient profiles, achieving a final DSC of 97.5% on the JSRT dataset.","Ga'al, Guszt'av; Maga, Bal'azs; Luk'acs, Andr'as",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10304v1.pdf,138

239832,Potent SARS-CoV-2 Direct-Acting Antivirals Provide an Important Complement to COVID-19 Vaccines,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection triggers elevated levels of circulating cytokines and immune-cell hyperactivation, called a cytokine storm, which leads to dysregulated immune response not only towards the pathogen itself but also contributes to cellular, vascular injury and multiorgan dysfunction. The cytokine-induced endothelial inflammation and vascular pathology of COVID-19 is well reported in post-mortem biopsies and several cases reporting small, medium and large vessel micro/macro thrombotic events and vasculitis in multiple organs. So far, few cases have been reported with newly diagnosed antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis at the time of acute COVID-19 infection. The exact pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and ANCA-associated vasculitis continues to be studied and reviewed. Here we report a case of a 60-year-old female who presented to our institution with sudden onset of shortness of breath and hemoptysis. A detailed history revealed a recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Labs showed elevated serum creatinine, urine analysis with large blood and nephrotic range proteinuria. CT chest was remarkable for abnormal appearance of the parenchyma bilaterally compatible with a crazy paving pattern, suggesting pulmonary alveolar proteinosis versus diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Vasculitis was suspected and the patient was started on IV corticosteroids and plasmapheresis. Diagnostic workup was positive for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-myeloperoxidase (ANCA-MPO), anti-Sjogren's syndrome-related antigen A autoantibodies (anti-SS-A) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Renal biopsy confirmed focal segmental necrotizing, crescentic and sclerosing glomerulonephritis, pauci-immune type, anti-MPO antibody/P-ANCA associated. A diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis was made and she was started on rituximab immunosuppressive therapy following which she showed clinical improvement. In this document, we present a unique case of microscopic polyangiitis possibly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by renal biopsy and clinical presentation. In the current setting of a global pandemic, we strongly recommend that vasculitis be high on the differential diagnosis in patients who are currently infected or had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and present with acute kidney injury (AKI).","Allena, N.; Patel, J.; Nader, G.; Patel, M.; Medvedovsky, B.",Cureus,,138
240043,Neutrophil extracellular traps contribute to immune dysregulation in bullous pemphigoid via inducing B-cell differentiation and antibody production,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread all around the world. Italy is one of the worst affected countries in Europe. Although there is a trend of relief, the epidemic situation hasn't stabilized yet. This study aims to investigate the dynamics of the disease spread in Italy and provide some suggestions on containing the epidemic. METHODS: We compared Italy's status at the outbreak stage and control measures with Guangdong Province in China by data observation and analysis. A modified autonomous SEIR model was used to study the COVID-19 epidemic and transmission potential during the early stage of the outbreak in Italy. We also utilized a time-dependent dynamic model to study the future disease dynamics in Italy. The impact of various non-pharmaceutical control measures on epidemic was investigated through uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The comparison of specific measures implemented in the two places and the time when the measures were initiated shows that the initial prevention and control actions in Italy were not sufficiently timely and effective. We estimated parameter values based on available cumulative data and calculated the basic reproduction number to be 4.32 before the national lockdown in Italy. Based on the estimated parameter values, we performed numerical simulations to predict the epidemic trend and evaluate the impact of contact limitation, detection and diagnosis, and individual behavior change due to media coverage on the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Italy was in a severe epidemic status and the control measures were not sufficiently timely and effective in the beginning. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, including contact restrictions and improvement of case recognition, play an important role in containing the COVID-19 epidemic. The effect of individual behavior changes due to media update of the outbreak cannot be ignored. For policy-makers, early and strict blockade measures, fast detection and improving media publicity are key to containing the epidemic.","Liu, Pei-Yu; He, Sha; Rong, Li-Bin; Tang, San-Yi",Infect Dis Poverty,,138

In contrast, very few studies have focused on the link between Adverse Childhood Experiences and altruistic behavior. The objective of this study is to examine the possible influence of Adverse Childhood Experiences on the social behavior exhibited in emerging adulthood (specifically deviant and altruistic behavior). METHOD: The study population consisted of 490 young adults between the ages of 18 and 20, with a mean of 18.90 years (SD = .77). All voluntarily completed the following self-report questionnaires: the Adverse Childhood Experiences questionnaire, the Deviant Behavior Scale, and the Altruistic Scale. RESULTS: Linear regression models found that Adverse Childhood Experiences were strong, positive predictors of deviant behaviors. Moreover, specific Adverse Childhood Experiences (physical abuse for deviant behavior, and emotional neglect for altruistic behaviors) had notable, differential effects. CONCLUSIONS: The prevention or early detection of Adverse Childhood Experiences during childhood could contribute to reducing maladaptive patterns of behavior and to increasing altruistic patterns during emerging adulthood","Gomis-Pomares, Aitana; Villanueva, Lidón",Psicothema (Oviedo),,138

Different drug intervention acting at multiple stages of pathogenesis of COVID-19 can substantially reduce the infection induced mortality. The current within-host mathematical modeling studies deals with the optimal drug regimen and the efficacy of combined therapy in treatment of COVID-19. The drugs/interventions considered include Arbidol, Remdesivir, Inteferon (INF) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir. It is concluded that these drug interventions when administered individually or in combination reduce the infected cells and viral load. Four scenarios involving administration of single drug intervention, two drug interventions, three drug interventions and all the four have been discussed. In all these scenarios the optimal drug regimen is proposed based on two methods. In the first method these medical interventions are modeled as control interventions and a corresponding objective function and optimal control problem is formulated. In this setting the optimal drug regimen is proposed. Later using the the comparative effectiveness method the optimal drug regimen is proposed based on basic reproduction number and viral load. The average infected cell count and viral load decreased the most when all the four interventions were applied together. On the other hand the average susceptible cell count decreased the best when Arbidol alone was administered. The basic reproduction number and viral count decreased the best when all the four interventions were applied together reinstating the fact obtained earlier in the optimal control setting. These findings may help physicians with decision making in treatment of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia.","Chhetri, Bishal; Bhagat, Vijay M.; Vamsi, D. K.

The University of Arizona (UArizona) utilized WBE paired with clinical testing as a surveillance tool to monitor the UArizona community for SARS-CoV-2 in near real-time, as students re-entered campus in the fall. Positive detection of virus RNA in wastewater lead to selected clinical testing, identification, and isolation of three infected individuals (one symptomatic and two asymptomatic) that averted potential disease transmission. This case study demonstrated the value of WBE as a tool to efficiently utilize resources for COVID-19 prevention and response. Thus, WBE coupled with targeted clinical testing was further conducted on 13 dorms during the course of the Fall semester (Table 3). In total, 91 wastewater samples resulted in positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that successfully provided an early-warning for at least a single new reported case of infection (positive clinical test) among the residents living in the dorm. Overall, WBE proved to be an accurate diagnostic for new cases of COVID-19 with an 82.0% positive predictive value and an 88.9% negative predictive value. Increases in positive wastewater samples and clinical tests were noted following holiday-related activities. However, shelter-in-place policies proved to be effective in reducing the number of daily reported positive wastewater and clinical tests. This case study provides evidence for WBE paired with clinical testing and public health interventions to effectively contain potential outbreaks of COVID-19 in defined communities.","Betancourt, Walter Q; Schmitz, Bradley W; Innes, Gabriel K; Prasek, Sarah M; Pogreba Brown, Kristen M; Stark, Erika R; Foster, Aidan R; Sprissler, Ryan S; Harris, David T; Sherchan, Samendra P; Gerba, Charles P; Pepper, Ian L",Sci Total Environ,,138

In the COVID-19 pandemic episode the use of these devices has become widespread, but, due to the shortage of conventional continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, alternative devices have been manufactured. The objective of this study is to describe the use of these devices, as well as their efficacy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data are collected from patients admitted for pneumonia due to COVID-19 at the IFEMA Field Hospital. Data are collected from 23 patients with respiratory failure and need for ventilatory support. RESULTS: Study carried out on a total of 23 patients, dated admission to IFEMA. Alternative CPAP was used in five patients (21.7%), while ventilatory support with a reservoir mask or Ventimask Venturi effect was used in the remaining 18 patients (78.3%). A progressive increase in saturation is observed in those patients in whom alternative CPAP was used (from 94% on average to 98 and 99% on average after 30 and 60 minutes with the mask, respectively), although this change was not significant (p = 0.058 and p = 0.122, respectively). No significant change in RF was observed at the beginning and end of the measurement in patients who used alternative CPAP (p = 0.423), but among those who did not use alternative CPAP (p = 0.001). A statistically significant improvement in the variable oxygen saturation / fraction inspired by oxygen is observed in patients who used alternative CPAP (p = 0.040) CONCLUSION: The use of these devices has helped the ventilatory work of several patients by improving their oxygenation parameters.

269320,The effects of climate change on infectious diseases with cutaneous manifestations,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in small bowel (SB). Our aim was to identify factors influencing intestinal ACE2 expression in Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. METHODS: Using bulk RNA-seq or microarray transcriptomics from tissue samples (4 SB and 2 colonic cohorts; CD=495; UC=387; non-IBD=94), we analyzed the relationship of ACE2 with demographics, disease activity and prognosis. We examined the outcome of anti-TNF and anti-IL12/IL-23 treatment on SB and colonic ACE2 expression in three clinical trials. Univariate and multivariate regression models were fitted. RESULTS: ACE2 levels were consistently reduced in SB CD and elevated in colonic UC, when compared to non-IBD controls. Elevated SB ACE2 was also associated with demographic features (age and elevated BMI) associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. Within CD, SB ACE2 was reduced in patients subsequently developing complicated disease. Within UC, colonic ACE2 was elevated in active disease and in patients subsequently requiring anti-TNF rescue therapy. SB and colonic ACE2 expression in active CD and UC were restored by anti-cytokine therapy, most notably in responders. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced SB, but elevated colonic ACE2 levels in IBD are associated with inflammation and severe disease but normalized following anti-cytokine therapy suggesting compartmentalization of ACE2-related biology in SB and colonic inflammation. The restoration of ACE2 expression with anti-cytokine therapy may be important in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially explain reports of reduced morbidity from COVID-19 in IBD patients treated with anti-cytokines.","Potdar, Alka A; Dube, Shishir; Naito, Takeo; Li, Katherine; Botwin, Gregory; Haritunians, Talin; Li, Dalin; Casero, David; Yang, Shaohong; Bilsborough, Janine; Perrigoue, Jacqueline G; Denson, Lee A; Daly, Mark; Targan, Stephan R; Fleshner, Phillip; Braun, Jonathan; Kugathasan, Subra; Stappenbeck, Thaddeus S; McGovern, Dermot P B",Gastroenterology,,138

However, conventional methods usually focus on simple network modeling with only pairwise interactions, while group-wise interactions modeled by hypernetwork are ubiquitous and critical. In this work, we formulate the hypernetwork dismantling problem as a node sequence decision problem and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based hypernetwork dismantling framework. Besides, we design a novel inductive hypernetwork embedding method to ensure the transferability to various real-world hypernetworks. Generally, our framework builds an agent. It first generates small-scale synthetic hypernetworks and embeds the nodes and hypernetworks into a low dimensional vector space to represent the action and state space in DRL, respectively. Then trial-and-error dismantling tasks are conducted by the agent on these synthetic hypernetworks, and the dismantling strategy is continuously optimized. Finally, the well-optimized strategy is applied to real-world hypernetwork dismantling tasks. Experimental results on five real-world hypernetworks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.","Yan, Dengcheng; Xie, Wenxin; Zhang, Yiwen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14332v1.pdf,138

Methods: One hundred and forty subjects aged between 18 and 75 years were assessed with the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-18), the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Self Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Data analysis were performed using SPSS version 16.0. Basic statistics were used to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants. The associations between sociodemographic and clinical variables were explored first by performing Pearson's correlation analysis followed by multivariate regression. IES-R total score was used as the dependent variable while sociodemographic variables, SRQ-20, CGI-S and BPRS total score were used as independent variables. Results: A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of distress measured by IES-R: 47 (33.6%) mild, 45 (32.1%) moderate and 37 (26.4%) severe. SRQ-20 total score was positive in 82 (58.6%) patients, particularly in the female population (p = 0.009) with an age between 45-65 years (p = 0.020). In multiple regression analysis, being actively working (Beta = 0.15, p = 0.03) and SRQ-20 (Beta = 0.56, p = 0.00) significantly predicted IES-R total score.

An overwhelming majority of published literature on the pathologic findings associated with COVID-19 is either from living clinical cohorts or from autopsy findings of those who died in a medical care setting, which can confound pure disease pathology. A relatively low initial infection rate paired with a high biosafety level enabled the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator to conduct full autopsy examinations on suspected COVID-19-related deaths. Full autopsy examination on the first 20 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive decedents revealed that some extent of diffuse alveolar damage in every death due to COVID-19 played some role. The average decedent was middle-aged, male, American Indian, and overweight with comorbidities that included diabetes, ethanolism, and atherosclerotic and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease. Macroscopic thrombotic events were seen in 35% of cases consisting of pulmonary thromboemboli and coronary artery thrombi. In 2 cases, severe bacterial coinfections were seen in the lungs. Those determined to die with but not of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection had unremarkable lung findings.","Jackson, Nicole R; Zeigler, Karen; Torrez, Mary; Makino, Yohsuke; Adolphi, Natalie L; Lathrop, Sarah; Decker, Lauren; Dvorscak, Lauren; Proe, Lori; Paul, Ian D; Zumwalt, Ross; Jarrell, Heather",Am J Forensic Med Pathol,,138

The biggest cluster of cases occurred in Lombardy, the most populous Italian region, and elderly men were the population hit in the hardest way. Besides its high infectivity, COVID-19 causes a severe cytokine storm and old people, especially those with comorbidities, appear to be the most vulnerable, presumably in connection to inflammaging. In centenarians inflammaging is much lower than predicted by their chronological age and females, presenting survival advantage in almost all centenarian populations, outnumber males, a phenomenon particularly evident in Northern Italy. Within this scenario, we wondered if: a) the COVID-19 mortality in centenarians was lower than that in people aged between 50 and 80 and b) the mortality from COVID-19 in nonagenarians and centenarians highlighted gender differences.We checked COVID-19-related vulnerability/mortality at the peak of infection (March 2020), using data on total deaths (i.e. not only confirmed COVID-19 cases).

Our objective was to describe baseline characteristics, ventilatory parameters, and outcomes of critically ill patients in the largest referral center for COVID-19 in Sao Paulo, Brazil, during the first surge of the pandemic. METHODS: This cohort included COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of an academic hospital with 94 ICU beds, a number expanded to 300 during the pandemic as part of a state preparedness plan. Data included demographics, advanced life support therapies, and ventilator parameters. The main outcome was 28-day survival. We used a multivariate Cox model to test the association between protective ventilation and survival, adjusting for PF ratio, pH, compliance, and PEEP. RESULTS: We included 1503 patients from March 30 to June 30, 2020. The mean age was 60 ± 15 years, and 59% were male. During 28-day follow-up, 1180 (79%) patients needed invasive ventilation and 666 (44%) died. For the 984 patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation in the first 24 h of ICU stay, mean tidal volume was 6.5 ± 1.3 mL/kg of ideal body weight, plateau pressure was 24 ± 5 cmH2O, respiratory system compliance was 31.9 (24.4-40.9) mL/cmH2O, and 82% of patients were ventilated with protective ventilation. Noninvasive ventilation was used in 21% of patients, and prone, in 36%. Compliance was associated with survival and did not show a bimodal pattern that would support the presence of two phenotypes. In the multivariable model, protective ventilation (aHR 0.73 [95%CI 0.57-0.94]), adjusted for PF ratio, compliance, PEEP, and arterial pH, was independently associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: During the peak of the epidemic in Sao Paulo, critically ill patients with COVID-19 often required mechanical ventilation and mortality was high. Our findings revealed an association between mechanical ventilation strategy and mortality, highlighting the importance of protective ventilation for patients with COVID-19.","Ferreira, Juliana C; Ho, Yeh-Li; Besen, Bruno Adler Maccagnan Pinheiro; Malbouisson, Luiz Marcelo Sa; Taniguchi, Leandro Utino; Mendes, Pedro Vitale; Costa, Eduardo Leite Vieira; Park, Marcelo; Daltro-Oliveira, Renato; Roepke, Roberta M L; Silva-Jr, Joao M; Carmona, Maria Jose Carvalho; Carvalho, Carlos R R",Ann Intensive Care,,138

METHODS: Observational analysis of the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey from 2005 to 2015. Primary outcomes were hospital-based ED closure and merger. Secondary outcomes were yearly ED visits per hospital-based ED and yearly hospital admissions per hospital bed. RESULTS: The total number of hospital-based EDs decreased from 4,500 in 2005 to 4,460 in 2015, with 200 closures, 138 mergers, and 160 new hospital-based EDs. While yearly ED visits per hospital-based ED exhibited a 28.6% relative increase (from 25,083 to 32,248), yearly hospital admissions per hospital bed had a 3.3% relative increase (from 45.4 to 43.9) from 2005 to 2015. The number of hospital admissions and hospital beds did not change significantly in urban areas and declined in rural areas. ED visits grew more uniformly across urban and rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The number of hospital-based ED closures is small when accounting for mergers, but occurs as many more patients are presenting to a stable number of EDs in larger health systems, though rural areas may differentially affected. EDs were managing accelerating patient volumes alongside stagnant inpatient bed capacity.","Venkatesh, Arjun K; Janke, Alexander; Rothenberg, Craig; Chan, Edwin; Becher, Robert D",PLoS One,,138

303713,Introduction to the genomics of infectious diseases,2020,"In December 2019, when the whole world is waiting for Christmas and New Year, the physicians of Wuhan, China, are astounded by clusters of patients suffering from pneumonia from unknown causes. The pathogen isolated from the respiratory epithelium of the patients is similar to previously known coronaviruses with some distinct features. The disease was initially called nCoV-2019 or SARS-nCoV-2 and later termed as COVID-19 by WHO. The infection is rapidly propagating from the day of emergence, spread throughout the globe and now became a pandemic which challenged the competencies of developed nations in terms of health care management. As per WHO report, 216 countries are affected with SARS-CoV-19 by August 5, 2020 with 18, 142, 718 confirmed cases and 691,013 deaths reports. Such huge mortality and morbidity rates are truly threatening and calls for some aggressive and effective measures to slow down the disease transmission. The scientists are constantly engaged in finding a potential solution to diagnose and treat the pandemic. Various FDA approved drugs with the previous history of antiviral potency are repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. Different drugs and vaccines are under clinical trials and some rapid and effective diagnostic tools are also under development. In this review, we have highlighted the current epidemiology through infographics, disease transmission and progression, clinical features and diagnosis and possible therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. The article mainly focused on the development and possible application of various FDA approved drugs, including chloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, nefamostate mesylate, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, ribavirin etc., vaccines under development and various registered clinical trials exploring different therapeutic measures for the treatment of COVID-19.

306208,Actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex plays a critical role in the aquaporin-2 exocytotic pathway,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic is still spreading globally. Contact tracing is a vital strategy in epidemic emergency management; however, traditional contact tracing faces many limitations in practice. The application of digital technology provides an opportunity for local governments to trace the contacts of individuals with COVID-19 more comprehensively, efficiently, and precisely. OBJECTIVE: Our research aimed to provide new solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional contact tracing by introducing the organizational process, technical process, and main achievements of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province. METHODS: A graph database algorithm, which can efficiently process complex relational networks, was applied in Hainan Province; this algorithm relies on a governmental big data platform to analyze multisource COVID-19 epidemic data and build networks of relationships among high-risk infected individuals, the general population, vehicles, and public places to identify and trace contacts. We summarized the organizational and technical process of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province based on interviews and data analyses. RESULTS: An integrated emergency management command system and a multi-agency coordination mechanism were formed during the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hainan Province. The collection, storage, analysis, and application of multisource epidemic data were realized based on the government's big data platform using a centralized model. The graph database algorithm is compatible with this platform and can analyze multisource and heterogeneous big data related to the epidemic. These practices were used to quickly and accurately identify and trace 10,871 contacts among hundreds of thousands of epidemic data records; 378 closest contacts and a number of public places with high risk of infection were identified. A confirmed patient was found after quarantine measures were implemented by all contacts. CONCLUSIONS: During the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic, Hainan Province used a graph database algorithm to trace contacts in a centralized model, which can identify infected individuals and high-risk public places more quickly and accurately. This practice can provide support to government agencies to implement precise, agile, and evidence-based emergency management measures and improve the responsiveness of the public health emergency response system. Strengthening data security, improving tracing accuracy, enabling intelligent data collection, and improving data-sharing mechanisms and technologies are directions for optimizing digital contact tracing.","Mao, Zijun; Yao, Hong; Zou, Qi; Zhang, Weiting; Dong, Ying",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,138

To investigate metabolic effects of SARS-COV-2 infection, we evaluated serum metabolites of COVID-19 patients (n = 33; diagnosed by nucleic acid testing), as compared to COVID-19-negative controls (n = 16). Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses identified altered tryptophan metabolism into the kynurenine pathway, which regulates inflammation and immunity. Indeed, these changes in tryptophan metabolism correlated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism was also seen in infected patients, with altered levels of most amino acids, along with increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and renal dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis. Interestingly, metabolite levels in these pathways correlated with clinical laboratory markers of inflammation (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and renal function (i.e., blood urea nitrogen). In conclusion, this initial observational study identified amino acid and fatty acid metabolism as correlates of COVID-19, providing mechanistic insights, potential markers of clinical severity, and potential therapeutic targets.","Thomas, Tiffany; Stefanoni, Davide; Reisz, Julie A; Nemkov, Travis; Bertolone, Lorenzo; Francis, Richard O; Hudson, Krystalyn E; Zimring, James C; Hansen, Kirk C; Hod, Eldad A; Spitalnik, Steven L; D039,; Alessandro, Angelo",JCI insight,,138
307437,"Aptamers, the bivalent agents as probes and therapies for coronavirus infections: A systematic review",2020,"OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Fecal calprotectin (CLP) is widely known for its detection in stools of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), to investigate the intestinal inflammatory status. Current research is promoting the circulating protein role as a systemic inflammatory marker. However, most studies report serum calprotectin analysis although plasma assay prevents its massive release by granulocytes. In this perspective, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic deserves deployment of convenient and easy-to-dose markers that could reliably address the state of infection. METHODS: We analyzed serum circulating calprotectin (cCLP) levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and plasma cCLP levels from patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, then assessed negative or positive on molecular tests. RESULTS: Our results confirm a significant circulating calprotectin increase in infected subjects respect to controls, in serum and plasma. Moreover, plasma calprotectin has higher levels in suspected patients with positive SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR, compared to suspected patients with negative SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR. Furthermore, ROC curves results showed the circulating plasma calprotectin discriminatory ability to differentiate infected SARS-CoV-2 patients at a cutoff value greater than 131.3 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Our data propose circulating calprotectin as a new, quantitative and predictive marker, which in addition to being an interesting generic inflammatory marker may provide important indications in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cherubini, Fabio; Cristiano, Antonio; Valentini, Alessandra; Bernardini, Sergio; Nuccetelli, Marzia",Inflamm Res,,138

ACE2 expression may be associated with COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. Routinely prescribed drugs that up- or down-regulate ACE2 expression are, therefore, of critical research interest as agents that might promote or reduce risk of COVID-19 infection in a susceptible population. AIM: To collate evidence on routinely prescribed drug treatments in the UK that could up- or down-regulate ACE2, and thus potentially affect COVID-19 infection. DESIGN & SETTING: Systematic review of studies published in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to 1 April 2020. METHOD: A systematic review will be conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Inclusion criteria will be: (1) assesses the effect of drug exposure on ACE2 level of expression or activity; (2) the drug is included in the British National Formulary (BNF) and, therefore, available to prescribe in the UK; and (3) a control, placebo, or sham group is included as comparator. Exclusion criteria will be: (1) ACE2 measurement in utero; (2) ACE2 measurement in children aged <18 years; (3) drug not in the BNF; and (4) review article. Quality will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for human studies, and the SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool for animal studies. RESULTS: Data will be reported in summary tables and narrative synthesis. CONCLUSION: This systematic review will identify drug therapies that may increase or decrease ACE2 expression. This might identify medications increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission, or as targets for intervention in mitigating transmission.","Dambha-Miller, Hajira; Albasri, Ali; Hodgson, Sam; Wilcox, Christopher; Islam, Nazrul; Khan, Shareen; Little, Paul; Griffin, Simon",,,138
308429,A new threat from an old enemy: Re­emergence of coronavirus (Review),2020,Epidemic data show the existence of a region of quasi-linear growth (strolling period) of infected cases extending in between waves. We demonstrate that this constitutes evidence for the existence of near time-scale invariance that is neatly encoded via complex fixed points in the epidemic Renormalisation Group approach. As a result we achieve a deeper understanding of multiple wave dynamics and its inter-wave strolling regime. Our results are tested and calibrated against the COVID-19 pandemic data. Because of the simplicity of our approach that is organised around symmetry principles our discovery amounts to a paradigm shift in the way epidemiological data are mathematically modelled.,"Cacciapaglia, Giacomo; Sannino, Francesco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08861v1.pdf,138
308430,A new threat from an old enemy: Re­emergence of coronavirus (Review),2020,"The biotin metabolism of the Gram-negative facultative chemolithoautotrophic bacterium Ralstonia eutropha (syn. Cupriavidus necator), that is used for production in industry, was investigated. A biotin auxotroph mutant lacking bioF was generated, and biotin depletion in the cells as well as the minimal biotin demand of a biotin auxotroph R. eutropha strain were determined. Three consecutive cultivations in biotin free medium were necessary to prevent growth of the auxotroph mutant, and 40 ng/ml biotin were sufficient to promote cell growth. Nevertheless, 200 ng/ml biotin were necessary to ensure growth comparable to that of the wildtype which is similar to the demand of biotin auxotroph mutants among other prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes. A phenotypic complementation of the R. eutropha &#916;bioF mutant was only achieved by homologous expression of bioF of R. eutropha or heterologous expression of bioF of Bacillus subtilis but not by bioF of Escherichia coli Together with the results from bioinformatic analysis of BioFs, this leads to the assumption that the intermediate of biotin synthesis in R. eutropha is pimeloyl-CoA instead of pimeloyl-ACP like in the Gram-positive B. subtilis Internal biotin content was enhanced by homologous expression of accB whereas homologous expression of accB and accC2 in combination led to decreased biotin concentrations in the cells. Although a DNA-binding domain of the regulator protein BirA is missing, biotin synthesis seemed to be influenced by the amount of acceptor protein present.Importance Ralstonia eutropha is applied in industry for the production of biopolymers and serves as a research platform for the production of diverse fine chemicals. Due to its ability to grow on hydrogen and carbon dioxide as sole carbon and energy source, R. eutropha is often utilized for metabolic engineering to convert cheap resources into value added products. The understanding of the metabolic pathways in this bacterium is mandatory for further bio-engineering of the strain and for the development of new strategies for biotechnological productions.","Eggers, Jessica; Strittmatter, Carl Simon; Küsters, Kira; Biller, Emre; Steinbüchel, Alexander",,,138

311915,Sample adequacy controls for infectious disease diagnosis by oral swabbing,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients at high risk of severe forms of COVID-19 frequently suffer from chronic diseases, but other risk factors may also play a role. Environmental stressors, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can contribute to certain chronic diseases and might aggravate the course of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To explore putative links between EDCs and COVID-19 severity, an integrative systems biology approach was constructed and applied. METHODS: As a first step, relevant data sets were compiled from major data sources. Biological associations of major EDCs to proteins were extracted from the CompTox database. Associations between proteins and diseases known as important COVID-19 comorbidities were obtained from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. Based on these data, we developed a tripartite network (EDCs-proteins-diseases) and used it to identify proteins overlapping between the EDCs and the diseases. Signaling pathways for common proteins were then investigated by over-representation analysis. RESULTS: We found several statistically significant pathways that may be dysregulated by EDCs and that may also be involved in COVID-19 severity. The Th17 and the AGE/RAGE signaling pathways were particularly promising. CONCLUSIONS: Pathways were identified as possible targets of EDCs and as contributors to COVID-19 severity, thereby highlighting possible links between exposure to environmental chemicals and disease development. This study also documents the application of computational systems biology methods as a relevant approach to increase the understanding of molecular mechanisms linking EDCs and human diseases, thereby contributing to toxicology prediction.","Wu, Qier; Coumoul, Xavier; Grandjean, Philippe; Barouki, Robert; Audouze, Karine",Environ Int,,138

312833,SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Vaccines: The Promises and the Challenges Ahead,2021,"BACKGROUND: The number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases has rapidly increased all over the world. Specific information about immunity in non-survivors with COVID-19 is scarce. This study aimed to analyse the clinical characteristics and abnormal immunity of the confirmed COVID-19 non-survivors. METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 125 patients with COVID-19 who were died between January 13 and March 4, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. A total of 414 randomly recruited patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were discharged from the same hospital during the same period served as control. The demographic, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings at admission, and treatment used in these patients were collected. The immunity-related risk factors associated with in-hospital death were tested by logistic regression models and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Non-survivors (70 years, IQR: 61.5-80) were significantly older than survivors (54 years, IQR: 37-65) (P < 0.001). 56.8% of non-survivors was male. Nearly half of the patients (44.9%) had chronic medical illness. In non-survivors, hypertension (49.6%) was the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes (20.0%) and coronary heart disease (16.0%). The common signs and symptoms at admission of non-survivors were fever (88%), followed by cough (64.8%), dyspnea (62.4%), fatigue (62.4%) and chest tightness (58.4%). Compared with survivors, non-survivors had higher white blood cell (WBC) count (7.85 vs 5.07 × 109/L), more elevated neutrophil count (6.41 vs 3.08 × 109/L), smaller lymphocyte count (0.69 vs 1.20 × 109/L) and lower platelet count (172 vs 211 × 109/L), raised concentrations of procalcitonin (0.21 vs 0.06 ng/mL) and CRP (70.5 vs 7.2 mg/L) (P < 0.001). This was accompanied with significantly decreased levels of CD3+ T cells (277 vs 814 cells/µl), CD4+ T cells (172 vs 473 cells/µl), CD8+ T cells (84 vs 262.5 cells/µl, P < 0.001), CD19+ T cells (88 vs 141 cells/µl) and CD16+ 56+ T cells (79 vs 128.5 cells/µl) (P < 0.001). The concentrations of immunoglobulins (Ig) G (13.30 vs 11.95 g/L), IgA (2.54 vs 2.21 g/L), and IgE (71.30 vs 42.25 IU/ml) were increased, whereas the levels of complement proteins (C)3 (0.89 vs 0.99 g/L) and C4 (0.22 vs 0.24 g/L) were decreased in non-survivors when compared with survivors (all P < 0.05). The non-survivors presented lower levels of oximetry saturation (90 vs 97%) at rest and lactate (2.40 vs 1.90 mmol/L) (P < 0.001). Old age, comorbidity of malignant tumor, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, low CD4+ T cells, decreased C3, and low oximetry saturation were the risk factors of death in patients with confirmed COVID-19. The frequency of CD4+ T cells positively correlated with the numbers of lymphocytes (r = 0.787) and the level of oximetry saturation (r = 0.295), Whereas CD4+ T cells were negatively correlated with age (r =-0.323) and the numbers of neutrophils (r = - 0.244) (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal cellular immunity and humoral immunity were key features of non-survivors with COVID-19. Neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, low CD4+ T cells, and decreased C3 were immunity-related risk factors predicting mortality of patients with COVID-19.","Zhao, Yang; Nie, Han-Xiang; Hu, Ke; Wu, Xiao-Jun; Zhang, Yun-Ting; Wang, Meng-Mei; Wang, Tao; Zheng, Zhi-Shui; Li, Xiao-Chen; Zeng, Shao-Lin",Infect Dis Poverty,,138

Initial response to this pandemic involved the development, production, and distribution of diagnostic molecular assays at an unprecedented rate, leading to minimal validation requirements and concerns regarding their diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. In addition to molecular testing, serological assays to detect antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now becoming available from numerous diagnostic manufacturers. In both cases, the lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for appropriate clinical use. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and management. This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight against this ongoing pandemic.

317477,Coronavirus infection and ophthalmology,2020,"With the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), measures are needed to detect social distancing and prevent further infection. In this paper, we propose a system that detects social distancing in indoor environments and identifies the movement path and contact objects according to the presence or absence of an infected person. This system detects objects through frames of video data collected from a closed-circuit television using You Only Look Once (v. 4) and assigns and tracks object IDs using DeepSORT, a multiple object tracking algorithm. Next, the coordinates of the detected object are transformed by image warping the area designated by the top angle composition in the original frame. The converted coordinates are matched with the actual map to measure the distance between objects and detect the social distance. If an infected person is present, the object that violates the movement path and social distancing of the infected person is detected using the ID assigned to each object. The proposed system can be used to prevent the rapid spread of infection by detecting social distancing and detecting and tracking objects according to the presence of infected persons.","Shin, Minchan Moon Nammee",Sustainability,,138

Within the same week, our Department of Anaesthesia and Critical Care at University Hospital Galway began to tackle the educational challenge by developing an in situ interprofessional simulation programme to prepare staff for the impending outbreak.Principles and approaches used for simulation-based trainingWe describe principles applied to identify core educational and system engineering objectives to prepare healthcare workers (HCWs) for infection control, personal and psychological safety, technical and crisis resource management skills. We discuss application of educational theories, rationale for simulation modes and debriefing techniques.Development of the simulation programme3 anaesthesia (general, obstetric, paediatric) and 1 critical care silo were created. 13 simulated scenarios were developed for teaching as well as for testing workflows specific to the outbreak. To support HCWs and ensure safety, management guidelines, cognitive aids and checklists were developed using simulation. The cumulative number of HCWs trained in simulation was 750 over a 4-week period.Challenges and future directionsDue to the protracted nature of the pandemic, simulation educators should address questions related to sustainability, infection control while delivering simulation, establishment of hybrid programmes and support for psychological preparedness.","Contreras, Maya Curran Emer Ross Mark Moran Peter Sheehan Ann Brennan Aoife Marie Cosgrave David McElwain Jennifer Lavelle Claire Lynch Bonnie",BMJ Simulation &amp; Technology Enhanced Learning,,138

Clinical studies have found that the virus can cause dyspnea, pneumonia and other cardiopulmonary system damage. In severe cases, it can lead to respiratory failure and even death. Although there are currently no effective drugs or vaccines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, the patient's prognosis recovery can be effectively improved by ameliorating the dysfunction of the respiratory system, cardiovascular systems, and immune function. Intermittent hypoxic preconditioning (IHP) as a new non-drug treatment has been applied in the clinical and rehabilitative practice for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, and other diseases. Many clinical studies have confirmed that IHP can improve the cardiopulmonary function of patients and increase the cardiorespiratory fitness and the tolerance of tissues and organs to ischemia. This article introduces the physiological and biochemical functions of IHP and proposes the potential application plan of IHP for the rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19, so as to provide a better prognosis for patients and speed up the recovery of the disease. The aim of this narrative review is to propose possible causes and pathophysiology of COVID-19 based on the mechanisms of the oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune response, and to provide a new, safe and efficacious strategy for the better rehabilitation from COVID-19.","Cai, M.; Chen, X.; Shan, J.; Yang, R.; Guo, Q.; Bi, X.; Xu, P.; Shi, X.; Chu, L.; Wang, L.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,,138

METHODS: Patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19 were included, while healthy patients formed the historic control group. All patients underwent an ophthalmological examination, including macular and optic nerve optical coherence tomography. In the case group, socio-demographic data, medical history, and neurological symptoms were collected. RESULTS: One hundred sixty patients were included; 90 recovered COVID-19 patients and 70 controls. COVID-19 patients presented increases in global RNFLT (mean difference 4.3; CI95% 0.8 to 7.7), nasal superior (mean difference 6.9; CI95% 0.4 to 13.4), and nasal inferior (mean difference 10.2; CI95% 2.4 to 18.1) sectors of peripapillary RNFLT.

341246,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment patterns in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma,2020,"BACKGROUND: The presence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is an indicator of protective immunity for most viral infections. A newly developed surrogate viral neutralization assay (sVNT) offers the ability to detect total receptor binding domain-targeting NAbs in an isotype-independent manner, increasing the test sensitivity. Thus, specimens with low IgM/ IgG antibody levels showed strong neutralization activity in sVNT. METHODS: This study aimed to measure the %inhibition of NAbs measured by sVNT in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. The sensitivity of sVNT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its kinetics were determined. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study. Majority of the patients were 21-40 years old (67%) and 63% had mild symptoms. The sensitivity of sVNT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 99% (95% confidence interval (CI) 94.4-100%) and the specificity was 100% (95% CI 98.3-100%). The negative predictive value of sVNT from the samples collected before and after 7 days of symptom onset was 99.5% (95% CI 97.4-100%) and 100% (95% CI 93.8-100%), respectively. The level of inhibition at days 8-14 were significantly higher than days 0-7 (p<0.001). The median %inhibition values by severity of COVID-19 symptoms were 79.9% (interquartile range (IQR) 49.7-91.8%); 89.0% (IQR 71.2-92.4%); and 86.6% (IQR 69.5-92.8%), for mild, moderate and severe/critical symptoms respectively. The median level of sVNT %inhibition of severe was significantly higher than the mild group (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The sVNT is a practical and robust serological test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and does not require specialized biosafety containment. It can be used clinically to aid diagnosis in both early and late infection especially in cases when the real-time RT-PCR results in weakly negative or weakly positive, and to determine the protective immune response from SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients.","Putcharoen, Opass; Wacharapluesadee, Supaporn; Chia, Wan Ni; Paitoonpong, Leilani; Tan, Chee Wah; Suwanpimolkul, Gompol; Jantarabenjakul, Watsamon; Ruchisrisarod, Chanida; Wanthong, Phanni; Sophonphan, Jiratchaya; Chariyavilaskul, Pajaree; Wang, Lin-Fa; Hemachudha, Thiravat",PLoS One,,138

Underserved communities already battling the opioid epidemic had new challenges in accessing medication assisted treatment (MAT). The investigators sought to determine if patients were retaining access to their opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and maintaining sobriety during the pandemic, with the intention of using this information to improve subsequent patient care while the pandemic continues. METHODS: In the assessment, seventy-five patient Epic EMR (electronic medical record) charts were reviewed to collect information on demographics, socioeconomic factors, healthcare access and sobriety during the pandemic period between March 1st, 2020 and June 15th, 2020. Patient charts were selected based on those receiving office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) for OUD at an urban healthcare center. RESULTS: 98.7% of patients accessed the healthcare center in some form since March 1st, 2020. The most common form of communication was through telemedicine with 94.6% of calls over audio. Out of the 21 toxicology screens performed during the pandemic period, 16 (76%) patients were found to be adhering to their buprenorphine treatment. Only 78.7% had documented they had Narcan at their disposal. Among all patients, 11 (14.6%) reoccurrences in opioid use were documented during the pandemic period. Few patients (76%) were adhering to their prescribed buprenorphine treatment, revealing that patients may not be receiving needed MAT support amid the pandemic.

Over 1.4 million adults in the United States are currently incarcerated in state and federal prisons and over 80,000 individuals are incarcerated in local jails. Correctional settings are often deprived, overcrowded, and unsanitary environments, which do not lend themselves to the prevention, treatment, or recovery from illness. Incarcerated individuals are at a much higher risk to become infected due to a variety of factors, such as generally higher rates of chronic conditions than the community and overall lack of screening for certain illnesses.

Given the critical role of virus-host interactions in the viral life cycle, the development of entry or shedding inhibitors may expand the current repertoire of antiviral agents; the combination of antireplication inhibitors and entry or shedding inhibitors would create a multifaceted drug cocktail with a tandem antiviral mechanism. Therefore, we provide critical information about triterpenoids as potential antiviral agents targeting entry and release, focusing specifically on the emerging aspect of triterpenoid-mediated inhibition of a variety of virus-host membrane fusion mechanisms via a trimer-of-hairpin motif. These properties of triterpenoids supply their host an evolutionary advantage for chemical defense and may protect against an increasingly diverse array of viruses infecting mammals, providing a direction for antiviral drug discovery.","Li, Haiwei; Sun, Jiaqi; Xiao, Sulong; Zhang, Lihe; Zhou, Demin",,,138

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we developed a predictive model to estimate the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period among 34 provincial regions in China. Our main assumption was that blood donors of all ages in different regions have a stable blood donation intention and the same infection risk. RESULTS: First, we estimated the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, and China, from December 31, 2019 to March 17, 2020. Second, we compared the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period in all provinces across China. In addition, we found that if all RBCs, plasma, and cryoprecipitation were stored in isolation until the 14th day, the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood transfusion was reduced by at least 65.77% after the blood donor safely passed the COVID-19 incubation period. Moreover, if the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was carried out on all platelets, the potential risk would be reduced by 77.48%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk is low, with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 and the appearance of alarmingly high infectivity and a high fatality rate, appropriate measures should be taken by health departments to ensure the safety of clinical blood.","Yuan, Zhaohu; Chen, Dandan; Chen, Xiaojie; Wei, Yaming",Transfusion,,138

METHODS: We acquired information and data on general information on and infection and death status of HCWs in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak and completed statistical analyses. RESULTS: We obtained the data on 2457 infected cases among HCWs in Wuhan, China. More than half of the infected individuals were nurses (52.06%), whereas 33.62% of infected cases were doctors and 14.33% of cases were medical staff. In particular, the case infection rate of nurses (2.22%) was remarkably higher than that of doctors (1.92%). Most infected cases among HCWs were female (72.28%). A majority of the infected HCWs (89.26%) came from general hospitals, followed by specialized hospitals (5.70%) and community hospitals (5.05%). The case infection rate of HCWs (2.10%) was dramatically higher than that of non-HCWs (0.43%). The case fatality rate of HCWs (0.69%) was significantly lower than that of non-HCWs (5.30%). CONCLUSIONS: The infection risk of HCWs is clearly higher than that of non-HCWs. HCWs play an essential role in fighting the pandemic. The analysis of the infection status of HCWs is essential to attract enough attention from the public, provide effective suggestions for government agencies, and improve protective measures for HCWs.","Zheng, Lichun; Wang, Xiang; Zhou, Chongchong; Liu, Qin; Li, Shuang; Sun, Qin; Wang, Mengjia; Zhou, Qian; Wang, Wenmei",Clin Infect Dis,,138

However, there is no existing review of environmental and epidemiologic methods applied to measure stillbirths resulting from exposure to ambient temperatures during pregnancy. The objective of this study is to systematically review published methods, data sources, and data linkage practices to characterize associations between ambient temperature and stillbirth to inform stillbirth prevention and risk management strategies. METHODS: A systematic review of published studies that assess the association between ambient temperature exposure during pregnancy using any measures or approach and stillbirth was undertaken in Cochrane Library, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science of studies (2000-2020, inclusive). Selection of studies were assessed by pre-specified eligibility criteria and documented using PRISMA. Citations were managed using EndNote X8 whilst selection, reviewing, and data extraction were performed using Covidence. The screening, selection, and data extraction process consisted of two blind, independent reviews followed by a tertiary independent review. An adapted Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist was used to assess quality and bias. The main findings and characteristics of all studies was extracted and summarized. Where appropriate, a meta-analysis will be performed for measures of association. RESULTS: Among 538 original records, 12 eligible articles were identified that analysed associations between ambient temperature exposure and stillbirth for 42,848 stillbirths among 3.4 million births across seven countries. Varied definitions of stillbirth were reported based on gestational age, birthweight, both, or neither. The overall rate of stillbirth ranged from 1.9 to 38.4 per 1000 among six high-income countries and one low-middle-income country. All study designs were retrospective and included ten cohort studies, three case-crossover studies, and two additional case-control subgroup analysis. Exposure data for ambient temperature was mostly derived from standard municipal or country-level monitors based on weather stations (66.6%) or a forecasting model (16.7%); otherwise, not reported (16.7%). Results were not statistically pooled for a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of methods and models among included studies. All studies reported associations of increased risk of stillbirth with ambient temperature exposures throughout pregnancy, particularly in late pregnancy. One study estimates 17-19% (PAR) of stillbirths are potentially attributable to chronic exposure to hot and cold ambient temperatures during pregnancy. Overall, risk of stillbirth was observed to increase below 15 °C and above 23.4 °C, where highest risk is above 29.4 °C. CONCLUSION: Exposure to hot and cold temperatures during pregnancy may increase the risk of stillbirth, although a clear causative mechanism remains unknown. Despite lack of causal evidence, existing evidence across diverse settings observed similar effects of increased risk of stillbirth using a variety of statistical and methodological approaches for exposure assessments, exposure windows, and data linkage. Managing exposure to ambient temperatures during pregnancy could potentially decrease risk of stillbirth, particularly among women in low-resource settings where access to safe antenatal and obstetric care is challenging. To fully understand the effects or dose-response relationship of maternal exposure to ambient temperatures and stillbirth, future studies should focus on biological mechanisms and contributing factors in addition to improving measurement of ambient temperature exposure.","Sexton, Jessica; Andrews, Christine; Carruthers, Selina; Kumar, Sailesh; Flenady, Vicki; Lieske, Scott",Environ Res,,138

Prototypical areas of interest include linear heat transfer and linear structural dynamics problems modeled with partial differential equations (PDEs). While different algorithms for direct integration of the equations of motion exist, exploring all feasible behaviors for varying loads, initial states and fluxes in models with large numbers of degrees of freedom remains a challenging task. In this article we propose a novel approach, based in set propagation methods and motivated by recent advances in the field of Reachability Analysis. Assuming a set of initial states and inputs, the proposed method consists in the construction of a union of sets (flowpipe) that enclose the infinite number of solutions of the spatially discretized PDE. We present the numerical results obtained in five examples to illustrate the capabilities of our approach, and compare its performance against reference numerical integration methods. We conclude that, for problems with single known initial conditions, the proposed method is accurate. For problems with uncertain initial conditions included in sets, the proposed method can compute all the solutions of the system more efficiently than numerical integration methods.","Forets, Marcelo; Caporale, Daniel Freire; Zerpa, Jorge M.

METHODOLOGY: This paper reports the results of an observational study on the extent of antibiotic use in 52 randomly selected patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the University Hospital in Pristina, Kosovo with severe forms of COVID-19. RESULTS: Antibiotics were prescribed in all the cases (52; 100%). Of the 52 patients, 1) 13 (25%) were given antibiotics before hospitalisation, 2) 49 (94.2%) during treatment in the ward and 3) 52 (100%) during treatment in the ICU. Most often, empirical antibiotics were administered in 32 cases (61.5%) to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, and in 23 patients (44.2%) to treat atypical pathogens. The most prescribed antibiotics were ceftriaxone/cefotaxime plus macrolide in (17 cases; 32.7%), ceftriaxone/cefotaxime in (15 cases; 28.8%), ampicillin/amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid or sulbactam (five cases; 9.6%), and quinolones (five cases; 9.6%). Imipenem was the most frequently used antibiotic in the ICU (30 cases; 57.7%), followed by ceftriaxone (28 cases; 53.8%), and piperacillin/tazobactam and fluoroquinolone (17 cases; 32.7%). In 18 cases (34.6%), three antibiotics were given simultaneously; two antibiotics in 29 cases (55.8%) and in five cases (9.6%) only one antibiotic was given. The mean duration of antibiotic treatment was 12.71 days (3-22 days; SD 4.026). CONCLUSIONS: The study showed unrestricted use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the treatment of severe cases with COVID-19.","Mustafa, Lirim; Tolaj, Ilir; Baftiu, Nehat; Fejza, Hajrullah",J Infect Dev Ctries,,138

377708,In search of the origin of Corona virus,2020-08-25,"A global COVID-19 pandemic, rising asthma and allergies - along with climate change impacting storm intensity and frequency - point to an urgent need to unify U.S. atmospheric biology research. To this end, we briefly define atmospheric biology, summarize its fragmented history and then outline how to unify the field to provide benefits for the U.S. science community and its citizens. Atmospheric biology refers to the study of concentrations, sources, sinks, transformation and impacts of airborne microorganisms inclusive of pollen, fungal spores, algae, lichens, bacteria, viruses, cellulose fibers, and other biomolecules or fragments of cells. Here our focus is biological particles, both respirable (PM10 ) and systemic (PM2.5 ). Due to its interdisciplinary dependencies and broadness of scales from nanometers to kilometers, atmospheric biology research is highly fragmented in the U.S. science community. It lacks shared paradigms and common vocabulary. This deficit calls for recognizing atmospheric biology as a research community in its own right, thereby linking human health to climate change. We need to recognize atmospheric biology's importance to national security and science diplomacy.

With no specific and effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19, new or repurposed antiviral are urgently needed. Phytochemicals pose a ray of hope for human health during this pandemic, and a great deal of research is concentrated on it. Phytochemicals have been used as antiviral agents against several viruses since they could inhibit several viruses via different mechanisms of direct inhibition either at the viral entry point or the replication stages and via immunomodulation potentials. Recent evidence also suggests that some plants and its components have shown promising antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes certain phytochemical agents along with their mode of actions and potential antiviral activities against important viral pathogens. A special focus has been given on medicinal plants and their extracts as well as herbs which have shown promising results to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be useful in treating patients with COVID-19 as alternatives for treatment under phytotherapy approaches during this devastating pandemic situation.","Anand, Arumugam Vijaya; Balamuralikrishnan, Balasubramanian; Kaviya, Mohandass; Bharathi, Kathirvel; Parithathvi, Aluru; Arun, Meyyazhagan; Senthilkumar, Nachiappan; Velayuthaprabhu, Shanmugam; Saradhadevi, Muthukrishnan; Al-Dhabi, Naif Abdullah; Arasu, Mariadhas Valan; Yatoo, Mohammad Iqbal; Tiwari, Ruchi; Dhama, Kuldeep",Molecules (Basel),,138

Presently, emergency surgery for patients with suspected COVID-19 is burdensome not only for patients but also for healthcare workers. Therefore, we established a surveillance system in the emergency room and established principles for managing patients suspected of COVID-19 who require emergency surgery. CASE SUMMARY: A 67-year-old man was diagnosed with appendicitis in March 2020. His wife was diagnosed with COVID-19 10 d earlier, and the patient was in close contact with her. The patient tested negative twice on an upper respiratory COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction screening test, but chest X-ray and chest computed tomography revealed patchy ground-glass opacity in both upper lobes of the patient's lungs. The same emergency surgery procedure for patients with confirmed COVID-19 was applied to this patient suspected of having the disease to ensure that surgery was not delayed while waiting for the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results. A few hours after surgery, the upper respiratory tract specimen taken in the emergency room was negative for COVID-19 but the lower respiratory tract specimen was found to be positive for the disease. CONCLUSION: When COVID-19 is suspected, emergency surgery should be performed as for confirmed COVID-19 without delay.","Kim, Changho; Kim, Jong Kun; Yeo, In Hwan; Choe, Jae Young; Lee, Jeong Eun; Kang, So Jeong; Park, Chan Sub; Kwon, Ki Tae; Hwang, Soyoon",World J.

The need for data on the impact of the virus on these patients grows rapidly. There is an urgent necessity of sharing information to enable evidence-based decision making on the clinical management. There are no data on what physicians are doing on clinical practice in Latin American countries. AIM: to investigate current management opinion of Latin American MS and/or NMOSD expert neurologists based on their experience and recommendations. METHODS: we developed a voluntary web-based survey based on hypothetical situations that these patients may encounter, while taking into account the potential risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: 60% of the experts had the possibility of monitoring their patients by telemedicine. Most neurologists postpone magnetic resonance. Laboratory blood tests delay is associated with the type of treatment. Platform therapies, dimethyl-fumarate and natalizumab are considered safe options to initiate in naive patients. CONCLUSION: decision-making about MS and NMOSD patients has become even more complex in order to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Glomerular podocyte injury is a major mechanism that leads to DN. However, the mechanisms underlying podocyte injury are ambiguous. In this study, we sought to investigate the contribution of SET domain-containing protein 6 (SETD6) to the pathogenesis of podocyte injury induced by glucose (GLU) and palmitic acid (PA), as well as the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that GLU and PA treatment significantly decreased SETD6 expression in mouse podocytes. Besides, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assay demonstrated that silencing of SETD6 silence obviously enhanced cell viability, and suppressed apoptosis in GLU and PA-induced podocytes. We also discovered that downregulation of SETD6 suppressed GLU and PA-induced ROS generation and podocyte mitochondrial dysfunction. Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway was involved in the effect of SETD6 on mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, silencing of SETD6 protected mouse podocyte against apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction through activating Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway. Therefore these data provide new insights into new potential therapeutic targets for DN treatment.","Wang, Xiang; Liu, Qiling; Kong, Deqin; Long, Zi; Guo, YuFang; Wang, Shuang; Liu, Rui; Hai, Chunxu",J. mol. histol,,138

389506,Broad neutralization of H1 and H3 viruses by adjuvanted influenza HA stem vaccines in nonhuman primates,2021,"BACKGROUND: To illustrate the extent of transmission, identify affecting risk factors and estimate epidemiological modeling parameters of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in household setting. METHODS: We enrolled 35 confirmed index cases and their 148 household contacts, January 2020-February 2020, in Zhuhai, China. All participants were interviewed and asked to complete questionnaires. Household contacts were then prospectively followed active symptom monitoring through the 21-day period and nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected at 3-7 days intervals. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data (when available) were collected. RESULTS: Assuming that all these secondary cases were infected by their index cases, the second infection rate in household context is 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.4%-44.4%), with 10.4% of secondary cases being asymptomatic. Multivariate analysis showed that household contacts with underlying medical conditions, a history of direct exposure to Wuhan and its surrounding areas, and shared vehicle with an index patient were associated with higher susceptibility. Household members without protective measures after illness onset of the index patient seem to increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median incubation period and serial interval within household were estimated to be 4.3 days (95% CI: 3.4-5.3 days) and 5.1 days (95% CI: 4.3-6.2 days), respectively. CONCLUSION: Early isolation of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and prioritizing rapid contact investigation, followed by active symptom monitoring and periodic laboratory evaluation, should be initiated immediately after confirming patients to address the underlying determinants driving the continuing pandemic.","Wu, Jian; Huang, Yiying; Tu, Changli; Bi, Chunping; Chen, Zhigang; Luo, Liyun; Huang, Mingxing; Chen, Meizhu; Tan, Cuiyan; Wang, Zhenguo; Wang, Kongqiu; Liang, YingJian; Huang, Jin; Zheng, Xiaobin; Liu, Jing",Clin Infect Dis,,138

The scientific interest on COVID-19 increased after WHO declared it a pandemic in the early February of 2020. In fact, this pandemic has had a worldwide impact on economy, health, and lifestyle like no other in the last 100 years. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Coronaviridae family and causes the deadliest clinical manifestations when compared to other viruses in the family. COVID-19 is an emerging zoonotic disease that has resulted in over 383,000 deaths around the world. Scientists are scrambling for ideas to develop treatment and prevention strategies to thwart the disease condition. In this review, we have attempted to summarize the latest information on the virus, disease, prevention, and treatment strategies.

However, not much is known about how (and why) between-district gaps vary among states, even though states are a primary organizational level in the decentralized education system in the United States. Using data from the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA), this study describes state-level socioeconomic achievement gradients and the growth of these gradients from Grades 3 to 8. We also examine state-level correlates of the gradients and their growth, including school system funding equity, preschool enrollment patterns, the distribution of teachers, income inequality, and segregation. We find that socioeconomic gradients and their growth rates vary considerably among states, and that between-district income segregation is positively associated with the socioeconomic achievement gradient.","Jang, Heewon; Reardon, Sean F",AERA Open,,138

SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). COVID-19 is characterized by two phases: the first resembles the flu with pneumonia, but after about seven or eight days the disease suddenly worsens to a sepsis-like syndrome. It is difficult to explain this virus-immune-pathology sequence from virology or immunology only. This paper hypothesizes that host-produced anti-spike protein antibodies are responsible for immune-induced viral dissemination. Subsequently, systemic distribution of virus-antibodies complexes activates the immune pathology observed in severe COVID-19. This hypothesis may be counterintuitive to immunologist that consider many anti-spike antibodies to be virus-neutralizing antibodies. Although anti-spike antibodies may hinder infection of epithelial cells, antibody binding to the spike protein may facilitate virus infection of myeloid leukocytes. If myeloid leukocytes reenter the circulation, they could spread the virus from a locoregional infection to a systemic disease. Disseminated virus in combination with antibodies results in dispersed virus-antibody complexes that overstimulate the immune system. The hypothesis aligns with the sequences of virus, immune and pathological events in COVID-19. The delay in onset from both syndromes results from an immune system still naïve to the non-cross-reactive spike protein. Details of this hypothesis are in concordance with many clinical characteristics of COVID-19, including its predominant lethality for the elderly, and the mostly asymptomatic course of disease in children. It predicts putative detrimental effects of vaccines that induce virus-neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein, as has been shown for other coronaviruses. This hypothesis has consequences for treatment of patients, evaluation of personal and herd immunity and vaccine development. In patients, cellular immunity should be stimulated. Neutralizing antibodies might not be indicative for immunity. Vaccines should aim to stimulate cellular immunity COVID-19 and/or stimulate humoral immunity against viral proteins except for the immunodominant spike protein.","Jacobs, J J L",Med Hypotheses,,138
399566,Characterization of KIR + NKG2A + Eomes- NK-like CD8+ T cells and their decline with age in healthy individuals,2020,"The major focus of this paper is on the sovereign–banks relationship following the COVID-19 pandemic crisis outbreak, with a view to gaining an insight into banks’ exposure to the sovereign. We rely on a series of complementary research approaches, such as desk research, comparative statistical analysis, exploratory learning algorithm, and a deterministic panel regression framework. The analysis reveals that most EU countries were not prepared for the pandemic crisis as they lacked a financial security buffer. The growing fiscal pressure and lockdown restrictions additionally resulted in an increase in banks’ exposure to the government debt market and higher government debt securities exposure on their balance sheets. One of the novelties of the research is the adoption of the gap method in order to measure the changes between banking assets major items (government securities vs. loans) and uncovering the preference for holding a specific type of asset. Additional insight is brought by the clustering solution, which shows increased cross-country heterogeneity in terms of the sovereign–banks relationship. Empirical research shows that banks’ involvement in the sovereign debt market is sensitive mainly to negative information related to pandemic occurrence and, to a lower extent, to positive information reflected by government’s reactions and economic stimulus measures. In addition, our results reveal there is no crowding-out effect triggered by the pandemic, in terms of lending to the sovereign against lending to the real economy. In the pandemic onset banks did not proceed to a sharp portfolio rebalancing in favor of the sovereign.","Boitan, Iustina Alina Marchewka-Bartkowiak Kamilla",Risks,,138

Acute stress and depressive symptoms increased significantly over time as COVID-19 deaths increased across the United States. Preexisting mental and physical health diagnoses, daily COVID-19-related media exposure, conflicting COVID-19 information in media, and secondary stressors were all associated with acute stress and depressive symptoms.

We develop a novel theoretical account, based on existing empirical research, of perceptual and psychological processes that may account for changes in speeding behavior under low traffic volume conditions. These include impaired ability to accurately perceive and control speed due to change in visual information, decreased salience of certain norms about socially appropriate speeds, lower perceived risk of speeding, and increased boredom leading to risk-taking behaviors. Further, we consider that individual attitude functions may account for the observed split in speeding behavior.","Tucker, A; Marsh, K L",Accid Anal Prev,,138

404151,Targeting Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase in Inflammatory and Autoimmune Pathologies,2021,"Transparent objects, such as glass walls and doors, constitute architectural obstacles hindering the mobility of people with low vision or blindness. For instance, the open space behind glass doors is inaccessible, unless it is correctly perceived and interacted with. However, traditional assistive technologies rarely cover the segmentation of these safety-critical transparent objects. In this paper, we build a wearable system with a novel dual-head Transformer for Transparency (Trans4Trans) perception model, which can segment general- and transparent objects. The two dense segmentation results are further combined with depth information in the system to help users navigate safely and assist them to negotiate transparent obstacles. We propose a lightweight Transformer Parsing Module (TPM) to perform multi-scale feature interpretation in the transformer-based decoder. Benefiting from TPM, the double decoders can perform joint learning from corresponding datasets to pursue robustness, meanwhile maintain efficiency on a portable GPU, with negligible calculation increase. The entire Trans4Trans model is constructed in a symmetrical encoder-decoder architecture, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the test sets of Stanford2D3D and Trans10K-v2 datasets, obtaining mIoU of 45.13% and 75.14%, respectively. Through a user study and various pre-tests conducted in indoor and outdoor scenes, the usability and reliability of our assistive system have been extensively verified. Meanwhile, the Tran4Trans model has outstanding performances on driving scene datasets. On Cityscapes, ACDC, and DADA-seg datasets corresponding to common environments, adverse weather, and traffic accident scenarios, mIoU scores of 81.5%, 76.3%, and 39.2% are obtained, demonstrating its high efficiency and robustness for real-world transportation applications.","Zhang, Jiaming; Yang, Kailun; Constantinescu, Angela; Peng, Kunyu; Muller, Karin; Stiefelhagen, Rainer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09174v1.pdf,138
404385,An overview of viral infections of the nervous system in the immunosuppressed,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pudilan (PDL), a four-herb prescription with the traditional function of heat-clearing and detoxifying, has been clinically used as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 infectory agent in China. PDL might also have therapeutic potentials for COVID-19 while the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. METHODS: We used network pharmacology analysis and selected 68 co-targeted genes/proteins as targets of both PDL and COVID-19. These co-targeted genes/proteins were predicted by SwissDock Server for their high-precision docking simulation, and analyzed by STRING for proteins to protein interaction (PPI), pathway and GO (gene ontology) enrichment. The therapeutic effect for PDL treatment on COVID-19 was validated by the TCMATCOV (TCM Anti COVID-19) platform. RESULTS: PDL might prevent the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It might inhibit the cytokine storm by affecting C-reactive protein (CRP), interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), interleukin- 6 (IL-6), interleukin- 10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGFß1), and other proteins. PDL might moderate the immune system to shorten the course of the disease, delay disease progression, and reduce the mortality rate. CONCLUSION: PDL might have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19 through three aspects, including the moderate immune system, anti-inflammation, and anti-virus entry into cells.","Kong, Qi; Wu, Yue; Gu, Yu; Lv, Qi; Qi, Feifei; Gong, Shuran; Chen, Xiuping",Biomed Pharmacother,,138

Of interest, 6 years earlier, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy due to papillary thyroid carcinoma and, in the meantime, she was submitted to mastectomy to treat an invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. In order to explain these lesions, an extensive genetic study was performed. Results showed positivity for the presence of the tumor suppressor gene PALB2, whose presence had already been detected in a niece with breast cancer. The patient underwent different procedures to treat the lesions and currently she is symptom-free over 2 years of follow-up. Learning points: The presence of two rare neoplasms in a single person should raise the suspicion of a common etiology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case that shows the coexistence of DIPNECH and paraganglioma.

409830,Evaluating case definitions for Ebola virus disease,2020,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiac indices can predict disease severity and survival in a multitude of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Herein, we hypothesized that CT-measured cardiac indices are correlated with severity of lung involvement and can predict survival in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent chest CT were enrolled. Cardiac indices including pulmonary artery-to-aorta ratio (PA/A), cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness and EAT density, inferior vena cava diameter, and transverse-to-anteroposterior trachea ratio were measured by non-enhanced CT. Logistic regression and Cox-regression analyses evaluated the association of cardiac indices with patients' outcome (death vs discharge). Linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between the extent of lung involvement (based on CT score) and cardiac indices. RESULTS: Mean (±SD) age of patients was 54.55 (±15.3) years old; 65.5% were male. Increased CTR (>0.49) was seen in 52.9% of patients and was significantly associated with increased odds and hazard of death (odds ratio [OR] = 12.5, pâ¯=â¯0.005; hazard ratio = 11.4, pâ¯=â¯0.006). PA/A >1 was present in 20.7% of patients and displayed a nonsignificant increase in odds of death (ORâ¯=â¯1.9, pâ¯=â¯0.36). Furthermore, extensive lung involvement was positively associated with elevated CTR and increased PA/A (pâ¯=â¯0.001). CONCLUSION: CT-measured cardiac indices might have predictive value regarding survival and extent of lung involvement in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and could possibly be used for the risk stratification of these patients and for guiding therapy decision-making. In particular, increased CTR is prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and is a powerful predictor of mortality.","Eslami, Vahid; Abrishami, Alireza; Zarei, Ehsan; Khalili, Nastaran; Baharvand, Zahra; Sanei-Taheri, Morteza",Acad. radiol,,138

As a social media platform with billions of daily views, YouTube has tremendous potential to both support and hinder public health efforts. However, the usefulness and accuracy of most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 have not been investigated. METHODS: A YouTube search was performed on 21 March 2020 using keywords 'coronavirus' and 'COVID-19', and the top 75 viewed videos from each search were analysed. Videos that were duplicates, non-English, non-audio and non-visual, exceeding 1 hour in duration, live and unrelated to COVID-19 were excluded. Two reviewers coded the source, content and characteristics of included videos. The primary outcome was usability and reliability of videos, analysed using the novel COVID-19 Specific Score (CSS), modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) and modified JAMA (mJAMA) scores. RESULTS: Of 150 videos screened, 69 (46%) were included, totalling 257 804 146 views. Nineteen (27.5%) videos contained non-factual information, totalling 62 042 609 views. Government and professional videos contained only factual information and had higher CSS than consumer videos (mean difference (MD) 2.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 4.32, p=0.037); mDISCERN scores than consumer videos (MD 2.46, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.42, p=0.008), internet news videos (MD 2.20, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.21, p=0.027) and entertainment news videos (MD 2.57, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.49, p=0.004); and mJAMA scores than entertainment news videos (MD 1.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.36, p=0.033) and consumer videos (MD 1.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.44, p=0.028). However, they only accounted for 11% of videos and 10% of views. CONCLUSION: Over one-quarter of the most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 contained misleading information, reaching millions of viewers worldwide. As the current COVID-19 pandemic worsens, public health agencies must better use YouTube to deliver timely and accurate information and to minimise the spread of misinformation. This may play a significant role in successfully managing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Heidi Oi-Yee; Bailey, Adrian; Huynh, David; Chan, James",,,138

Historically, Coxsackieviruses and adenoviruses have been commonly suspected in myocarditis/DCM patients in North America and Europe. However, this notion is changing as other viruses such as Parvovirus B19 and human herpesvirus-6 are increasingly reported as causes of myocarditis in the United States, with the most recent example being the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, causing the Coronavirus Disease-19. The mouse model of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis, which may involve mediation of autoimmunity, is routinely used in the study of immune pathogenesis of viral infections as triggers of DCM. In this review, we discuss the immune mechanisms underlying the development of viral myocarditis with an emphasis on autoimmunity in the development of post-infectious myocarditis induced with CVB3.","Lasrado, Ninaad; Reddy, Jay",Rev Med Virol,,138

417365,Transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells: A Potential Adjuvant Therapy for COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Efficient evaluation with an early surrogate endpoint, taking into account the process of disease evolution, may not only clarify inconsistent or underpowered results but also provide a new insight into the exploration of a new antiviral therapy for treating COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We assessed the dynamics of COVID-19 disease spectrum, commencing from low-risk (no or low oxygen supplement), medium-risk (non-invasive ventilator or high oxygen supplement), and high-risk (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or invasive ventilator) risk state on enrollment, and then the subsequent progression and regression of risk states until discharge or death. The efficacy of antiviral therapy in altering the dynamics was assessed by using the high-risk state as a surrogate endpoint based on the data retrieved from the two-arm Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial. RESULTS: Using the high-risk state as a surrogate endpoint, remdesivir treatment led to a decrease in the high-risk COVID-19 state by 34.8% (95% CI 26.7-42.0%) for a 14-day period and 29.3% (95% CI 28.8-29.8%) up to 28 days, which were consistent with a statistically significant reduction of death by 30.5% (95% CI 6.6, 50.9%) up to a 28-day period. The estimates of numbers needed to be treated were 100.9 (95% CI 88.1, 115.7) for using the high-risk COVID-19 state as a surrogate endpoint for a 14-day period and 133.3 (95% CI 112.5, 158.0) were required for averting one death from COVID-19 up to 28 days. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the expedient use of the high-risk COVID-19 disease status as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the primary outcome of the earliest death.","Jen, Hsiao-Hsuan; Chang, Wei-Jung; Lin, Ting-Yu; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Yen, Amy Ming-Fang; Lai, Chao-Chih; Chen, Tony Hsiu-Hsi",,,138

Unique physiologic and ethical considerations negate a one-size-fits-all approach to the care of critically ill pregnant women with COVID-19, and few resources exist to guide the multi-disciplinary team through decisions regarding optimal maternal-fetal surveillance, intensive care procedures, and delivery timing. We present a case of rapid clinical decompensation and development of severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in a woman at 31 weeks' gestation to highlight these unique considerations and present an algorithmic approach to the disease's diagnosis and management.","Schnettler, William T; Al Ahwel, Yousef; Suhag, Anju",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,138

Despite being one of the most unequal regions of the world, there is a scarce report of the effect of socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 mortality in their countries. We aimed to identify the effect of some socioeconomic inequality-related factors on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia. METHODS: We conducted a survival analysis in a nation-wide retrospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Colombia from 2 March 2020 to 26 October 2020. We calculated the time to death or recovery for each confirmed case in the cohort. We used an extended multivariable time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate the HR by age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance, area of residence and socioeconomic strata. RESULTS: There were 1 033 218 confirmed cases and 30 565 deaths for COVID-19 in Colombia between 2 March and 26 October. The risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases was higher in males (HR 1.68 95% CI 1.64 to 1.72), in people older than 60 years (HR 296.58 95% CI 199.22 to 441.51), in indigenous people (HR 1.20 95% CI 1.08 to 1.33), in people with subsidised health insurance regime (HR 1.89 95% CI 1.83 to 1.96) and in people living in the very low socioeconomic strata (HR 1.44 95% CI 1.24 to 1.68). CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in terms of age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance regimen and socioeconomic status.","Cifuentes, Myriam Patricia; Rodriguez-Villamizar, Laura Andrea; Rojas-Botero, Maylen Liseth; Alvarez-Moreno, Carlos Arturo; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,138
424781,Effects of iRoot SP on osteogenic differentiation of human stem cells from apical papilla,2021,"Countless research works of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the task of credit card fraud detection have focused on improving the accuracy of point predictions and mitigating unwanted biases by building different network architectures or learning models. Quantifying uncertainty accompanied by point estimation is essential because it mitigates model unfairness and permits practitioners to develop trustworthy systems which abstain from suboptimal decisions due to low confidence. Explicitly, assessing uncertainties associated with DNNs predictions is critical in real-world card fraud detection settings for characteristic reasons, including (a) fraudsters constantly change their strategies, and accordingly, DNNs encounter observations that are not generated by the same process as the training distribution, (b) owing to the time-consuming process, very few transactions are timely checked by professional experts to update DNNs. Therefore, this study proposes three uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques named Monte Carlo dropout, ensemble, and ensemble Monte Carlo dropout for card fraud detection applied on transaction data. Moreover, to evaluate the predictive uncertainty estimates, UQ confusion matrix and several performance metrics are utilized. Through experimental results, we show that the ensemble is more effective in capturing uncertainty corresponding to generated predictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed UQ methods provide extra insight to the point predictions, leading to elevate the fraud prevention process.","Habibpour, Maryam; Gharoun, Hassan; Mehdipour, Mohammadreza; Tajally, AmirReza; Asgharnezhad, Hamzeh; Shamsi, Afshar; Khosravi, Abbas; Shafie-Khah, Miadreza; Nahavandi, Saeid; Catalao, Joao P.S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13508v1.pdf,138

Here we describe the pathologic features of early lung involvement by Covid-19 in a surgical sample resected for carcinoma from a patient who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after surgery. The main histologic findings observed were pneumocyte damage, alveolar hemorrhages with clustering of macrophages, prominent and diffuse neutrophilic margination within septal vessels, and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, mainly represented by CD8+ T lymphocytes. These features are similar to those previously described in SARS-CoV-1 infection. Subtle histologic changes suggestive pulmonary involvement by Covid-19 may be accidentally encountered in routine pathology practice, especially when extensive sampling is performed for histology. These findings should be carefully interpreted in light of the clinical context of the patient and could prompt a pharyngeal swab PCR test to rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients.","Pernazza, Angelina; Mancini, Massimiliano; Rullo, Emma; Bassi, Massimiliano; De Giacomo, Tiziano; Rocca, Carlo Della; d039,; Amati, Giulia",Virchows Arch,,138

COVID-19 is caused by the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus (ß-CoVs) which is of greatest clinical importance since it contains many other viruses that cause respiratory disease in humans including OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS. The spike (S) glycoprotein of ß-CoVs is a key virulence factor determining disease pathogenesis and host tropism, and it also mediates virus binding to host's receptors to allow viral entry into host cells, i.e., the first step in virus lifecycle. This, viral entry inhibitors are considered promising putative drugs for COVID-19. Herein, we mined the biomedical literature for viral entry inhibitors of other corona viruses, with special emphasis on ß-CoVs entry inhibitors. We also outlined the structural features of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and how it differs from other ß-CoVs to better understand the structural determinants of S protein binding to its human receptor (ACE2). This review highlighted several promising viral entry inhibitors as potential treatments for COVID-19.","Sabbah, Dima A; Hajjo, Rima; Bardaweel, Sanaa K; Zhong, Haizhen A",Curr. top. med. chem,,138

Rapid antigen tests have not been sufficiently evaluated in asymptomatic patients to be used as massive population screening tools. Methods: Head-to-head evaluation of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as SARS-CoV-2 screening tools performed in asymptomatic adults from a semi-closed community in University of Navarra (Spain) from November 2020 to January 2021. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated using RT-PCR as reference method. Findings: Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test was performed on 2542 asymptomatic adults in a community with a SARS-CoV-2 incidence of 1·93%. It showed a sensitivity of 71·43% (CI 95%: 56·74 - 83·42) and a specificity of 99·68% (CI 95%: 99·37 - 99·86). Positive Predictive Value was 81·4 (CI 95% 66·6 - 91·61) and Negative Predictive Value was 99·44 (CI 95% 99·06 - 99·69). Test sensitivity was related to viral load, with higher sensitivity in RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values under 25 (93·75%, CI 95%: 71·96 - 98·93), that dropped to 29·41% (CI 95%: 10·31- 55·96) in RT-PCR Ct values above 25. Interpretation: This study suggests that rapid antigen tests are less effective in asymptomatic population, when compared with RT-PCR. Further studies are needed to evaluate different options to improve screenings based on rapid antigen test, such as the use of clinical questionnaires to select higher risk-participants, the confirmation of negative results with RT-PCR or the use of repetitive sequential testing.

435770,"Type I and Type III Interferons - Induction, Signaling, Evasion, and Application to Combat COVID-19",2020,"The aim of this rapid analysis was to investigate the spatial patterns of COVID-19 emergence across counties in Colorado. In the U.S. West, Colorado has the second highest number of cases and deaths, second only to California. Colorado is also reporting, like other states, that communities of color and low-income persons are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Using GIS and correlation analysis, this study explored COVID-19 incidence and deaths from March 14 to April 8, 2020, with social determinants and chronic conditions. Preliminary results demonstrate that COVID-19 incidence intensified in mountain communities west of Denver and along the Urban Front Range, and evolved into new centers of risk in eastern Colorado. Overall, the greatest increase in COVID-19 incidence was in northern Colorado, i.e., Weld County, which reported the highest rates in the Urban Front Range. Social and health determinants associated with higher COVID-19-related deaths were population density and asthma, indicative of urban areas, and poverty and unemployment, suggestive of rural areas. Furthermore, a spatial overlap of high rates of chronic diseases with high rates of COVID-19 may suggest a broader syndemic health burden, where comorbidities intersect with inequality of social determinants of health.","Ramirez, I.

AIM: To describe the epidemiology of delirium in patients hospitalized for suspect COVID-19 pneumonia during the pandemic peak in an academic hospital of Northern Italy, identify its clinical correlations and evaluate the association with mortality. METHODS: The clinical records of 852 patients admitted for suspect COVID-19 pneumonia, defined as respiratory symptoms or fever or certain history of contact with COVID-19 patients, plus chest CT imaging compatible with alveolar-interstitial pneumonia, were retrospectively analyzed. Delirium was defined after careful revision of daily clinical reports in accordance with the Confusion Assessment Method criteria. Data on age, clinical presentation, comorbidities, drugs, baseline lab tests and outcome were collected. The factors associated with delirium, and the association of delirium with mortality, were evaluated through binary logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients (11%) developed delirium during stay. They were older (median age 82, interquartile range, IQR 78-89, vs 75, IQR 63-84, p < 0.001), had more neuropsychiatric comorbidities and worse respiratory exchanges at baseline. At multivariate models, delirium was independently and positively associated with age [odds ratio (OR) 1.093, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.046-1.143, p < 0.001], use of antipsychotic drugs (OR 4.529, 95% CI 1.204-17.027, p = 0.025), serum urea and lactate-dehydrogenase at admission. Despite a higher mortality in patients with delirium (57% vs 30%), this association was not independent of age and respiratory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium represents a common complication of COVID-19 and a marker of severe disease course, especially in older patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidity.","Ticinesi, Andrea; Cerundolo, Nicoletta; Parise, Alberto; Nouvenne, Antonio; Prati, Beatrice; Guerra, Angela; Lauretani, Fulvio; Maggio, Marcello; Meschi, Tiziana",Aging Clin Exp Res,,138

Here we describe a series of artificial life simulations that reveal a close relationship between the evolution of cellularity, the evolution of metabolism, and the richness of the environment. When environments are rich in processing energy, a resource that the digital organisms require to both process their genomes and replicate, populations evolve toward a state of non-cellularity. But when processing energy is not readily available in the environment and organisms must produce their own processing energy from food puzzles, populations always evolve both a proficient metabolism and a high level of cellular impermeability. Even between these two environmental extremes, the population-averaged values of cellular impermeability and metabolic proficiency exhibit a very strong correlation with one another. Further investigations show that non-cellularity is selectively advantageous when environmental processing energy is abundant because it allows organisms to access the available energy, while cellularity is selectively advantageous when environmental processing energy is scarce because it affords organisms the genetic fidelity required to incrementally evolve efficient metabolisms. The selection pressures favoring either non-cellularity or cellularity can be reversed when the environment transitions from one of abundant processing energy to one of scarce processing energy. These results have important implications for when and why cellular organisms evolved following the origin of life.","Takagi, Yuta A; Nguyen, Diep H; Wexler, Tom B; Goldman, Aaron D",J Mol Evol,,138

We describe the nationwide U.K. PICU experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection during the first wave of the pandemic and compare this with the critical care course of the 2019 influenza cohort. Design: Prospective nationwide cohort study of characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-positive children. Data collection utilized routine Pediatric Intensive Care Audit Network and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-specific data. Setting: All U.K. PICUs. Patients: Children less than 18 years old, admitted to U.K. PICUs between March 14, 2020, and June 13, 2020, and a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction. Children admitted to U.K. PICUs in 2019 with influenza provided comparison. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We identified 76 PICU admissions among 73 children with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Prevalence of PICU admissions per million was 5.2 for children versus 260 for adults. Ten children (14%) were identified on routine screening. Seventeen children (23%) had pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Seventeen (23%) had coinfections. Invasive ventilation was required in seven of 17 children (41%) with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 versus 38 of 56 other severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 positive children (68%), with 77% requiring vasoactive support versus 43%, respectively. Seven children (10%) died. In comparison with influenza children, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 children were older (median [interquartile range]: 10 [1-13] vs 3 yr [1-8 yr]), more often Black or Asian (52% v 18%), higher weight z score (0.29 [-0.80 to 1.62] vs -0.41 [-1.37 to 0.63]), and higher deprivation index (3.3 [-1 to 6.3] vs 1.2 [-1.8 to 4.4]). Comorbidities, frequency of organ supports, and length of stay were similar. Conclusions: This nationwide study confirms that PICU admissions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections were infrequent. We have reported similarities and differences in sociodemographic characteristics, organ support interventions, and outcomes of children affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 compared with influenza.","Kanthimathinathan, Hari Krishnan; Buckley, Hannah; Lamming, Caroline; Davis, Peter; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan; Feltbower, Richard; Draper, Elizabeth S",Crit Care Explor,,138
441415,Identification of key non-coding RNAs and transcription factors regulators and their potential drugs for steroid-induced femoral head necrosis,2020,"RATIONALE: The upper respiratory tract (URT) is the portal of entry and an active site of replication of SARS-CoV-2 and thus of critical importance in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. However, little is known about the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 and the URT microbiome. To fill this gap in knowledge, we 1) compared the URT microbiome between SARS-CoV-2-infected and-uninfected adults, and 2) examined the association of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with the URT microbiome during COVID-19. Methods: We characterized the URT microbiome using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing in 59 adults (38 with confirmed, symptomatic, mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and 21 asymptomatic, uninfected controls). In those with COVID-19, we measured SARS-CoV-2 viral load using qRT-PCR. We then examined the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection status and its viral load with the α-diversity i.e., richness ± evenness), β-diversity (i.e, overall structure), and abundance of bacterial taxa of the URT microbiome using common microbial ecology analyses. Our main models were all adjusted for age and sex. Results: The median (interquartile range) age was 30 (27-45) years and none of the participants had recently used antibiotics or intranasal steroids. The observed species -diversity index was higher in SARS-CoV-2-infected than in-uninfected adults (β=7.53, 95%CI=0.17-14.89, p=0.045). There were no differences in the Bray-Curtis β-diversity index between groups (permutational multivariate analysis of variance p&gt;0.05). In DESeq2 testing, 21 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were differentially abundant between groups, with 13 being more abundant (including Brevundimonas, Corynebacterium, Granilucatella, Anaerococcus, and Peptoniphulus ASVs) and 8 being less abundant (including Corynebacterium-1, Prevotella, Staphylococcus, Anaerostipes, and Neisseria ASVs) in SARSCoV-2-infected vs.-uninfected adults (p&lt;0.05 for all comparisons). In the adults with COVID-19, there were no associations of viral load with -or β-diversity indices of the URT microbiome (p&gt;0.05 for all comparisons). However, 21 ASVs were differentially abundant between groups in DESeq2 analyses, with 9 being more abundant (including Neisseriacea, Anaerococcus, Peptoniphulus, Campylobacter, and Enterococcus ASVs) and 12 being less abundant (including Corynebacterium-1, Staphylococcus, Granilucatella, Neisseria, and Prevotella ASVs) in those with high viral load when compared to those with low viral load (p&lt;0.05 for all comparisons) (Figure 1). Conclusions: Our findings suggest complex associations between SARS-CoV-2 and the URT microbiome in adults. Our study is a stepping stone in examining the role of the URT microbiome in SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes and in understanding the development of bacterial co-infections during COVID-19. We are now examining longitudinal associations of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with the URT microbiome over time.","Rosas-Salazar, C.; Kimura, K.; Shilts, M.; Turner, J.; Das, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,138

These conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with such misinformation. METHODS: This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the #5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph's vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined. RESULTS: Social network analysis identified that the two largest network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8% (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 32.2% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0% (n=77) were general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Thus, 65.2% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also shared. The study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of quick and targeted interventions oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which should be used.

A 73-year-old man traveling on a cruise ship with history of hypertension and dyslipidemia developed high fever, dyspnea and cough after 7 days of steroid treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in sputa polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination. His respiratory function deteriorated despite treatments with lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, azithromycin and meropenem at a regional hospital. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU in the tertiary university hospital on day 10 (ICU day 1). Interferon beta-1b subcutaneous injection was initiated immediately to enhance anti-viral therapy, and favipiravir on ICU day 10 upon availability. Progression of organ dysfunctions necessitated inhalation of nitrogen oxide for respiratory dysfunction, noradrenaline for cardiovascular dysfunction and continuous renal replacement therapy for renal dysfunction. His blood samples PCR also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicating viremia, concomitantly with elevated IL-6 levels. VV-ECMO was initiated after sudden exacerbation of respiratory dysfunction on ICU day 7 to maintain oxygenation. The sustained excessive inflammatory cytokines in the present case might have led to the exacerbation of the disease, requiring vigorous organ support therapies to allow for survival and recovery from the rapid progression of multiple organ dysfunctions and severe respiratory failure.","Takahashi, Nozomi; Abe, Ryuzo; Hattori, Noriyuki; Matsumura, Yosuke; Oshima, Taku; Taniguchi, Toshibumi; Igari, Hidetoshi; Nakada, Taka-Aki",J Artif Organs,,138
444372,Blood cell-produced amyloid-ß induces cerebral Alzheimer-type pathologies and behavioral deficits,2020,"Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with breast cancer. Systemic drug therapy, which is usually effective against peripheral breast cancers, is often ineffective on BCBM due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB). In this study, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with internalization function was found to be specifically up-regulated on BCBM-associated BTB while barely detectable in normal blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, a nanotechnology approach is reported that can overcome the BTB through ACUPA (A) and cyclic TT1 (cT) co-functionalized nanoparticles (A-NPs-cT). A-NPs-cT selectively target PSMA on BTB for specific BTB crossing and specially bind with p32 for BCBM targeting. We disclosed the effectual synergism of doxorubicin (DOX) and lapatinib (LAP) for BCBM combined therapy. A-NPs-cT exhibited boosted uptake than integrin-targeting RGD-modified NPs in BTB endothelial cells and displayed about 4.57-fold stronger penetration through the BCBM-associated BTB as compared to the normal BBB. In vivo studies showed specific BTB crossing, and remission of BCBM and prolonged survival with DOX and LAP combinatorial regimen. A-NPs-cT based DOX and LAP innovative combined therapy envisioned improved therapeutic intervention for clinical management of BCBM, for which surgery is generally inapplicable and insufficient.","Ni, Jiang; Miao, Tongtong; Su, Ma; Khan, Naveed Ullah; Ju, Xiufeng; Chen, Haiyan; Liu, Feng; Han, Liang",J. control. release,,138

Although any anti-TB drug can cause ADRs, but these are more common with drugs used for treatment of DR-TB. However, most of ADRs with these drugs are mild or moderate and can be managed if adequate supervision and monitoring is done. However, few ADRs can be severe or potentially life-threatening and may require removal of the offending drug(s). TB patients having comorbidities and on treatment for them may experience drug interaction with anti TB drugs and may require dose modification or change of drug. For a good TB treatment outcome patient's compliance should be ensured, and adverse events and drug interactions should be appropriately addressed by the clinicians. This article outlines the majority of the possible ADRs to anti-TB drugs used for management of DR-TB and their common drug interactions with practical recommendations to identify the possible drug(s) responsible and the most adequate management in each situation.","Gupta, Amitesh; Kumar, Vikas; Natarajan, Sekar; Singla, Rupak",Indian J Tuberc,,138

El objetivo de este documento es explorar las contribuciones de tres vías de transmisión-contacto, gota e inhalación-al riesgo de infección de COVID-19 adquirida por el personal sanitario en el ámbito laboral. El método consistió en la evaluación cuantitativa de los riesgos microbianos y de un modelo de exposición cuyos posibles parámetros se basaron en datos específicos del virus SARS-CoV-2 cuando se disponía de ellos. El hallazgo clave fue que las vías de transmisión por gotas e inhalación predominan sobre la vía de contacto, contribuyendo en promedio 35%, 57% y 8.2% a la probabilidad de infección cuando no se usa equipo de protección personal. En promedio, 80% de la exposición a la inhalación ocurre cuando el personal sanitario está cerca de los pacientes. La contribución relativa de las gotas y la inhalación depende de la emisión de SARS-CoV-2 en las partículas respirables (<10 µm) a través de la exhalación, y la inhalación se vuelve predominante, en promedio, cuando la emisión supera las cinco copias genéticas por minuto. La concentración prevista del SARS-CoV-2 en el aire de la habitación del paciente es baja (<1 copia del gen por m3 en promedio) y probablemente se encuentre por debajo del límite de cuantificación de muchos métodos de muestreo del aire. Los resultados demuestran el valor que supone la protección respiratoria del personal sanitario y que el muestreo de campo puede no ser lo suficientemente sensible para verificar la contribución que realiza la inhalación del SARS-CoV-2 al riesgo de infección de COVID-19 adquirida por el personal. La emisión e ineficacia del SARS-CoV-2 en gotas respiratorias de diferente tamaño es aún una brecha en el conocimiento, fundamental para comprender y controlar la transmisión de la COVID-19.","Jones, Rachael M",J Occup Environ Hyg,,138

457090,The cytokine storm in COVID-19: An overview of the involvement of the chemokine/chemokine-receptor system,2020,"The concept of trained immunity has recently emerged as a mechanism contributing to several immune mediated inflammatory conditions. Trained immunity is defined by the immunological memory developed in innate immune cells after a primary non-specific stimulus that, in turn, promotes a heightened inflammatory response upon a secondary challenge. The most characteristic changes associated to this process involve the rewiring of cell metabolism and epigenetic reprogramming. Under physiological conditions, the role of trained immune cells ensures a prompt response. This action is limited by effective resolution of inflammation and tissue repair in order to restore homeostasis. However, unrestrained activation of innate immune cells contributes to the development of chronic inflammation and tissue destruction through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, proteases and growth factors. Therefore, interventions aimed at reversing the changes induced by trained immunity provide potential therapeutic approaches to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We review cellular approaches that target metabolism and the epigenetic reprogramming of dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, and other trained cells in the context of autoimmune inflammatory diseases.","Municio, Cristina; Criado, Gabriel",Front Immunol,,138

Several measures have been put in place to prevent its spread among the population. However, for these preventive measures to be effective, the population requires appropriate and sufficient knowledge, attitude, and practices. Thus, a survey to assess knowledge, attitude, and self-reported practice toward measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 was conducted among Ugandans. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among during the lockdown in Uganda. An online structured questionnaire was used, applying a snowballing sampling approach for recruitment of participants 18 years and above and residing in Uganda. Data collection was done from 6th to 15th April 2020, during which 1,763 people participated. We analyzed all data using STATA 14.2, applying appropriate statistical tests. Results: Out of 1,763 participants, 80% were highly knowledgeable. For attitude, 72.4% reported following recommendations given by the Ministry of health to prevent the spread of COVID-19; 89.0% were worried about contracting COVID-19 and 73.3% agreed that COVID-19 can be cured and 99.3% reported good practice toward measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. According to ordered logistic regression, health workers were 6 times more knowledgeable [aOR:6 (3.51-10.09), p < 0.001] followed by teachers [aOR:5.2 (2.6-10.32), p < 0.001]; students [aOR:3.2 (1.96-5.33), p < 0.001]. On the contrary, the drivers, business entrepreneurs, and security personnel had less knowledge. Conclusion: The results show that the participating Ugandans were knowledgeable and had a positive attitude and good practices. However, there is still a gap in knowledge among drivers, business entrepreneurs, and security personnel. Therefore, there is a need to mobilize the country's population to have the same degree of knowledge, which will have an impact on the attitude and practices toward prevention of the spread of COVID-19.","Ssebuufu, Robinson; Sikakulya, Franck Katembo; Mambo, Simon Binezero; Wasingya, Lucien; Nganza, Sifa K; Ibrahim, Bwaga; Kyamanywa, Patrick",Front Public Health,,138

The Pituitary Society has produced recommendations to guide management during this era. We sought to assess contemporary neurosurgical practice and the effects of COVID-19. METHODS: A multicenter prospective observational cohort study was conducted at 12 tertiary neurosurgical units (United Kingdom and Ireland). Data were collected from March 23 to July 31, 2020, inclusive. The data points collected included patient demographics, preoperative COVID-19 test results, operative modifications, and 30-day COVID-19 infection rates. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were included. Of the 124 patients, 116 (94%) had undergone COVID-19 testing preoperatively (transsphenoidal approach, 97 of 105 [92%]; expanded endoscopic endonasal approach, 19 of 19 [100%]). One patient (1 of 116 [0.9%]) had tested positive for COVID-19 preoperatively, requiring a delay in surgery until the infection had been confirmed as resolved. Other than transient diabetes insipidus, no other complications were reported for this patient. All operating room staff had worn at least level 2 personal protective equipment. Adaptations to surgical techniques included minimizing drilling, draping modifications, and the use of a nasal iodine wash. At 30 days postoperatively, no evidence of COVID-19 infection (symptoms or positive formal testing results) were found in our cohort and no mortality had occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative screening protocols and operative modifications have facilitated endonasal neurosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Pituitary Society guidelines followed for most of these operations. We found no evidence of COVID-19 infection in our cohort and no mortality, supporting the use of risk mitigation strategies to continue endonasal neurosurgery in subsequent pandemic waves.","Bandyopadhyay, S.; Khan, D.

463385,"Predictive values, uncertainty, and interpretation of serology tests for the novel coronavirus",2021,"This paper describes the design and implementation of a software system to improve the management of diabetes using a machine learning approach and to demonstrate and evaluate its effectiveness in controlling diabetes. The proposed approach for this management system handles the various factors that affect the health of people with diabetes by combining multiple artificial intelligence algorithms. The proposed framework factors the diabetes management problem into subgoals: building a Tensorflow neural network model for food classification; thus, it allows users to upload an image to determine if a meal is recommended for consumption; implementing K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm to recommend meals; using cognitive sciences to build a diabetes question and answer chatbot; tracking user activity, user geolocation, and generating pdfs of logged blood sugar readings. The food recognition model was evaluated with cross-entropy metrics that support validation using Neural networks with a backpropagation algorithm. The model learned features of the images fed from local Ghanaian dishes with specific nutritional value and essence in managing diabetics and provided accurate image classification with given labels and corresponding accuracy. The model achieved specified goals by predicting with high accuracy, labels of new images. The food recognition and classification model achieved over 95% accuracy levels for specific calorie intakes. The performance of the meal recommender model and question and answer chatbot was tested with a designed cross-platform user-friendly interface using Cordova and Ionic Frameworks for software development for both mobile and web applications. The system recommended meals to meet the calorific needs of users successfully using KNN (with k = 5) and answered questions asked in a human-like way. The implemented system would solve the problem of managing activity, dieting recommendations, and medication notification of diabetics.","Sowah, Robert A; Bampoe-Addo, Adelaide A; Armoo, Stephen K; Saalia, Firibu K; Gatsi, Francis; Sarkodie-Mensah, Baffour",Int J Telemed Appl,,138

However, disease management remains difficult. With limited options, there is a need for innovative solutions. The cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22) has emerged as a possible therapeutic target for fish and has been correlated with protection under pathogen challenge. Plant-based production systems have the potential to effectively manufacture and bring unique efficacy-enhancing features to the aquaculture industry; namely, the advantages of low cost for this commodity market, ready scalability, and reduced environmental impact. Catfish IL-22 produced at significant yield and purity highlights the use of plants as a promising production platform for therapeutic proteins with utility to the aquaculture industry. Purified cfIL-22 shows similar in vitro bioactivity to its mammalian homolog that include increased proliferation of catfish cells highlighting the tissue preservation capabilities associated with this protein. Recombinant cfIL-22 also upregulated expression of genes encoding a tissue repair protein, fibronectin, an antimicrobial peptide, Natural killer lysin-1, and a common innate immune protein, interferon. These findings support plant-made recombinant catfish interleukin-22 as a potential therapeutic for the aquaculture industry and further analysis of this protein for promoting animal health.","Elkins, Lana L; Dolan, Maureen C",J. biotechnol,,138

In this study, we tested the extended TPB to predict university students' intentions to uptake COVID-19 vaccination.Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was developed to investigate students' intention to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine based on the components of the TPB (i.e., attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) and extended components (i.e., knowledge about COVID-19, risk perception of COVID-19, and past influenza vaccination behavior). Non-probability sampling was used to collect data from 3145 students from 43 universities in mainland China in January 2021. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to examine the proposed model. Enrolled students were relatively young (mean age = 20.80 years; SD = 2.09), half of them are female (50.2%), and most of them were studying in undergraduate programs (n = 3026; 96.2%).Results: The results showed that students' knowledge of the COVID-19 vaccine and risk perception of COVID-19 positively influenced their attitude toward the uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine. Also, students' attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination uptake and their past influenza vaccination uptake behaviors were positively associated with the intention to uptake COVID-19 vaccination. Subjective norm and perceived behavioral control were not significant predictors for the intention to uptake COVID-19 vaccination (R2 = 0.49).Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that the extended TPB appears to be an efficient model with the focus on attitude, knowledge, risk perception, and past influenza vaccination uptake behaviors in explaining students' intention for COVID-19 vaccination.","Fan, Chia-Wei; Chen, I-Hua; Ko, Nai-Ying; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D; Pakpour, Amir H",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,138

Activity-dependent transcriptional dynamics in neurons, however, remain incompletely characterized because most previous efforts relied on measurement of steady-state mRNAs. Here, we use nascent RNA sequencing to profile transcriptional dynamics of primary neuron cultures undergoing network activity shifts. We find pervasive transcriptional changes, in which â¼45% of expressed genes respond to network activity shifts. We further link retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1), the Smith-Magenis syndrome gene, to the transcriptional program driven by reduced network activity. Remarkable agreement among nascent transcriptomes, dynamic chromatin occupancy of RAI1, and electrophysiological properties of Rai1-deficient neurons demonstrates the essential roles of RAI1 in suppressing synaptic upscaling in the naive network, while promoting upscaling triggered by activity silencing. These results highlight the utility of bona fide transcription profiling to discover mechanisms of activity-dependent chromatin remodeling that underlie normal and pathological synaptic plasticity.","Garay, Patricia M; Chen, Alex; Tsukahara, Takao; Rodríguez Díaz, Jean Carlos; Kohen, Rafi; Althaus, J Christian; Wallner, Margarete A; Giger, Roman J; Jones, Kevin S; Sutton, Michael A; Iwase, Shigeki",Cell Rep,,138

In order to fill research gaps in the literature relating to market competition among different freight modes and to adjust the freight transportation structure by optimizing transportation prices, we propose a multi-objective bi-level programming pricing model that considers market competition and the carbon emissions of the freight system in China. First, an objective function in upper-level planning was used to improve logistics enterprise profits and reduce the total carbon emissions of the freight system. Then, a generalized cost function for the freight transportation mode was designed to quantify the market competition among different transportation modes, and a user equilibrium assignment model was established to obtain the results of cargo flow assignment in lower-level planning. To solve the model, a sensitivity analysis algorithm was designed, and a logistics network example was used to verify the effectiveness of the model. The experimental results show that reasonable freight price adjustment can effectively increase enterprise profits and reduce the total carbon emissions of the freight system. In this paper, we provide a new method for freight pricing research, considering the market competition of multiple transportation modes, and provide a new idea for adjusting the transportation structure through freight price optimization, which will play a positive role in promoting the development of green freight. © 2021 by the authors.

501043,"Effects of host genetic variations on response to, susceptibility and severity of respiratory infections",2020,"The rapidly spreading Covid-19 that affected almost all countries, was first reported at the end of 2019. As a consequence of its highly infectious nature, countries all over the world have imposed extremely strict measures to control its spread. Since the earliest stages of this major pandemic, academics have done a huge amount of research in order to understand the disease, develop medication, vaccines and tests, and model its spread. Among these studies, a great deal of effort has been invested in the estimation of epidemic parameters in the early stage, for the countries affected by Covid-19, hence to predict the course of the epidemic but the variability of the controls over the course of the epidemic complicated the modeling processes. In this article, the determination of the basic reproduction number, the mean duration of the infectious period, the estimation of the timing of the peak of the epidemic wave is discussed using early phase data. Daily case reports and daily fatalities for China, South Korea, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Iran, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States over the period January 22, 2020–April 18, 2020 are evaluated using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. For each country, the SIR models fitting cumulative infective case data within 5% error are analyzed. It is observed that the basic reproduction number and the mean duration of the infectious period can be estimated only in cases where the spread of the epidemic is over (for China and South Korea in the present case). Nevertheless, it is shown that the timing of the maximum and timings of the inflection points of the proportion of infected individuals can be robustly estimated from the normalized data.

501116,Application of CAR-T Cell Therapy beyond Oncology: Autoimmune Diseases and Viral Infections,2021,"In the three decades since the collapse of communism in Romania (1989), human resources have gone through several distinct moments in the process of social and economic transition, from the state economy to the market economy: (1) the period 1990-2007 characterized by declining employment, rising unemployment, low wages, employee poverty, labour migration to developed countries;(2) the period 2007-2019 in which Romanian employees experienced the benefits of the European integration process, which meant economic macrostability, increased foreign investment, projects financed by European operational programs that led to increased living standards, increased employment, labour crisis;(3) the period beginning with the 2020 pandemic year and the economic and social crisis, the effects of which are already quantified by official statistics This paper proposes a retrospective analysis of the evolution of labour resources in Romania, after joining the European Union The methodology used combines descriptive statistical analysis (labour resources, activity rate, employment rate, unemployment rate, average net earnings), hierarchical cluster analysis to compare the employment situation in Romania in the year of accession to the European Union (2007) versus the year before the onset of the pandemic crisis (2019) and the simple linear regression analysis, having as an independent variable the „unemployment rate"" and as a dependent variable „the number of employees"" Simple linear regression is used not only for teaching purposes, but in addition to testing the link between variables, we wanted to find out how much the number of employees decreases if

502389,Simulation of deterministic compartmental models for infectious diseases dynamics,2021-06-03,The rapid emergence of the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV2] and the coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] has caused significant global morbidity and mortality. This is particularly concerning for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. Care for pregnant IBD patients in itself is a complex issue because of the delicate balance between controlling maternal IBD as well as promoting the health of the unborn child. This often requires continued immunosuppressive maintenance medication or the introduction of new IBD medication during pregnancy. The current global COVID-19 pandemic creates an additional challenge in the management of pregnant IBD patients. In this paper we aimed to answer relevant questions that can be encountered in daily clinical practice when caring for pregnant women with IBD during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

There have been many pandemics caused by various viruses throughout the world over the years. Recently, the global outbreak of COVID-19 has had a catastrophic impact on human health and the world economy. Antiviral drug treatment has become another essential means to overcome pandemics in addition to vaccine development. How to quickly find effective drugs that can control the development of a pandemic is a hot issue that still needs to be resolved in medical research today. To accelerate the development of drugs, it is necessary to target the key target proteins in the development of the pandemic, screen active molecules, and develop reliable methods for the identification and characterization of target proteins based on the active ingredients of drugs. This article discusses key target proteins and their biological mechanisms in the progression of COVID-19 and other major epidemics. We propose a model based on these foundations, which includes identifying potential core targets, screening potential active molecules of core targets, and verifying active molecules. This article summarizes the related innovative technologies and methods. We hope to provide a reference for the screening of drugs related to pandemics and the development of new drugs.","Yu, Hongxin; Li, Chunyan; Wang, Xing; Duan, Jingyi; Yang, Na; Xie, Lijuan; Yuan, Yu; Li, Shanze; Bi, Chenghao; Yang, Bin; Li, Yubo",J Proteome Res,,138

511158,Structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and anti-COVID-19 drug discovery from medicinal plants,2020,"The incidence of mechanical valve thrombosis (MVT) is around 0.4 per 100 patient-years. Mitral valve thrombosis has a higher incidence than aortic valve thrombosis with a nearly 5-fold increase. Various factors contribute to MVT. The most common cause of valve thrombosis is poor adherence/disruption of anticoagulation therapy. Low cardiac output is known to increase the risk of prosthetic valve thrombosis. Other factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and other patient comorbidities might also play a role. Decreased flow promotes hypercoagulability. Lower pressure in the left atrium (and higher velocities in the left ventricle) can partially contribute to the higher incidence of mitral MVT versus aortic MVT. The presenting symptoms usually depend on the severity of the valve thrombosis; nonobstructive valve thrombosis patients have progressive dyspnea, signs of heart failure, and systemic embolization with strokes being the most common complication. In this article, we present a case of a middle-aged woman with a history of mitral and aortic mechanical prosthesis who presented with an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and pulmonary edema due to mechanical aortic valve prosthesis thrombosis. She had an isolated mechanical aortic valve prosthesis thrombosis with intact mitral valve, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been described. We performed a literature review by searching PubMed and Embase using the keywords ""mechanical valve,"" ""thrombosis,"" ""aortic,"" and ""mitral,"" our search did not show similar cases.","Khalid, Mazin O; Malyshev, Yury; Hashmi, Arsalan Talib; Siddiqui, Sabah; Patel, NeelKumar; Shani, Jacob; Ayzenberg, Sergey",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,,138

Here, we used an array of omics techniques including glycomics to examine the effect of dietary fiber consumption on the gut microbiota, colonic mucin O-glycosylation and host physiology of high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mice. The high-fat diet group had significantly impaired glucose tolerance and altered liver proteome, gut microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acid production compared to normal chow diet group. While dietary fiber inclusion did not reverse all high fat-induced modifications, it resulted in specific changes, including an increase in the relative abundance of bacterial families with known fiber digesters and a higher propionate concentration. Conversely, colonic mucin O-glycosylation remained similar between the normal chow and high-fat diet groups, while dietary fiber intervention resulted in major alterations in O-glycosylation. Correlation network analysis revealed previously undescribed associations between specific bacteria and mucin glycan structures. For example, the relative abundance of the bacterium Parabacteroides distasonis positively correlated with glycan structures containing one terminal fucose and correlated negatively with glycans containing two terminal fucose residues or with both an N-acetylneuraminic acid and a sulfate residue. This is the first comprehensive report of the impact of dietary fiber on the colonic mucin O-glycosylation and associations of these mucosal glycans with specific gut bacteria.","Gamage, Hasinika K A H; Chong, Raymond W W; Bucio-Noble, Daniel; Kautto, Liisa; Hardikar, Anandwardhan A; Ball, Malcolm S; Molloy, Mark P; Packer, Nicolle H; Paulsen, Ian T",Gut Microbes,,138

Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity. Results We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country. Conclusions As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.","Sun, Haoyang; Dickens, Borame Lee; Chen, Mark; Cook, Alex Richard; Clapham, Hannah Eleanor",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024075,138

Although hypoalbuminemia has been related with severity in COVID-19, there is no agreement of the albumin cutoff points with a potential clinical use. Additionally, a measure of strength of the association between albumin levels and mortality has not been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate if Child Pug albumin categories are associated with mortality and obtain the strength of the association. Methods Patients admitted to hospitalization with a positive SARS CoV 2 PCR from 4 April to 24 June 2020 were analyzed. Three groups were formed based on Child-Pugh albumin categories. Death frequency were compared between groups and statistical significance of the difference were assessed using a Xi2 test, strength of association between albumin levels and death was evaluated with a Kendall´s Tau B test. Results A total of 348 patients were studied, age was 54.4 ± 14.7 years, 250 (71.8%) were male and 182 patients died (52%). Association of Albumin level and Death is presented Table 1, Kendall Tau B shows that knowing albumin level improves in 32% the prediction of death and since it has a negative coefficient at a lower level of albumin, risk of death increase. Conclusions Kendall´s Tau-B shows a strong association between Child-Pug albumin categories and death, so is possible it´s use in clinical decisions as a marker of severity.","Vázquez-Medina, Martín Uriel; Montejo-Velázquez, Cesar; Vargas-De-León, Cruz; Barrón-Campos, Arcelia Carolina; Almeyda-Farfán, José Antonio; Gándara-Calderón, Julián Gonzalo; Pantaleón-Martínez, Claudia; Fernández-Martínez, Nerina del Carmen; María del Rosario, Herrera-Maceda; Cerda-Reyes, Eira",Annals of Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aohep.2021.100370; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1665268121000697; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1665268121000697,138

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen in severe disease, with hMPV, PIV-3, influenza viruses, and rhinoviruses accounting for the majority of the remainder of acute viral respiratory infections.

594131,ANDES: Statistical tools for the ANalyses of DEep Sequencing,2010-07-15,"INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are increasingly being recognized in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if the presence of GI symptoms is associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. We aim to assess if GI symptoms could be used for prognostication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to a tertiary medical center in Brooklyn, NY, from March 18, 2020, to March 31, 2020, with COVID-19. The patients' medical charts were reviewed for the presence of GI symptoms at admission, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms (cases) were compared with COVID-19 patients without GI symptoms (control). RESULTS: A total of 150 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included, of which 31 (20.6%) patients had at least 1 or more of the GI symptoms (cases). They were compared with the 119 COVID-19 patients without GI symptoms (controls). The average age among cases was 57.6 years (SD 17.2) and control was 63.3 years (SD 14.6). No statistically significant difference was noted in comorbidities and laboratory findings. The primary outcome was mortality, which did not differ between cases and controls (41.9 vs. 37.8%, p = 0.68). No statistically significant differences were noted in secondary outcomes, including the length of stay (LOS, 7.8 vs. 7.9 days, p = 0.87) and need for mechanical ventilation (29 vs. 26.9%, p = 0.82). DISCUSSION: In our study, the presence of GI manifestations in COVID-19 at the time of admission was not associated with increased mortality, LOS, or mechanical ventilation.","Ramachandran, Preethi; Onukogu, Ifeanyichkwu; Ghanta, Snigdha; Gajendran, Mahesh; Perisetti, Abhilash; Goyal, Hemant; Aggarwal, Alok",Dig Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599601/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000509774,138

594411,Antiviral therapeutic approaches for human rhinovirus infections,2018-06-12,"Concurrent advances in information technology infrastructure and mobile computing power in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have raised hopes that artificial intelligence (AI) might help to address challenges unique to the field of global health and accelerate achievement of the health-related sustainable development goals. A series of fundamental questions have been raised about AI-driven health interventions, and whether the tools, methods, and protections traditionally used to make ethical and evidence-based decisions about new technologies can be applied to AI. Deployment of AI has already begun for a broad range of health issues common to LMICs, with interventions focused primarily on communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and malaria. Types of AI vary, but most use some form of machine learning or signal processing. Several types of machine learning methods are frequently used together, as is machine learning with other approaches, most often signal processing. AI-driven health interventions fit into four categories relevant to global health researchers: (1) diagnosis, (2) patient morbidity or mortality risk assessment, (3) disease outbreak prediction and surveillance, and (4) health policy and planning. However, much of the AI-driven intervention research in global health does not describe ethical, regulatory, or practical considerations required for widespread use or deployment at scale. Despite the field remaining nascent, AI-driven health interventions could lead to improved health outcomes in LMICs. Although some challenges of developing and deploying these interventions might not be unique to these settings, the global health community will need to work quickly to establish guidelines for development, testing, and use, and develop a user-driven research agenda to facilitate equitable and ethical use.","Schwalbe, Nina; Wahl, Brian",Lancet,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620302269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416782/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673620302269; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30226-9,138
594816,The Role of Viral Infection in Pulmonary Exacerbations of Bronchiectasis in Adults: A Prospective Study,2015-12-23,"BACKGROUND: After the public health emergency due to COVID-19 was declared in Brazil, the federal government temporarily regulated and authorized the use of telemedicine services for patient consultation, monitoring, and diagnosis. For more than a decade, neurologists have recognized the benefits of telemedicine in the acute management of stroke patients. However, as the use of telemedicine was restricted until the COVID-19 pandemic, the view of Brazilian neurologists about telemedicine is unknown. METHODS: All neurologists registered at the Brazilian Academy of Neurology were invited by e-mail to participate in a survey about personal perceptions on telemedicine use. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two neurologists from all regions of Brazil answered the online questionnaire. The survey showed that 18.5% of participants worked with telemedicine before the pandemic, while 63.6% reported working with telemedicine during the pandemic. The main telemedicine modalities used during the pandemic were teleorientation and teleconsultation. DISCUSSION: According to our data, the COVID-19 pandemic deeply influenced the behavior of Brazilian neurologists, who developed a more favorable view about telemedicine and actively searched for information about telemedicine. As there is a need for more training in this area in Brazil, universities and medical societies must strive to improve telemedicine education. Expanding the use of high-quality teleneurology can contribute to a better care for patients with neurological diseases in Brazil.","Aquino, Erds Domingues R. B.; Mantese, C.

DESIGN: Cohort study with follow-up between 12 March 2020 and 23 February 2021. SETTING: Swedish register-based study on all residents in Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: 3 963 356 Swedish residents in co-residential unions who were 30 years of age or older and alive on 12 March 2020 and living in Sweden in December 2019. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cox regression models were conducted to assess the association between different constellations of immigrant-native couples (proxy for language proficiency and institutional awareness) and COVID-19 mortality and all other causes of deaths (2019 and 2020). Models were adjusted for relevant confounders. RESULTS: Compared with Swedish-Swedish couples (1.18 deaths per thousand person-years), both immigrants partnered with another immigrant and a native showed excess mortality for COVID-19 (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.29 to 1.58 and HR 1.24; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.40, respectively), which translates to 1.37 and 1.28 deaths per thousand person-years. Moreover, similar results are found for natives partnered with an immigrant (HR 1.15; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29), which translates to 1.29 deaths per thousand person-years. Further analysis shows that immigrants from both high-income and low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) experience excess mortality also when partnered with a Swede. However, having a Swedish-born partner is only partially protective against COVID-19 mortality among immigrants from LMIC origins. CONCLUSIONS: Language barriers and/or poor institutional awareness are not major drivers for the excess mortality from COVID-19 among immigrants. Rather, our study provides suggestive evidence that excess mortality among immigrants is explained by differential exposure to the virus.","Aradhya, Siddartha; Brandén, Maria; Drefahl, Sven; Obućina, Ognjen; Andersson, Gunnar; Rostila, Mikael; Mussino, Eleonora; Juárez, Sol Pía",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465581/,138

We performed longitudinal antigen-specific T cell analyses on healthy SARS-CoV-2 naïve and recovered individuals prior to and following mRNA prime and boost vaccination. Vaccination induced rapid antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses in naïve subjects after the first dose, whereas CD8+ T cell responses developed gradually and were variable in magnitude. Vaccine-induced Th1 and Tfh cell responses following the first dose correlated with post-boost CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody, respectively. Integrated analysis revealed coordinated immune responses with distinct trajectories in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and recovered individuals. Lastly, whereas booster vaccination improved T cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects, the second dose had little effect in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals. These findings highlight the role of rapidly primed CD4+ T cells in coordinating responses to the second vaccine dose in SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals.","Painter, Mark M.; Mathew, Divij; Goel, Rishi R.; Apostolidis, Sokratis A.; Pattekar, Ajinkya; Kuthuru, Oliva; Baxter, Amy E.; Herati, Ramin S.; Oldridge, Derek A.; Gouma, Sigrid; Hicks, Philip; Dysinger, Sarah; Lundgreen, Kendall A.; Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia; Adamski, Sharon; Hicks, Amanda; Korte, Scott; Giles, Josephine R.; Weirick, Madison E.; McAllister, Christopher M.; Dougherty, Jeanette; Long, Sherea; D’Andrea, Kurt; Hamilton, Jacob T.; Betts, Michael R.; Bates, Paul; Hensley, Scott E.; Grifoni, Alba; Weiskopf, Daniela; Sette, Alessandro; Greenplate, Allison R.; Wherry, E.

Thus, our goal was to review the literature with respect to: (i) Are patients with underlying hypo- or hyperthyroidism at increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection? (ii) do underlying hypo- and hyperthyroidism impact the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection? (iii) does SARS-CoV-2 infection cause de novo thyroid dysfunction? RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with hypo- or hyperthyroidism do not have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, and a diagnosis of hypo- or hyperthyroidism is not associated with a worsened prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with subsequent thyrotoxicosis, euthyroid sick syndrome, subacute thyroiditis, and autoimmune thyroid disease. SUMMARY: These findings suggest that receiving treatment for thyroid dysfunction does not per se impact the patients’ risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, or the management of those who already contracted it. Additional studies with larger numbers of patients and long-term follow-up are required in order to clarify whether patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are more or less prone to develop thyroid dysfunction and/or thyroid autoimmunity than patients recovering from other virus infections.","Brix, Thomas H.; Hegedüs, Laszlo",Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224435/; https://doi.org/10.1097/med.0000000000000654,138
596959,Infectious diseases in large-scale cat hoarding investigations,2014-05-22,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created a public health crisis worldwide. Although vaccines against the virus are efficiently being rolled out, they are proving to be ineffective against certain emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The high degree of sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses (HCoV) presents the opportunity for designing vaccines that may offer protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants, with cross-protection against other HCoVs. In this study, we performed bioinformatics analyses to identify T and B cell epitopes originating from spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope protein sequences found to be evolutionarily conserved among seven major HCoVs. Evolutionary conservation of these epitopes indicates that they may have critical roles in viral fitness and are, therefore, unlikely to mutate during viral replication thus making such epitopes attractive candidates for a vaccine. Our designed vaccine construct comprises of twelve T and six B cell epitopes that are conserved among HCoVs. The vaccine is predicted to be soluble in water, stable, have a relatively long half-life, and exhibit low allergenicity and toxicity. Our docking results showed that the vaccine forms stable complex with toll-like receptor 4, while the immune simulations predicted that the vaccine may elicit strong IgG, IgM, and cytotoxic T cell responses. Therefore, from multiple perspectives, our multi-subunit vaccine design shows the potential to elicit a strong immune-protective response against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants while carrying minimal risk for causing adverse effects.","Akbay, Burkitkan; Abidi, Syed Hani; Ibrahim, Mahmoud A.

Methods A survey consisting of twenty-two questions assessing respondent’s operative experience, location, type of practice, subspecialty, changes in clinic and operative volumes, changes to staff, and changes to income since the pandemic began was distributed electronically to neurosurgeons throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Results There were 457 respondents throughout the United States and Puerto Rico representing all practices types and subspecialties. Nearly all respondents reported hospital restrictions on elective surgeries. Most reported a decline in clinic and operative volume. Nearly 70% of respondents saw a decrease in the work hours of their ancillary providers, and almost half (49.1%) of respondents had to downsize their practice staff, office assistants, nurses, schedulers, etc. Overall, 43.6% of survey responders had experienced a decline in income, while 27.4% expected a decline in income in the upcoming billing cycle. More senior neurosurgeons and those with a private practice, whether solo or as part of a group, were more likely to experience a decline in income as a result of the pandemic as compared to their colleagues. Conclusion The COVID pandemic will likely have a lasting effect on the practice of medicine. Our survey results describe the early impact on the neurosurgical workforce. Nearly all neurosurgeons experienced a significant decline in clinical volume which leads to many downstream effects. Ultimately, analysis of the effects of such a pervasive pandemic will allow the neurosurgical workforce to be better prepared for similar events in the future.","Pelargos, Panayiotis E.; Chakraborty, Arpan R.; Adogwa, Owoicho; Swartz, Karin; Zhao, Yan D.; Smith, Zachary A.; Dunn, Ian F.; Bauer, Andrew M.",World Neurosurg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33065352/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875020322178?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.10.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875020322178,138

These analyses are performed in central laboratories. Rapid shipment from collection site to the central laboratories is currently needed because cells and biomarkers degrade rapidly. The dried blood spot from a fingerstick allows the preservation of cellular molecules for months but entire cells are never recovered. Here leucocyte elution is optimized from dried blood spots. Flow cytometry and mRNA expression profiling are used to analyze the recovered cells. 50–70% of the leucocytes that are dried on a polyester solid support via elution after shaking the support with buffer are recovered. While red blood cells lyse upon drying, it is found that the majority of leucocytes are preserved. Leucocytes have an altered structure that is improved by adding fixative in the elution buffer. Leucocytes are permeabilized, allowing an easy staining of all cellular compartments. Common immunophenotyping and mRNAs are preserved.

Several lines of evidence suggest a potential role for CV therapies in COVID-19 treatment. Characteristics of clinical trials of CV therapies related to COVID-19 registered on ClinicalTrials.gov have not been described. METHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov was queried on August 7, 2020 for COVID-19 related trials. Studies evaluating established CV drugs, other fibrinolytics (defibrotide), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were included. Studies evaluating anti-microbial, convalescent plasma, non-colchicine anti-inflammatory, and other therapies were excluded. Trial characteristics were tabulated from study-specific entries. RESULTS: A total of 2,935 studies related to COVID-19 were registered as of August 7, 2020. Of these, 1,645 were interventional studies, and the final analytic cohort consisted of 114 studies evaluating 10 CV therapeutic categories. Antithrombotics (32.5%; n=37) were most commonly evaluated, followed by pulmonary vasodilators (14.0%; n=16), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-related therapies (12.3%; n=14), and colchicine (8.8%; n=10). Trials evaluating multiple CV therapy categories and CV therapies in combination with non-CV therapies encompassed 4.4% (n=5) and 9.6% (n=11) of studies, respectively. Most studies were designed for randomized allocation (87.7%; n=100), enrollment of less than 1000 participants (86.8%; n=99), single site implementation (55.3%; n=63), and had a primary outcome of mortality or a composite including mortality (56.1%; n=64). Most study populations consisted of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (81.6%; n=93). At the time of database query, 28.9% (n=33) of studies were not yet recruiting and the majority were estimated to be completed after December 2020 (67.8%; n=78). Most lead sponsors were located in North America (43.9%; n=50) or Europe (36.0%; n=41). CONCLUSIONS: A minority (7%) of clinical trials related to COVID-19 registered on ClinicalTrials.gov plan to evaluate CV therapies. Of CV therapy studies, most were planned to be single center, enroll less than 1000 inpatients, sponsored by European or North American academic institutions, and estimated to complete after December 2020.

However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported official data, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared.","Xiong, Hao; Yan, Huili",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021519,138

Virological investigation of water samples is always a multi-stage process involving concentration of viruses present followed by an appropriate detection procedure. There are several approaches to detection of viruses. Part or all of the concentrate may be inoculated into cell cultures to detect infectious cytopathogenic virus, and if this is done in a quantitative fashion the virus can be enumerated, the count being reported as plaque-forming units, the tissue culture infectious dose, or most probable number units. The virus may be isolated and identified from the cell cultures. Viruses that multiply without producing an identifiable cytopathic effect in culture may sometimes be detected by immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence staining. The concentrate may also be analyzed by molecular biological procedures (usually polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time-PCR). The problem then is that such techniques do not usually detect the infectious virus, and novel approaches have been made recently to meet this challenge.","Wyn-Jones, Peter",Perspect Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287592/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-7069(07)17009-9; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168706907170099; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168706907170099,138

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is perceived to be seasonally recurrent, and a rapid noninvasive biomarker to accurately diagnose patients early on in their disease course will be necessary to meet the operational demands for COVID-19 control in the coming years. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of exhaled breath volatile biomarkers in identifying patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, based on their underlying PCR status and clinical probability. METHODS: A prospective, real-world, observational study was carried out, recruiting adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Breath samples were collected using a standard breath collection bag, modified with appropriate filters to comply with local infection control recommendations, and samples were analysed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). RESULTS: 81 patients were recruited between April 29 and July 10, 2020, of whom 52 out of 81 (64%) tested positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A regression analysis identified a set of seven exhaled breath features (benzaldehyde, 1-propanol, 3,6-methylundecane, camphene, beta-cubebene, iodobenzene and an unidentified compound) that separated PCR-positive patients with an area under the curve (AUC): 0.836, sensitivity: 68%, specificity: 85%. CONCLUSIONS: GC-MS-detected exhaled breath biomarkers were able to identify PCR-positive COVID-19 patients. External replication of these compounds is warranted to validate these results.","Ibrahim, Wadah; Cordell, Rebecca L.; Wilde, Michael J.; Richardson, Matthew; Carr, Liesl; Sundari Devi Dasi, Ananga; Hargadon, Beverley; Free, Robert C.; Monks, Paul S.; Brightling, Christopher E.; Greening, Neil J.; Siddiqui, Salman",ERJ Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235208/; https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00139-2021,138

Respiratory samples from the 2018/2019 season positive by our in-house RT-PCR for influenza A were analysed for the prevalence and impact of any M1 gene mutations. Sequence information was used to re-design primers for our routine assay and their performance assessed. Forty-five samples, consisting of 11 H1N1pdm09 and 34 H3N2 subtypes, together with the NIBSC H1N1 control were sequenced. All samples displayed the core mutations for H1N1 M1(C154T; G174A and G238A) and for H3N2 M1(C153T; C163T and G189T); three of the H1N1pdm09 viruses also showed a small number of point mutations. None of the mutations appeared to affect either the sensitivity or efficiency of the RT-PCR when compared to the re-designed primers. Although the mutations we found agreed with those in the publications cited we did not encounter any problems with our routine diagnostic assay and no improvements were found when the primers were modified to suit those mutations. However, it is likely that the influenza A virus M1 gene will accumulate further mutations that could impact RT-PCR assays and, therefore, it would be prudent to implement routine sequencing of samples during the influenza seasons to ensure no loss in assay performance.","Finch, James; Zuckerman, Mark; Smith, Melvyn",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339766/,138

605111,"Radiological, epidemiological and clinical patterns of pulmonary viral infections",2021-01-14,"The main protease (Mpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics. Recently, many high-resolution apo and inhibitor-bound structures of Mpro, a cysteine protease, have been determined, facilitating structure-based drug design. Mpro plays a central role in the viral life cycle by catalyzing the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In addition to the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145, Mpro contains multiple histidines including His163, His164, and His172. The protonation states of these histidines and the catalytic nu-cleophile Cys145 have been debated in previous studies of SARS-CoV Mpro, but have yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. In this work we have used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a function of the protonation assignments for these residues. We simulated both the apo and inhibitor-bound enzyme and found that the conformational stability of the binding site, bound inhibitors, and the hydrogen bond networks of Mpro are highly sensitive to these assignments. Additionally, the two inhibitors studied, the peptidomimetic N3 and an α-ketoamide, display distinct His41/His164 protonation-state-dependent stabilities. While the apo and the N3-bound systems favored Nδ (HD) and Nϵ (HE) protonation of His41 and His164, respectively, the α-ketoamide was not stably bound in this state. Our results illustrate the importance of using appropriate histidine protonation states to accurately model the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in both the apo and inhibitor-bound states, a necessary prerequisite for drug-design efforts.","Pavlova, Anna; Lynch, Diane L.; Daidone, Isabella; Zanetti-Polzi, Laura; Smith, Micholas Dean; Chipot, Chris; Kneller, Daniel W.; Kovalevsky, Andrey; Coates, Leighton; Golosov, Andrei A.; Dickson, Callum J.; Velez-Vega, Camilo; Duca, José S.; Vermaas, Josh V.; Pang, Yui Tik; Acharya, Atanu; Parks, Jerry M.; Smith, Jeremy C.; Gumbart, James C.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935106/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.07.286344,138
605407,The epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases and pandemics,2021-08-21,"Pestiviruses including bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), border disease virus (BDV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV), occur worldwide and are important pathogens of livestock. A large part of their success can be attributed to the induction of central immunotolerance including B- and T-cells upon fetal infection leading to the generation of persistently infected (PI) animals. In the past few years, it became evident that evasion of innate immunity is a central element to induce and maintain persistent infection. Hence, the viral non-structural protease N(pro) heads the transcription factor IRF-3 for proteasomal degradation, whereas an extracellularly secreted, soluble form of the envelope glycoprotein E(rns) degrades immunostimulatory viral single- and double-stranded RNA, which makes this RNase unique among viral endoribonucleases. We propose that these pestiviral interferon (IFN) antagonists maintain a state of innate immunotolerance mainly pertaining its viral nucleic acids, in contrast to the well-established immunotolerance of the adaptive immune system, which is mainly targeted at proteins. In particular, the unique extension of ‘self’ to include the viral genome by degrading immunostimulatory viral RNA by E(rns) is reminiscent of various host nucleases that are important to prevent inappropriate IFN activation by the host’s own nucleic acids in autoimmune diseases such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus. This mechanism of “innate tolerance” might thus provide a new facet to the role of extracellular RNases in the sustained prevention of the body’s own immunostimulatory RNA to act as a danger-associated molecular pattern that is relevant across various species.","Lussi, Carmela; Schweizer, Matthias",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021825/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2016.03.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610116300296; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610116300296,138

It is very contagious and is spreading rapidly around the world. Until now, coronaviruses have mainly been associated with the aerodigestive tract due to the presence of a monobasic cleavage site for the resident transmembrane serine protease 2. Notably, SARS‐CoV‐2 is equipped with a second, polybasic cleavage site for the ubiquitous furin protease, which may determine the widespread tissue tropism. Furthermore, the terminal sequence of the furin‐cleaved spike protein also binds to neuropilin receptors. Clinically, there is enormous variability in the severity of the disease. Severe consequences are seen in a relatively small number of patients, most show moderate symptoms, but asymptomatic cases, especially among young people, drive disease spread. Unfortunately, the number of local infections can quickly build up, causing disease outbreaks suddenly exhausting health services’ capacity. Therefore, COVID‐19 is dangerous and unpredictable and has become the most serious threat for generations.

RECENT FINDINGS: Enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery (ERAC) provides an evidenced-based system to improve maternal outcomes, functional recovery, maternal-infant bonding, and patient experience. Postsurgical recovery has evolved from a one-dimensional pain score to a holistic multidimensional approach emphasizing faster functional recovery. ERAC involves multidisciplinary efforts of the anesthesiologist, obstetrician, nursing, hospital, and patient. Components of ERAC include preoperative patient education, limited fasting, carbohydrate load, limiting opioids intra- and postoperatively, using scheduled non-opioid analgesics and supplementing with advanced therapies for women at higher risk for pain. ERAC protocols reduce opioid consumption, reduce length of stay, and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. SUMMARY: Implementing ERAC standardized care will likely be the most important change you can make in your practice to improve outcomes, improve quality care, help address racial disparities, and minimize opioid exposure and potential for addiction.","Patel, Kishan; Zakowski, Mark",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40140-021-00442-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679253/,138

Some centers have reported very high rates of thrombosis despite anticoagulant prophylaxis. The electronic health record (EHR) of a New Orleans–based health system was searched for all patients with polymerase chain reaction–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were either admitted to hospital or treated and discharged from an emergency department between 1 March 2020 and 1 May 2020. From this cohort, patients with confirmed VTE (either during or after their hospital encounter) were identified by administrative query of the EHR.: Between 1 March 2020 and 1 May 2020, 6153 patients with COVID-19 were identified; 2748 of these patients were admitted, while 3405 received care exclusively through the emergency department. In total, 637 patients required mechanical ventilation and 206 required renal replacement therapy. Within the hospitalized cohort, the overall mortality rate was 24.5% and VTE occurred in 86 patients (3.1%). In the 637 patients who required mechanical ventilation at some point during their hospital stay, 45 developed VTE (7.2%). After a median follow-up of 14.6 days, VTE had been diagnosed in 3 of the 2075 admitted who were discharged alive (0.14%).

608701,Breath analysis for respiratory infections,2020-09-18,"Environmental change created worldwide interest in investing in renewable energy. Less reliance on fossil fuels would have a substantial influence on investors for alternative energy, especially renewable energy. The literature has concentrated on empirical studies of herding behaviour in finance, but not in renewable energy. This paper fills the gap by investigating herding in renewable energy, using daily closing prices in renewable and fossil fuel energy stock returns in the USA, Europe, and Asia, for March 24, 2000–May 29, 2020, which covers the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) (2007–2009), the coronavirus crises of SARS (2003). And the ongoing COVID-19 (2019–2020) pandemic. The paper shows that: (1) for low extreme oil returns, investors are more likely to display herding in the stock market; (2) for SARS and COVID-19, herding is more likely during extremely high oil returns after the GFC; and (3) herding is more likely during periods of extremely low oil returns during the coronavirus crises. These results suggest that after the GFC, investors are more sensitive to asset losses, so they will be more likely to display herding in the stock market. However, during SARS and COVID-19, investors panic so they may unwisely sell their assets. There are strong cross-sector herding spillover effects from US fossil fuel energy to renewable energy, especially before the GFC, while the US fossil fuel energy market has a significant influence on the Europe and Asia renewable energy returns during COVID-19. During SARS, which was not a pandemic, US fossil fuels only had an impact on US renewable energy returns.","Chang, Chia-Lin; McAleer, Michael; Wang, Yu-Ann",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234619/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.110349; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1364032120306377; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032120306377,138

All have associations with human central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. In infants and young children, the most common CNS phenomena are febrile seizures; in adults, non-focal abnormalities that may be either neurologic or constitutional. Neurotropism and neurovirulence are dependent in part on CNS expression of cell surface receptors mediating viral entry, and host immune response. In adults, CNS receptors for epidemic viruses are largely expressed on brain vasculature, whereas receptors for less pathogenic viruses are present in vasculature, brain parenchyma, and olfactory neuroepithelium, dependent upon viral species. Human coronaviruses can infect circulating mononuclear cells, but meningoencephalitis is rare. Well-documented human neuropathologies are infrequent and, for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, can entail cerebrovascular accidents originating extrinsically to brain. There is evidence of neuronal infection in the absence of inflammatory infiltrates with SARS-CoV, and CSF studies of rare patients with seizures have demonstrated virus but no pleocytosis. In contrast to human disease, animal models of neuropathogenesis are well developed, and pathologies including demyelination, neuronal necrosis, and meningoencephalitis are seen with both native CoVs as well as human CoVs inoculated into nasal cavities or brain. This review covers basic CoV biology pertinent to CNS disease; the spectrum of clinical abnormalities encountered in infants, children, and adults; and the evidence for CoV infection of human brain, with reference to pertinent animal models of neuropathogenesis.","Morgello, Susan",J Neurovirol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32737861/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13365-020-00868-7,138

This present study aimed to assess the early impact of COVID-19 on vaccine activities by comparing current trends to trends over the past year when vaccine coverage of major antigens (BCG, OPV, DTP-HepB-Hib, MMR, IPV, and Td) had improved considerably. Methods: The study was carried out at the Expanded Vaccination Program (EPI) of the Republic of Guinea from February 2019 to June 2019. It was a comparative retrospective cohort study on the trends in administrative coverage of the different antigens used in the framework of vaccination. We performed interrupted time series (STI) analysis using the delayed dependent variable model ANCOVA type II Sum Squares with significance for a p-value less than 0.05 to confirm the link between the occurrence of Covid-19 and the collapse of vaccine coverage. These analyzes were performed on global vaccine-preventable disease surveillance data extracted from the District Immunization Data Management Tool (DVD-MT) designed by WHO. Estimates of the target population were obtained from the National Health Information System (SNIS), and surveillance data for Covid-19 patients were obtained from the National Health Security Agency (ANSS). Results: Overall, the EPI recorded a median vaccination coverage of less than 80% for all the vaccines introduced and the analysis of the interrupted time series shows that the interruption of the vaccination program was significant for all the vaccines. This finding is factual at both the national and district levels. However, there are disparities at this level, even though some districts have yet to report cases of COVID-19 but have experienced drop-in vaccination coverage. The comparison of vaccination coverage for DTP3, for example, shows a sharp drop in the prefectures of Yomou, N'Nzerekore, Macenta, Kankan, Mandiana, Dinguiraye, Mamou, Koubia, Mali, and Conakry, where it varies between 0 and 80% compared to 2019 where it was above 80%. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the need for a resilient health system that could adapt quickly and effectively to pandemics and which in turn makes it possible to strengthen EPI activities in Guinea during this period of a health crisis, in particular for children.

Two groups of mini RTCs with different conformations of nsp13-1 are identified. In both of them, nsp13-1 stabilizes overall architecture of the mini RTC by contacting with nsp13-2, which anchors the 5′-extension of RNA template, as well as interacting with nsp7-nsp8-nsp12-RNA. Orientation shifts of nsp13-1 results in its variable interactions with other components in two forms of mini RTC.

610073,Untwining Anti-Tumor and Immunosuppressive Effects of JAK Inhibitors—A Strategy for Hematological Malignancies?,2021-05-26,"The human gut is known to be a reservoir of a wide variety of microbes, including viruses. Many RNA viruses are known to be associated with gastroenteritis; however, the enteric RNA viral community present in healthy humans has not been described. Here, we present a comparative metagenomic analysis of the RNA viruses found in three fecal samples from two healthy human individuals. For this study, uncultured viruses were concentrated by tangential flow filtration, and viral RNA was extracted and cloned into shotgun viral cDNA libraries for sequencing analysis. The vast majority of the 36,769 viral sequences obtained were similar to plant pathogenic RNA viruses. The most abundant fecal virus in this study was pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV), which was found in high concentrations—up to 10(9) virions per gram of dry weight fecal matter. PMMV was also detected in 12 (66.7%) of 18 fecal samples collected from healthy individuals on two continents, indicating that this plant virus is prevalent in the human population. A number of pepper-based foods tested positive for PMMV, suggesting dietary origins for this virus. Intriguingly, the fecal PMMV was infectious to host plants, suggesting that humans might act as a vehicle for the dissemination of certain plant viruses.","Zhang, Tao; Breitbart, Mya; Lee, Wah Heng; Run, Jin-Quan; Wei, Chia Lin; Soh, Shirlena Wee Ling; Hibberd, Martin L; Liu, Edison T; Rohwer, Forest; Ruan, Yijun",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16336043/,138
610141,"Interdependency of CEACAM-1, -3, -6, and -8 induced human neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells",2008-12-10,"BACKGROUND: Due to the limited number of species specific antibodies against fish proteins, differential gene expression analyses are vital for the study of host immune responses. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is one of the most powerful tools for this purpose. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the method will depend on the careful selection of genes whose expression are stable and can be used as internal controls for a particular experimental setting. FINDINGS: The expression stability of five commonly used housekeeping genes [beta-actin (ACTB), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1A), ubiquitin (UBQ), glyceraldehyd-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and tubulin alpha (TUBA)] were monitored in salmonid cell lines CHSE-214 and RTS11 after infection with two of the most fastidious fish pathogens, the facultative bacterium Piscirickettsia salmonis and the aquabirnavirus IPNV (Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus). After geNorm analysis, UBQ and EF1A appeared as the most stable, although EF1A was slightly upregulated at late stages of P. salmonis infection in RTS11. ACTB instead, showed a good performance in each case, being always considered within the three most stable genes of the panel. In contrast, infection-dependent differential regulation of GAPDH and TUBA was also demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Based on the data presented here with the cell culture models CHSE-214 and RTS11, we suggest the initial choice of UBQ, ACTB and EF1A as reference genes in qRT-PCR assays for studying the effect of P. salmonis and IPNV on the host immune response.","Peña, Andrea A; Bols, Niels C; Marshall, Sergio H",BMC Res Notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20398263/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-3-101,138

Social distancing measures coupled with national lockdowns have reduced work opportunities and the overall household incomes. Moreover, the disruption in agricultural production and supply routes is expected to continue into 2021, which may leave millions without access to food. Coincidentally, those who suffer the most are poor people. As such, food security and tourism poverty alleviation are interlinked when discussing social problems and development. While the corporate interest in tourism poverty alleviation is as old as the industrial revolution, little research has been conducted to show how social innovation can be leveraged to reinforce food security and alleviate poverty.

611336,Viral infections of the CNS with special emphasis on herpes simplex infections,2001,"INTRODUCTION: Understanding population health in the context of infectious disease outbreaks is an important physician competency. However, identifying effective ways to engage early medical students in this content remains a challenge. We designed an innovative pandemic simulation for first-year medical students utilizing the pop culture theme of zombies. METHODS: This 2.5-hour simulation was conducted in 2018 and 2020 during students' virology course. Student teams collected and analyzed data to formulate hypotheses for the source pathogen. The teams completed reports explaining their diagnostic hypotheses, infection containment recommendations, and resource allocation recommendations. Learners completed an evaluation of the simulation through an online survey. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics; narrative responses were analyzed qualitatively for themes. A content analysis was performed on students' reports. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-four medical students participated in this activity. Nearly all respondents agreed that the small-group format (98%, 2018 and 2020) and pace and duration (92%, 2018; 94%, 2020) were appropriate and that the activity was intellectually stimulating (97%, 2018; 96%, 2020). Learner engagement measures were high (90%-97%, 2018; 83%-96%, 2020). Analysis of students' reports revealed evidence of cognitive integration of virology, population health, and bioethics concepts, including integration of new learning content. DISCUSSION: Collaborative problem-solving during a simulated zombie-themed pandemic provided preclinical medical students with an engaging opportunity to integrate virology, population health, and bioethics concepts. Implementing this event required advanced planning, use of multiple spaces, learning materials preparation, and recruitment of several faculty, staff, and actors.","Jackson, Jennifer M.; Shen, E; Peters, Timothy R.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204840/; https://doi.org/10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11016,138
612023,MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) and infectious diseases,2015-04-08,"Parker's rat coronavirus (PRC) is a naturally-occurring viral infection of the laboratory rat. On the first passage, ATCC strain 8190 of PRC replicated in L-2 cells. Using the tenth passage of PRC in L-2 cells, the characteristics of the virus were compared with previous studies of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) replicated in L-2 cells. Based on light and immunofluorescence microscopic examination of control and inoculated cell cultures, PRC-associated CPE was frequently confined primarily to individual cells, and there were relatively few syncytial giant cells. Maximum titers were recovered at 36h post inoculation (pi). Infectious virus was demonstrated at pH values ranging from 6.0 to 9.0 and a pH of 7.5 was determined to produce the highest titers of PRC. The optimum temperature for viral replication was 33°C. Up to 15 passages of PRC in L-929 cells failed to produce detectable virus. However, after adaptation in L-2 cells (20th passage), PRC replicated to high titers in L-929 cells. Previously, in vitro studies of rat coronaviruses have been hampered by the lack of an identified continuous cell line to replicate these viruses in the laboratory. L-2 cells represent a readily-available continuous cell line that can support the replication of relatively high titers of PRC.","Percy, D. H.; Williams, K. L.; Bond, S. J.; MacInnes, J.

612109,Challenges and future directions of potential natural products leads against 2019-nCoV outbreak,2020-10-08,"To date, the majority of work on RNA virus replication fidelity has focused on the viral RNA polymerase, while the potential role of other viral replicase proteins in this process is poorly understood. Previous studies used resistance to broad-spectrum RNA mutagens, such as ribavirin, to identify polymerases with increased fidelity that avoid misincorporation of such base analogues. We identified a novel variant in the alphavirus viral helicase/protease, nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) that operates in concert with the viral polymerase nsP4 to further alter replication complex fidelity, a functional linkage that was conserved among the alphavirus genus. Purified chikungunya virus nsP2 presented delayed helicase activity of the high-fidelity enzyme, and yet purified replication complexes manifested stronger RNA polymerization kinetics. Because mutagenic nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin also affect intracellular nucleotide pools, we addressed the link between nucleotide depletion and replication fidelity by using purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. High-fidelity viruses were more resistant to these conditions, and viral growth could be rescued by the addition of exogenous nucleosides, suggesting that mutagenesis by base analogues requires nucleotide pool depletion. This study describes a novel function for nsP2, highlighting the role of other components of the replication complex in regulating viral replication fidelity, and suggests that viruses can alter their replication complex fidelity to overcome intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions. IMPORTANCE Previous studies using the RNA mutagen ribavirin to select for drug-resistant variants have highlighted the essential role of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in regulating replication fidelity. However, the role of other viral replicase components in replication fidelity has not been studied in detail. We identified here an RNA mutagen-resistant variant of the nsP2 helicase/protease that conferred increased fidelity and yet could not operate in the same manner as high-fidelity polymerases. We show that the alphavirus helicase is a key component of the fidelity-regulating machinery. Our data show that the RNA mutagenic activity of compounds such as ribavirin is coupled to and potentiated by nucleotide depletion and that RNA viruses can fine-tune their replication fidelity when faced with an intracellular environment depleted of nucleotides.","Stapleford, Kenneth A.; Rozen-Gagnon, Kathryn; Das, Pratyush Kumar; Saul, Sirle; Poirier, Enzo Z.; Blanc, Hervé; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Merits, Andres; Vignuzzi, Marco",J Virol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01553-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26311883/,138
612164,Global Burden of Infectious Diseases,2009-02-17,"In the fight against the recent COVID‐19 pandemics, testing is crucial. Nasopharyngeal swabs and real‐time RT‐PCR are used for the detection of the viral RNA. The collection of saliva is non‐invasive, pain‐free and does not require trained personnel. An alternative to RT‐PCR is loop‐mediated isothermal amplification coupled with reverse transcription (RT‐LAMP) that is easy to perform, quick and does not require a thermal cycler. The aim of this study was to test whether SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA can be detected directly in saliva using RT‐LAMP. We have tested 16 primer mixes from the available literature in three rounds of sensitivity assays. The selected RT‐LAMP primer mix has a limit of detection of 6 copies of viral RNA per reaction in comparison with RT‐PCR with 1 copy per reaction. Whole saliva, as well as saliva collected using Salivette collection tubes, interfered with the RT‐LAMP analysis. Neither Chelex‐100 nor protease treatment of saliva prevented the inhibitory effect of saliva. With the addition of the ribonuclease inhibitor, the sensitivity of the RT‐LAMP assay was 12 copies per reaction of RNA in Salivette® saliva samples and 6 copies per reaction of RNA in whole saliva samples. This study shows that it is possible to combine the use of saliva and RT‐LAMP for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA detection without RNA extraction which was confirmed on a small set of correctly diagnosed clinical samples. Further studies should prove whether this protocol is suitable for point of care testing in the clinical setting.","Janíková, Monika; Hodosy, Július; Boor, Peter; Klempa, Boris; Celec, Peter",Microb Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33497538/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.13737,138

The active component of CCP mediating improved outcome is commonly reported as specific antibodies, particularly neutralizing antibodies, with clinical efficacy characterized according to the level or antibody affinity. In this review, we highlight the potential role of additional factors in CCP that can be either beneficial (e.g., AT-III, alpha-1 AT, ACE2+ extracellular vesicles) or detrimental (e.g., anti-ADAMTS13, anti-MDA5 or anti-interferon autoantibodies, pro-coagulant extracellular vesicles). Variations in these factors in CCP may contribute to varied outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and undergoing CCP therapy. We advise careful, retrospective investigation of such co-factors in randomized clinical trials that use fresh frozen plasma in control arms. Nevertheless, it might be difficult to establish a causal link between these components and outcome, given that CCP is generally safe and neutralizing antibody effects may predominate.","Focosi, Daniele; Franchini, Massimo; Pirofski, Liise-anne; Burnouf, Thierry; Fairweather, DeLisa; Joyner, Michael J.; Casadevall, Arturo",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452459/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081594,138

Different studies have displayed an existing association between pregnancy and COVID-19 severity due to the various physiological changes that occur during gestation. Recent data identified maternal country of origin as an important determinant of COVID-19 presentation in pregnant women. However, the explanation of this fact remains to be fully elucidated. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to analyze the possible relationship between Human Development Index (HDI) of maternal country of origin with the morbimortality of pregnant women and their newborns. Here, we conducted a multicentric, ambispective, observational case-control study (1:1 ratio) and compare with the HDI of each country (group 1—very high HDI, group 2—high HDI, group 3—medium HDI, and group 4—low HDI). In total, 1347 pregnant women with confirmed SARV-CoV-2 infection (cases) were enrolled, and each was paired with one control to give a total number of 2694 participants from 81 tertiary care centers. Among the women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, more cases were produced of perinatal mortality, overall maternal morbidity, COVID-19 maternal morbidity, C-sections, hypertensive maternal morbidity, and perinatal morbidity. Our results described an inverse association between HDI and maternofetal morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the countries with an HDI lower than 1 showed higher rates of patients with maternal COVID-19-related morbidity (6.0% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.001), a need for oxygen therapy (4.7% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001), and maternal ICU admission (2.6% vs. 1.0%, p = 0.007). Compared to other risk factors such as overweight, obesity, preexisting and obstetric comorbidities, HDI emerged as an independent risk factor explaining much of the increased maternal–perinatal morbidity and mortality detected in our group of cases. Further research is needed to establish to confirm the real impact of this factor and its components on pregnancy outcomes.","Cuñarro-López, Yolanda; Larroca, Santiago García-Tizón; Pintado-Recarte, Pilar; Hernández-Martín, Concepción; Prats-Rodríguez, Pilar; Cano-Valderrama, Óscar; Cueto-Hernández, Ignacio; Ruiz-Labarta, Javier; Muñoz-Chápuli, María del Mar; Martínez-Pérez, Óscar; Ortega, Miguel A.; De León-Luis, Juan Antonio",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441928/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10163631,138

Of note, there is still a controversy about whether or not there is a causative relation between SARS-CoV-2 and these neurological conditions. Other concerns, however, seem to be relevant as well. This includes not only the reluctance of patients with acute neurological complaints to report to the emergency department for fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 but also the ethical and practical implications for neurology patients in everyday clinical routine.

The chicks were vaccinated against IBV on the second day of life with the vaccine Ma5, but at the age of 18 days, they exhibited clinical signs and macroscopic lesions compatible with avian infectious bronchitis (IB). In the clinical disease stage, the Ma5 vaccine strain was detected in the trachea, lungs, and small intestine of the chicks, while IBV variants were detected in the bursa of Fabricius and kidneys. Subsequently, new samples were collected from the same batch at the end of the production cycle. In this phase, the Ma5 vaccine strain was detected in the kidneys, small intestine, and oviduct of the hens. However, a previously unidentified IBV variant was found in the cecal tonsils. Additionally, a fragment of viral RNA with that was completely identical to the corresponding region of the Ma5 vaccine was detected in the allantoic fluid of viable embryos from the hens under study after 18 days of incubation. These findings suggest that, in addition to the Ma5 vaccine, other strains of IBV variants can coexist, seeming to establish a chronic infection in the chickens, and that they can potentially be transmitted vertically. These results may assist in immunoprophylaxis control programs against IBV.

Effective simple, home-treatment algorithms implemented on the basis of a pathophysiologic and pharmacologic rationale to accelerate recovery and prevent hospitalization of patients with early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would have major implications for patients and health care providers. Methods. This academic, matched-cohort study compared outcomes of 90 consecutive consenting patients with mild COVID-19 treated at home by their family physicians from October 2020 to January 2021 according to the proposed recommendation algorithm with those of 90 age-, sex-, and comorbidities- matched patients who received other therapeutic regimens. Primary outcome was time to resolution of major symptoms. Secondary outcomes included prevention of hospitalization. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Findings. All patients achieved complete remission. The median [IQR] time to resolution of major symptoms was 18 [14-23] days in the recommended schedule cohort and 14 [7-30] days in the matched control cohort (p=0.033). Minor symptoms persisted in a lower percentage of patients in the recommended than in the control cohort (23.3% versus 73.3%, respectively, p<0.0001) and for a shorter period (p=0.0107).

615095,The role of airway macrophages in apoptotic cell clearance following acute and chronic lung inflammation,2016-03-08,"The gonadal steroids, including androgens, estrogens and progestogens, are involved in the control of body fat distribution in humans. Nevertheless, not only the size and localization of the fat depots depend on the sex steroids levels, but they can also highly affect the functioning of adipose tissue. Namely, the gonadocorticoids can directly influence insulin signaling, lipid metabolism, fatty acid uptake and adipokine production. They may also alter energy balance and glucose homeostasis in adipocytes in an indirect way, e.g., by changing the expression level of aquaglyceroporins. This work presents the recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanism of how the gonadal steroids influence the functioning of adipose tissue leading to a set of detrimental metabolic consequences. Special attention is given here to highlighting the sexual dimorphism of adipocyte functioning in terms of health and disease. Particularly, we discuss the molecular background of metabolic disturbances occurring in consequence of hormonal imbalance which is characteristic of some common endocrinopathies such as the polycystic ovary syndrome. From this perspective, we highlight the potential drug targets and the active substances which can be used in personalized sex-specific management of metabolic diseases, in accord with the patient’s hormonal status.","Wawrzkiewicz-Jałowiecka, Agata; Lalik, Anna; Soveral, Graça",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22105226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069293/,138
615375,Bioterrorism: is it a real threat?,2004-09-02,"BACKGROUND: In Japan, both the prevalence of the elderly and super‐elderly and those of acute heart failure (AHF) have been increasing rapidly. METHODS: This registry was a prospective multicenter cohort, which enrolled a total of 1253 patients with AHF. In this study, 1117 patients' follow‐up data were available and were categorized into three groups according to age: <75 years old (nonelderly), 75–84 years old (elderly), and ≥ 85 years old (super‐elderly). The endpoint was defined as all‐cause death and each mode of death after discharge during the 3‐years follow‐up period. RESULTS: Based on the Kaplan–Meier analysis, a gradually increased risk of all‐cause death according to age was found. Among the three groups, the proportion of HF death was of similar trend; however, the proportion of infection death was higher in elderly and super‐elderly patients. After adjusting for potentially confounding effects using the Cox and Fine–Gray model, the hazard ratio (HR) of all‐cause death increased significantly in elderly and super‐elderly patients (HR, 2.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.93–3.54 and HR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.72–6.92, respectively), when compared with nonelderly patients. The highest sub‐distribution HR in detailed mode of death was infection death in elderly and super‐elderly patients (HR, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.75–10.33 and HR, 10.10; 95% CI, 3.78–27.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this population, the risk of all‐cause death was found to increase in elderly and super‐elderly. Elderly patients and especially super‐elderly patients with AHF were at a higher risk for noncardiovascular death, especially infection death.","Takabayashi, Kensuke; Kitaguchi, Shouji; Yamamoto, Takashi; Takenaka, Kotoe; Takenaka, Hiroyuki; Fujita, Ryoko; Okuda, Miyuki; Nakajima, Osamu; Koito, Hitoshi; Terasaki, Yuka; Kitamura, Tetsuhisa; Nohara, Ryuji",Clin Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.23619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963771/,138

Clinically manifest central nervous system symptoms have been described in COVID‐19 patients and could be the consequence of commonly associated vascular pathology, but the detailed neuropathological sequelae remain largely unknown. A total of six cases, all positive for Sars‐CoV‐2, showed evidence of cerebral petechial hemorrhages and microthrombi at autopsy. Two out of six patients showed an elevated risk for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy according to current criteria and were excluded from further analysis. In the remaining four patients, the hemorrhages were most prominent at the grey and white matter junction of the neocortex, but were also found in the brainstem, deep grey matter structures and cerebellum. Two patients showed vascular intramural inflammatory infiltrates, consistent with Sars‐CoV‐2‐associated endotheliitis, which was associated by elevated levels of the Sars‐CoV‐2 receptor ACE2 in the brain vasculature. Distribution and morphology of patchy brain microbleeds was clearly distinct from hypertension‐related hemorrhage, critical illness‐associated microbleeds and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which was ruled out by immunohistochemistry. Cerebral microhemorrhages in COVID‐19 patients could be a consequence of Sars‐ CoV‐2‐induced endotheliitis and more general vasculopathic changes and may correlate with an increased risk of vascular encephalopathy.","Kirschenbaum, Daniel; Imbach, Lukas L.; Rushing, Elisabeth J.; Frauenknecht, Katrin B.

616242,Authoritarianism and the threat of infectious diseases,2020-04-02,"OBJECTIVES: To report frontline healthcare workers’ (HCWs) experiences with personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. To understand HCWs’ fears and concerns surrounding PPE, their experiences following its guidance and how these affected their perceived ability to deliver care during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A rapid qualitative appraisal study combining three sources of data: semistructured in-depth telephone interviews with frontline HCWs (n=46), media reports (n=39 newspaper articles and 145 000 social media posts) and government PPE policies (n=25). PARTICIPANTS: Interview participants were HCWs purposively sampled from critical care, emergency and respiratory departments as well as redeployed HCWs from primary, secondary and tertiary care centres across the UK. RESULTS: A major concern was running out of PPE, putting HCWs and patients at risk of infection. Following national level guidance was often not feasible when there were shortages, leading to reuse and improvisation of PPE. Frequently changing guidelines generated confusion and distrust. PPE was reserved for high-risk secondary care settings and this translated into HCWs outside these settings feeling inadequately protected. Participants were concerned about differential access to adequate PPE, particularly for women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic HCWs. Participants continued delivering care despite the physical discomfort, practical problems and communication barriers associated with PPE use. CONCLUSION: This study found that frontline HCWs persisted in caring for their patients despite multiple challenges including inappropriate provision of PPE, inadequate training and inconsistent guidance. In order to effectively care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline HCWs need appropriate provision of PPE, training in its use as well as comprehensive and consistent guidance. These needs must be addressed in order to protect the health and well-being of the most valuable healthcare resource in the COVID-19 pandemic: our HCWs.","Hoernke, Katarina; Djellouli, Nehla; Andrews, Lily; Lewis-Jackson, Sasha; Manby, Louisa; Martin, Sam; Vanderslott, Samantha; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472794/,138
616394,Neutrophils and viral-induced neurologic disease,2018-04-01,"The epigenetic modifications control the pathogenicity of human pathogenic fungi, which have been poorly studied in Mucorales, causative agents of mucormycosis. This order belongs to a group referred to as early-diverging fungi that are characterized by high levels of N6-methyldeoxy adenine (6mA) in their genome with dense 6mA clusters associated with actively expressed genes. AlkB enzymes can act as demethylases of 6mA in DNA, with the most remarkable eukaryotic examples being mammalian ALKBH1 and Caenorhabditis elegans NMAD-1. The Mucor lusitanicus (formerly M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus) genome contains one gene, dmt1, and two genes, dmt2 and dmt3, encoding proteins similar to C. elegans NMAD-1 and ALKBH1, respectively. The function of these three genes was analyzed by the generation of single and double deletion mutants for each gene. Multiple processes were studied in the mutants, but defects were only found in single and double deletion mutants for dmt1. In contrast to the wild-type strain, dmt1 mutants showed an increase in 6mA levels during the dimorphic transition, suggesting that 6mA is associated with dimorphism in M. lusitanicus. Furthermore, the spores of dmt1 mutants challenged with macrophages underwent a reduction in polar growth, suggesting that 6mA also has a role during the spore–macrophage interaction that could be important in the infection process.","Osorio-Concepción, Macario; Lax, Carlos; Navarro, Eusebio; Nicolás, Francisco E.; Garre, Victoriano",J Fungi (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/jof7090738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575776/,138
616434,Salmonella Strain Specificity Determines Post-typhoid Central Nervous System Complications: Intervention by Lactiplantibacillus plantarum at Gut-Brain Axis,2020-07-24,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke, enhanced stroke severity, and other comorbidities. However, AF is often asymptomatic, and frequently remains undiagnosed until complications occur. Current screening approaches for AF lack either cost-effectiveness or diagnostic sensitivity; thus, there is interest in tools that could be used for population screening. An AF risk prediction algorithm, developed using machine learning from a UK dataset of 2,994,837 patients, was found to be more effective than existing models at identifying patients at risk of AF. Therefore, the aim of the trial is to assess the effectiveness of this risk prediction algorithm combined with diagnostic testing for the identification of AF in a real-world primary care setting. Eligible participants (aged ≥30 years and without an existing AF diagnosis) registered at participating UK general practices will be randomised into intervention and control arms. Intervention arm participants identified at highest risk of developing AF (algorithm risk score ≥ 7.4%) will be invited for a 12‑lead electrocardiogram (ECG) followed by two-weeks of home-based ECG monitoring with a KardiaMobile device. Control arm participants will be used for comparison and will be managed routinely. The primary outcome is the number of AF diagnoses in the intervention arm compared with the control arm during the research window. If the trial is successful, there is potential for the risk prediction algorithm to be implemented throughout primary care for narrowing the population considered at highest risk for AF who could benefit from more intensive screening for AF.

In this study, 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens infected with TW I-type IBV were continuously observed for 200 days. TW I-type IBV affected the respiratory, urinary, and female reproductive systems, resulting in a mortality rate of 10% as well as a decrease in egg quantity and an increase in inferior eggs. During the monitoring period, serious lesions occurred in the female reproductive system, such as yolk peritonitis, a shortened oviduct, and cysts of different sizes with effusion in the degenerated right oviduct. The infective viruses persisted in vivo for a long time, and due to the stress of laying, virus shedding was detected again after the onset of egg production. Our findings suggest that TW I-type IBV is deadly to chickens and could cause permanent damage to the oviduct, resulting in the poor laying performance of female survivors and decreasing the breeding value and welfare of the infected flock.","Zhang, Xiaorong; Liao, Kai; Chen, Shuqin; Yan, Kun; Du, Xubin; Zhang, Chengcheng; Guo, Mengjiao; Wu, Yantao",Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-020-00819-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736651/,138
617400,"Emerging respiratory infections: The infectious disease pathology of SARS, MERS, pandemic influenza, and Legionella",2019-04-17,"Background. COVID-19 knowledge has been changing rapidly with the fast pace of information that accompanied the pandemic. Since peer-reviewed research is a trusted source of evidence, capturing and predicting the emerging themes in COVID-19 literature are crucial for guiding research and policy. Machine learning, natural language processing and dynamical networks have the potential to enable rapid distillation and prediction of actionable insights for ending the pandemic. Objective. We hypothesized that emerging COVID-19 research trends can be captured and predicted from networks constructed upon language features. Further, we aimed to detect communities in these networks and used centrality measures to track and predict emerging network modules as dominant themes in a given time period. The goal of our study was to make our findings publicly available as an explainable AI dashboard for researchers and policymakers. Methods. Abstracts from more than 95,000 peer-reviewed articles from the WHO curated COVID-19 database were used to construct word embedding models. Named entity recognition was used to refine the terms. Cosine similarity between the terms was then used to construct dynamical networks in order to understand the temporal trend of emerging associations over months and visualized as alluvial diagrams. Finally, temporal link prediction between diseases for the subsequent month based on their trends of occurrence in the previous six months was carried out to predict the emergence and disappearance of associations in the rapidly changing pandemic scenario. Results. Community detection upon dynamical networks clearly demonstrated the emergence of thromboembolic complications as a cluster and dominant theme between March and August 2020. Forecasting of top-K influential entities further allowed prediction of future trends, such as the emergence of psychiatry theme as a central node by February 2021. XGBoost modeling in our proposed temporal link prediction framework achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.855 for predicting new dis(associations) one month in advance. Visualization of the underlying word-embedding models allowed interactive querying to choose novel keywords and extractive models summarized the research relevant to the keyword, allowing faster knowledge distillation. Conclusion: We provide an explainable AI approach for querying, tracking and predicting novel insights in COVID-19 peer reviewed literature. The EvidenceFlow web-application is publicly available and emerging trends are updated on a monthly basis. Such approaches will be crucial to understand and pre-empt actionable research such as vaccine strategies in the ongoing pandemic.","Pal, R.; Chopra, H.; Awasthi, R.; Bandhey, H.; Nagori, A.; Gulati, A.; Kumaraguru, P.; Sethi, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249855v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.14.21249855,138

The fruit also displayed scavenging and reducing activity, in vitro. The present study focused on unravelling peripheral and central protective effects, antimicrobial but also anti-COVID-19 properties exerted by the water extract of P. mahaleb. Anti-inflammatory effects were studied in isolated mouse colons exposed to lipopolysaccharide. Neuroprotection, measured as a blunting effect on hydrogen-peroxide-induced dopamine turnover, was investigated in hypothalamic HypoE22 cells. Antimicrobial effects were tested against different Gram+ and Gram- bacterial strains. Whereas anti-COVID-19 activity was studied in lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells, where the gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was measured after extract treatment. The bacteriostatic effects induced on Gram+ and Gram- strains, together with the inhibition of COX-2, TNFα, HIF1α, and VEGFA in the colon, suggest the potential of P. mahaleb water extract in contrasting the clinical symptoms related to ulcerative colitis. The inhibition of the hydrogen peroxide-induced DOPAC/DA ratio indicates promising neuroprotective effects. Finally, the downregulation of the gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in H1299 cells, suggests the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus entry in the human host.

617990,Herd immunity: hyperimmune globulins for the 21st century,2018-04-30,"INTRODUCTION: In Sierra Leone, access to prostheses is limited due to absence of practical knowledge, materials, trained staff, and high cost. This paper investigates the impact of a 3D printed prosthesis on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in prosthesis recipients. METHODS: Patients with upper extremity amputations were included in this case study from December 2018 until July 2019. Data on the HRQoL was gathered until April 2020 in Masanga Hospital, central rural Sierra Leone. At two follow-up moments the HRQoL was assessed by applying the standard EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. These two follow-up moments varied between one week and just over a year after receiving the prosthesis. A second patient questionnaire was used to assess prosthesis satisfaction. RESULTS: Seven patients were included. The results of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire show no deterioration of the HRQoL in any patient and the overall HRQoL increased by almost 20% compared to the null measurement. One patient was lost to follow up after the first re-visit. The responses to the second questionnaire indicated that patients are satisfied with the prosthesis and use it in various situations. Patients often mentioned they feel more included in society when wearing the prosthesis. One patient says wearing the prosthesis helped in accepting the amputation. As a result, enough self-confidence was experienced without the prosthesis and the patients stopped wearing the prosthesis. DISCUSSION: The overall HRQoL in patients wearing a 3D-printed prosthesis increases compared to not wearing one. Assessing the HRQoL at regular intervals is important for the long-term follow-up and to safeguard sustainability and long-term success of this project. Nevertheless, defining the HRQoL is challenging due to cultural differences and misunderstandings. Therefore, the use of alternative questionnaires to define the HRQoL should be investigated. To improve and warrant long-term success, identifying long-term problems is important, and the second questionnaire accounts for this need.","Sterkenburg, A.J.; Van der Stelt, M.; Koroma, A.R.; Van Gaalen, M.D.; Van der Pols, M.J.; Grobusch, M.P.; Slump, C.H.; Maal, T.J.J.; Brouwers, L.",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34286125/,138

The four socially distanced stations include airway, chest compressions, umbilical venous catheter placement, and team leader. Feedback from 79 NRP students showed no difference in overall course rating between Socially Distanced NRP and standard NRP courses. No cases of COVID-19 transmission were identified in the Socially Distanced NRP courses.

One of the World Health Organization states that COVID-2019 is a serious disease that spreads from one person to another at very fast speed through contact routes and respiratory drops. On this day, India and the world should rise to an effective step to analyze this disease and eliminate the effects of this epidemic. In this paper presented, the growing database of COVID-2019 has been analyzed from March 1, 2020, to April 11, 2020, and the next one is predicted for the number of patients suffering from the rising COVID-2019. Different regression analysis models have been utilized for data analysis of COVID-2019 of India based on data stored by Kaggle in between 1 March 2020 to 11 April 2020. In this study, we have been utilized six regression analysis based models namely quadratic, third degree, fourth degree, fifth degree, sixth degree, and exponential polynomial respectively for the COVID-2019 dataset. We have calculated the root mean square of these six regression analysis models. In these six models, the root mean square error of sixth degree polynomial is very less in compared other like quadratic, third degree, fourth degree, fifth degree, and exponential polynomial. Therefore the sixth degree polynomial regression model is very good models for forecasting the next 6 days for COVID-2019 data analysis in India. In this study, we have found that the sixth degree polynomial regression models will help Indian doctors and the Government in preparing their plans in the next 7 days.

As a result, animals rescued from hoarding frequently have a variety of medical conditions including respiratory infections, gastrointestinal disease, parasitism, malnutrition, and other evidence of neglect. The purpose of this study was to characterize the infectious diseases carried by clinically affected cats and to determine the prevalence of retroviral infections among cats in large-scale cat hoarding investigations. Records were reviewed retrospectively from four large-scale seizures of cats from failed sanctuaries from November 2009 through March 2012. The number of cats seized in each case ranged from 387 to 697. Cats were screened for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in all four cases and for dermatophytosis in one case. A subset of cats exhibiting signs of upper respiratory disease or diarrhea had been tested for infections by PCR and fecal flotation for treatment planning. Mycoplasma felis (78%), calicivirus (78%), and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (55%) were the most common respiratory infections. Feline enteric coronavirus (88%), Giardia (56%), Clostridium perfringens (49%), and Tritrichomonas foetus (39%) were most common in cats with diarrhea. The seroprevalence of FeLV and FIV were 8% and 8%, respectively. In the one case in which cats with lesions suspicious for dermatophytosis were cultured for Microsporum canis, 69/76 lesional cats were culture-positive; of these, half were believed to be truly infected and half were believed to be fomite carriers. Cats from large-scale hoarding cases had high risk for enteric and respiratory infections, retroviruses, and dermatophytosis. Case responders should be prepared for mass treatment of infectious diseases and should implement protocols to prevent transmission of feline or zoonotic infections during the emergency response and when transferring the rescued cats to other shelters or to adopters.","Polak, K.C.; Levy, J.K.; Crawford, P.C.; Leutenegger, C.M.; Moriello, K.A.",Vet J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934262/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023314002172; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.05.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023314002172,138

Methods A multicenter, hospital-based, retrospective comparative analysis of patients presenting with posterior segment trauma was done during the COVID-19 (Group A) (March 25, 2020 - September 30, 2020) period and the pre-COVID-19 (Group B) (March 25, 2019 - September 30, 2019) period. Results A total of 405 patients were diagnosed with posterior segment trauma (Group A: 206, Group B: 199). The time interval between onset of trauma and presentation was higher in Group A (16.59 ± 29.87 days) as compared to Group B (9.41 ± 19.19 days) (P = 0.004). A majority of patients in Group A had a history of prior consultation before presentation (P = 0.049). In Group A, 120 (58.2%) patients sustained ocular trauma at home as compared to 80 (40.2%) patients in Group B (P < 0.0001). Patients presenting with light perception were significantly more in Group A (43.7%) as compared to Group B (30.2%) (P = 0.004). In Group B, 37.6% patients had presenting visual acuity of counting finger or better as compared to 27.6% patients in Group A (P = 0.07). Patients in Group A had a significantly higher proportion of post-traumatic endophthalmitis with delayed presentation (P = 0.011) and retinal detachment (P = 0.041).

Since the early days of the outbreak, researchers with different scientific backgrounds across the globe have tried to fulfill the urgent need for such assays, with many assays having been approved and with others still undergoing clinical validation. Molecular diagnostic assays are a major group of tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Currently, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most widely used method. Other diagnostic molecular methods, including CRISPR-based assays, isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods, digital PCR, microarray assays, and next generation sequencing (NGS), are promising alternatives. In this review, we summarize the technical and clinical applications of the different COVID-19 molecular diagnostic assays and suggest directions for the implementation of such technologies in future infectious disease outbreaks.","Habibzadeh, Parham; Mofatteh, Mohammad; Silawi, Mohammad; Ghavami, Saeid; Faghihi, Mohammad Ali",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595397/; https://doi.org/10.1080/10408363.2021.1884640,138

Evidence that SARS-CoV-2 exists as locally evolving variants suggests that immunological differences may impact the effectiveness of antibody-based treatments such as convalescent plasma and vaccines. Considering that near-sourced convalescent plasma likely reflects the antigenic composition of local viral strains, we hypothesize that convalescent plasma has a higher efficacy, as defined by death within 30 days of transfusion, when the convalescent plasma donor and treated patient were in close geographic proximity. Results of a series of modeling techniques applied to approximately 28,000 patients from the Expanded Access to Convalescent Plasma program (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04338360) support this hypothesis. This work has implications for the interpretation of clinical studies, the ability to develop effective COVID-19 treatments, and, potentially, for the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines as additional locally-evolving variants continue to emerge.","Kunze, Katie L.; Johnson, Patrick W.; van Helmond, Noud; Senefeld, Jonathon W.; Petersen, Molly M.; Klassen, Stephen A.; Wiggins, Chad C.; Klompas, Allan M.; Bruno, Katelyn A.; Mills, John R.; Theel, Elitza S.; Buras, Matthew R.; Golafshar, Michael A.; Sexton, Matthew A.; Diaz Soto, Juan C.; Baker, Sarah E.; Shepherd, John R.

The pattern of the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 in individuals may fluctuate. Some have a virus-dependent protective immune response resulting in asymptomatic or mild disease with elimination of the virus within 7-10 days after onset of infection. Others develop virus non-dependent uncontrolled hyper-inflammation in the later period, leading to severe disease with cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation and multi-organ failure. Methods: The serum of 72 patients was investigated for titers of 15 cytokines and chemokines using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits in the serum of peripheral blood samples. The means of groups were compared using ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple post hoc comparisons if the ANOVA p-value was <0.05.

626954,Type I Interferons as Regulators of Lung Inflammation,2017-03-10,"The long evolutionary battle between humans and pathogens has played an important role in shaping the current network of host-pathogen interactions. Each organ brings new challenges from the perspective of a pathogen to establish a suitable niche for survival while subverting the protective mechanisms of the host. Lungs, the organ for oxygen exchange, have been an easy target for pathogens due to its accessibility. The organ has evolved diverse capabilities to provide the flexibility required for an organism’s health and at the same time maintain protective functionality to prevent and resolve assault by pathogens. The pathogenic invasions are strongly challenged by healthy lung architecture which includes the presence and activity of the epithelium, mucous, antimicrobial proteins, surfactants, and immune cells. Competitively, the pathogens in the form of viruses, bacteria, and fungi have evolved an arsenal of strategies that can over-ride the host’s protective mechanisms. While bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) can survive in dormant form for years before getting active in humans, novel pathogens can wreak havoc as they pose a high risk of morbidity and mortality in a very short duration of time. Recently, a coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic which provides us an opportunity to look at the host manipulative strategies used by respiratory pathogens. Their ability to hide, modify, evade, and exploit cell’s processes are key to their survival. While pathogens like M. tuberculosis have been infecting humans for thousands of years, SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of the recent pandemic. Molecular understanding of the strategies used by these pathogens could greatly serve in design of predictive, preventive, personalized medicine (PPPM). In this article, we have emphasized on the clinically relevant evasive strategies of the pathogens in the lungs with emphasis on M. tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2. The molecular basis of these evasive strategies illuminated through advances in genomics, cell, and structural biology can assist in the mapping of vulnerable molecular networks which can be exploited translationally. These evolutionary approaches can further assist in generating screening and therapeutic options for susceptible populations and could be a promising approach for the prediction, prevention of disease, and the development of personalized medicines. Further, tailoring the clinical data of COVID-19 patients with their physiological responses in light of known host-respiratory pathogen interactions can provide opportunities to improve patient profiling and stratification according to identified therapeutic targets.","Ahluwalia, Pankaj; Ahluwalia, Meenakshi; Vaibhav, Kumar; Mondal, Ashis; Sahajpal, Nikhil; Islam, Shaheen; Fulzele, Sadanand; Kota, Vamsi; Dhandapani, Krishnan; Baban, Babak; Rojiani, Amyn M.; Kolhe, Ravindra",EPMA J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-020-00230-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204369/,138

However, research shows technologies being abandoned or rejected by users due to a lack of compatibility and consumer involvement in selecting their assistive technology devices. This study aims to understand older adults’ perceptions and preferences of technologies that can potentially assess frailty at home. METHODS: This study collected qualitative data through focus group meetings with 15 participants ages 65 and older. Researchers asked participants questions to achieve the goal of understanding their attitudes on the technologies. These questions include (1) the concerns or barriers of installing and using the presented technology in daily life at home, (2) the reasons participants like or dislike a particular technology, (3) what makes a specific technology more acceptable, and (4) participants’ preferences in choosing technologies. Data were transcribed, coded and categorized, and finally synthesized to understand the attitudes towards presented technologies. RESULTS: Three focus group sessions were conducted with five participants in each session. In the findings, the attitudes and perspectives of participants on the technologies for assessing frailty were categorized into four themes: (A) general attitude towards using the technologies, (B) conditions for accepting certain technologies, (C) existing living habits or patterns related to using the technologies, and (D) constructive suggestions related to the technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Participants generally had positive attitudes towards allowing the technologies to be installed and used at their homes. They would accept some technologies if used under certain conditions. However, questions and concerns remain, such as concerns about privacy, functionality, and aesthetics. The study also found that older adults’ living habits or patterns could affect the design and use of technology. Lastly, many valuable suggestions have been made by participants. These perspectives and insights can help improve the design and adoption of home-based frailty assessment technologies among older adults.","Bian, Chao; Ye, Bing; Hoonakker, Anna; Mihailidis, Alex",BMC Geriatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33964887/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02252-4,138

The purpose of this study is to systematically review the current literature on COVID-19-associated neuroradiological findings and examine the prevalence of different findings in patients with both severe and mild COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed. Any studies reporting CT or MRI neuroimaging findings in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. Patient demographics, main radiological findings, neurological symptoms, and severity of COVID-19 infection were tabulated and quantified according to infection severity. RESULTS: 61 studies published between 2019 to 2020 comprising 711 patients were analyzed according to severity of respiratory symptoms. The main neuroradiological findings for patients with mild classification were cranial nerve abnormalities, ischemic infarction, and white matter abnormalities, while the main findings in patients with severe classification were white matter abnormalities, ischemic infarction, and hemorrhagic events. CONCLUSION: Neuroradiological manifestations in COVID-19 infection are highly heterogeneous and differ based on the severity of COVID-19 infection. Cranial nerve abnormalities appear exclusive to mild infection, with a high degree of olfactory tract involvement, while hemorrhagic events are more common in severe infection. Notably, ischemic infarction was equally prevalent in both mild and severe COVID-19 infection. Healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients should be aware of these potential complications and consider neurological assessment and neuroimaging studies when indicated.","Pan, Simon; Chen, Willam C.; Baal, Joe D.; Sugrue, Leo P.",Acad Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912668/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633220305079?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1076633220305079; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2020.08.026,138

But can citizens make useful disaster decisions? Potential obstacles are that such decisions are complex, involve public goods, and often affect other people. Theories of political decision-making disagree on whether these problems can be overcome. We used experimental economic games that simulate disaster to test whether people are willing and able to prevent disasters for others. Groups of players face a complex task in which options that might help vary in their riskiness. Importantly, although all options are reasonable, which option is most useful depends on the experimental condition. We find that players will pay to help, can identify which option is most useful across experimental conditions, and will pay to learn how best to help. Thus, players were able to make useful and costly decisions to prevent others from experiencing disaster. This suggests that, in at least some situations, citizens may be able to make good disaster decisions.

This transition from face-to-face usual care had to be embraced by patients and professionals alike. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated patients’ and professionals’ experiences with virtual antenatal clinic appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine satisfaction and inquire into the safety and quality of care received. METHODS: A total of 148 women who attended a virtual antenatal clinic appointment at our UK tertiary obstetric care center over a 2-week period provided feedback (n=92, 62% response rate). A further 37 health care professionals (HCPs) delivering care in the virtual antenatal clinics participated in another questionnaire study (37/45, 82% response rate). RESULTS: We showed that women were highly satisfied with the virtual clinics, with 86% (127/148) rating their experience as good or very good, and this was not associated with any statistically significant differences in age (P=.23), ethnicity (P=.95), number of previous births (P=.65), or pregnancy losses (P=.94). Even though 56% (83/148) preferred face-to-face appointments, 44% (65/148) either expressed no preference or preferred virtual, and these preferences were not associated with significant differences in patient demographics. For HCPs, 67% (18/27) rated their experience of virtual clinics as good or very good, 78% (21/27) described their experience as the same or better than face-to-face clinics, 15% (4/27) preferred virtual clinics, and 44% (12/27) had no preference. Importantly, 67% (18/27) found it easy or very easy to adapt to virtual clinics. Over 90% of HCPs agreed virtual clinics should be implemented long-term.

RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES: The study examined how Israeli nurses respond to ethical dilemmas and tension during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to what extent this is associated with their perceived risk and motivation to provide care? RESEARCH DESIGN: The study implemented a descriptive correlative study using a 53-section online questionnaire, including 4 open-ended questions. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: The questionnaire was complete by 231 registered and intern nurses after being posted on nurses’ Facebook and WhatsApp groups, and through snowball sampling. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The research was pre-approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at the University of Haifa, Israel. FINDINGS: In all, 68.8% of the respondents had received some form of training about COVID-19. Respondents positioned themselves at perceived high risk levels for contracting the virus. About one-third feared going to work because of potential contraction and due to feeling inadequately protected. While 40.9% were scared to care for COVID-19 patients, 74.7% did not believe they have the right to refuse to treat certain patients. When asked about defining an age limit for providing patients with scarce resources (such as ventilation machines) in cases of insufficient supplies, respondents stated that the maximum age in such scenarios should be 84 (standard deviation (SD = 19) – yet most respondents (81.4%) believed that every patient has the right to receive optimal treatment, regardless of their age and medical background. DISCUSSION: Correlating with their strong commitment to care, nurses did not convey intention to leave the profession despite their stress, perceived risk, and feelings of insufficient support and protection at work. The nurses did not hold a utilitarian approach to resource allocation, thereby acknowledging the value of all people and their entitlement to care, regardless of optimal outcomes. CONCLUSION: While experiencing significant personal risk and emotional burden, nurses conveyed strong dedication to providing care, and did not regret working in the nursing profession, yet they did seek a supportive climate for their needs and ethical concerns.","Sperling, Daniel",Nurs Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733020956376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33000673/,138

Probiotics were used as a natural substitution for antibiotics and 10% dietary flaxseed is an effective prebiotic which supports the action of probiotics and has other beneficial effects on the organism. Probiotics with or without flaxseed were fed to weanling gilts starting 10 days before and lasting up until 14 days after weaning. The ovaries were measured and histologically analysed. The blood samples for the levels of steroid hormones and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were assessed using immunoassays and the levels of fatty acids were assessed using gas chromatography. All samples were collected on the day of weaning and 14 days after weaning. On the day of weaning, increased levels of linoleic acid and IGF-I was associated with higher body weight. The steroid hormones were not affected by the diet. The conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to timodonic (EPA) and cervonic (DHA) acids were lower compared to controls, and together with high levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids was associated with the higher proliferation and lower apoptosis in the primordial, primary and secondary follicles; although the inhibition of the cell cycle was observed in relation to the low level of eicosadienoic acid. The high levels of ALA, EPA and DHA and the low levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids may have been the effect of flaxseed feeding 14 days post-weaning and may have had a reverse effect on the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian follicles. These data suggest that flaxseed may suppress the follicle development in weanlings via the stimulation of apoptosis and the inhibition of proliferation via the modulation of the metabolism of selected fatty acids.","Vlčková, Radoslava; Andrejčáková, Zuzana; Sopková, Drahomíra; Hertelyová, Zdenka; Kozioł, Katarzyna; Koziorowski, Marek; Gancarčíková, Soňa",Anim Reprod Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29685707/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843201830099X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037843201830099X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.04.066,138

Afin de mieux comprendre les étiologies des syndromes grippaux en période COVID-19, nous avons analysé les prélèvements effectués dans un centre de dépistage hospitalier Francilien au tout début de l’épidémie. Matériels et méthodes La période d’étude s’est étendue du 28 février au 27 mars 2020. Tout patient consultant pour une recherche de SARS-CoV2 par RT-PCR dans le cadre d’un syndrome grippal a bénéficié d’une PCR multiplex pour les autres virus respiratoires. Les caractéristiques démographiques, cliniques et virologiques des consultants ont été analysées et les variables associées aux prélèvements positifs pour le SARS-CoV ou les autres virus ont été recherchées par régression logistique. Résultats Au total 707 patients ont consulté pendant la période d’étude et 468 patients ont bénéficié de la recherche de SARS-CoV2 et autres virus respiratoires. L’âge médian (IQR) était de 37 ans (29–50) avec 139 hommes (29,7 %). La prévalence du SARS-CoV2 était de 37,4 % (IQR : 33,01–41,8), et 37 sujets (7,9 %) étaient positifs pour d’autres pathogènes : Influenza A – 6 (1,3 %), Influenza B – 7 (1,5 %), Metapneumovirus – 5 (1,1 %), Rhinovirus – 4 (0,9 %), Coronavirus (229E, HKU1) – 3 (0,6 %), Adenovirus – 2 (0,4 %), Enterovirus – 4 (0,9 %), M. pneumoniae – 1 (0,2 %), Virus Respiratoire syncytial – 1 (0,2 %), infection mixte hors SARS-CoV-2 – 4 (0,9 %). À noter qu’aucun agent pathogène n’a été retrouvé chez 256 consultants. Les symptômes d’anosmie, fièvre et céphalées étaient plus fréquemment présents chez les sujets avec SARS-CoV2 comparés aux autres pathogènes (respectivement 26,3 % vs 2,7 %, p <0,00001 ; 78,9 % vs 64,9 %, p <0,02 ; 45,1 % vs 29,7 %, p <0,002), tandis que la rhino-pharyngite étaient plus fréquente chez les patients porteurs d’autres virus (24,3 % vs 10,39 %, p <0,003). Sur la période d’étude, la prévalence des virus respiratoires hors SARS-CoV-2 a régulièrement diminué (semaine 1 : 26,4 %, semaine 2 : 7,3 %, semaine 3 : 1,8 %) jusqu’à devenir nulle la 4e semaine. Conclusion Sur la période de mars 2020 alors que l’épidémie de SARS-CoV-2 a touché la France de plein fouet, les virus respiratoires classiques ont rapidement disparu tandis que la COVID-19 touchait plus du tiers des personnes consultant pour un syndrome grippal dans un centre de dépistage hospitalier francilien. La triade anosmie–fièvre–céphalées a été beaucoup plus fréquemment retrouvée associée au SARS-CoV2 qu’aux autres virus respiratoires et peut constituer un tableau d’alerte en cas de nouvelle épidémie.","Sukach, M.; Ingiliz, P.; Valin, N.; Boussaid, K.; Jullien, J.; Chiarabini, T.; Morand-Joubert, L.; Gozlan, J.; Schnuriger, A.; Lacombe, K.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20302948; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X20302948,138
631734,"Economic growth, urbanization, globalization, and the risks of emerging infectious diseases in China: A review",2016-08-04,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is considered the most serious global health threat in recent times. As there is a current lack of approved treatments and vaccines, universal safety precautions (USPs) must be taken to deal with this emergency. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and beliefs of the Indian public with regard to USPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted during March 2020. A 20-item self-administered questionnaire was developed, validated and distributed using Google Forms through social media networks. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors influencing knowledge regarding COVID-19 USPs. RESULTS: Of the 1117 individuals who participated in the survey, the mean age was 28.8 ± 10.9 years, 32.9% had a post-graduate education, 45% had a professional job, and 40% belonged to the upper-middle economic class. Overall, the mean correct response scores were 63% for USP knowledge and 83% for USP beliefs. All the sociodemographic variables were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with the USP knowledge levels. Importantly, students were less likely to have a lower level of USP knowledge compared with the other occupations (odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.23–0.53; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although the knowledge and beliefs of the Indian public towards USPs are encouraging, there is a need for long-term educational interventions as the dynamics and severity of COVID-19 rapidly change. These findings could guide public health authorities to make and implement precautionary measures to combat this pandemic.

631825,Children’s Participation in a Virtual Epidemic in the Science Classroom: Making Connections to Natural Infectious Diseases,2006-11-23,"Purpose Lung transplant (LTx) recipients may be at increased risk for fulminant novel SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 infection due to their immunosuppressed state. Additional risk factors, outcomes, and optimal management of COVID-19 in LTx recipients is unknown. Methods We identified LTx recipients infected with COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab in our institution. Baseline demographics and clinical data were obtained through review of the electronic medical record (EMR) from 3/20/2020 to 10/25/2020. Results Ten LTx recipients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Disease course and management details are described in Table 1. Mean age was 57.5 ± 8 years, 50% were women (n = 5), and 70% self-identified as Latinx, 66% had a high school diploma or lower education. Medicare or Medicaid was the primary insurance in 60% (n = 6). Mean household size was 3.2 ± 1.5 persons. Forty percent (n = 4) had mild symptoms that progressed to fulminant hypoxemic respiratory failure at 9-10 days from symptom onset. Ninety percent (n = 9) required hospitalization with an average length of stay 14.8 ± 12. Sixty percent (n = 6) were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU), 40% (n = 4) requiring mechanical ventilation. COVID-19 specific therapies included remdesivir (80%, n = 8), dexamethasone (60%, n = 6), and convalescent plasma (50%, n = 5). Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was reduced or held in 60% (n = 6) of recipients. One recipient who recovered later died in hospice care from other comorbidities. Conclusion Most LTx recipients infected with COVID-19 had severe complications, with a high proportion requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Though, mortality was relatively low. Adjustments to immunosuppression included reduction in MMF and steroid augmentation. Similar to the general US population, there is a disproportionate impact of COVID-19 infection in Latinx LTx recipients that may be related to social factors such as residing in multi-generational households.","Seijo, L.

632272,A new therapeutic strategy for lung tissue injury induced by influenza with CR2 targeting complement inhibitior,2010-02-09,"BACKGROUND: Research during 2020 has been rapidly attending to the impact of COVID-19 on various dimensions of wellbeing (e.g., physical, psychological, lifestyle and routines) on adults and children around the world. However, less attention has focused on the psychoeducational impact on children and their families. To our knowledge, no currently available studies have looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with dyslexia and their families. Research on this topic is needed to offer greater support for this population of students and their families. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this paper is to examine the psychoeducational impact of the required COVID-19 quarantine in Spain among children with dyslexia and their families. METHOD: A sample of 32 children with dyslexia and their mothers participated in this study. MEASURES: Children and adolescents with dyslexia and their mother completed several measures before the required national quarantine in Spain and again during the quarantine. Children completed measures of depression, state anxiety, reading activity, and reading motivation. Mothers provided demographic information and completed measures related to students’ emotional and behavioral difficulties as well as parenting stress, parental distress, and a questionnaire about educational problems during quarantine. RESULTS: Major findings showed that during quarantine, children with dyslexia had increased levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, and parents perceived their children as having more emotional symptoms, hyperactivity-inattention, and conduct problems. During quarantine, children and adolescents with dyslexia also showed less reading activity and less reading motivation. Parents also reported significantly more stress, during quarantine compared to pre-quarantine conditions. Some demographic and psychological variables predicted children’s state anxiety as well parental stress. The questionnaire related to impacts of quarantine also revealed several important findings. For example, nearly all parents of children with dyslexia reported (a) difficulties in establishing study routines, (b) that the quarantine negatively affected their child’s learning, and (c) that they did not receive sufficient help from teachers on how to support their child’s learning. Additionally, the vast majority of the parents were very worried about the child’s learning and school success, the child’s motivation and interest in reading, the child’s peer relations, and the professional skills of the child’s teacher. CONCLUSION: This study offers a preliminary investigation into this topic and elucidates several psychoeducational challenges that children with dyslexia and their families have experienced during the quarantine in Spain. Study findings highlight the need to provide immediate support for children with dyslexia and emphasizes the importance of developing prevention programs to mitigate any future negative impacts of COVID-19 on children with dyslexia and their parents.","Soriano-Ferrer, Manuel; Morte-Soriano, Manuel Ramón; Begeny, John; Piedra-Martínez, Elisa",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34122234/,138

632877,Jokro: The death of a wild infant chimpanzee from respiratory disease,2020-04-26,"Minimization of airborne virus transmission has become increasingly important due to pandemic and endemic infectious respiratory diseases. Physical distancing is a frequently advocated control measure, but the proximity-based transmission it is intended to control is challenging to incorporate into generalized, ventilation-based models. We utilize a size-dependent aerosol release model with turbulent dispersion to assess the impact of direct, near-field transport in conjunction with changes in ventilation, exposure duration, exhalation/inhalation rates, and masks. We demonstrate this model on indoor and outdoor scenarios to estimate the relative impacts on infection risk. The model can be expressed as a product of six multiplicative factors that may be used to identify opportunities for risk reduction. The additive nature of the short-range (proximity) and long-range (background) transmission components of the aerosol transport factor implies that they must be minimized simultaneously. Indoor simulations showed that close physical distances attenuated the impact of most other risk reduction factors. Increasing ventilation resulted in a 17-fold risk decrease at further physical distances but only a 6-fold decrease at shorter distances. Distance, emission rate, and duration also had large impacts on risk (11-65-fold), while air direction and inhalation rate had lower risk impacts (3-4-fold range). Surgical mask and respirator models predicted higher maximum risk impacts (33- and 280-fold, respectively) than cloth masks (4-fold). Most simulations showed decreasing risk at distances > 1-2 m (3-6 ft). The risk benefit of maintaining 2-m distance vs. 1 m depended substantially on the environmental turbulence and ventilation rate. Outdoors, long-range transmission was negligible and short-range transmission was the primary determinant of risk. Temporary passing events increased risk by up to 50 times at very slow walking speeds and close passing distances, but the relative risks outdoors were still much lower than indoors. The current model assumes turbulent dispersion typical of a given room size and ventilation rate. However, calm environments or confined airflows may increase transmission risks beyond levels predicted with this turbulent model.","Wagner, Jeff; Sparks, Tamara L; Miller, Shelly; Chen, Wenhao; Macher, Janet M; Waldman, Jed M",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34515602/; https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2021.1963445,138

The disease raised an unprecedented demand for intensive care support due to severe pulmonary dysfunction and multiorgan failure. Although the pulmonary system is the potential target of the COVID-19, recent reports have demonstrated that COVID-19 profoundly influences the cardiovascular system and the kidneys. Research studies on cadavers have shown that direct heart and kidney injury can be frequently seen in patients deceased due to COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, functional or structural dysfunction of the heart may deteriorate the renal function and vice versa. This concept is already known as the cardiorenal syndrome and may play a role in COVID-19. Proactive monitoring of micro- and macrohemodynamics could allow prompt correction of circulatory dysfunction and can be of pivotal importance in the prevention of acute kidney injury. Moreover, type and amount of fluid therapy and vasoactive drug support could help manage these patients either with or without mechanical ventilator support. This brief review outlines the current evidence regarding the COVID-19-related renal and cardiorenal complications and discusses potential hemodynamic management strategies.","Guven, Goksel; Ince, Can; Topeli, Arzu; Caliskan, Kadir",Cardiorenal Med,https://doi.org/10.1159/000516740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082420/,138

Faced with a new reality, and until a vaccine or efficient treatment is found, humanity must figure out ways to keep the economy going, on one hand, while keeping the population safe, on the other hand, especially those that are susceptible to this virus. Here, we use a Watts–Strogatz network simulation, with parameters that were drawn from what is already known about the virus, to explore five different scenarios of partial lockdown release in two geographical locations with different age distributions. We find that separating age groups by reducing interactions between them protects the general population and reduces mortality rates. Furthermore, the addition of new connections within the same age group to compensate for the lost connections outside the age group still has a strong beneficial influence and reduces the total death toll by about 62%. While complete isolation from society may be the most protective scenario for the elderly population, it would have an emotional and possibly cognitive impact that might outweigh its benefit. Therefore, we propose creating age-related social recommendations or even restrictions, thereby allowing social connections while still offering strong protection for the older population.","Mizrahi, Liron; Shekhidem, Huda Adwan; Stern, Shani",Open Biol,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.200213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33171068/,138

The main object of the current research was to estimate the antiviral activity of cannabinoids (CBDs) against the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In the presented research work, we performed in silico and in vitro experiments to aid the sighting of lead CBDs for treating the viral infections of SARS-CoV-2. Virtual screening was carried out for interactions between 32 CBDs and the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) enzyme. Afterward, in vitro antiviral activity was carried out of five CBDs molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, among them, two CBDs molecules namely Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (IC(50) = 10.25 μM) and cannabidiol (IC(50) = 7.91 μM) were observed to be more potent antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference drugs lopinavir, chloroquine, and remdesivir (IC(50) ranges of 8.16–13.15 μM). These molecules were found to have stable conformations with the active binding pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) by molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory. Our findings suggest cannabidiol and Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol are possible drugs against human coronavirus that might be used in combination or with other drug molecules to treat COVID-19 patients.","Raj, Vinit; Park, Jae Gyu; Cho, Kiu-Hyung; Choi, Pilju; Kim, Taejung; Ham, Jungyeob; Lee, Jintae",Int J Biol Macromol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813020351783; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813020351783; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33290767/,138

634315,The Refugee and Immigrant Core Stressors Toolkit (RICST): Understanding the Multifaceted Needs of Refugee and Immigrant Youth and Families Through a Four Core Stressors Framework,2021-07-09,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has become an ongoing pandemic. Understanding the respiratory immune microenvironment which is composed of multiple cell types, together with cell communication based on ligand–receptor interactions is important for developing vaccines, probing COVID-19 pathogenesis, and improving pandemic control measures. METHODS: A total of 102 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Clinical information, routine laboratory tests, and flow cytometry analysis data with different conditions were collected and assessed for predictive value in COVID-19 patients. Next, we analyzed public single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which offers the closest available view of immune cell heterogeneity as encountered in patients with varying severity of COVID-19. A weighting algorithm was used to calculate ligand–receptor interactions, revealing the communication potentially associated with outcomes across cell types. Finally, serum cytokines including IL6, IL1β, IL10, CXCL10, TNFα, GALECTIN-1, and IGF1 derived from patients were measured. RESULTS: Of the 102 COVID-19 patients, 42 cases (41.2%) were categorized as severe. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that AST, D-dimer, BUN, and WBC were considered as independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. T cell numbers including total T cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the severe disease group were significantly lower than those in the moderate disease group. The risk model containing the above mentioned inflammatory damage parameters, and the counts of T cells, with AUROCs ranged from 0.78 to 0.87. To investigate the molecular mechanism at the cellular level, we analyzed the published scRNA-seq data and found that macrophages displayed specific functional diversity after SARS-Cov-2 infection, and the metabolic pathway activities in the identified macrophage subtypes were influenced by hypoxia status. Importantly, we described ligand–receptor interactions that are related to COVID-19 serverity involving macrophages and T cell subsets by communication analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that macrophages driving ligand–receptor crosstalk contributed to the reduction and exhaustion of CD8(+) T cells. The identified crucial cytokine panel, including IL6, IL1β, IL10, CXCL10, IGF1, and GALECTIN-1, may offer the selective targets to improve the efficacy of COVID-19 therapy.

634571,Disinfection of aircraft: Appropriate disinfectants and standard operating procedures for highly infectious diseases,2016-10-26,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of effective pharmacotherapy for prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Evidence suggests that the neurobiology of PGD involves the same circuitry as the reward pathway. Based upon this evidence, we hypothesize that PGD can be conceptualized as a disorder of addiction and therefore could benefit from being treated with medications that are currently used to treat such disorders. One such medication is naltrexone, which is currently used to treat alcohol and opioid dependence. Oral naltrexone was chosen for its mechanism of action, safety, and convenience. The primary aim of this study is to establish the efficacy of using oral naltrexone as a pharmacological treatment for PGD. Specifically, we hypothesize that participants receiving naltrexone will demonstrate reduced PGD symptoms when compared to placebo. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blinded (to healthcare professionals/study staff, participants, and data analysts) study in which we propose to enroll 48 participants who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD). Participants will be randomly assigned to the naltrexone 50 mg oral arm or placebo arm; medications will be over-encapsulated to appear identical. Participants will take their assigned medication for 8 weeks, with clinic visits every 4 weeks to assess symptom severity, social closeness, and adverse reactions. Weekly surveys of Prolonged Grief-13-Revised (PG-13-R) will be used to relate naltrexone use to changes in PGD symptom severity. Follow-up 4 weeks after their last visit will assess the longevity of treatment, as well as any lingering adverse reactions. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to investigate the use of oral naltrexone as pharmacological treatment for PGD. The acute and debilitating nature of the disorder, in addition to the increased risk of comorbidities, highlights the need for pharmacological treatment like naltrexone that can act more rapidly, may help those for whom psychotherapy may not be effective, and/or may augment psychotherapy to promote PGD symptom grief resolution.

Despite high sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-1 and −2, each strain has distinctive virulence. A better understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms mediating changes in virulence is needed. Here, we profile the virus-host protein-protein interactions of two hCoV non-structural proteins (nsps) that are critical for virus replication. We use tandem mass tag-multiplexed quantitative proteomics to sensitively compare and contrast the interactomes of nsp2 and nsp4 from three betacoronavirus strains: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-OC43 – an endemic strain associated with the common cold. This approach enables the identification of both unique and shared host cell protein binding partners and the ability to further compare the enrichment of common interactions across homologs from related strains. We identify common nsp2 interactors involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) signaling and mitochondria biogenesis. We also identifiy nsp4 interactors unique to each strain, such as E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes for SARS-CoV-1 and ER homeostasis factors for SARS-CoV-2. Common nsp4 interactors include N-linked glycosylation machinery, unfolded protein response (UPR) associated proteins, and anti-viral innate immune signaling factors. Both nsp2 and nsp4 interactors are strongly enriched in proteins localized at mitochondrial-associated ER membranes suggesting a new functional role for modulating host processes, such as calcium homeostasis, at these organelle contact sites. Our results shed light on the role these hCoV proteins play in the infection cycle, as well as host factors that may mediate the divergent pathogenesis of OC43 from SARS strains. Our mass spectrometry workflow enables rapid and robust comparisons of multiple bait proteins, which can be applied to additional viral proteins. Furthermore, the identified common interactions may present new targets for exploration by host-directed anti-viral therapeutics.","Davies, Jonathan P.; Almasy, Katherine M.; McDonald, Eli F.; Plate, Lars",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.201517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699849/,138

Sa prévalence semble différente à travers le monde. Plusieurs mécanismes physiopathologiques sont impliqués, parmi lesquelles une hypoperfusion rénale liée à la ventilation mécanique, au sepsis et à l’orage cytokinique, ainsi qu’une toxicité directe du virus sur les cellules tubulaires proximales et les podocytes, médiée par les récepteurs de conversion de l’angiotensine 2 (ACE 2) et les protéases TMPRSS. Le recours à l’épuration extra rénale (EER) est de l’ordre de 20% chez les patients de réanimation.

Summary Renal impairment is a common complication in patients hospitalized in intensive care unit for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 infection. However, the prevalence of SARS-covid2 kidney injury is difficult to estimate worldwide. Several pathophysiological mechanisms are involved; including decreased renal perfusion related to mechanical ventilation, sepsis and cytokines release, as well as direct virus toxicity on proximal tubular cells and podocytes, mediated by angiotensin 2 conversion receptors (ACE 2) and TMPRSS proteases. More than 20% of ICU COVID-19 patients require extra renal replacement therapy (ERT) for acute renal failure that is made difficult by the hypercoagulable state of these patients, responsible for filter thrombosis.","Darriverre, Lucie; Fieux, Fabienne; de la Jonquiere, Christophe",Prat Anesth Reanim,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pratan.2020.07.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1279796020300905; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279796020300905?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837207/,138

Its frequency and persistence have implications for service delivery and workforce planning. AIMS: This study was aimed to assess the prevalence of symptoms consistent with PCS and the subjective degree of recovery in a cohort of healthcare workers, focusing on those who have returned to work. METHODS: A study population of 1176 was surveyed when attending for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody testing. Two sub-groups were identified: those with known (i.e. diagnosed on PCR testing) and assumed (i.e. antibody evidence of previous infection) SARs-CoV-2 infection, at least 12 weeks prior to the study. Each group was asked about their subjective degree of recovery and the nature of their persistent symptoms. Results were analysed via excel and SPSS. RESULTS: In total, 144 employees showed PCR evidence of previous infection, with 139 of these being infected at least 12 weeks prior to the study. Of these 139, only 19% (n = 26) reported feeling 100% recovered, and 71% reported persistent symptoms. Of those with assumed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 78), 32 (41%) were truly asymptomatic since the commencement of the pandemic, while 46 (59%) described symptoms suggestive of possible infection at least 12 weeks prior to the study. Of this latter group, 23% (n = 18) also reported residual symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: PCS is prevalent among this group, including those not previously diagnosed with COVID-19.

METHODS: Concentrations of lopinavir/ritonavir were assayed by an accredited LC-MS/MS method. The population pharmacokinetics of lopinavir was described using non-linear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM version 7.4). After determination of the base model that better described the data set, the influence of covariates (age, body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), gender, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), C reactive protein (CRP), and trough ritonavir concentrations) was tested on the model. RESULTS: From 13 hospitalized patients (4 females, 9 males, age = 64 ± 16 years), 70 lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations were available for analysis. The data were best described by a one-compartment model with a first-order input (KA). Among the covariates tested on the PK parameters, only the ritonavir trough concentrations had a significant effect on CL/F and improved the fit. Model-based simulations with the final parameter estimates under a regimen lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg b.i.d. showed a high variability with median concentration between 20 and 30 mg/L (C(min)/C(max)) and the 90% prediction intervals within the range 1–100 mg/L. CONCLUSION: According to the estimated 50% effective concentration of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells (16.7 mg/L), our model showed that at steady state, a dose of 400 mg b.i.d. led to 40% of patients below the minimum effective concentration while a dose of 1200 mg b.i.d. will reduce this proportion to 22%.

The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS England) has provided formal recognition, support and guidance to all members of its interdisciplinary collaborative COVID Research Group (RCS CRG). We describe research conducted by members of this group, initial findings and lessons for clinical practice so far. METHODS: Members of the more than 50 projects included so far in the RCS CRG portfolio were invited to provide a summary of their project and findings to date. The 26 summaries received were collated and broad themes identified to produce this summary document. RESULTS: Wide-ranging projects have been conducted by members of the RCS CRG, rapidly yielding crucial insights into the behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen, its impact on patients and staff, the challenges it presents to surgical practice and investigation into methods to adapt and overcome such challenges. CONCLUSIONS: The response of the surgical research community to COVID-19 has been rapid and well-organised. Early establishment of a formal network under the auspices of RCS England has assisted efficient research collaboration and delivery, while avoiding academic duplication between groups. This has led to a high research output, directly informing and substantially influencing practice throughout and beyond the pandemic.","Mehendale, F V; Gupta, S; Beamish, A J; Akkulak, M; Hutchinson, P",Ann.

However, the potential effect that medications may have on the vitamin D status is rarely taken into consideration. This literature review was undertaken to assess the degree to which vitamin D status may be affected by medication. Electronic databases were searched to identify literature relating to this subject, and study characteristics and conclusions were scrutinized for evidence of potential associations. The following groups of drugs were identified in one or more studies to affect vitamin D status in some way: anti-epileptics, laxatives, metformin, loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, statins, calcium channel blockers, antagonists of vitamin K, platelet aggregation inhibitors, digoxin, potassium-sparing diuretics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, proton pump inhibitors, histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists, bile acid sequestrants, corticosteroids, antimicrobials, sulphonamides and urea derivatives, lipase inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine, highly active antiretroviral agents, and certain chemotherapeutic agents. Given that the quality of the data is heterogeneous, newer, more robustly designed studies are required to better define likely interactions between vitamin D and medications. This is especially so for cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4)-metabolized medications. Nevertheless, this review suggests that providers of health care ought to be alert to the potential of vitamin D depletions induced by medications, especially in elderly people exposed to multiple-drug therapy, and to provide supplementation if required.","Wakeman, Michael",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421316/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s316897,138
638845,The impact of host genetic background in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa respiratory infections,2018-06-12,"During the intracellular life of Salmonella enterica, a unique membrane-bound compartment termed Salmonella-containing vacuole, or SCV, is formed. By means of translocated effector proteins, intracellular Salmonella also induce the formation of extensive, highly dynamic membrane tubules termed Salmonella-induced filaments or SIF. Here we report the first detailed ultrastructural analyses of the SCV and SIF by electron microscopy (EM), EM tomography and live cell correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). We found that a subset of SIF is composed of double membranes that enclose portions of host cell cytosol and cytoskeletal filaments within its inner lumen. Despite some morphological similarities, we found that the formation of SIF double membranes is independent from autophagy and requires the function of the effector proteins SseF and SseG. The lumen of SIF network is accessible to various types of endocytosed material and our CLEM analysis of double membrane SIF demonstrated that fluid phase markers accumulate only between the inner and outer membrane of these structures, a space continual with endosomal lumen. Our work reveals how manipulation of the endosomal membrane system by an intracellular pathogen results in a unique tubular membrane compartmentalization of the host cell, generating a shielded niche permissive for intracellular proliferation of Salmonella.","Krieger, Viktoria; Liebl, David; Zhang, Yuying; Rajashekar, Roopa; Chlanda, Petr; Giesker, Katrin; Chikkaballi, Deepak; Hensel, Michael",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25254663/,138

The purpose of this study was to assess for the prevalence and consequences of spontaneous echo contrast on point-of-care vascular ultrasound in coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 39 adult patients admitted to the ICU with a confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis at a large tertiary-care academic medical center. Patients were included if they had undergone a vascular ultrasound examination during their ICU admission. Overall, 48 venous ultrasound studies among the 39 patients were reviewed in blinded fashion by two reviewers for the presence of venous spontaneous echo contrast, and charts were analyzed for laboratory data and outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: S: pontaneous echo contrast correlated with serum viscosity (mean values of 2.64, 2.54, and 2.04 cP for dense spontaneous echo contrast, spontaneous echo contrast , and no spontaneous echo contrast, respectively, with a p value of 0.0056 for spontaneous echo contrast compared with negative spontaneous echo contrast) and hyperfibrinogenemia (mean values of 726.6, 668.5, and 566.6 mg/dL for dense spontaneous echo contrast, positive spontaneous echo contrast, and negative spontaneous echo contrast, respectively, with a p value of 0.0045 for dense spontaneous echo contrast compared with negative spontaneous echo contrast). About 36% of patients with dense spontaneous echo contrast and 33% of individuals with positive spontaneous echo contrast experienced significant clotting events compared with 17% of those with negative spontaneous echo contrast. A total of 19% of patients with spontaneous echo contrast suffered a cardiac arrest following a major clotting event, and there were no cardiac arrests from clotting events in the negative spontaneous echo contrast group. There was no association with the presence of spontaneous echo contrast and right or left cardiac function or other laboratory values such as d-dimer, external thromboelastometry - maximum lysis, platelet counts, C-reactive protein, or interleukin-6. CONCLUSIONS: Point-of-care venous ultrasonography is easily performed and reliably interpreted for visualization of spontaneous echo contrast. The presence of spontaneous echo contrast in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with hyperviscosity and increased rates of thrombotic events and complications.","Connor-Schuler, Randi; Daniels, Lisa; Coleman, Caroline; Harris, Danny; Herbst, Nicole; Fiza, Babar",Crit Care Explor,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33458687/,138

This study assessed the association of ACE-I/ARB therapy with the development of severe COVID-19. METHODS: This multi-center, prospective study enrolled patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and receiving one or more antihypertensive agents to manage either hypertension or cardiovascular disease. ACE-I/ARB therapy associations with severe COVID-19 on the day of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death on follow-up were tested using a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for age, obesity, and chronic illnesses. The composite outcome of mechanical ventilation and death was examined using the adjusted Cox multivariate regression model. RESULTS: Of 338 enrolled patients, 245 (72.4%) were using ACE-I/ARB on the day of hospital admission, and 197 continued ACE-I/ARB therapy during hospitalization. Ninety-eight (29%) patients had a severe COVID-19, which was not significantly associated with the use of ACE-I/ARB (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.66-2.09; P = .57). Prehospitalization ACE-I/ARB therapy was not associated with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. Continuing ACE-I/ARB therapy during hospitalization was associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.073-0.67; P = .008). ACE-I/ARB use was not associated with developing the composite outcome of mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.51-1.78; P = .87) versus not using ACE-I/ARB. CONCLUSION: Patients with hypertension or cardiovascular diseases receiving ACE-I/ARB therapy are not at increased risk for severe COVID-19 on admission to the hospital. ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality are not associated with ACE-I/ARB therapy. Maintaining ACE-I/ARB therapy during hospitalization for COVID-19 lowers the likelihood of death.

These are being used for a wide variety of purposes including disseminating, discussing and seeking health related information. U.S. Federal health agencies are leveraging these platforms to ‘engage’ social media users to read, spread, promote and encourage health related discussions. However, different agencies and their communications get varying levels of engagement. In this study we use statistical models to identify factors that associate with engagement. METHODS: We analyze over 45,000 Facebook posts from 72 Facebook accounts belonging to 24 health agencies. Account usage, user activity, sentiment and content of these posts are studied. We use the hurdle regression model to identify factors associated with the level of engagement and Cox proportional hazards model to identify factors associated with duration of engagement. RESULTS: In our analysis we find that agencies and accounts vary widely in their usage of social media and activity they generate. Statistical analysis shows, for instance, that Facebook posts with more visual cues such as photos or videos or those which express positive sentiment generate more engagement. We further find that posts on certain topics such as occupation or organizations negatively affect the duration of engagement. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first comprehensive analyses of engagement with U.S. Federal health agencies on Facebook.

The causes of the disease are still largely unexplained, and no causative treatment is currently available. Changes in the immune response are considered as fundamental in the development of ME/CFS. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the immunological profile of ME/CFS patients in a retrospective data analysis. As part of the routine workup for ME/CFS patients, a differential blood count, leukocyte subtyping, and quantification of immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses, as well as a complement analysis, was performed. Out of 262 ME/CFS patients, 64.9% had a reduction or deficiency in at least one of the listed immune parameters. In contrast, 26.3% showed signs of immune activation or inflammation. A total of 17.6% of the ME/CFS patients had an unclassified antibody deficiency, with IgG3 and IgG4 subclass deficiencies as the most common phenotypes. Reduced MBL (mannose-binding lectin) levels were found in 32% of ME/CFS patients, and MBL deficiency in 7%. In summary, the present results confirmed the relevance of immune dysfunction in ME/CFS patients underlining the involvement of a dysfunctional immune response in the disease. Thus, immune parameters are relevant disease biomarkers, which might lead to targeted therapeutic approaches in the future.","Lutz, Lena; Rohrhofer, Johanna; Zehetmayer, Sonja; Stingl, Michael; Untersmayr, Eva",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11091359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572574/,138

They can kill diseased cells and produce cytokines and chemokines, thereby shaping the adaptive immune response. Nowadays, NK cells are considered as a strong weapon for cancer immunotherapy and can for example be transduced to express tumor-specific chimeric antigen receptors or harnessed with therapeutic antibodies such as the so-called NK engagers. Whereas a large body of literature exists about the antiviral and antitumoral properties of NK cells, their potential role in bacterial infections is not that well delineated. Furthermore, NK cells are much more heterogeneous than previously thought and have tissue-characteristic features and phenotypes. This review gives an overview of airway NK cells and their position within the immunological army dressed against bacterial infections in the upper and predominantly the lower respiratory tracts. Whereas it appears that in several infections, NK cells play a non-redundant and protective role, they can likewise act as rather detrimental. The use of mouse models and the difficulty of access to human airway tissues for ethical reasons might partly explain the divergent results. However, new methods are appearing that are likely to reduce the heterogeneity between studies and to give a more coherent picture in this field.","Theresine, Maud; Patil, Neha D.; Zimmer, Jacques",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101315/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.585048,138

In order to effectively promote the overall recovery of patients’ physical and mental function and quality of life (QOL), the focus of clinical work should be gradually shifted to rehabilitation treatment. Dance-based mind-motor activities were defined as coordinated upright mind-motor movements that emphasize dynamic balance, structured through music or an inner rhythm (e.g., breathing) and distinctive instructions or choreography, and that involve social interaction. It has positive effects on motor function, lung function, psychological mood and other aspects, so it can be used as a safe alternative therapy for patients recovering from COVID-19. At present, there are no relevant articles for systematic review. METHODS: From its inception until March 2021, we will conduct a comprehensive electronic search, including Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, Springer, EMBASE, Chinese Science Citation Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Wan-fang database. Two independent researchers will conduct article retrieval, screening, quality assessment, and data analysis through the Review Manager (V. 5.3.5). RESULTS: The results of this study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dance-based mind-motor activities for the improvement of QOL in COVID-19 patients during the recovery period. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of the study will provide an evidence to judge whether dance-based mind-motor activities is effective and safe for COVID-19 in recovery period.

Google and Apple recently announced the intention to build interfaces to allow Bluetooth contact tracking using Android and iPhone devices. In this article we look at the compatibility of the proposed Apple/Google Bluetooth exposure notification system with Western privacy and data protection regimes and principles, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Somewhat counter-intuitively, the GDPR’s expansive scope is not a hindrance, but rather an advantage in conditions of uncertainty such as a pandemic. Its principle-based approach offers a functional blueprint for system design that is compatible with fundamental rights. By contrast, narrower, sector-specific rules such as the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and even the new California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), leave gaps that may prove difficult to bridge in the middle of an emergency.","Bradford, Laura; Aboy, Mateo; Liddell, Kathleen",J Law Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32728470/,138
642265,The Importance of miRNA Identification During Respiratory Viral Infections,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty leaves older adults vulnerable to adverse health outcomes. Frailty assessment is recommended by multiple COVID‐19 guidelines to inform care and resource allocation. We aimed to identify, describe, and synthesize studies reporting the association of frailty with outcomes (informed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Triple Aim [health, resource use, and experience]) in individuals with COVID‐19. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta‐analysis. SETTING: Studies reporting associations between frailty and outcomes in the setting of COVID‐19 diagnosis. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with COVID‐19. MEASUREMENTS: Following review of titles, abstracts and full text, we included 52 studies that contained 118,373 participants with COVID‐19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic studies tool. Our primary outcome was mortality, secondary outcomes included delirium, intensive care unit admission, need for ventilation and discharge location. Where appropriate, random‐effects meta‐analysis was used to pool adjusted and unadjusted effect measures by frailty instrument. RESULTS: The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was the most used frailty instrument. Mortality was reported in 37 studies. After confounder adjustment, frailty identified using the CFS was significantly associated with mortality in COVID‐19 positive patients (odds ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49–2.14; hazard ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.33–2.61). On an unadjusted basis, frailty identified using the CFS was significantly associated with increased odds of delirium and reduced odds of intensive care unit admission. Results were generally consistent using other frailty instruments. Patient‐reported, cost and experience outcomes were rarely reported. CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with a substantial increase in mortality risk in COVID‐19 patients, even after adjustment. Delirium risk is also increased. Frailty assessment may help to guide prognosis and individualized care planning, but data relating frailty status to patient‐reported outcomes are urgently needed to provide a more comprehensive overview of outcomes relevant to older adults.","Dumitrascu, Flavia; Branje, Karina E.; Hladkowicz, Emily S.; Lalu, Manoj; McIsaac, Daniel I.",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34048599/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17299,138

The targeted time frame for initial vaccine deployment is late 2020. The present article examines whether short-term, mid-term, and long-term vaccine safety can be achieved under such an accelerated schedule, given the myriad vaccine-induced mechanisms that have demonstrated adverse effects based on previous clinical trials and laboratory research. It presents scientific evidence of potential pitfalls associated with eliminating critical phase II and III clinical trials, and concludes that there is no substitute currently available for long-term human clinical trials to ensure long-term human safety.","Kostoff, Ronald N.; Briggs, Michael B.; Porter, Alan L.; Spandidos, Demetrios A.; Tsatsakis, Aristidis",Int J Mol Med,https://doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.2020.4733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33000193/,138

In this study, we provide a full account of the evolutionary relationships between proteins of significant sequence and structural similarity found in viruses that belong to different classes according to the Baltimore classification. We show that such proteins can be found in viruses from all Baltimore classes. For protein families that include these proteins, we observe two patterns of the taxonomic spread. In the first pattern, they can be found in a large number of viruses from all implicated Baltimore classes. In the other pattern, the instances of the corresponding protein in species from each Baltimore class are restricted to a few compact clades. Proteins with the first pattern of distribution are products of so-called viral hallmark genes reported previously. Additionally, this pattern is displayed by the envelope glycoproteins from Flaviviridae and Bunyaviridae and helicases of superfamilies 1 and 2 that have homologs in cellular organisms. The second pattern can often be explained by horizontal gene transfer from the host or between viruses, an example being Orthomyxoviridae and Coronaviridae hemagglutinin esterases. Another facet of horizontal gene transfer comprises multiple independent introduction events of genes from cellular organisms into otherwise unrelated viruses.","Caprari, Silvia; Metzler, Saskia; Lengauer, Thomas; Kalinina, Olga V.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v7102882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26492264/,138

Because no animal reservoir carrying closely related hepaciviruses has been identified, the zoonotic origins of HCV still remain unresolved. Motivated by recent findings of divergent hepaciviruses in rodents and a plausible African origin of HCV genotypes, we have screened a large collection of small mammals samples from seven sub-Saharan African countries. Out of 4,303 samples screened, eighty were found positive for the presence of hepaciviruses in twenty-nine different host species. We, here, report fifty-six novel genomes that considerably increase the diversity of three divergent rodent hepacivirus lineages. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence for hepacivirus co-infections in rodents, which were exclusively found in four sampled species of brush-furred mice. We also detect evidence of recombination within specific host lineages. Our study expands the available hepacivirus genomic data and contributes insights into the relatively deep evolutionary history of these pathogens in rodents. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of rodents as a potential hepacivirus reservoir and as models for investigating HCV infection dynamics.","Bletsa, Magda; Vrancken, Bram; Gryseels, Sophie; Boonen, Ine; Fikatas, Antonios; Li, Yiqiao; Laudisoit, Anne; Lequime, Sebastian; Bryja, Josef; Makundi, Rhodes; Meheretu, Yonas; Akaibe, Benjamin Dudu; Mbalitini, Sylvestre Gambalemoke; Van de Perre, Frederik; Van Houtte, Natalie; Těšíková, Jana; Wollants, Elke; Van Ranst, Marc; Pybus, Oliver G; Drexler, Jan Felix; Verheyen, Erik; Leirs, Herwig; Gouy de Bellocq, Joelle; Lemey, Philippe",Virus Evol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veab036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34221451/,138

METHOD: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE up to August 10(th), 2020. The adjusted effect estimates were extracted and pooled to evaluate the risk of the unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients with cerebrovascular disease. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were also carried out. RESULTS: There were 12 studies with 10,304 patients included in our meta-analysis. A significant trend was observed when evaluating the association between cerebrovascular disease and adverse outcomes (pooled effect = 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34-3.16). In addition, the pooled effects showed that patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease had more likelihood to progress fatal outcomes than patients without a history of cerebrovascular disease (pooled effect = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.04-3.07). CONCLUSION: This study for the first time indicated that cerebrovascular disease was an independent risk factor for predicting the adverse outcomes, particularly fatal outcomes, in COVID-19 patients on the basis of adjusted effect estimates. Well-designed studies with larger sample size are needed for further verification.","Xu, Jie; Xiao, Wenwei; Liang, Xuan; Zhang, Peihua; Shi, Li; Wang, Ying; Wang, Yadong; Yang, Haiyan",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33066922/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105283; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305720307011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305720307011?v=s5,138

OBJECTIVE: : To explore the psychology of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization. METHODS: : A phenomenological and robust sampling approach was employed. Sixteen patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology with COVID-19 from 20th January to 1st March 2020 were selected. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, phone calls, or face-to-face interviews using quarantine measures. Data were analyzed using the Colaizzi method. RESULTS: : The psychological experience of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization could be summarized into five themes. Firstly, attitudes toward the disease included fear, denial, and stigma during the early stages, which gradually developed into acceptance in the later stages. Secondly, the major source of stress included the viral nature of the disease, quarantine measures, and concerns regarding the health of family members. Thirdly, reactions of body and mind included disease stage-dependent emotional responses, excessive attention to symptoms, rumination, and changes in diet, sleep, and behavior. Fourthly, supportive factors included psychological adjustments, medical care, and family and social support. Finally, the disease resulted in psychological growth and patients viewed problems with gratitude through the cherishing of life, family, bravery, and tenacity. CONCLUSION: : COVID-19 patients gradually changed their attitude toward the disease and displayed emotional responses dependent on the stage of the disease. Negative emotions dominated during the early stages but gradually gave way to mixed positive and negative emotions. Active guidance of psychological growth may therefore promote physical and mental recovery in COVID-19 patients.","Sun, Niuniu; Wei, Luoqun; Wang, Hongyun; Wang, Xianru; Gao, Mingxia; Hu, Xinjun; Shi, Suling",J Affect Disord,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032720326458?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32949869/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032720326458; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.040,138

Currently, there is limited knowledge on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 ICU-survivors and the impact on family members. This study aimed to gain an insight into the long-term physical, social and psychological functioning of COVID-19 ICU-survivors and their family members at three- and six-months following ICU discharge. Methods: A single-center, prospective cohort study was conducted among COVID-19 ICU-survivors and their family members. Participants received questionnaires at three and six months after ICU discharge. Physical functioning was evaluated using the MOS Short-Form General Health Survey, Clinical Frailty Scale and spirometry tests. Social functioning was determined using the McMaster Family Assessment Device and return to work. Psychological functioning was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: Sixty COVID-19 ICU-survivors and 78 family members participated in this study. Physical functioning was impaired in ICU-survivors as reflected by a score of 33.3 (IQR 16.7–66.7) and 50 (IQR 16.7–83.3) out of 100 at 3- and 6-month follow-ups, respectively. Ninety percent of ICU-survivors reported persistent symptoms after 6 months. Social functioning was impaired since 90% of COVID-19 ICU-survivors had not reached their pre-ICU work level 6 months after ICU-discharge. Psychological functioning was unaffected in COVID-19 ICU-survivors. Family members experienced worse work status in 35% and 34% of cases, including a decrease in work rate among 18.3% and 7.4% of cases at 3- and 6-months post ICU-discharge, respectively. Psychologically, 63% of family members reported ongoing impaired well-being due to the COVID-19-related mandatory physical distance from their relatives. Conclusion: COVID-19 ICU-survivors suffer from a prolonged disease burden, which is prominent in physical and social functioning, work status and persisting symptoms among 90% of patients. Family members reported a reduction in return to work and impaired well-being. Further research is needed to extend the follow-up period and study the effects of standardized rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients and their family members.","van Veenendaal, Nadine; van der Meulen, Ingeborg C.; Onrust, Marisa; Paans, Wolter; Dieperink, Willem; van der Voort, Peter H.

Such technologies are essential to support seroprevalence studies and vaccine clinical trials, and to monitor quality and duration of immunity. We developed a microfluidic nanoimmunoassay (NIA) for the detection of anti–SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1,024 samples per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultralow-volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glucose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 μL of whole blood easily obtainable from a simple finger prick. The NIA platform achieves high throughput, high sensitivity, and specificity based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples, and negligible reagent consumption. We furthermore demonstrate the possibility to combine NIA with decentralized and simple approaches to blood sample collection. We expect this technology to be applicable to current and future SARS-CoV-2 related serological studies and to protein biomarker analysis in general.","Swank, Zoe; Michielin, Grégoire; Yip, Hon Ming; Cohen, Patrick; Andrey, Diego O.; Vuilleumier, Nicolas; Kaiser, Laurent; Eckerle, Isabella; Meyer, Benjamin; Maerkl, Sebastian J.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2025289118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33945500/,138
645379,"Of plagues, planes and politics: Controlling the global spread of infectious diseases by air",2009-11-02,"Objective Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe morbidity and mortality due to respiratory infections like SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) during pregnancy1. Those with substance use disorders (SUD) may be especially vulnerable due to high rates of smoked tobacco, cannabis and methamphetamine use which adversely affect pulmonary function.2 However, little is known about differential effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women with and without SUD. Study Design This was a retrospective cohort study of commercially insured pregnant women ages 15-44 using national administrative healthcare data from Optum’s deidentified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database version 8.1 (2007-2020). Women with a delivery hospitalization between January 1, 2020-August 19, 2020 continuously enrolled in insurance for ≥8 weeks during pregnancy and 6 weeks postpartum were included. SUD was defined using ICD-10 diagnoses for ≥ 1 SUD during pregnancy including alcohol, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, opioid or other substance use disorder.3 COVID-19 screening and diagnosis were defined using ICD-10 coding and reporting guidelines published by the CDC.4, 5 We used T-tests, Fisher’s exact tests, and quantile regression (percentiles) to examine statistical differences. This study was exempt by the University of Pittsburgh IRB because deidentified healthcare data were used. Results Among 65,009 pregnancies, 2,616 (4.0%) had ≥1 SUD diagnosis. Almost half of the pregnant women in the cohort were non-Hispanic White (48%) and most lived in the South (41%) or the Midwest (28%) region of the United States (Table). Pregnant women with an SUD diagnosis were significantly more likely to be younger (30±6 vs 32±5; p<.05). Compared with the overall sample, non-Hispanic Black (10% vs 7%; p,.05) and non-Hispanic White (54% vs 48%; p<.05) women were overrepresented among those with SUD as opposed to Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian women. Overall, 27% of pregnant women were screened and evaluated for COVID-19 during pregnancy or postpartum. Women without an SUD diagnosis were significantly more likely to be screened for COVID-19 during pregnancy (27% vs 24%; p<0.001) than those with an SUD. Overall, 3.4% of pregnant women were diagnosed with COVID-19, mostly (86%) in the third trimester. The prevalence of a COVID-19 diagnosis was higher among those with a SUD compared to those without an SUD (5% vs 3%; p<0.05). Further, there was a higher percentage of COVID-19 related hospitalizations among pregnant women with an SUD (36%) than those without an SUD (8%) (p<0.001). The median length of stay was one day longer among those with a SUD (3 vs 2 days; p<0.01) compared to those without an SUD. There were no COVID-19 related deaths reported during pregnancy or postpartum. Conclusion In this national cohort, pregnant women with a SUD had a higher COVID-19 diagnosis rate than those without a SUD, despite lower screening rates. Among those with a COVID-19 diagnosis, pregnant women with a SUD had a significantly higher rate of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and longer median length of stay than those without a SUD. Efforts to improve COVID-19 screening rates and decrease morbidity associated with COVID-19 diagnosis among pregnant women with SUDs may be warranted.","GAO, Yitong; JARLENSKI, Marian P.; CHEN, Qingwen; KRANS, Elizabeth E.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937821006359; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2021.06.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937821006359?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34116037/,138
646345,The spreading of infectious diseases in modern socio-technical systems Comment on “Pattern transitions in spatial epidemics: Mechanisms and emergent properties” by Gui-Quan Sun et al.,2016-09-19,"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which belongs to coronaviridae family. Despite the global prevalence, there are currently no vaccines or drugs. Dietary plant derived exosome-like vesicles are known as edible nanoparticles (ENPs). ENPs are filled with microRNAs (miRNAs), in bioavailable form. Recently, cross-kingdom regulation of human transcripts by plant miRNAs have been demonstrated. However, ENP derived miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 has not been described. STUDY DESIGN: Mature ENP-derived miRNA sequences were retrieved from small RNA sequencing datasets available in the literature. In silico target prediction was performed to identify miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2. ENPs were isolated from ginger and grapefruit plants and the expression of SARS-CoV-2 targeting miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: From a total of 260 ENP-derived miRNAs, we identified 22 miRNAs that could potentially target SARS-CoV-2 genome. 11 miRNAs showed absolute target specificity towards SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV. ENPs from soybean, ginger, hamimelon, grapefruit, tomato and pear possess multiple miRNAs targeting different regions within SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, osa/cme miR-530b-5p specifically targeted the ribosomal slippage site between ORF1a and ORF1b. We validated the relative expression of six miRNAs (miR-5077, miR-6300, miR-156a, miR-169, miR-5059 and miR-166 m) in ginger and grapefruit ENPs by RT-PCR which showed differential enrichment of specific miRNAs in ginger and grapefruit ENPs. CONCLUSION: Since administration of ENPs leads to their accumulation into lung tissues in vivo, ENP derived miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 genome has the potential to be developed as an alternative therapy.","Kalarikkal, Sreeram Peringattu; Sundaram, Gopinath M.",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2021.115425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33516820/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X21000326?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041008X21000326,138

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of lifting state-level eviction moratoria, which increased housing insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included individuals with commercial insurance or Medicare Advantage who lived in a state that issued an eviction moratorium and were diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as a control group comprising an equal number of randomly selected individuals in these states who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Data were collected from OptumLabs Data Warehouse, a database of deidentified administrative claims. The study used a difference-in-differences analysis among states that implemented an eviction moratorium between March 13, 2020, and September 4, 2020. EXPOSURES: Time since state-level eviction moratoria were lifted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was a binary variable indicating whether an individual was diagnosed with COVID-19 for the first time in a given week with International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision code U07.1. The study analyzed changes in COVID-19 diagnosis before vs after a state lifted its moratorium compared with changes in states that did not lift it. For sensitivity analyses, models were reestimated on a 2% random sample of all individuals in the claims database during this period in these states. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 509 694 individuals (254 847 [50.0%] diagnosed with COVID-19; mean [SD] age, 47.0 [23.6] years; 239 056 [53.3%] men). During the study period, 43 states and the District of Columbia implemented an eviction moratorium and 7 did not. Among the states that implemented a moratorium, 26 (59.1%) lifted their moratorium before the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued their national moratorium, while 18 (40.1%) maintained theirs. In a Cox difference-in-differences regression model, individuals living in a state that lifted its eviction moratorium experienced higher hazards of a COVID-19 diagnosis beginning 5 weeks after the moratorium was lifted (hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.11-1.76; P = .004), reaching an HR of 1.83 (95% CI, 1.36-2.46; P < .001) 12 weeks after. Hazards increased in magnitude among individuals with preexisting comorbidities and those living in nonaffluent and rent-burdened areas. Individuals with a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 3 or greater had an HR of 2.37 (95% CI, 1.67-3.36; P < .001) at the end of the study period. Those living in nonaffluent areas had an HR of 2.14 (95% CI, 1.51-3.05; P < .001), while those living in areas with a high rent burden had an HR of 2.31 (95% CI, 1.64-3.26; P < .001).

Whether this also applies to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has been scarcely investigated. METHODS: Using the Danish administrative databases, we identified all patients with a positive real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction test for COVID‐19 in Denmark up to and including 2 January 2021. Multivariable cox regression was used to calculate 30‐day absolute risk and average risk ratio (ARR) for the composite end point of death from any cause and severe COVID‐19 associated with psychiatric disorders, defined using both hospital diagnoses and redemption of psychotropic drugs. RESULTS: We included 144,321 patients with COVID‐19. Compared with patients without psychiatric disorders, the standardized ARR of the composite outcome was significantly increased for patients with severe mental illness including schizophrenia spectrum disorders 2.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.79–3.07), bipolar disorder 2.11 (95% CI, 1.25–2.97), unipolar depression 1.70 (95% CI, 1.38–2.02), and for patients who redeemed psychotropic drugs 1.70 (95% CI, 1.48–1.92). No association was found for patients with other psychiatric disorders 1.13 (95% CI, 0.86–1.38). Similar results were seen with the outcomes of death or severe COVID‐19. Among the different psychiatric subgroups, patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders had the highest 30‐day absolute risk for the composite outcome 3.1% (95% CI, 2.3–3.9%), death 1.2% (95% CI, 0.4–2.0%) and severe COVID‐19 2.7% (95% CI, 1.9–3.6%).

An open data set called the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset or CORD-19 contains large set full text scientific literature on SARS-CoV-2. The Next Strain consists of a database of SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from since 12/3/2019. We applied an unique information mining method named lexical link analysis (LLA) to answer the call to action and help the science community answer high-priority scientific questions related to SARS-CoV-2. We first text-mined the CORD-19. We also data-mined the next strain database. Finally, we linked two databases. The linked databases and information can be used to discover the insights and help the research community to address high-priority questions related to the SARS-CoV-2’s genetics, tests, and prevention. Significance Statement In this paper, we show how to apply an unique information mining method lexical link analysis (LLA) to link unstructured (CORD-19) and structured (Next Strain) data sets to relevant publications, integrate text and data mining into a single platform to discover the insights that can be visualized, and validated to answer the high-priority questions of genetics, incubation, treatment, symptoms, and prevention of COVID-19.","Zhao, Ying; Zhou, Charles C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.079798,138
649498,The 2019‐new coronavirus epidemic: Evidence for virus evolution,2020-02-07,"The causative agent for the most fatal form of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, has developed insecticide and drug resistance with time. Therefore combating this disease is becoming increasingly difficult and this calls for finding alternate ways to control malaria. One of the feasible ways could be to find out inhibitors/drugs specific for the indispensable enzymes of malaria parasite such as helicases. These helicases, which contain intrinsic nucleic acid-dependent ATPase activity, are capable of enzymatically unwinding energetically stable duplex nucleic acids into single-stranded templates and are required for all the nucleic acid transactions. Most of the helicases contain a set of nine extremely conserved amino acid sequences, which are called ‘helicase motifs’. Due to the presence of the DEAD (Asp–Glu–Ala–Asp) in one of the conserved motifs, this family is also known as the ‘DEAD-box’ family. In this review, using bioinformatic approach, we describe the ‘DEAD-box’ helicases of malaria parasite P. falciparum. An in depth analysis shows that the parasite contains 22 full-length genes, some of which are homologues of well-characterized helicases of this family from other organisms. Recently we have cloned and characterized the first member of this family, which is a homologue of p68 and is expressed during the schizont stage of the development of the parasite [Pradhan, A., Chauhan, V.S., Tuteja, R., 2005a. A novel ‘DEAD-box’ DNA helicase from Plasmodium falciparum is homologous to p68. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 140, 55–60.; Pradhan A., Chauhan V.S., Tuteja R., 2005b. Plasmodium falciparum DNA helicase 60 is a schizont stage specific, bipolar and dual helicase stimulated by PKC phosphorylation. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 144, 133–141.]. It will be really interesting to clone and characterize other members of the ‘DEAD-box’ family and understand their role in the replication and transmission of the parasite. These detailed studies may help to identify a parasite-specific enzyme, which could be a potential drug target to treat malaria. The various steps at which this probable drug can act are also discussed.","Tuteja, Renu; Pradhan, Arun",Gene,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111906002058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16713133/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111906002058,138

This study aims to address this issue by proposing a spatial multicriteria approach to estimate the risk of the Brazilian health care system, by municipality, to exceed the health care capacity because of an influx of patients infected with the COVID-19. We estimated this risk for 5572 municipalities in Brazil using a combination of a multicriteria decision-making approach with spatial analysis to estimate the exceedance risk, and then, we examined the risk variation by designing 5 control intervention scenarios (3 scenarios representing reduction on social contacts, and 2 scenarios representing investment on health care system). For the baseline scenario using an average infection rate across Brazil, we estimated a mean Hospital Bed Capacity (HBC) value of −16.73, indicating that, on average, the Brazilian municipalities will have a deficit of approximately 17 beds. This deficit is projected to occur in 3338 municipalities with the north and northeast regions being at the greatest risk of exceeding health care capacity due to the COVID-19. The intervention scenarios indicate across all of Brazil that they could address the bed shortage, with an average of available beds between 23 and 32. However, when we consider the shortages at a municipal scale, bed exceedances still occur for at least 2119 municipalities in the most effective intervention scenario. Our findings are essential to identify priority areas, to compare populations, and to provide options for government agencies to act. This study can be used to provide support for the creation of effective health public policies for national, regional, and local intervention.","Requia, Weeberb J.; Kondo, Edson Kenji; Adams, Matthew D.; Gold, Diane R.; Struchiner, Claudio José",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720326619; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139144; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720326619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380368/,138
650089,Presumptive Development of Fibrotic Lung Disease From Bordetella bronchiseptica and Post-infectious Bronchiolitis Obliterans in a Dog,2019-10-10,"BACKGROUND: Refractory dyspnea or breathlessness is a common symptom in patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with a high negative impact on quality of life (QoL). Low dosed opioids have been investigated for refractory dyspnea in COPD and other life-limiting conditions, and some positive effects were demonstrated. However, upon first assessment of the literature, the quality of evidence in COPD seemed low or inconclusive, and focused mainly on morphine which may have more side effects than other opioids such as fentanyl. For the current publication we performed a systematic literature search. We searched for placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials investigating opioids for refractory dyspnea caused by COPD. We included trials reporting on dyspnea, health status and/or QoL. Three of fifteen trials demonstrated a significant positive effect of opioids on dyspnea. Only one of four trials reporting on QoL or health status, demonstrated a significant positive effect. Two-thirds of included trials investigated morphine. We found no placebo-controlled RCT on transdermal fentanyl. Subsequently, we hypothesized that both fentanyl and morphine provide a greater reduction of dyspnea than placebo, and that fentanyl has less side effects than morphine. METHODS: We describe the design of a robust, multi-center, double blind, double-dummy, cross-over, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with three study arms investigating transdermal fentanyl 12 mcg/h and morphine sustained-release 10 mg b.i.d. The primary endpoint is change in daily mean dyspnea sensation measured on a numeric rating scale. Secondary endpoints are change in daily worst dyspnea, QoL, anxiety, sleep quality, hypercapnia, side effects, patient preference, and continued opioid use. Sixty patients with severe stable COPD and refractory dyspnea (FEV(1) < 50%, mMRC ≥ 3, on optimal standard therapy) will be included. DISCUSSION: Evidence for opioids for refractory dyspnea in COPD is not as robust as usually appreciated. We designed a study comparing both the more commonly used opioid morphine, and transdermal fentanyl to placebo. The cross-over design will help to get a better impression of patient preferences. We believe our study design to investigate both sustained-release morphine and transdermal fentanyl for refractory dyspnea will provide valuable information for better treatment of refractory dyspnea in COPD.

While the research on organizations offers extensive insights on recovery from economic or technological shocks, there is limited understanding of how organizations recover from life-threatening events such as terrorist attacks. In this study, we build on the research on resilience and argue that organizational recovery from a traumatic event is informed by the perception of threat. Higher perception of threat increases inter-organizational collaboration and the care associated with the deployment of slack as well as to learning. We tested our arguments with a sample of US and non-US firms before and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and found that, due to spatial proximity, US firms’ higher perception of threat led to a larger increase in the frequency of inter-organizational alliances than that of non-US firms. This preference was more frequently directed towards local partners and demonstrated a distinct emphasis on slack and learning. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our findings suggest that organizational resilience in the face of a traumatic event benefits not from immunity but from spatial proximity to the threat. Proximity increases the perception of threat, and with it, the impetus for adaptation.","Mithani, Murad A.; Gopalakrishnan, Shanthi; Santoro, Michael D.",Long Range Plann,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863432/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024630120302302; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lrp.2020.102031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024630120302302?v=s5,138

We aimed to understand how rheumatologists, one of the most common prescribers of HCQ/CQ, prescribed these medications to manage COVID-19 and to understand if their patients are affected by shortages. METHODS: Between April 8 and April 27, 2020, an online survey was distributed to a convenience sample of rheumatologists who practice medicine in a diverse range of settings globally, resulting in 506 responses. Adjusted Poisson regression models were calculated. RESULTS: Only 6% of respondents prescribed HCQ/CQ for COVID-19 prophylaxis, and only 12% for outpatient treatment of COVID-19. Compared to the United States, the likelihood of prescribing HCQ/CQ for prophylaxis was higher in India (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7–16.8; p < 0.001). Further, compared to the United States and those with 1 to 5 years of experience, rheumatologists in Europe (aRR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6–5.3; p < 0.001) and those with 10+ years of experience (11–20 years: aRR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2–5.3; p = 0.015; 21+ years: aRR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4–7.4; p = 0.004) had a higher likelihood of prescribing HCQ/CQ for outpatient treatment. Of note, 71% of all rheumatologists reported that their patients were directly affected by HCQ/CQ shortages. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that only a small percentage of rheumatologists are prescribing HCQ/CQ for prophylaxis or outpatient treatment of COVID-19. Medication shortages experienced by large numbers of autoimmune disease patients are concerning and should play a role in decisions, especially given poor efficacy data for HCQ/CQ in COVID-19.","Mehta, Bella; Moezinia, Carine J.; Jannat-Khah, Deanna; Gibofsky, Allan; Tornberg, Haley; Pearce-Fisher, Diyu; Goodman, Susan M.; Salmon, Jane E.; Ibrahim, Said",J Clin Rheumatol,https://doi.org/10.1097/rhu.0000000000001539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32694358/,138

The study aimed to validate the original Caprini score and its modifications considering coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a severe prothrombotic condition in patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed infection. Methods. The relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records with the implemented Caprini score and were evaluated retrospectively. The score was calculated twice: by the physician at the admission and by the investigator at discharge or after death. The second calculation at discharge, considered additional risk factors that occurred during inpatient treatment. Besides the original Caprini score (a version of 2005), the modified version added the elevation of D-dimer and specific scores for COVID-19 as follows: 2 points for asymptomatic, 3 points for symptomatic and 5 points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer, were evaluated in a retrospective manner. The primary endpoint was symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) confirmed by appropriate imaging testing or dissection. The secondary endpoint included the unfavorable outcome as a combination of symptomatic VTE, admission to the intensive care unit, the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, and death. The association of eight different versions of the Caprini score with outcomes was evaluated. Results. Totally 168 patients (83 males and 85 females at the age of 58.3{+/-}12.7 years old) were admitted to the hospital between April 30 and May 29, 2020, and were discharged or died up to the time of data analysis. The original Caprini score varied between 2-12 (5.4{+/-}1.8) at the admission and between 2-15 (5.9{+/-}2.5) at discharge or death. The presence of the virus increased these scores and resulted in an increased score with the maximal value for those including COVID-19 points (10.0{+/-}3.0). Patients received prophylactic (2.4%), intermediate (76.8%), or therapeutic (20.8%) doses of enoxaparin. Despite this, the symptomatic VTE was detected in 11 (6.5%) and unfavorable outcomes in 31 (18.5%) patients. The Caprini score of all eight versions demonstrated a significant association with VTE with the highest predictability for the original scale when assessed at discharge. Supplementation of the original score by elevated D-dimer improved predictability only at the admission. Four versions of the Caprini score calculated at the admission had a significant correlation with the unfavorable outcome with the minor advantages of specific COVID-19 points. Conclusion. The study identified a significant correlation between the Caprini score and the risk of VTE or unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients. All models, including specific COVID-19 scores, showed high predictability with minor differences.","Tsaplin, S.; Schastlivtsev, I.; Lobastov, K.; Zhuravlev, S.; Barinov, V.; Caprini, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.22.20137075; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.22.20137075v1?rss=1,138

We aimed to assess the incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 treated with either HFNC or NIV. METHODS: This was a single-center randomized controlled trial performed in the COVID-19 ICU of a tertiary care teaching hospital in New Delhi, India. One hundred and nine subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure were recruited and allocated to either HFNC (n = 55) or NIV (n = 54) arm. Primary outcome was intubation by 48 h. Secondary outcomes were improvement in oxygenation by 48 h, intubation rate at day 7, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and PaO2 /FIO2 ratio were similar in both the groups. Intubation rate at 48 h was similar between the groups (33% NIV vs 20% HFNC, relative risk 0.6, 95% CI 0.31-1.15, P = .12). Intubation rate at day 7 was lower in the HFNC (27.27%) compared to the NIV group (46.29%) (relative risk 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.99, P = .045), and this difference remained significant after adjustment for the incidence of chronic kidney disease and the arterial pH (adjusted OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17-0.93, P = .03). Hospital mortality was similar between HFNC (29.1%) and NIV (46.2%) group (relative risk 0.6, 95% CI 0.38-1.04, P = .06). CONCLUSIONS: We were not able to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement of oxygenation parameters nor of the intubation rate at 48 h between NIV and HFNC.

In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of reduced doses of Ad26.COV2.S. 30 rhesus macaques were immunized once with 1×1011, 5×1010, 1.125×1010, or 2×109 vp Ad26.COV2.S or sham and were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal and intratracheal routes. Vaccine doses as low as 2×109 vp provided robust protection in bronchoalveolar lavage, whereas doses of 1.125×1010 vp were required for protection in nasal swabs. Activated memory B cells as well as binding and neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination correlated with protective efficacy. At suboptimal vaccine doses, viral breakthrough was observed but did not show evidence of virologic, immunologic, histopathologic, or clinical enhancement of disease compared with sham controls. These data demonstrate that a single immunization with a relatively low dose of Ad26.COV2.S effectively protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Moreover, our findings show that a higher vaccine dose may be required for protection in the upper respiratory tract compared with the lower respiratory tract.","He, Xuan; Chandrashekar, Abishek; Zahn, Roland; Wegmann, Frank; Yu, Jingyou; Mercado, Noe B.; McMahan, Katherine; Martinot, Amanda J.; Piedra-Mora, Cesar; Beecy, Sidney; Ducat, Sarah; Chamanza, Ronnie; Huber, Sietske Rosendahl; van der Fits, Leslie; Borducchi, Erica N.; Lifton, Michelle; Liu, Jinyan; Nampanya, Felix; Patel, Shivani; Peter, Lauren; Tostanoski, Lisa H.; Pessaint, Laurent; Van Ry, Alex; Finneyfrock, Brad; Velasco, Jason; Teow, Elyse; Brown, Renita; Cook, Anthony; Andersen, Hanne; Lewis, Mark G.; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; Barouch, Dan H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.428380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532782/,138

A national survey of police officers was conducted to determine whether barriers to enforcing these laws exist, what aspects of laws make them easier to enforce and ways to discourage the behaviour among drivers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: USA. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals >18 years of age employed as a law enforcement officer from all 50 states were recruited via convenience sampling through multiple modalities from November 2019 to April 2020. Officers (N=353) from 31 states participated. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Descriptive statistics and multi-level logistic regression analyses were run to assess the responses. RESULTS: The most common barriers to enforcing texting bans (ie, the most prevalent law) were drivers concealing their phone use (78%) and the officer not being able to determine what the driver was doing on their phone (65%). If a universal hand-held cellphone ban was in effect in their state, officers were 77% less likely (adjusted OR=0.23; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.70) to report that a texting ban was difficult to adjudicate. The majority of officers (86%) agreed that having one general law that prohibits any type of hand-held cellphone use would aid with enforcement, and that laws must be a primary offence (87%), and be applicable to all licensed drivers (91%). Most officers felt that driver education is needed.

This research aimed to assess knowledge, perceptions, and preventive behavior toward the COVID-19 infection among student nurses. Methods: The study has quantitative, descriptive, and cross-sectional design. A convenience sample of 1,226 student nurses from seven universities in Saudi Arabia was surveyed from March 22 to April 4, 2020. A four-part online survey on demographic characteristics, perceptions, knowledge, and preventive behavior of Saudi student nurses was carried out. Results: Nearly all students were aware of the outbreak (99.2%), and most of them received information on COVID-19 primarily from social media (71.0%). Over three-fourths of the students were confident that the government (89.1%) and Ministry of Health (MOH) (86.5%) were doing a good job responding to the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. The overall average score in the knowledge questionnaire was 9.85 (SD = 1.62, range = 0–12), which is equivalent to 82.1%. The majority of the students always performed most of the preventive behavior identified in the survey, except “washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 s after blowing my nose, coughing, or sneezing” (39.2%) and “daily cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces” (41.6%). Being female, being in the fourth year, and gaining good perceived knowledge were associated with high actual COVID-19 knowledge.

654876,Favourable antibody responses to human coronaviruses in children and adolescents with autoimmune rheumatic diseases,2021-02-16,"Background: Men and older women have been shown to be at higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Animal model studies of SARS-CoV and MERS suggest that the age and sex difference in COVID-19 symptom severity may be due to a protective effect of the female sex hormone estrogen. Females have shown an ability to mount a stronger immune response to a variety of viral infections because of more robust humoral and cellular immune responses. Objectives: We sought to determine whether COVID-19 positivity increases in women entering menopause. We also aimed to identify whether premenopausal women taking exogenous hormones in the form of the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and post-menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have lower predicted rates of COVID-19, using our published symptom-based model. Design: The COVID Symptom Study developed by Kings College London and Zoe Global Limited was launched in the UK on 24th March 2020. It captured self-reported information related to COVID-19 symptoms. Data used for this study included records collected between 7th May - 15th June 2020. Main outcome measures: We investigated links between COVID-19 rates and 1) menopausal status, 2) COCP use and 3) HRT use, using symptom-based predicted COVID-19, tested COVID-19, and disease severity based on requirement for hospital attendance or respiratory support. Participants: Female users of the COVID Symptom Tracker Application in the UK, including 152,637 women for menopause status, 295,689 for COCP use, and 151,193 for HRT use. Analyses were adjusted for age, smoking and BMI. Results: Post-menopausal women aged 40-60 years had a higher rate of predicted COVID (P=0.003) and a corresponding range of symptoms, with consistent, but not significant trends observed for tested COVID-19 and disease severity. Women aged 18-45 years taking COCP had a significantly lower predicted COVID-19 (P=8.03E-05), with a reduction in hospital attendance (P=0.023). Post-menopausal women using HRT or hormonal therapies did not exhibit consistent associations, including increased rates of predicted COVID-19 (P=2.22E-05) for HRT users alone. Conclusions: Our findings support a protective effect of estrogen on COVID-19, based on positive association between predicted COVID-19 and menopausal status, and a negative association with COCP use. HRT use was positively associated with COVID-19 symptoms; however, the results should be considered with caution due to lack of data on HRT type, route of administration, duration of treatment, and potential comorbidities.

656688,SARS – A Fast Moving Infectious Disease,2003,"BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for accurate, rapid, inexpensive biomarkers that can differentiate COVID-19 from bacterial pneumonia. We assess the role of the ferritin-to-procalcitonin (F/P) ratio to classify pneumonia cases into those due to COVID-19 or due to bacterial pathogens. METHODS: This multicenter case-control study compared patients with either COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia, admitted between March 1 and May 31, 2020. Patients with COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia co-infection were excluded. The F/P in patients with COVID-19 or with bacterial pneumonia were compared. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined the sensitivity and specificity of various cut-off F/P values for COVID-19 versus bacterial pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 242 COVID-19 pneumonia cases and 34 bacterial pneumonia controls were included. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had a lower mean age (57.11 vs 64.4 years, p=0.02) and a higher BMI (30.74 vs 27.15 kg/m 2, p=0.02) compared to patients with bacterial pneumonia. Cases and controls had a similar proportion of women (47% vs 53%, p=0.5) and COVID-19 patients had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (32.6% vs 12%, p=0.01). The median F/P was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 (4037.5) compared to the F/P in bacterial pneumonia (802, p<0.001). An F/P ≥ 877 used to diagnose COVID-19 resulted in a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 56%, with a positive predictive value of 93.2%, and a likelihood ratio of 1.92. In multivariable analyses, an F/P ≥ 877 was associated with greater odds of identifying a COVID-19 case (OR: 11.27, CI: 4-31.2, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: An F/P ≥ 877 increases the likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia compared to bacterial pneumonia.","Gharamti, Amal A; Mei, Fei; Jankousky, Katherine C; Huang, Jin; Hyson, Peter; Chastain, Daniel B; Fan, Jiawei; Osae, Sharmon; Zhang, Wayne W; Montoya, José G; Erlandson, Kristine M; Scherger, Sias J; Franco-Paredes, Carlos; Henao-Martínez, Andrés F; Shapiro, Leland",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183978/,138

The objective of the present study was to determine whether meteorological parameters and air quality affect the transmission of COVID-19, analogous to SARS. We captured data from 29 provinces, including numbers of COVID-19 cases, meteorological parameters, air quality and population flow data, between Jan 21, 2020 and Apr 3, 2020. To evaluate the transmissibility of COVID-19, the basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) was calculated with the maximum likelihood “removal” method, which is based on chain-binomial model, and the association between COVID-19 and air pollutants or meteorological parameters was estimated by correlation analyses. The mean estimated value of R(0) was 1.79 ± 0.31 in 29 provinces, ranging from 1.08 to 2.45. The correlation between R(0) and the mean relative humidity was positive, with coefficient of 0.370. In provinces with high flow, indicators such as carbon monoxide (CO) and 24-h average concentration of carbon monoxide (CO_24 h) were positively correlated with R(0), while nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), 24-h average concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)_24 h) and daily maximum temperature were inversely correlated to R(0), with coefficients of 0.644, 0.661, −0.636, −0.657, −0.645, respectively. In provinces with medium flow, only the weather factors were correlated with R(0), including mean/maximum/minimum air pressure and mean wind speed, with coefficients of −0.697, −0.697, −0.697 and −0.841, respectively. There was no correlation with R(0) and meteorological parameters or air pollutants in provinces with low flow. Our findings suggest that higher ambient CO concentration is a risk factor for increased transmissibility of the novel coronavirus, while higher temperature and air pressure, and efficient ventilation reduce its transmissibility. The effect of meteorological parameters and air pollutants varies in different regions, and requires that these issues be considered in future modeling disease transmissibility.","Lin, Shaowei; Wei, Donghong; Sun, Yi; Chen, Kun; Yang, Le; Liu, Bang; Huang, Qing; Bastos Paoliello, Monica Maria; Li, Huangyuan; Wu, Siying",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32768746/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147651320308745; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651320308745; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111035,138
657910,Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression of Cancer to Guide the Use of Chemotherapeutics,2007-09-30,"The type I interferon system plays a critical role in limiting the spread of viral infection. Viruses induce the production of interferon (IFN), which after binding to the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR), and triggering of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade, results in the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs function to inhibit viral replication and to regulate the host immune response. Among these ISGs, the ubiquitin-like molecule, ISG15, is one of the most strongly induced proteins. Similar to ubiquitin, through an IFN induced conjugation cascade, ISG15 is covalently linked to a variety of cellular proteins, suggesting regulation of different cellular processes. Studies performed over the past several years have shown that ISG15 plays a central role in the host’s antiviral response against many viruses. Mice lacking ISG15 display increased susceptibility to multiple viruses. Furthermore, several viruses have developed immune evasion strategies that directly target the ISG15 pathway. Work is now underway to determine the mechanism by which ISG15 functions as an antiviral molecule, such that therapies targeting this pathway can be developed in the future.","Lenschow, Deborah J.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v2102154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994614/,138

This is the first report from the Middle East and North Africa that tackles specifically the association of smoking and COVID-19 mortality while demonstrating a novel sex-discrepancy in the survival rates among patients. METHODS: Clinical data for 743 hospitalized COVID-19 patients was retrospectively collected from the leading centre for COVID-19 testing and treatment in Lebanon. Logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age and stratified by sex were used to assess the association between the current cigarette smoking status of patients and COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: In addition to the high smoking prevalence among our hospitalized COVID-19 patients (42.3%), enrolled smokers tended to have higher reported ICU admissions (28.3% vs 16.6%, p<0.001), longer length of stay in the hospital (12.0 ± 7.8 vs 10.8 days, p<0.001) and higher death incidences as compared to non-smokers (60.5% vs 39.5%, p<0.001). Smokers had an elevated odds ratio for death (OR = 2.3, p<0.001) and for ICU admission (OR = 2.0, p<0.001) which remained significant in a multivariate regression model. Once adjusted for age and stratified by sex, our data revealed that current smoking status reduces survival rate in male patients ([HR] = 1.9 [95% (CI), 1.029–3.616]; p = 0.041) but it does not affect survival outcomes among hospitalized female patients([HR] = 0.79 [95% CI = 0.374–1.689]; p = 0.551). CONCLUSION: A high smoking prevalence was detected in our hospitalized COVID-19 cohort combined with worse prognosis and higher mortality rate in smoking patients. Our study was the first to highlight potential sex-specific consequences for smoking on COVID-19 outcomes that might further explain the higher vulnerability to death from this disease among men.","Khalil, Athar; Dhingra, Radhika; Al-Mulki, Jida; Hassoun, Mahmoud; Alexis, Neil",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351990/,138

The epidemiological situation is evolving on a daily basis, and the methodology of how to evaluate the impact of the pandemic and the severity of its consequences is lacking. The only available high-frequency data now are the number of people who have contracted the illness, and the restrictive measures that authorities have implemented to contain the outbreak. The most important question now is whether authorities can prevent subsequent waves. The contribution of the paper is a dynamic model of COVID-19 outbreaks, on the basis of which we investigated the possible impact of the socio-economic behavior and restrictions on its waves. To build the model, a large database for different countries with a wide range of economic and social institutions was collected. We give a detailed description of the model and a comparison of the results with trajectories of the outbreaks in the countries under consideration. The proposed model describes the empirical results and can be used for timely and contemporary predictions of the stages of pandemics. Despite this, the model needs future development and verification because the pandemic is not over, and the accumulation of empirical information continues. Yet the model might also be useful as a basis for researching the impacts of other socio-economic and medical actions for containing pandemics.","Pomazanov, Mikhail; Arkhipov, Artem; Karminsky, Alexander",Eurasian Econ Rev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40822-021-00177-2,138

When TBI was reduced to 1 Gy, only transient engraftment was observed. Here we asked whether stable engraftment after 1 Gy TBI could be accomplished by reducing host vs. donor immune responsiveness through preceding CD154 blockade and infusion of donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The anti-human CD154 antibody, 5c8, cross-reacted with canine lymphocytes and blocked allo-immune responses in vitro. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, six dogs received a single i.v. injection of 5 mg/kg anti-CD154 antibody (day -5) followed one day later by donor PBMC. On day 0, dogs were given 1 Gy TBI and DLA-identical marrow grafts. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of MMF and CSP. All six dogs showed initial engraftment, which was sustained in three of the six for >26 weeks, while three dogs rejected their grafts after 9, 22, and 24 weeks, respectively, and survived with autologous recovery. Graft survival was significantly improved over that among 11 historical controls conditioned with 1 Gy TBI and given either MMF or rapamycin with CSP after HCT, all of which rejected their grafts between 3 and 12 weeks (P = 0.03). Preceding donor PBMC infusion and CD154 blockade improved survival of DLA-identical marrow grafts after 1 Gy TBI.","Jochum, Christoph; Beste, Mechthild; Zellmer, Eustacia; Graves, Scott S.; Storb, Rainer",Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879106007506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241922/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879106007506,138
658793,From bench side to clinic: Potential and challenges of RNA vaccines and therapeutics in infectious diseases,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID‐19 pandemic has led to unprecedented global changes in the delivery of healthcare over a short period of time. With the implementation of “shelter in place” orders, otolaryngology clinic visits at our institution were transitioned to Telemedicine. This change enabled the rapid characterization of the patients who accepted and declined Telemedicine. METHODS: Review of 525 otolaryngology patients at a tertiary care referral center with scheduled visits requiring rescheduling to a future date or a Telemedicine visit. Visit, demographic information, and reason for deferring Telemedicine were collected for analysis. RESULTS: 72% of patients declined a Telemedicine visit with the most common reason being the lack of a physical exam (97%). There was an even distribution of demographics between those who accepted and declined visits. There was an association between declining Telemedicine with older age (P = 0.0004) and otology visits (P = 0.0003), while facial plastics patients were more likely to accept (P < 0.0001). Patients scheduled earlier during the pandemic were more likely to accept a visit with a median of 28 days from onset of “shelter in place” orders vs 35 for those who declined (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We describe our initial experience with a transition to Telemedicine, where the majority of patients would decline a virtual visit due to the lack of a physical exam. While the future remains uncertain, Telemedicine will continue to play a vital role in healthcare delivery; we believe that understanding our patient base gives critical insights that will help guide and improve virtual care to meet patient's needs.","Ohlstein, Jason F.; Garner, Jordan; Takashima, Masayoshi",Laryngoscope,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.29030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32740925/,138

In response, the Government has claimed that lockdown slowed the transmission process of COVID, thereby reducing the number of cases and deaths substantially. The consequent pressure on the health infrastructure was also much less. To judge between competing claims, this study has undertaken the first cost-benefit analysis of the worlds biggest lockdown.

Despite advances in recent decades, our knowledge of this disease is still limited, and novel and better therapies are needed. Organoids were recently developed as a new system to culture normal and tumor cells obtained from patients subjected to surgery or endoscopic tests. Organoids are being used to dissect the molecular and genetic bases of colorectal cancer initiation and progression. In this review, we describe how patient-derived organoids can be generated, and their use to investigate in depth the tumorigenic process. We show how this system has allowed the study of colorectal tumorigenesis features for the first time, including immunotherapy, interplay with microorganisms and, more importantly, assays of drug treatments at an individualized level. Additionally, we summarize the most recent developments of what is known as organoid technology directed towards personalized medicine. ABSTRACT: Organoids were first established as a three-dimensional cell culture system from mouse small intestine. Subsequent development has made organoids a key system to study many human physiological and pathological processes that affect a variety of tissues and organs. In particular, organoids are becoming very useful tools to dissect colorectal cancer (CRC) by allowing the circumvention of classical problems and limitations, such as the impossibility of long-term culture of normal intestinal epithelial cells and the lack of good animal models for CRC. In this review, we describe the features and current knowledge of intestinal organoids and how they are largely contributing to our better understanding of intestinal cell biology and CRC genetics. Moreover, recent data show that organoids are appropriate systems for antitumoral drug testing and for the personalized treatment of CRC patients.","Barbáchano, Antonio; Fernández-Barral, Asunción; Bustamante-Madrid, Pilar; Prieto, Isabel; Rodríguez-Salas, Nuria; Larriba, María Jesús; Muñoz, Alberto",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071313/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13112657,138

DESIGN: Rapid scoping review. INCLUDED SOURCES AND ARTICLES: PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, PEDro, UK Health Forum, WHO, National Archives and NHS England were searched using the participant–concept–context framework from 2015 to August 2020. Primary studies that recruited individuals with physical disabilities and guidance documents aimed at providers to implement movement-related telerehabilitation were included. RESULTS: 23 articles (11 primary research studies, 3 systematic reviews and 9 guidance documents) were included out of 7857 that were identified from the literature search. Two main issues were found: (1) telerehabilitation guidance (from both research studies and guidance documents) was not specific to movement-related assessment and (2) most primary research studies provided neither guidance nor training of movement-specific assessment to practitioners. Of the COVID-19 related guidance, two articles reported COVID-19 management that only referred to identifying COVID-19 status without references to specific movement-related guidance. CONCLUSIONS: Telerehabilitation guidance and training have existed pre-COVID-19, yet the lack of specific movement-related information and provider support is surprising. This gap must be addressed to optimise effective implementation of remote assessments for those with physical disabilities.

Objectifs L’objectif de notre travail était d’étudier les caractéristiques cliniques et pronostiques des accidents vasculaires cérébraux (AVC) chez les patients infectés par le SARS-COV-2. Patients et méthodes Nous avons mené une étude rétrospective descriptive incluant 9 patients suivis au service de neurologie de l’hôpital militaire principal d’instructions de Tunis pour accident vasculaire cérébral aigu et présentant une infection par le SARS-CoV-2 diagnostiquée à l’aide d’une réaction en chaîne par polymérase transcriptase inverse (RT-PCR) sur des écouvillons nasopharyngés. Résultats Nous avons colligé 9 patients (7 hommes et 2 femmes). L’âge moyen était de 64 ans. Les sous-types d’AVC étaient ischémiques (6 cas) hémorragique (1 cas), et une thrombose veineuse cérébrale (1 cas). Tous les patients avaient au moins 2 facteurs de risque vasculaires. Le score NIHSS moyen était de 16±5. Le pronostic était péjoratif chez la plupart des patients (3 patients étaient décédés et 3 autres ont gardé un handicap sévère).

Epidemiological data evidenced that COVID-19 patients with altered liver function because of hepatitis infection and cholestasis have an adverse prognosis and experience worse health outcomes. COVID-19-associated liver injury is correlated with various liver diseases following a severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that can progress during the treatment of COVID-19 patients with or without pre-existing liver disease. SARS-CoV-2 can induce liver injury in a number of ways including direct cytopathic effect of the virus on cholangiocytes/hepatocytes, immune-mediated damage, hypoxia, and sepsis. Indeed, immediate cytopathogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2 via its potential target, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor, which is highly expressed in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, renders the liver as an extra-respiratory organ with increased susceptibility to pathological outcomes. But, underlying COVID-19-linked liver disease pathogenesis with abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) is incompletely understood. Hence, we collated COVID-19-associated liver injuries with increased LFTs at the nexus of pre-existing liver diseases and COVID-19, and defining a plausible pathophysiological triad of COVID-19, hepatocellular damage, and liver disease. This review summarizes recent findings of the exacerbating role of COVID-19 in pre-existing liver disease and vice versa as well as international guidelines of clinical care, management, and treatment recommendations for COVID-19 patients with liver disease.","Ahmad, Aqsa; Ishtiaq, Syeda Momna; Khan, Junaid Ali; Aslam, Rizwan; Ali, Sultan; Arshad, Muhammad Imran",World J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833483/; https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v27.i13.1296,138

All infected pigs showed inappetence and listlessness, but there were no clinical signs of nervous disorder. Severe encephalomyelitis, characterized by neuronophagia, focal gliosis and perivascular cuffing, was observed in the brain stem and cerebral cortex. Nasally infected pigs, in particular, developed lesions in the area of the stria olfactoria and tractus olfactorius. Coincident with the encephalitic changes, HEV antigen was observed first in the trigeminal ganglion cells and then in degenerating neurones. Immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM)-containing cells were also found in perivascular cuffs and glial foci. They appeared at first on PID 7 and after that increased in number. These findings suggest that these encephalitic lesions are a specific immune response to HEV following its multiplication in the central nervous system.","Narita, M.; Kawamura, H.; Haritani, M.; Kobayashi, M.",Journal of Comparative Pathology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021997589901229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2469703/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0021997589901229,138

At the end of the year, these efforts have culminated with the approval of vaccines by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) giving new hope for the future. On the other hand, clinical data underscore the urgent need for effective drugs to treat COVID-19 patients. In this work, we embarked on a virtual screening campaign against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) M(pro) chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease employing our in-house database of peptide and non-peptide ligands characterized by different types of warheads acting as Michael acceptors. To this end, we employed the AutoDock4 docking software customized to predict the formation of a covalent adduct with the target protein. In vitro verification of the inhibition properties of the most promising candidates allowed us to identify two new lead inhibitors that will deserve further optimization. From the computational point of view, this work demonstrates the predictive power of AutoDock4 and suggests its application for the in silico screening of large chemical libraries of potential covalent binders against the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) enzyme.","Amendola, Giorgio; Ettari, Roberta; Previti, Santo; Di Chio, Carla; Messere, Anna; Di Maro, Salvatore; Hammerschmidt, Stefan J.; Zimmer, Collin; Zimmermann, Robert A.; Schirmeister, Tanja; Zappalà, Maria; Cosconati, Sandro",J Chem Inf Model,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784094/,138

The aim of the study was to assess whether and to what extent the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the health behaviours of young adults. METHODS: 506 people aged 18 to 34 ([Formula: see text] =24.67 years ±4.23 years) who filled in an online survey were qualified for the study. Assessment was made of eating habits (a modified Food Frequency Questionnaire, FFQ), physical activity and sedentary behaviours (International Physical Activity Questionnaire, short form IPAQ-SF), sleep quality (The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), and generalized anxiety (Generalized anxiety Disorder, 7-item, GAD-7 scale). RESULTS: During the pandemic, young adults changed their dietary preferences toward sweets and cereal products, increased alcohol (p < 0.001) and fat (p = 0.005) intake, significantly reduced their physical activity (from 8752.5 metabolic equivalents (MET) min/week vs. 6174.6 MET min/week, p < 0.001), increased the time spent sedentarily (Me = 240 min vs. Me = 360 min, p < 0.001) and had decreased sleep quality (PSQI score Me = 7.00 vs. Me = 9.00). CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 pandemic worsened health behaviours and intensified the feeling of generalized anxiety in young adults.

667270,Scaling the immune incline in PDAC,2021-06-03,"By engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or Ace2), the novel pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades host cells and affects many organs, including the brain. However, the distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still obscure. Here, we investigated the ACE2 expression in the brain by analyzing data from publicly available brain transcriptome databases. According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some brain locations, such as the choroid plexus and paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus. According to cell-type distribution analysis, nuclear expression of ACE2 was found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells) in the human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. A few ACE2-expressing nuclei were found in a hippocampal dataset, and none were detected in the prefrontal cortex. Except for the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of Ace2 in the mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain. Thus, our results reveal an outline of ACE2/Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse brains, which indicates that the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of inducing central nervous system symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Potential species differences should be considered when using mouse models to study the neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chen, Rongrong; Wang, Keer; Yu, Jie; Howard, Derek; French, Leon; Chen, Zhong; Wen, Chengping; Xu, Zhenghao",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551947/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.573095,138

There has been a shift toward virtual consultations. The evidence to support this change in practice is unclear. The aim of this study was to systematically review the evidence base for virtual consultations for orthopedics. Materials and Methods: Two independent reviewers performed a literature search based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, utilizing the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases. Only studies reporting outcomes following the use of telemedicine for diagnosis, consultation, rehabilitation, and follow-up were included. Outcomes analyzed were: (1) patient and clinician satisfaction, (2) clinical outcome measures, and (3) cost analysis of traditional versus teleconsultation. Results: A total of 41 studies were included. Fifteen studies compared clinical outcomes of telemedicine against a matched traditional cohort. Of these 15 studies, 2 demonstrated noninferiority, 9 showed no statistically significant difference, and 4 found telemedicine to be superior. Eleven studies recorded patient reported outcomes, which demonstrated high patient satisfaction. Nine studies reported decreased costs when telemedicine was compared to traditional care. The remaining six studies had varied aims and methodologies that didn't fit well with any of these subheadings. Discussion: While the available evidence is limited, the studies assessed here show that telemedicine can deliver high quality health care with good clinical outcomes and high patient satisfaction in a cost-effective manner. Our team thinks what this has highlighted is that communication technology is advancing rapidly and that we as a community of surgeons need to be able to adapt rapidly and adopt innovative technology to continue to improve patient experience and outcomes.","Fahey, Eoin; Elsheikh, Mohamed F H; Davey, Martin S; Rowan, Fiachra; Cassidy, John Tristan; Cleary, May S",Telemed. j. e. health,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34375150/,138

To determine the probabilities of transition between different types of care and diagnostic states for the population infected with COVID-19 in Colombia, by age group. METHODS. Using the official reports of COVID-19 cases in Colombia, transition matrices were calculated for the states according to the location of an infected person during the evolution of the disease, i.e. home, hospital or intensive care unit (ICU). The probabilities that infected persons will move to a state of “recovery” or “death” within a 24-hour period were also calculated for different territories. RESULTS. The population aged 66 or older had a higher probability of moving to the state of “death” in a period of 24 hours; this finding was confirmed for all the territories analyzed, with a probability between 52% and 57%, except for the Aburrá Valley where the probability was 25%. In Colombia, out of every 200 infected persons treated at home, one will require admission to the ICU within 24 hours. If the infected person is older than 65, one of every 53 cases will require admission to the ICU. Of infected hospital patients, one in 10 will require ICU admission within 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS. The results provide information about the pressure that the increase of people infected by COVID-19 exerts on hospital capacity. Some people die without ever having been in an intensive care bed. The results of the transition probabilities show low case fatality rates for those under 65.","Manrique Ruiz, Luis Carlos; Muñetón Santa, Guberney; Loaiza Quintero, Osmar Leandro",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://doi.org/10.26633/rpsp.2020.171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346244/,138

670224,Perspectives on mechanistic implications of ROS inducers for targeting viral infections,2020-10-14,"OBJECTIVE: In physiological conditions, arterial blood lactate concentration is equal to or lower than central venous blood lactate concentration. A reversal in this rate (i.e., higher lactate concentration in central venous blood), which could reflect a derangement in the mitochondrial metabolism of lung cells induced by inflammation, has been previously reported in patients with ARDS but has been never explored in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to explore if the COVID-19-induced lung cell damage was mirrored by an arterial lactatemia higher than the central venous one; then if the administration of anti-inflammatory therapy (i.e., canakinumab 300 mg subcutaneous) could normalize such abnormal lactate a-cv difference. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted, started on March 25, 2020, for a duration of 10 days, enrolling 21 patients affected by severe COVID-19 pneumonia undergoing mechanical ventilation consecutively admitted to the ICU of the Rimini Hospital, Italy. Arterial and central venous blood samples were contemporarily collected to calculate the difference between arterial and central venous lactate (Delta a-cv lactate) concentrations within 24 h from tracheal intubation (T(0)) and 24 hours after canakinumab administration (T(1)). RESULTS: At T(0), 19 of 21 (90.5%) patients showed a pathologic Delta a-cv lactate (median 0.15 mmol/L; IQR 0.07–0.25). In the 13 patients undergoing canakinumab administration, at T(1), Delta a-cv lactate decreased in 92.3% of cases, the decrease being statistically significant (T(0): median 0.24, IQR 0.09–0.31 mmol/L; T(1): median −0.01, IQR −0.08–0.04 mmol/L; p=0.002). CONCLUSION: A reversed Delta a-cv lactate might be interpreted as one of the effects of COVID-19-related cytokine storm, which could reflect a derangement in the mitochondrial metabolism of lung cells induced by severe inflammation or other uncoupling mediators. In addition, Delta a-cv lactate decrease might also reflect the anti-inflammatory activity of canakinumab.

We argue that COVID-19 trial participants should usually be offered reimbursement for research-related expenses, and compensation for their time and effort, as for other types of research under usual circumstances. Given increased risk of undue influence against pandemic background conditions, incentive payment should be avoided unless essential to recruitment and retention in important trials whose social value outweighs this risk.

Alongside increased physical frailty, anxiety symptoms associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion appear to represent its most prominent ‘sequelae’. The attentional and linguistic resources required for decoding virus-related information may also influence the perceived threat of contagion. However, the possible role of neuropsychogeriatric factors on the latter dimension has never been assessed in a longitudinal study on the older population. To fill this gap, 50 healthy cognitively preserved older adults underwent a neuropsychological and physical frailty assessment before the pandemic (T0). Subsequently, they agreed to be interviewed and re-assessed during the lockdown (T1) and immediately after it (T2) through a longitudinal one-year study. Perceived threat of SARS-CoV-2 at T2 was predicted both by baseline anxiety and frailty scores, and by decreased performance in information processing speed and language comprehension tests.

Kits I‐IV approved by the State Drug Administration of China were selected, and the detection targets were ORF1ab gene and N gene. Specificity was evaluated by detecting other respiratory viruses. The sensitivity and batch effect of each kit were evaluated by testing 10‐fold dilutions of RNA. Clinical application was verified by testing nasopharyngeal swab and sputum specimens from COVID‐19 patients. Among the 78 cases infected by other respiratory viruses, no amplification curve was observed using these four COVID‐19 RT‐PCR kits. The minimum detection limits of kits I‐IV were 10(−6), 10(−5), 10(−5), and 10(−6) dilutions, respectively, and concentrations were 10 copies/mL (10(−5) dilution) and 1 copies/mL (10(−6) dilution). The sensitivities of kits I‐IV detected using 142 nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID‐19 patients were 91.55%, 81.69%, 80.28%, and 90.85%, respectively, while they were 92.68%, 85.37%, 82.93%, and 93.90%, respectively, for the 82 sputum samples. The specificity of each kit was 100.00% (77/77). The total expected detection rate using sputum samples was 88.59% (691/780) higher than 86.15% (672/780) of nasopharyngeal swabs. Comparison of nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples from the same COVID‐19 patient led to the detection of ORF1ab and N genes in 16 (100%) sputum samples; only ORF1ab and N genes were detected in 12 (75%) and 14 (87.5%) nasopharyngeal swab specimens, respectively. In conclusion, comparison of commercial COVID‐19 RT‐PCR kits should be performed before using a new batch of such kits in routine diagnostics.","Shen, Lingyu; Cui, Shujuan; Zhang, Daitao; Lin, Changying; Chen, Lijuan; Wang, Quanyi",J Clin Lab Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320386/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23605,138
671810,"The impact of influenza infection on young children, their family and the health care system",2018-09-11,"OBJECTIVES: Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be at risk to develop a severe course of COVID-19. The influence of immunomodulating drugs on the course of COVID-19 is unknown. To gather knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients with IRD, we established a registry shortly after the beginning of the pandemic in Germany. METHODS: Using an online questionnaire (www.COVID19-rheuma.de), a nationwide database was launched on 30 March 2020, with appropriate ethical and data protection approval to collect data of patients with IRD infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this registry, key clinical and epidemiological parameters—for example, diagnosis of IRD, antirheumatic therapies, comorbidities and course of the infection—are documented. RESULTS: Until 25 April 2020, data from 104 patients with IRD infected with SARS-CoV-2 were reported (40 males; 63 females; 1 diverse). Most of them (45%) were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, 59% had one or more comorbidities and 42% were treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Hospitalisation was reported in 32% of the patients. Two-thirds of the patients already recovered. Unfortunately, 6 patients had a fatal course. CONCLUSIONS: In a short time, a national registry for SARS-CoV2-infected patients with IRD was established. Within 4 weeks, 104 cases were documented. The registry enables to generate data rapidly in this emerging situation and to gain a better understanding of the course of SARS-CoV2-infection in patients with IRD, with a distinct focus on their immunomodulatory therapies. This knowledge is valuable for timely information of physicians and patients with IRD, and shall also serve for the development of guidance for the management of patients with IRD during this pandemic.","Hasseli, Rebecca; Mueller-Ladner, Ulf; Schmeiser, Tim; Hoyer, Bimba F; Krause, Andreas; Lorenz, Hanns-Martin; Regierer, Anne Constanze; Richter, Jutta G; Strangfeld, Anja; Voll, Reinhard E; Pfeil, Alexander; Schulze-Koops, Hendrik; Specker, Christof",RMD Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32878994/; https://doi.org/10.1136/rmdopen-2020-001332,138
672216,Characteristics of physical blocking on co-occupant’s exposure to respiratory droplet residuals,2012-03-03,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The presence of carnivores near human settlements is a poorly studied topic that generates concern and perception of risk in some human communities, especially for medium to large felids. Apart from the conflict of the potential predation of livestock, there is the insecurity perception of a potential attack on people. To gain a better understanding of how, when, and how close pumas approached human settlements, we analyze 51 puma records near populated areas over eight years in central Chile. The results show that pumas approached human-populated areas; in 23.5% of the records pumas are found between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement, 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m, and 51% are over 5000 m. We associate puma records with landscape features, such as mountain ranges, land-use, road, and urban infrastructure; and based on previous knowledge of puma biology, behavior, and habitat preference, we identify their area of occupation and the potential biological corridor used for their movements from the Andes Range to the coast. Our results show the adaptability of pumas to human-dominated landscapes, and their capacity to overcome landscape barriers, such as human infrastructure, contributing to a better understanding of the population dynamics in the study area. Studies on human–carnivore coexistence, through formulas that consider local realities and the reduction of implicit risks for humans, are urgently needed, both globally and locally, and likely the only way to secure the long-term conservation of pumas in human-dominated landscapes. ABSTRACT: The wildland–urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes—creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Wildlife sightings near human settlements have appeared to increase in the last years. This article reports 51 records of presences, sightings, and livestock attacks of Puma concolor, a large-sized felid, collected from 2012 to 2020 across the O’Higgins region in central Chile. Puma records were concentrated in the east of the region in the Andes Range and foothills (90%). The number of puma records is higher in the last four to six years than in previously studied years. Of the 51 records, 23.5% are between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement (classified as very close), 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m (moderately close), and 51% are over 5000 m (distant). Most of the sightings are recorded in the summer (35%) and spring (29%). We identify an area of approximately 9000 km(2) of suitable habitat as the most probable corridor effectively connecting pumas moving between eastern and western areas, encompassing the Angostura de Paine mountain range. Our results contribute to the understanding of the presence and movements of P. concolor near urban areas and human settlements, confirming their persistence in and adaptation to human-dominated landscapes. We also provide insights into human–carnivore coexistence in the current global context in the densely populated central Chile.","Ramírez-Álvarez, Diego; Napolitano, Constanza; Salgado, Iván",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11040965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807134/,138
672480,New therapeutic approaches of mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND: MRNA COVID-19 vaccine is more effective than traditional vaccines due to superior immune activation. However, the impact of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine on triggering de novo/relapsing glomerulonephritis (GN) is limited. We report a case series of patients who developed new or relapsing GN post vaccination. METHOD: We evaluated baseline characteristics, vaccine type and clinical outcomes of 13 patients from our institution who had a new diagnosis or relapse of their GN post mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Of 13 patients, 8 patients were newly diagnosed GNs and 5 patients had relapse. Median age was 62 years (range 19-83 years). Autoimmune disease (38%) was the most prevalent underlying disease followed by cancer (23%). Majority of patients were white male. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) was the most common GN in our series (5 patients, 38%) followed by membranous nephropathy (MN) (3 patients, 23%). One patient with IgAN had evidence of IgA deposits prior to vaccination suggesting that the immune activation following vaccination triggered a flare of the disease. Our case series also included the first case report of tip-variant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, NELL-1 associated MN, and atypical anti-GBM nephritis. Seventy seven percent developed acute kidney injury with the majority being KDIGO stage 1 (67%). Outcome are favorable with 80% responding to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: New cases and relapse of GN can present shortly after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. New cases of IgAN may result from unmasking of undiagnosed IgAN due to robust immune activation rather than development of new deposits.","Klomjit, Nattawat; Alexander, Mariam Priya; Fervenza, Fernando C.; Zoghby, Ziad; Garg, Arvind; Hogan, Marie C.; Nasr, Samih H.; Minshar, Marwan Abu; Zand, Ladan",Kidney Int Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34632166/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468024921014480; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468024921014480?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2021.09.008,138

We developed two online behavioural interventions to support eczema care called ECO (Eczema Care Online) for young people and ECO for families. This protocol describes two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate clinical and cost-effectiveness of the two interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Design: Two independent, pragmatic, unmasked, parallel group RCTs with internal pilots and nested health economic and process evaluation studies. Setting: Participants will be recruited from general practitioner practices in England. Participants: Young people aged 13–25 years with eczema and parents and carers of children aged 0–12 years with eczema, excluding inactive or very mild eczema (five or less on Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)). Interventions: Participants will be randomised to online intervention plus usual care or to usual eczema care alone. Outcome measures: Primary outcome is eczema severity over 24 weeks measured by POEM. Secondary outcomes include POEM 4-weekly for 52 weeks, quality of life, eczema control, itch intensity (young people only), patient enablement, health service and treatment use. Process measures include treatment adherence, barriers to adherence and intervention usage. Our sample sizes of 303 participants per trial are powered to detect a group difference of 2.5 (SD 6.5) in monthly POEM scores over 24 weeks (significance 0.05, power 0.9), allowing for 20% loss to follow-up. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be from a National Health Service and personal social service perspective. Qualitative and quantitative process evaluation will help understand the mechanisms of action and participant experiences and inform implementation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by South Central Oxford A Research Ethics Committee (19/SC/0351). Recruitment is ongoing, and follow-up will be completed by mid-2022. Findings will be disseminated to participants, the public, dermatology and primary care journals, and policy makers.

673039,Single‐cell analysis identified lung progenitor cells in COVID‐19 patients,2020-10-22,"Many positive-strand RNA viruses encode genes that can function in trans, whereas other genes are required in cis for genome replication. The mechanisms underlying trans- and cis-preferences are not fully understood. Here, we evaluate this concept for hepatitis C virus (HCV), an important cause of chronic liver disease and member of the Flaviviridae family. HCV encodes five nonstructural (NS) genes that are required for RNA replication. To date, only two of these genes, NS4B and NS5A, have been trans-complemented, leading to suggestions that other replicase genes work only in cis. We describe a new quantitative system to measure the cis- and trans-requirements for HCV NS gene function in RNA replication and identify several lethal mutations in the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B genes that can be complemented in trans, alone or in combination, by expressing the NS3–5B polyprotein from a synthetic mRNA. Although NS5B RNA binding and polymerase activities can be supplied in trans, NS5B protein expression was required in cis, indicating that NS5B has a cis-acting role in replicase assembly distinct from its known enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the RNA binding and NTPase activities of the NS3 helicase domain were required in cis, suggesting that these activities play an essential role in RNA template selection. A comprehensive complementation group analysis revealed functional linkages between NS3-4A and NS4B and between NS5B and the upstream NS3–5A genes. Finally, NS5B polymerase activity segregated with a daclatasvir-sensitive NS5A activity, which could explain the synergy of this antiviral compound with nucleoside analogs in patients. Together, these studies define several new aspects of HCV replicase structure-function, help to explain the potency of HCV-specific combination therapies, and provide an experimental framework for the study of cis- and trans-acting activities in positive-strand RNA virus replication more generally.","Kazakov, Teymur; Yang, Feng; Ramanathan, Harish N.; Kohlway, Andrew; Diamond, Michael S.; Lindenbach, Brett D.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25875808/,138

For densely populated regions in the world, this may have been challenging given the proximity of people to one other. Thus, this brief report sought to compare the measures across 2 densely populated locations, Hong Kong and Gaza. Epidemiological data was obtained from governmental online repositories and was compared with the data presented by the Johns Hopkins coronavirus map to ensure consistency. Descriptive statistics were used to interpret the data obtained over the period of the study. The data suggested that although Hong Kong and Gaza implemented similar strategies, Gaza recorded marginally higher cases compared with Hong Kong in the same timeframe. The strategies implemented in both settings included border closures, social distancing, proper hand hygiene, and mask usage. Cultural and socio-demographic differences may have played a part in this variation in case numbers, in addition to lessons Hong Kong had previously learned from a similar outbreak. As the pandemic is ongoing it is essential that public sensitization to adherence to precautionary measures at the personal/family level does not occur.","Abu-Odah, Hammoda; Ramazanu, Sheena; Saleh, Eslam; Bayuo, Jonathan; Abed, Yehia; Salah, Motasem Said",Osong Public Health Res Perspect,https://doi.org/10.24171/j.phrp.2021.12.1.07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33659154/,138

However, success depends on peoples’ knowledge levels and rates of acceptance. But, previous research on this topic is currently lacking in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study aimed at to investigate Bangladeshi peoples’ knowledge, acceptance, and perception of challenges regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Quantitative data were collected using an online survey (n = 1975) and face-to-face interviews (n = 2200) with a pre-tested structured questionnaire. In addition, seven open-ended interviews were conducted with health experts regarding challenges of vaccination. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between explanatory and dependent variables. Effect size was estimated to understand the magnitude of relationship between two variables. Of 4175 respondents, 92.6% knew about COVID-19 vaccines, while only 37.4% believed vaccines to be effective in controlling COVID-19. Nearly 46% of respondents believed that COVID-19 vaccines have side-effects, and 16.4% of respondents believed that side-effects could be life-threatening. Only 60.5% of respondents indicated that they would receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Out of 1650 respondents (39.5%) who did not intend to receive the vaccine, 948 (57.4%) believed that they would be naturally protected. Regressions results indicated that men had higher rates of knowledge regarding the vaccine. In addition, rural respondents demonstrated lower knowledge regarding the vaccine. Furthermore, education had a significant association with knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines. Respondents with university education had more knowledge regarding the vaccine (Odds ratio, OR = 29.99; 95% confidence interval, CI 11.40–78.90, effect size 1.88; p = 0.01) and correct dosage (OR 27.34; 95% CI 15.25–49.00, effect size 1.83; p = 0.01).

Survivorship care plans should address five key areas that include surveillance and screening for new/reoccurring cancer; management of long-term effects of cancer treatment; health promotion; and care coordination/practice implications. To maximize the benefit of survivorship care for rural BCS, it is necessary to better understand their experiences and preferences. METHODS A systematic review of the extant literature addressing the survivorship needs and interventions for rural BCS was conducted. The following databases were searched for reports published between January, 2007, and December, 2018: PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, PsycINFO (EBSCO), CAB Direct, and Sociological Abstracts. Reports published after 2007 with samples including and comprised of rural BCS in the United States were included. Screening of the search results followed PRISMA guidelines using Covidence systematic review software. RESULTS Findings were extracted from 30 reports disseminating findings of 14 research studies. The five areas of a survivorship care were counted/accounted for during data extraction. The included reports concentrated on health promotion (e.g., weight loss and exercise) and the management of long-term effects of cancer treatment as key outcomes. There is a gap in the literature addressing care coordination, surveillance, and screening. CONCLUSION Additional research including interventions for rural BCS that address more survivorship care areas would benefit this population and improve survivorship quality of life for rural BCS.","Anbari, Allison Brandt; Wanchai, Ausanee; Graves, Rebecca",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05308-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31970515/,138

It is controversial whether the lesion size assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can change over time without any operative treatment. In this study, we used MRI to observe the lesion size changes of ONFH induced by corticosteroid administration in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. The study included 51 SARS patients (84 hips) with early-stage ONFH who did not receive any operative treatment and were diagnosed by MRI. All of the patients underwent MRI follow-ups. Each patient was evaluated on the basis of the lesion volume on MRI at every follow-up for further comparisons. At the first MRI scan, the mean lesion volume was 10.12 ± 8.05 cm(3) (range: 0.39–41.62 cm(3)). At the mid-term follow-up (2.5 years), the mean lesion volume was 7.82 ± 7.59 cm(3) (range: 0.11–39.65 cm(3)). At the final follow-up (five years), complete regression of the lesion was observed in six hips, and the mean lesion volume was 5.67 ± 6.58 cm(3) (range: 0.00–31.47 cm(3)). Overall, the lesion volume was reduced by >15% in 80 hips, and only four hips with relatively larger lesion volumes showed no apparent reductions.

Severe Covid-19 is characterized by pulmonary pathologies associated with respiratory failure. Thus, therapeutics aimed at inhibiting entry of the virus or its internalization in the upper respiratory tract, are of interest. Herein, we report the prophylactic application of two intra-nasal formulations provided by the National Medicinal Plant Board (NMPB), Anu oil and Til tailya in SARS-CoV2 infection hamster model. Prophylactic nasal instillation of these oil formulations exhibited reduced viral load in lungs, and resulted in reduced body weight loss and pneumonitis. In line with reduced viral load, histopathlogical analysis revealed a reduction in lung pathology in Anu oil group as compared to the control infected group. However, Til tailya group did not show a significant reduction in lung pathology. Furthermore, molecular analysis using mRNA expression profiling indicated reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines genes, including Th1 and Th17 cytokines for both the intra-nasal formulations as a result of decreased viral load.

Assessing the capacity of surveillance systems to detect these threats is crucial for evaluating a country’s ability to meet these requirements. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We propose a framework to evaluate the sensitivity and representativeness of hospital-based surveillance and apply it to severe neurological infectious diseases and fatal respiratory infectious diseases in Bangladesh. We identified cases in selected communities within surveillance hospital catchment areas using key informant and house-to-house surveys and ascertained where cases had sought care. We estimated the probability of surveillance detecting different sized outbreaks by distance from the surveillance hospital and compared characteristics of cases identified in the community and cases attending surveillance hospitals. We estimated that surveillance detected 26% (95% CI 18%–33%) of severe neurological disease cases and 18% (95% CI 16%–21%) of fatal respiratory disease cases residing at 10 km distance from a surveillance hospital. Detection probabilities decreased markedly with distance. The probability of detecting small outbreaks (three cases) dropped below 50% at distances greater than 26 km for severe neurological disease and at distances greater than 7 km for fatal respiratory disease. Characteristics of cases attending surveillance hospitals were largely representative of all cases; however, neurological disease cases aged <5 y or from the lowest socioeconomic group and fatal respiratory disease cases aged ≥60 y were underrepresented. Our estimates of outbreak detection rely on suspected cases that attend a surveillance hospital receiving laboratory confirmation of disease and being reported to the surveillance system. The extent to which this occurs will depend on disease characteristics (e.g., severity and symptom specificity) and surveillance resources. CONCLUSION: We present a new approach to evaluating the sensitivity and representativeness of hospital-based surveillance, making it possible to predict its ability to detect emerging threats.","Nikolay, Birgit; Salje, Henrik; Sturm-Ramirez, Katharine; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Homaira, Nusrat; Ahmed, Makhdum; Iuliano, A.

We first highlight the relevance of interpreting the early stage of the epidemic in light of incoming infectious travelers from abroad. Next, we critically evaluate certain proposed solutions to contain the epidemic based on instantaneous modifications of the reproductive number. Finally, we build increasingly complex and realistic models, ranging from simple homogeneous models used to estimate local reproduction numbers, to fully coupled inhomogeneous (deterministic or stochastic) models incorporating mobility estimates from cell phone location data. The models are capable of producing forecasts highly consistent with the official number of cases with minimal parameter fitting and fine-tuning. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed models, focusing on the validity of different necessary first approximations, and caution future modeling efforts to exercise great care in the interpretation of long-term forecasts, and in the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions backed by numerical simulations.","Tagliazucchi, E.; Balenzuela, P.; Travizano, M.; Mindlin, G.B.; Mininni, P.D.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501375/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303180?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109923; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920303180,138

A well-accepted strategy is to definitively reduce and fix one part of the fracture (commonly the posterior articular surface in a pilon or tibial plateau fracture) with the patient in one position, and then reposition the patient to access the other side of the fracture. The change of position prolongs the anaesthetic and surgical time. In the context of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it also causes concern with donning and doffing. We describe a mobile floppy lateral position that enables dual approaches to the ankle, distal tibia, tibial plateau, and the acetabulum without having to change the patient positioning. The patient is positioned lateral on a radiolucent table, usually with the affected side on top. No supports are placed around the pelvis, allowing the patient's pelvis to flop forwards or backwards. Two supports are placed around the chest and a strap is placed to secure the patient to the table if deemed necessary. The initial surgical procedure can be performed by flopping the patient's pelvis forwards, allowing access to the posterior leg, knee or hip. Once satisfactory fixation is achieved, the pelvis is rolled backwards to allow access to the anterior aspect of the fracture.","Garala, Kanai; Patil, Sunit",Orthop Trauma,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877132721000026; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mporth.2021.01.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877132721000026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619438/,138

Development and testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs or vaccines have not turned to be realistic within the timeframe needed to combat this pandemic. Here, we report a comprehensive computational approach to identify the multi-targeted drug molecules against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whichare crucially involved in the viral–host interaction, replication of the virus inside the host, disease progression and transmission of coronavirus infection. Virtual screening of 75 FDA-approved potential antiviral drugs against the target proteins, spike (S) glycoprotein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL(pro)), cathepsin L (CTSL), nucleocapsid protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and non-structural protein 6 (NSP6), resulted in the selection of seven drugs which preferentially bind to the target proteins. Further, the molecular interactions determined by molecular dynamics simulation revealed that among the 75 drug molecules, catechin can effectively bind to 3CL(pro), CTSL, RBD of S protein, NSP6 and nucleocapsid protein. It is more conveniently involved in key molecular interactions, showing binding free energy (ΔG(bind)) in the range of −5.09 kcal/mol (CTSL) to −26.09 kcal/mol (NSP6). At the binding pocket, catechin is majorly stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions, displays ΔE(vdW) values: −7.59 to −37.39 kcal/mol. Thus, the structural insights of better binding affinity and favorable molecular interaction of catechin toward multiple target proteins signify that catechin can be potentially explored as a multi-targeted agent against COVID-19.","Mishra, Chandra Bhushan; Pandey, Preeti; Sharma, Ravi Datta; Malik, Md Zubbair; Mongre, Raj Kumar; Lynn, Andrew M; Prasad, Rajendra; Jeon, Raok; Prakash, Amresh",Brief Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33386025/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa378,138
679462,Expression and purification of SARS coronavirus membrane protein,2004,"This chapter discusses the epidemiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Classically, PD refers to progressive parkinsonism caused by loss of pigmented aminergic brainstem neurons without an identifiable cause, while parkinsonism refers simply to the syndrome of bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and postural reflex impairment. Over nearly two centuries, Parkinson's clinical description has provided the framework for clinical investigations, including epidemiologic ones. Descriptions of PD were limited to selected clinical settings until the middle of the 20th century. Since then, epidemiologic approaches have been used not only to investigate the population distribution of PD, but also as a way to glean clues as to the cause of this “idiopathic” disorder. Because PD is relatively infrequent, a large base population must be surveyed to identify sufficient numbers of cases for a study. In some instances, PD cases can be identified through health service rosters within defined geographic areas or in enumerated populations. In others, cases of PD are sought independently of the health care system, such as through door-to-door surveys. While the latter approach is theoretically least likely to exclude cases, the time and cost involved are also greatest using this approach.","Kasten, Meike; Chade, Annabel; Tanner, Caroline M.",Handb Clin Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0072-9752(07)83006-5; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0072975207830065; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0072975207830065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18808913/,138

This paper aims to conceptualize, develop, and validate a measurement scale for SCV. SCV is first defined and operationalized as a construct, followed by content validation and item measure development. Data have been collected through three independent samplings comprising a total of 558 respondents. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are used in a step-wise manner for scale development. Reliability and validity are evaluated. A nomological model is theorized and tested to evaluate nomological validity. For the first time, our study frames SCV as a novel and distinct construct. The findings show that SCV is a hierarchical and multidimensional construct, reflected in organizational structures, organizational resources, dynamic design capabilities, and operational aspects. The findings reveal that a central characteristic of SCV is the dynamic reconfiguration of SC structures in an adaptive manner to ensure survival in the long-term perspective. This research conceptualizes and provides specific, validated dimensions and item measures for SCV. Practitioner directed guidance and suggestions are offered for improving SCV during the COVID-19 pandemic and future severe disruptions.","Ruel, Salomée; El Baz, Jamal; Ivanov, Dmitry; Das, Ajay",Ann Oper Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716370/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-03974-9,138

It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. In Ghana, the first two cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded on March 13, 2020 with a strain imported from Europe. In December 2020, a new strain from South Africa was detected in Ghana which was associated with higher transmission rates, severity of the disease, and higher number of recorded deaths. Our study aimed to record notable differences and similarities between infections due to the initial, and second strains of COVID-19 infections detected in Ghana during the last 12-months. METHOD: This was a retrospective study involving 50 patients infected with the first strain, and another 50 patients infected with the second strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Microsoft Excel-2013 was the analytical tool. RESULTS: The data analysis supported publications suggesting that the new strain of the virus caused more severe infections, which were manifested on high resolution CT (HRCT) scans as more widespread alveolar disease, most commonly presenting as large areas of consolidation. CONCLUSION: Despite numerous similarities in terms of the manifestation of COVID-19 infection on HRCT scans, notable difference supporting the notion of increased virulence and severity of disease were also recorded. The study findings demonstrate the need for heightened and sustained preventive measures needed to reduce, and eventually curb COVID-19 infection and mortality rates associated with the introduction of new virulent strains.","Brakohiapa, Edmund K.K.; Sarkodie, Benjamin D.; Botwe, Benard O.; Dzefi-Tettey, Klenam; Anim, Dorothea A.; Edzie, Emmanuel K.M.; Goleku, Philip N.; Jimah, Bashiru B.; Amankwa, Adu Tutu",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07818; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021019216?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844021019216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34423148/,138

Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current recommended laboratory method, several rapid antigen point-of-care tests (POCTs) were developed as frontline testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess a recently CE-approved POCT, SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test on the LumiraDx™ Platform (LumiraDx GmbH, Cologne, Germany) for the identification of SARS-COV-2 infected subjects at hospital setting. METHODS: LumiraDx POCT was implemented in three hospital settings: adult and pediatric emergency departments and occupational medicine department along two-month period during the second peak of Italian SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Rapid antigen testing was performed on direct nasal swabs and results were compared with those obtained by Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: Overall sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV were 90.3%, 92.1%, 95.1%, and 84.9%, respectively, compared to reference method. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for symptomatic group were 89.3% [95% IC 84.2-93.3], 88.2% [95% IC 72.5-96.7], 97.8% [95% IC 94.6-99.1], and 58.8% [95% IC 48.4-68.5], respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for asymptomatic group were 92.1% [95% IC 85-96.5], 92.3% [95% IC 89.9-94.4], 67.9% [95% IC 61.3-73.8], and 98.5% [95% IC 97.1-99.2], respectively. False positive and negative antigen testing results in both symptomatic and asymptomatic group were observed. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 Ag POCT may represent an interesting tool to rapidly identify symptomatic or asymptomatic infected subjects. However, in hospital setting in which false negative or false positive results may have relevant implications, confirmatory NAAT always remains necessary for the appropriate management of patients.","Bianco, Gabriele; Boattini, Matteo; Barbui, Anna Maria; Scozzari, Gitana; Riccardini, Franco; Coggiola, Maurizio; Lupia, Enrico; Cavallo, Rossana; Costa, Cristina",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104838; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653221001050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33946040/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653221001050?v=s5,138
680649,The Immune System Throws Its Traps: Cells and Their Extracellular Traps in Disease and Protection,2021-07-26,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has spread worldwide with dire consequences. To urgently investigate the pathogenicity of COVID-19 and develop vaccines and therapeutics, animal models that are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed. In the present study, we established an animal model highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 via the intratracheal tract infection in CAG promoter-driven human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-transgenic (CAG-hACE2) mice. The CAG-hACE2 mice showed several severe symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with definitive weight loss and subsequent death. Acute lung injury with elevated cytokine and chemokine levels was observed at an early stage of infection in CAG-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of the hACE2 gene in CAG-hACE2 mice revealed that more than 15 copies of hACE2 genes were integrated in tandem into the mouse genome, supporting the high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In the developed model, immunization with viral antigen or injection of plasma from immunized mice prevented body weight loss and lethality due to infection with SARS-CoV-2. These results indicate that a highly susceptible model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CAG-hACE2 mice via the intratracheal tract is suitable for evaluating vaccines and therapeutic medicines.","Asaka, Masamitsu N; Utsumi, Daichi; Kamada, Haruhiko; Nagata, Satoshi; Nakachi, Yutaka; Yamaguchi, Tomokazu; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Kuba, Keiji; Yasutomi, Yasuhiro",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.152529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34463644/,138
680845,Cannabinoids as Key Regulators of Inflammasome Signaling: A Current Perspective,2021-01-28,"The events of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemics have shown the importance of social factors, especially given the large number of asymptomatic cases that effectively spread the virus, which can cause a medical emergency to very susceptible individuals. Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability.","Tadić, Bosiljka; Melnik, Roderick",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33095815/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241163,138

COVID-19 interventions in Turkey are incorporated into the model to detect the future trend of the outbreak accurately. The lockdown is lifted on June 1, and the model is modified to include a time dependent transmission rate which is linked to the effective reproduction number Rt through basic reproduction number R0. The modified model captures the changing dynamics and peaks of the outbreak successfully. With the onset of vaccination on 13 January 2021, we augment the model with the vaccination class to investigate the impact of vaccination rate and efficacy.

Many countries rely on assessments through a national hotline or telecommunications, but this only adds to the burden of an already overwhelmed health care system. In this study, we developed an algorithm and a web application to help patients get screened. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to aid the general public by developing a web-based application that helps patients decide when to seek medical care during a novel disease outbreak. METHODS: The algorithm was developed via consultations with 6 physicians who directly screened, diagnosed, and/or treated patients with COVID-19. The algorithm mainly focused on when to test a patient in order to allocate limited resources more efficiently. The application was designed to be mobile-friendly and deployed on the web. We collected the application usage pattern data from March 1 to March 27, 2020. We evaluated the association between the usage pattern and the numbers of COVID-19 confirmed, screened, and mortality cases by access location and digital literacy by age group. RESULTS: The algorithm used epidemiological factors, presence of fever, and other symptoms. In total, 83,460 users accessed the application 105,508 times. Despite the lack of advertisement, almost half of the users accessed the application from outside of Korea. Even though the digital literacy of the 60+ years age group is half of that of individuals in their 50s, the number of users in both groups was similar for our application.

681723,Chikungunya Virus,2017-06-30,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is straining healthcare systems globally. The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate between patients requiring hospitalization and those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool and has not been externally validated. Methods: We followed the OHDSI framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 model. We evaluated the model on two different target populations: i) 41,381 patients that have SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency room visit and ii) 9,429,285 patients that have influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency room visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0 to 30 days. In total we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the US, Europe, Australia and Asia. Findings: The internal validation performance of the C-19 index was a c-statistic of 0.73 and calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data the model obtained c-statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US and South Korean datasets respectively. The calibration was poor with the model under-estimating risk. When validated on 12 datasets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network the c-statistics ranged between 0.40-0.68. Interpretation: The results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 model is low for influenza cohorts, and even worse amongst COVID-19 patients in the US, Spain and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.","Reps, Jenna M; Kim, Chungsoo; Williams, Ross D.; Markus, Aniek F; Yang, Cynthia; Salles, Talita Duarte; Falconer, Thomas; Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Williams, Andrew; Fernandez-Bertolin, Sergio; DuVall, Scott L; Kostka, Kristin; Rao, Gowtham; Shoaibi, Azza; Ostropolets, Anna; Spotnitz, Matthew E; Zhang, Lin; Casajust, Paula; Steyerberg, Ewout; Nyberg, Fredrik; Kaas-Hansen, Benjamin Skov; Choi, Young Hwa; Morales, Daniel; Liaw, Siaw-Teng; Abrahao, Maria Tereza Fernandes; Areia, Carlos; Matheny, Michael E; Aragon, Maria; Park, Rae Woong; Hripcsak, George; Reich, Christian G; Suchard, Marc A; You, Seng Chan; Ryan, Patrick B; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; Rijnbeek, Peter R",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.20130328; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.15.20130328v1?rss=1,138

Indeed, different commercial kits are directed against different antigens and could utilise different methods thereby triggering confusion and criticism. Here, we compared two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved automatized assays that detect IgG responses against spike or nucleocapsid protein of Sars-Cov-2 virus in 127 subjects among healthcare workers of IRCCS Policlinico San Donato (MI), Italy. We observed different kinetics of IgG responses, demonstrating the importance of timing of sampling to correctly interpret the results both for infection diagnosis and for epidemiologic studies. We observed that Anti-N response starts earlier than Anti-S1/S2 response but also decreases earlier, affecting the sensitivity of the tests at different time points. Combining two different assays, designed against different antigens, could reduce false negative results. Finally, we observed a patient who produced anti-nucleocapsid IgG, but not anti-spike IgG. In conclusion, we investigated antibody responses in Covid-19 disease, aiming to direct clinicians and laboratory scientists to correctly interpret serologic results by always paying attention to clinical history correlation, timing of sampling, methods and antigens used, to avoid false negative results and obtain relevant epidemiologic data.","Sitzia, C; Pistelli, L; Cardani, R; Renna, L V; Ranucci, M; Carrara, M; Borlini, S; Clerici, P; Rampoldi, B; Cornetta, M; Corsi-Romanelli, M",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/21-163-a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231353/,138

OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between CAC and in-hospital mortality and adverse events in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study enrolled 2067 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with definitive clinical outcomes (death or discharge) admitted from 22 tertiary hospitals in China between January 3, 2020 and April 2, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory results, chest CT findings, and CAC on admission were collected. The primary outcome was in-hospital death and the secondary outcome was composed of in-hospital death, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and requiring mechanical ventilation. Multivariable Cox regression analysis and Kaplan–Meier plots were used to explore the association between CAC and in-hospital death and adverse clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years (SD,16) and 1097 (53.1%) were male. A total of 177 patients showed high CAC level, and compared with patients with low CAC, these patients were older (mean age: 49 vs. 69 years, P < 0.001) and more likely to be male (52.0% vs. 65.0%, P = 0.001). Comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) ([33.3%, 59/177] vs. [4.7%, 89/1890], P < 0.001), presented more often among patients with high CAC, compared with patients with low CAC. As for laboratory results, patients with high CAC had higher rates of increased D-dimer, LDH, as well as CK-MB (all P < 0.05). The mean CT severity score in high CAC group was also higher than low CAC group (12.6 vs. 11.1, P = 0.005). In multivariable Cox regression model, patients with high CAC were at a higher risk of in-hospital death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.731; 95% CI 1.010–2.971, P = 0.046) and adverse clinical outcomes (HR, 1.611; 95% CL 1.087–2.387, P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: High CAC is a risk factor associated with in-hospital death and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with confirmed COVID-19, which highlights the importance of calcium load testing for hospitalized COVID-19 patients and calls for attention to patients with high CAC.

This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life (QoL) of Malaysian healthcare workers and its predictive factors. An online sample of 389 university-based healthcare workers completed questionnaires on demographics, clinical features, COVID-19-related stressors, psychological experiences, and perceived social support after the movement lockdown was lifted. All domains of QoL were within the norms of the general population except for social relationship QoL, which was lower than the norm. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that COVID-19-related stressors (e.g., stress due to annual leave being frozen, loss of daily routine, and frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients) and psychological sequelae (e.g., greater severity of depression, anxiety, and stress) predicted lower QoL. Conversely, greater perceived social support from friends and significant others predicted higher QoL. Clinical and demographic characteristics predicted QoL to a lesser extent: A history of pre-existing medical illness was associated only with lower physical health QoL, whereas older age and being single, divorced, or widowed were only predictive of higher environmental QoL. Efforts to enhance QoL among healthcare workers in response to the pandemic should focus on mitigating COVID-19-related stressors and psychological sequelae and facilitating social support.","Woon, Luke Sy-Cherng; Mansor, Nor Shuhada; Mohamad, Mohd Afifuddin; Teoh, Soon Huat; Leong Bin Abdullah, Mohammad Farris Iman",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897561/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.652326,138

Voice therapy faces a double challenge, interventions using telepractice, and delivering rehabilitation services to a growing population of patients at risk of functional impairment related to the COVID-19 disease. Moreover, as COVID-19 is transmitted through droplets, it is critical to understand how to mitigate these risks during assessment and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To promote safety, and effective clinical practice to voice assessment and rehabilitation in the pandemic COVID-19 context for speech-language pathologists. METHODS: A group of 11 experts in voice and swallowing disorders from five different countries conducted a consensus recommendation following the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery rules building a clinical guide for speech-language pathologists during this pandemic context. RESULTS: The clinical guide provides 79 recommendations for clinicians in the management of voice disorders during the pandemic and includes advice from assessment, direct treatment, telepractice, and teamwork. The consensus was reached 95% for all topics. CONCLUSION: This guideline should be taken only as recommendation; each clinician must attempt to mitigate the risk of infection and achieve the best therapeutic results taking into account the patient's particular reality.","Castillo-Allendes, Adrián; Contreras-Ruston, Francisco; Cantor, Lady; Codino, Juliana; Guzman, Marco; Malebran, Celina; Manzano, Carlos; Pavez, Axel; Vaiano, Thays; Wilder, Fabiana; Behlau, Mara",J Voice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917460/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0892199720303179; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2020.08.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892199720303179?v=s5,138

684975,COVID-19 vaccine development: Time to consider SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies?,2020-06-04,"Vaccines constitute the most effective medications in public health as they control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases and reduce mortality. Similar to other medications, allergic reactions can occur during vaccination. While most reactions are neither frequent nor serious, anaphylactic reactions are potentially life-threatening allergic reactions that are encountered rarely, but can cause serious complications. The allergic responses caused by vaccines can stem from activation of mast cells via Fcε receptor-1 type I reaction, mediated by the interaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against a particular vaccine, and occur within minutes or up to four hours. The type IV allergic reactions initiate 48 h after vaccination and demonstrate their peak between 72 and 96 h. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation via activation of the complement system and via activation of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 can also induce allergic reactions. Reactions are more often caused by inert substances, called excipients, which are added to vaccines to improve stability and absorption, increase solubility, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance, and not by the active vaccine itself. Polyethylene glycol, also known as macrogol, in the currently available Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and polysorbate 80, also known as Tween 80, in AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, are excipients mostly incriminated for allergic reactions. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge of immediate and delayed allergic reactions in the currently available vaccines against COVID-19, together with the general and specific therapeutic considerations. These considerations include: The incidence of allergic reactions and deaths under investigation with the available vaccines, application of vaccination in patients with mast cell disease, patients who developed an allergy during the first dose, vasovagal symptoms masquerading as allergic reactions, the COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, deaths associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and questions arising in managing of this current ordeal. Careful vaccine-safety surveillance over time, in conjunction with the elucidation of mechanisms of adverse events across different COVID-19 vaccine platforms, will contribute to the development of a safe vaccine strategy. Allergists’ expertise in proper diagnosis and treatment of allergic reactions is vital for the screening of high-risk individuals.","Kounis, Nicholas G.; Koniari, Ioanna; de Gregorio, Cesare; Velissaris, Dimitris; Petalas, Konstantinos; Brinia, Aikaterini; Assimakopoulos, Stelios F.; Gogos, Christos; Kouni, Sophia N.; Kounis, George N.; Calogiuri, GianFranco; Hung, Ming-Yow",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807579/,138

We assessed SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia (RNAemia) and the association between RNAemia and inflammation, organ failure and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. We included all patients with PCR verified COVID-19 and consent admitted to ICU. SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies above 1000/ml measured by PCR in plasma was defined as RNAemia and used as surrogate for viremia. In this cohort of 92 patients 59 (64%) were invasively ventilated. RNAemia was found in 31 patients (34%). Hypertension and corticosteroid treatment was more common in patients with RNAemia. Extra-pulmonary organ failure biomarkers and the extent of organ failure were similar in patients with and without RNAemia, but the former group had more renal replacement therapy and higher mortality (26 vs 16%; 35 vs 16%, respectively, p = 0.04). RNAemia was not an independent predictor of death at 30 days after adjustment for age. SARS-CoV2 RNA copies in plasma is a common finding in ICU patients with COVID-19. Although viremia was not associated with extra pulmonary organ failure it was more common in patients who did not survive to 30 days after ICU admission.

Hybridoma supernatants were selected for their ability to block PRRSV infection. Four MAbs, 1-8D2, 9.4C7, 9.9F2, and 3-3H2 inhibited infection and recognised cell surface, PAM-specific antigens as shown by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. These MAbs were then used to identify cellular proteins involved in PRRSV infection by radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPAs). MAbs 1-8D2 and 9.9F2 each recognised a 150 kDa-polypeptide doublet, while MAbs 9.4C7 and 3-3H2 both recognised a 220 kDa-polypeptide. Glycosidase treatment demonstrated all these polypeptides to be N-glycosylated. Thus, multiple glycoproteins appear to be involved in infection of PAMs by PRRSV.","Wissink, E. H. J.; van Wijk, H. A.

The aim was therefore to evaluate the two separate production lots of a commercial POC lateral flow test, intended for the detection of IgM and IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1). Control samples consisted of serum from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and pre-COVID-19 negative sera gathered from a biobank. The presence of anti-S1 IgM/IgG in the sera was verified by an in-house Luminex-based serological assay (COVID-19 SIA). One hundred samples were verified as positive for anti-S1 IgG and 74 for anti-S1 IgM. Two hundred samples were verified as negative for anti-S1 IgM/IgG. For the two lots of the POC-test, the sensitivities were 93.2% and 87.8% for IgM and 93.0% and 100% for IgG. The specificities were 100% for IgM and 99.5% for IgG. The positive predictive value was 100% for IgM and 98.9% and 99.0% for IgG. The negative predictive value was 97.6% and 95.7% for IgM, and 96.6% and 100% for IgG. The evaluated POC-test is suitable to assess anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgM and IgG, as a measure of previous virus exposure on an individual level. The external validation of separate lots of rapid POC-tests is encouraged to ensure high sensitivity before market introduction.","Hoffman, Tove; Kolstad, Linda; Rönnberg, Bengt; Lundkvist, Åke",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13061043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072890/,138

DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional design. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve team members (specialists in rehabilitation medicine -MD-, psychologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists) from a tertiary expertise centre in pain rehabilitation. METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected via a digital survey. Theme-based content analysis was performed for qualitative data. RESULTS: The themes that emerged were: the compulsory context; prerequisites for proper use of videoconferencing methods, which are strongly associated with the clinicians’ experiences; changes experienced in specific components of pain rehabilitation; and overarching changes experienced, including opportunities and limitations (sub-themes: therapeutic relationship, system involvement, efficiency, hands-on possibilities, interdisciplinary teamwork, and formalities). Overall, clinicians expressed moderate agreement with the statements that the quality of the pain rehabilitation programme can be maintained using videoconferencing, and that the COVID-19 pandemic offers opportunities for growth and innovation in telehealth. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to provide valid and satisfactory pain rehabilitation via videoconferencing. This study identified facilitators and barriers to the use of videoconferencing, and great potential for integrating aspects of telehealth into standard care after the pandemic.","Baadjou, Vera A.; Hollander, Marlies Den; Meulenbroek, Thijs Van; Verbunt, Jeanine A.; Timmers, Inge",J Rehabil Med Clin Commun,https://doi.org/10.2340/20030711-1000036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884138/,138

Ultraviolet radiation (UV) has a well-known antiviral effect, but measurements on the radiation dose necessary to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 have not been published so far. Methods: Coronavirus inactivation experiments with ultraviolet light performed in the past were evaluated to determine the UV radiation dose required for a 90% virus reduction. This analysis is based on the fact that all coronaviruses have a similar structure and similar RNA strand length. Results: The available data reveals large variations, which are apparently not caused by the coronaviruses but by the experimental conditions selected. If these are excluded as far as possible, it appears that coronaviruses are very UV sensitive. The upper limit determined for the log-reduction dose (90% reduction) is approximately 10.6 mJ/cm(2) (median), while the true value is probably only 3.7 mJ/cm(2) (median). Conclusion: Since coronaviruses do not differ structurally to any great exent, the SARS-CoV-2 virus – as well as possible future mutations – will very likely be highly UV sensitive, so that common UV disinfection procedures will inactivate the new SARS-CoV-2 virus without any further modification.","Heßling, Martin; Hönes, Katharina; Vatter, Petra; Lingenfelder, Christian",GMS Hyg Infect Control,https://doi.org/10.3205/dgkh000343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32547908/,138
