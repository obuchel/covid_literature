Sufficient conditions for extinction and persistence of the disease are established. In the case of persistence, the existence of endemic stationary distribution is proved and the distance between stochastic solutions and the endemic equilibrium of the corresponding deterministic system in the time mean sense is estimated. Based on realistic parameters of influenza A in humans, numerical simulations have been performed to verify/extend our analytical results. It is found that: (i) the deterministic threshold of the influenza A extinction [Formula: see text] may exist and the threshold parameter will be overestimated in case of neglecting the impaction of environmental noises; (ii) the presence of environmental noises is capable of supporting the irregular recurrence of influenza epidemic, and the average level of the number of infected individuals I(t) always decreases with the increase in noise intensity; and (iii) if [Formula: see text] , the volatility of I(t) increases with the increase of noise intensity, while the volatility of I(t) decreases with the increase in noise intensity if [Formula: see text] .","Li, Dan; Cui, Jing’an; Liu, Meng; Liu, Shengqiang",Bull Math Biol,480,11

We present the procedure, discussed ID topics and evaluation results of EpiLag after 10 years. We analysed attendance, duration of EpiLag and the frequency of reported events. Participants (RKI and state PHA) were surveyed regarding their satisfaction with logistics, contents and usefulness of EpiLag (Likert scales). Between 2009 and 2018, RKI hosted 484 EpiLag conferences with a mean duration of 25 min (range: 4–60) and high participation (range: 9–16; mean: 15 PHAs). Overall, 2975 ID events (39% international, 9% national and 52% subnational) were presented (mean: 6.1 per EpiLag), most frequently on measles (18%), salmonellosis (8%) and influenza (5%). All responding participants (14/16 PHAs and 9/9 at RKI) were satisfied with the EpiLag's organization and minutes and deemed EpiLag useful for an overview and information distribution on ID events relevant to Germany. EpiLag is time efficient, easily applicable and useful for a low-threshold event communication. It supports PHAs in crises and strengthens the network of surveillance stakeholders. We recommend its implementation to other countries or sectors.","Milde-Busch, Astrid; Zeitlmann, Nadine; Mücke, Inge; Gilsdorf, Andreas; Rexroth, Ute; an der Heiden, Maria",Epidemiol Infect,480,1

With advanced age comes an increase in accumulation of senescent cells that release soluble and insoluble pro-inflammatory factors collectively termed the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In the present report, we examined whether immune cells typical of those at the oral mucosa-microbe interface, are vulnerable to cellular senescence (CS) and the role of dysbiotic oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from young (yDCs) and old (oDCs) mice were co-cultured in vitro with CS inducer doxorubicin or P.gingivalis (Pg), plus or minus senolytic agent rapamycin. CS profiling revealed elevated CS mediators SA-β-Gal, p16 (INK4A), p53, and p21(Waf1/Clip1) in oDCs, or yDCs in response to doxorubicin or P. gingivalis, reversible with rapamycin. Functional studies indicate impaired maturation function of oDCs, and yDC exposed to P. gingivalis; moreover, OVA-driven proliferation of CD4+ T cells from young OTII transgenic mice was impaired by oDCs or yDCs+Pg. The SASP of DCs, consisting of secreted exosomes and inflammasome-related cytokines was further analyzed. Exosomes of DCs cocultured with P. gingivalis (PgDCexo) were purified, quantitated and characterized. Though typical in terms of size, shape and phenotype, PgDCexo were 2-fold greater in number than control DCs, with several important distinctions. Namely, PgDCexo were enriched in age-related miRNAs, and miRNAs reported to disrupt immune homeostasis through negative regulation of apoptosis and autophagy functions. We further show that PgDCexo were enriched in P. gingivalis fimbrial adhesin protein mfa1 and in inflammasome related cytokines IL-1β, TNFα and IL-6. Functionally PgDCexo were readily endocytosed by recipient yDCs, amplifying functional impairment in maturation and ability to promote Ova-driven proliferation of OTII CD4+ T cells from young mice. In conclusion P. gingivalis induces premature (autocrine) senescence in DCs by direct cellular invasion and greatly amplifies senescence, in paracrine, of bystander DCs by secretion of inflammatory exosomes. The implications of this pathological pathway for periodontal disease in vivo is under investigation in mouse models.","Elsayed, Ranya; Elashiry, Mahmoud; Liu, Yutao; El-Awady, Ahmed; Hamrick, Mark; Cutler, Christopher W.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,480,1

New evidence from Chinese provinces,23.667852,7.1836553,2021-07-07,"BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are frequent on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO). Performing routine blood cultures (BCs) may identify early paucisymptomatic BSIs. We investigated the contribution of systematic daily BCs to detect BSIs on V-A ECMO. METHODS: This was a retrospective study including all adult patients requiring V-A ECMO and surviving more than 24 h. Our protocol included routine daily BCs, from V-A ECMO insertion up to 5 days after withdrawal; other BCs were performed on-demand. RESULTS: On the 150 V-A ECMO included, 2146 BCs were performed (1162 routine and 984 on-demand BCs); 190 (9%) were positive, including 68 contaminants. Fifty-one (4%) routine BCs revealed BSIs; meanwhile, 71 (7%) on-demand BCs revealed BSIs (p = 0.005). Performing routine BCs was negatively associated with BSIs diagnosis (OR 0.55, 95% CI [0.38; 0.81], p = 0.002). However, 16 (31%) BSIs diagnosed by routine BCs would have been missed by on-demand BCs. Independent variables for BSIs diagnosis after routine BCs were: V-A ECMO for cardiac graft failure (OR 2.43, 95% CI [1.20; 4.92], p = 0.013) and sampling with on-going antimicrobial therapy (OR 2.15, 95% CI [1.08; 4.27], p = 0.029) or renal replacement therapy (OR 2.05, 95% CI [1.10; 3.81], p = 0.008). Without these three conditions, only two BSIs diagnosed with routine BCs would have been missed by on-demand BCs sampling. CONCLUSIONS: Although routine daily BCs are less effective than on-demand BCs and expose to contamination and inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, a policy restricted to on-demand BCs would omit a significant proportion of BSIs. This argues for a tailored approach to routine daily BCs on V-A ECMO, based on risk factors for positivity.","de Roux, Quentin; Renaudier, Marie; Bougouin, Wulfran; Boccara, Johanna; Fihman, Vincent; Lepeule, Raphaël; Cherait, Chamsedine; Fiore, Antonio; Hemery, François; Decousser, Jean-Winoc; Langeron, Olivier; Mongardon, Nicolas",Crit Care,480,1

Curcumin (CURC) is a natural polyphenol that has anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytoprotective effect of CURC against OTA-induced nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity through the study of the nitrosative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. Sprague Dawley rats were daily treated with CURC (100 mg/kg b.w.), OTA (0.5 mg/kg b.w), or CURC with OTA by oral gavage for 14 days. Our results demonstrated that OTA exposure was associated with significant increase of pro-inflammatory and DNA oxidative-damage biomarkers. Moreover, OTA induced the inducible nitric oxide synthase, (iNOS) resulting in increased nitric oxide (NO) levels both in kidney and liver. The co-treatment OTA + CURC counteracted the harmful effects of chronic OTA treatment by regulating inflammation, reducing NO levels and oxidative DNA damage in kidney and liver tissues. Histology revealed that OTA + CURC treatment determinates mainly an Iba1+ macrophagic infiltration with fewer CD3+ T-lymphocytes in the tissues. In conclusion, we evidenced that CURC exerted cytoprotective and antioxidant activities against OTA-induced toxicity in rats.","Longobardi, Consiglia; Damiano, Sara; Andretta, Emanuela; Prisco, Francesco; Russo, Valeria; Pagnini, Francesco; Florio, Salvatore; Ciarcia, Roberto",Antioxidants (Basel),480,1

Two of the most common long-term conditions, cancer and dementia, both disproportionately affect older adults. However, little is known about the needs and experiences of those living with both conditions, which could inform practice in the area. OBJECTIVES: This focused ethnographic study sought to understand how oncology services balance the unique and complex needs of these patients with those of the service more widely. DESIGN: Focused ethnography. SETTING: Two National Health Service hospital trusts. PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen people with dementia and cancer, 22 relatives and 19 staff members participated. METHODS: Participant observation, informal conversations, semi-structured interviews, and medical notes review. RESULTS: Improved satisfaction and outcomes of care were reported when staff were delivering person-centred care. Staff tried to balance the need for personalised and flexible support for individuals with dementia with managing targets and processes of cancer care and treatment. The importance of continuity of people, places, and processes was consistently highlighted. CONCLUSION: Navigating and managing the delicate balance between the needs of the individual and the needs of services more widely was difficult for both staff and patients. Improved awareness, identification and documentation of dementia would help to ensure that staff are aware of any specific patient needs. Consistency in staffing and appointment locations should develop familiarity and routine for people with dementia.","Griffiths, Alys Wyn; Ashley, Laura; Kelley, Rachael; Cowdell, Fiona; Collinson, Michelle; Mason, Ellen; Inman, Hayley; Henry, Ann; Farrin, Amanda; Surr, Claire",Int J Nurs Stud,480,1

With unprecedented increases in fentanyl in the US drug supply, many Massachusetts (MA) communities have seen a surge in opioid-related overdoses. The objective of this study was to determine factors associated with lifetime and past year NFOD in at-risk MA communities. METHODS: We conducted multiple rapid assessments among people who use drugs (PWUD) in eight MA communities using non-probability sampling (purposive, chain referral, respondent-driven) methods. We collected sociodemographic, substance use, overdose history, substance use treatment, and harm reduction services utilization data. We examined the prevalence of NFOD (lifetime and past year) and identified factors associated with NFOD through multivariable logistic regression analyses in a subset of 469 study participants between 2017 and 2019. RESULTS: The prevalence of lifetime and last year non-fatal opioid overdose was 62.5% and 36.9%, respectively. Many of the study participants reported heroin (64%) and fentanyl (45%) use during the 30 days preceding the survey. Nonprescription buprenorphine and fentanyl use were independently associated with higher odds of lifetime NFOD, while marijuana use was associated with lower odds of lifetime NFOD (p < 0.05). Injection as the route of administration, benzodiazepine, nonprescription buprenorphine, heroin, and fentanyl use were independently associated with higher odds, while methadone use was associated with lower odds of past year NFOD (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We documented a high prevalence of past year and lifetime NFOD among PWUD in MA. Our findings provide indicators that can help inform interventions to prevent overdoses among PWUD, including overdose prevention, medication treatment, and naloxone distribution.","Shrestha, Shikhar; Stopka, Thomas J.; Hughto, Jaclyn M.

The degree of frailty, resilience and number of co-morbidities caused COVID-19 to present as acute geriatric syndrome events such as falls, delirium and dehydration in these patients. Clinical laboratory results considered typical for COVID-19 were present less often in this frail older population. As in other countries, morbidity and mortality is most severe among frail male patients; therefore, assessment of changes suggestive of typical acute geriatric syndromes in frail older patients with chronic diseases should lead to a careful clinical examination for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Yet, there is little data on factors associated with antibiotic use in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of all patients below 2 years of age hospitalized between 2014 and 2018. We compared children with RSV infection to children with FLU infection analyzing clinical characteristics and factors contributing to an increased rate of antimicrobial utilization. RESULTS: RSV infection was diagnosed in 476/573 (83.1%), FLU in 95/573 (16.6%), and RSV-FLU-co-infection in 2/573 (0.3%) patients. Median age was lower for RSV compared to FLU (4 vs. 12 months; p < 0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the rate of antibiotic utilization was comparable between RSV and FLU patients, while for both groups distinct clinical presentation and a high CRP value were associated with higher antibiotic use.","Papan, Cihan; Willersinn, Meike; Weiß, Christel; Karremann, Michael; Schroten, Horst; Tenenbaum, Tobias",BMC Infect Dis,480,16
236896,236896,236896,Heat-related illnesses in a mass gathering event and the necessity for newer diagnostic criteria: a field study,23.682646,7.189763,2021,"Introduction. COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a pandemic infection that has caused significant mortality and economic losses. Potential therapies and prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulphate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulphate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.Aim. To compare outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients ordered to receive hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc sulphate versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone.Methodology. This was a retrospective observational study. Data was collected from medical records for all patients with admission dates ranging from 2 March 2020 through to 11 April 2020. Initial clinical characteristics on presentation, medications given during the hospitalization, and hospital outcomes were recorded. The study included patients admitted to any of four acute care NYU Langone Health Hospitals in New York City. Patients included were admitted to the hospital with at least one positive COVID-19 test and had completed their hospitalization. Patients were excluded from the study if they were never admitted to the hospital or if there was an order for other investigational therapies for COVID-19.Results. Patients taking zinc sulphate in addition to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (n=411) and patients taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone (n=521) did not differ in age, race, sex, tobacco use or relevant comorbidities. The addition of zinc sulphate did not impact the length of hospitalization, duration of ventilation or intensive care unit (ICU) duration. In univariate analyses, zinc sulphate increased the frequency of patients being discharged home, and decreased the need for ventilation, admission to the ICU and mortality or transfer to hospice for patients who were never admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for the time at which zinc sulphate was added to our protocol, an increased frequency of being discharged home (OR 1.53, 95â% CI 1.12-2.09) and reduction in mortality or transfer to hospice among patients who did not require ICU level of care remained significant (OR 0.449, 95â% CI 0.271-0.744).Conclusion. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that zinc sulphate may play a role in therapeutic management for COVID-19.","Carlucci, Philip M; Ahuja, Tania; Petrilli, Christopher; Rajagopalan, Harish; Jones, Simon; Rahimian, Joseph",J Med Microbiol,480,1

Initially appeared in Wuhan, China around December 2019, it had spread to almost 187 countries due to its high contagious nature. Precautionary measures remain the sole obliging tactic to cease the person to person transmissions till any effective method of treatment or vaccine is developed. Amidst the pandemic, research and development of new molecule is labour-intensive and tedious process. Drug repurposing is the concept of identifying therapeutically potent molecule from the library of pre-existing molecules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, 61 molecules that are already being used in clinics or under clinical scrutiny as antiviral agents are surveyed via docking study. Docking study was performed using Maestro interface (Schrödinger Suite, LLC, NY). KEY FINDINGS: Out of these 61 molecules, 37 molecules were found to interact with >2 protein structures of COVID-19. The docking results indicate that amongst the reported molecules, HIV protease inhibitors and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors showed promising features of binding to COVID-19 enzyme. Along with these, Methisazone an inhibitor of protein synthesis, CGP42112A an angiotensin AT2 receptor agonist and ABT450 an inhibitor of the non-structural protein 3-4A might become convenient treatment option as well against COVID-19. SIGNIFICANCE: The drug repurposing approach provide an insight about the therapeutics that might be helpful in treating corona virus disease.","Shah, Bhumi; Modi, Palmi; Sagar, Sneha R",Life Sci,480,2

Objectives: To determine the pattern of injuries amongst tennis players in Accra. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 142 male and female participants selected from tennis clubs in Accra and the Accra sports stadium. A standardised tennis injury report form was used to obtain data from participants. Data on the parts of the body mostly injured and the types of injury mostly sustained by the players were summarised and presented appropriately with the use of graphs and pie charts. Assessment of the causes underlying the prevailing injuries to tennis players was also tabulated and comparisons made. Results: Out of a total of 170 injuries recorded, knee (39 [27.5%]) and shoulder (31 [21.1%]) injuries were the most commonly sustained. Most (80 [56.3%]) tennis injuries occurred during training. Other injuries (26 [18.3%]) occurred during competitions or tournaments whilst 26 (18.3%) occurred during social play. About 10 (7.0%) participants were not certain of the type of activity at the time of injury. The majority (35 [24.65%]) of the players received no treatment for their injuries. However, few of the injuries (20 [14.08%], 14 [9.86%], 6 [4.23%]) sustained were treated by medical personnel, physiotherapists or nurses respectively. There was no association between warm-up before play and cause of injury (p = 0.375). There was also no association between shoe type and cause of injury (p = 0.253). Conclusion: The majority of the injuries occurred in the upper and lower limbs. Most of these injuries occurred during training with overuse and overexertion being the most common cause. Clinical implications: It is important to educate tennis players and coaches on injury prevention measures and the use of protective gear during tennis.","Acquaye, Gabriella; Quartey, Jonathan; Kwakye, Samuel",S Afr J Physiother,480,1

These circumstances are leading to unintended effects such as the increase in the burden of other diseases. Here, using a data-driven epidemiological model for Tuberculosis (TB) spreading, we describe the expected rise in TB incidence and mortality that can be attributable to the impact of COVID-19 on TB surveillance and treatment in four high-burden countries. Our calculations show that the reduction in diagnosis of new TB cases due to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in 824250 (CI 702416-940873) excess deaths in India, 288064 (CI 245932-343311) in Indonesia, 145872 (CI 120734-171542) in Pakistan, and 37603 (CI 27852-52411) in Kenya. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to revert such unflattering TB burden scenarios by increasing the pre-covid diagnosis capabilities at least a 75% during 2 to 4 years. This would prevent almost all TB-related excess mortality caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which will be observed if nothing is done to prevent it. Our work therefore provides guidelines for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis epidemic in the years to come.","Tovar, Mario; Aleta, Alberto; Sanz, Joaquin; Moreno, Yamir",,480,4

Among all the economic indicators, the stock market indexes are particularly important, because the stock markets anticipate the future economic change and reflect investor confidence and thus may be the barometer of the overall economy. The Chinese and US stock markets are the most important stock markets. Because New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) have the greatest market cap worldwide. And Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) can obviously show the conditions of economy in the mainland of China and East Asia. We collected the daily increase or decrease indexes of the U.S. and China stock markets to study their relationships and how they are affected by the pandemic. To study this problem, this paper uses three methods, including Local Similarity Analysis (LSA), Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Markov chain. We calculate the correlation between the U.S. stock indexes and China stock indexes with LSA and analyze the possible factors which lead to these correlations. LASSO is used to find out other economic indexes which affect the U.S. and China stock markets and test whether these indexes can predict the trend of future markets. Lastly, Markov chains can be used to analyze the effects of the day to the next day transmission in stock markets. We find that there is a high correlation between the U.S. and the China stock using LSA, especially, from Jan.10 to Feb.10. We find that Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSEC) and NASDAQ are correlated to the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index (S&P500) in the US market. S&P500, confirmed cases of COVID-2019 in China (Chinese cases), USD to CNY exchange rate are correlated to the SSEC in the Chinese market. Using these indexes, the future indexes of the U.S. stock market can be predicted at a PCC correlation, the highest is 0.44 and the lowest is 0.24 for the China market. LASSO shows that the U.S. market can be more accurately predicted by the indexes. The estimated Markov models of the two stock markets are pretty similar, i.e. the probability that the value of the U.S. stocks increases two days in a row is 13.40% and the Chinese market is 11.34%. To sum up, we find that the two stock markets are highly correlated under the Covid-19 pandemic despite from some differences.","Yang, Jinyu Jia Ziyi Mao Yunxiang",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,480,22

We investigated if an interaction existed between vitamin D levels and social deprivation in those with and without COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Upper or lower respiratory tract samples from 104 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in accordance with Public Health England criteria (January-May 2020) using RT-PCR. The latest serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D(25-OHD) levels, quantified by LC-MS/MS, was obtained for each patient (September 2019-April 2020). Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was generated for each patient. Univariate and logistic regression analyses examined associations between age, gender, 25-OHD, IMD score and SARS-CoV-2 result in the total cohort and subgroups. RESULTS: In the total cohort, a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was significantly associated with lower 25-OHD levels and higher IMD. A positive test was associated with higher IMD in the male subgroup and with lower 25-OHD levels in those aged >72 years. Low 25-OHD and IMD quintile 5 were separately associated with positive COVID-19 outcome in the cohort. Patients in IMD quintile 5 with vitamin D levels &#8804; 34.4 nmol/L were most likely to have a positive COVID-19 outcome, even more so if aged >72 years (OR: 19.07, 95%CI: 1.71-212.25; P = .016). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, combined low vitamin D levels and higher social deprivation were most associated with COVID-19 infection. In older age, this combination was even more significant. Our data support the recommendations for normalising vitamin D levels in those with deficient / insufficient levels and in groups at high risk for deficiency.","Livingston, Mark; Plant, Aiden; Dunmore, Simon; Hartland, Andrew; Jones, Stephen; Laing, Ian; Ramachandran, Sudarshan",Int J Clin Pract,480,24

In the absence of a vaccine, or an approved effective therapeutic, there is an intense interest in repositioning available drugs or designing small molecule antivirals. In this context, in silico modelling has proven to be an invaluable tool. An important target is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), involved in processing translated viral proteins. Peptidomimetic &#945;-ketoamides represent prototypical inhibitors of Mpro. A recent attempt at designing a compound with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties has resulted in the synthesis and evaluation of the &#945;-ketoamide 13b analogue. Here, we performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to further characterize the interaction of &#945;-ketoamide 13b with the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We included the widely used antibiotic, amoxicillin, for comparison. Our findings indicate that &#945;-ketoamide 13b binds more tightly (predicted GlideScore = -8.7 and -9.2â¯kcal/mol for protomers A and B, respectively), to the protease active site compared to amoxicillin (-5.0 and -4.8â¯kcal/mol). Further, molecular dynamics simulations highlight the stability of the interaction of the &#945;-ketoamide 13b ligand with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (&#916;G = -25.2 and -22.3â¯kcal/mol for protomers A and B). In contrast, amoxicillin interacts unfavourably with the protease (&#916;G = +32.8â¯kcal/mol for protomer A), with unbinding events observed in several independent simulations. Overall, our findings are consistent with those previously observed, and highlight the need to further explore the &#945;-ketoamides as potential antivirals for this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Liang, Julia; Pitsillou, Eleni; Karagiannis, Chris; Darmawan, Kevion K; Ng, Ken; Hung, Andrew; Karagiannis, Tom C",Comput Biol Chem,480,16

Lacking scientific evidence, a very stringent but safer policy was imposed on liver transplantation (LT) early in the pandemic. Restrictive transplant guidelines must be reevaluated and adjusted as data become available. Before LT, the prevailing policy requires a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of donors and recipients. Unfortunately, prolonged viral RNA shedding frequently hinders transplantation. Recent data reveal that positive test results for viral genome are frequently due to noninfectious and prolonged convalescent shedding of viral genome. Moreover, studies demonstrated that the cycle threshold of quantitative RT-PCR could be leveraged to inform clinical transplant decision-making. We present an evidence-adjusted and significantly less restrictive policy for LT, where risk tolerance is tiered to recipient acuity. In addition, we delineate the pretransplant clinical decision-making, intra- and postoperative management, and early outcome of 2 recipients of a liver graft performed while their RT-PCR of airway swabs remained positive. Convalescent positive RT-PCR results are common in the transplant arena, and the proposed policy permits reasonably safe LT in many circumstances.","Raveh, Yehuda; Simkins, Jacques; Vianna, Rodrigo; Tekin, Akin; Nicolau-Raducu, Ramona",Transplant. proc,480,16

Although atherosclerotic risk factors have been reported in severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the exact mechanisms are unclear. The mortality associated with the COVID-19 outbreak is increased by comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cardiovascular disease. Besides, older individuals and smokers have significantly worse outcomes. Interestingly, these comorbidities and risk factors are consistent with the pathophysiology that causes vascular endothelial glycocalyx damage. Moreover, vascular glycocalyx dysfunction causes microvascular leakage, which results in interstitial pulmonary abnormal shadows (multiple patchy shadows with a ground glass inter-pneumonic appearance). This is frequently followed by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), closely related to coagulo-fibrinolytic changes contributing to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, as well as inducing activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to thromboembolism and multiple organ failure. Notably, SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, binds to ACE2, which is abundantly present not only in human epithelia of the lung and the small intestine, but also in vascular endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells. Moreover, COVID-19 can induce severe septic shock, and sepsis can easily lead to systemic degradation of the vascular endothelial glycocalyx. In the current review, we propose new concepts and therapeutic goals for COVID-19-related vascular endothelial glycocalyx damage, based on previous vascular endothelial medicine research.","Yamaoka-Tojo, Minako",Biomed J,480,16

We built the correlation network of 26 stock indices and implemented in-sample and out-of-sample tests to evaluate the predictive power of VIX, VSTOXX, and VXJ implied volatility indices. To measure markets' synchronization, we use the Minimum Spanning Tree length and the length of the Planar Maximally Filtered Graph. Our results indicate a high predictive power of all the volatility indices, both individually and together, though the VIX predominates over the evaluated options. We find that an increase in the markets' volatility expectations, captured by the implied volatility indices, is a good Granger predictor of an increase in the synchronization of returns in the following month. Estimating, monitoring, and predicting returns' synchronization is essential for investment decision-making, especially for diversification strategies and regulating financial systems.","Magner, Nicolás; Lavin, Jaime F; Valle, Mauricio; Hardy, Nicolás",PLoS One,480,1

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, an essential factor in viral pathogenesis, is recognized as a prospective therapeutic target in drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2. To tackle this pandemic, Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs are being screened against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro via in silico and in vitro methods to detect the best conceivable drug candidates. However, identification of natural compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro potential have been recommended as rapid and effective alternative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic development. Thereof, a total of 653 natural compounds were identified against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro from NP-lib database at MTi-OpenScreen webserver using virtual screening approach. Subsequently, top four potential compounds, i.e. 2,3-Dihydroamentoflavone (ZINC000043552589), Podocarpusflavon-B (ZINC000003594862), Rutin (ZINC000003947429) and Quercimeritrin 6""-O-L-arabinopyranoside (ZINC000070691536), and co-crystallized N3 inhibitor as reference ligand were considered for stringent molecular docking after geometry optimization by DFT method. Each compound exhibited substantial docking energy >-12 kcal/mol and molecular contacts with essential residues, including catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) and substrate binding residues, in the active pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro against N3 inhibitor. The screened compounds were further scrutinized via absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion - toxicity (ADMET), quantum chemical calculations, combinatorial molecular simulations and hybrid QM/MM approaches. Convincingly, collected results support the potent compounds for druglikeness and strong binding affinity with the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Here we report that suramin, a 100-year-old drug, is a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and acts by blocking the binding of RNA to the enzyme. In biochemical assays, suramin and its derivatives are at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the currently approved nucleotide drug for treatment of COVID-19. The 2.6 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the viral RdRp bound to suramin reveals two binding sites. One site directly blocks the binding of the RNA template strand and the other site clashes with the RNA primer strand near the RdRp catalytic site, thus inhibiting RdRp activity. Suramin blocks viral replication in Vero E6 cells, although the reasons underlying this effect are likely various. Our results provide a structural mechanism for a nonnucleotide inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.","Yin, Wanchao; Luan, Xiaodong; Li, Zhihai; Zhou, Ziwei; Wang, Qingxing; Gao, Minqi; Wang, Xiaoxi; Zhou, Fulai; Shi, Jingjing; You, Erli; Liu, Mingliang; Wang, Qingxia; Jiang, Yi; Jiang, Hualiang; Xiao, Gengfu; Zhang, Leike; Yu, Xuekui; Zhang, Shuyang; Eric Xu, H",Nat Struct Mol Biol,480,24

The suspected contribution of thrombotic events to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients has prompted a search for novel potential options for preventing COVID-19-associated thrombotic disease. In this article by the Global COVID-19 Thrombosis Collaborative Group, we describe novel dosing approaches for commonly used antithrombotic agents (especially heparin-based regimens) and the potential use of less widely used antithrombotic drugs in the absence of confirmed thrombosis. Although these therapies may have direct antithrombotic effects, other mechanisms of action, including anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects, have been postulated. Based on survey results from this group of authors, we suggest research priorities for specific agents and subgroups of patients with COVID-19. Further, we review other agents, including immunomodulators, that may have antithrombotic properties. It is our hope that the present document will encourage and stimulate future prospective studies and randomized trials to study the safety, efficacy, and optimal use of these agents for prevention or management of thrombosis in COVID-19.","Bikdeli, Behnood; Madhavan, Mahesh V; Gupta, Aakriti; Jimenez, David; Burton, John R; Der Nigoghossian, Caroline; Chuich, Taylor; Nouri, Shayan Nabavi; Dreyfus, Isaac; Driggin, Elissa; Sethi, Sanjum; Sehgal, Kartik; Chatterjee, Saurav; Ageno, Walter; Madjid, Mohammad; Guo, Yutao; Tang, Liang V; Hu, Yu; Bertoletti, Laurent; Giri, Jay; Cushman, Mary; Quéré, Isabelle; Dimakakos, Evangelos P; Gibson, C Michael; Lippi, Giuseppe; Favaloro, Emmanuel J; Fareed, Jawed; Tafur, Alfonso J; Francese, Dominic P; Batra, Jaya; Falanga, Anna; Clerkin, Kevin J; Uriel, Nir; Kirtane, Ajay; McLintock, Claire; Hunt, Beverley J; Spyropoulos, Alex C; Barnes, Geoffrey D; Eikelboom, John W; Weinberg, Ido; Schulman, Sam; Carrier, Marc; Piazza, Gregory; Beckman, Joshua A; Leon, Martin B; Stone, Gregg W; Rosenkranz, Stephan; Goldhaber, Samuel Z; Parikh, Sahil A; Monreal, Manuel",Thromb. haemost,480,33

Moreover, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 disease, was associated with hyperferritinemia and unfavorable prognosis in older individuals, suggesting virus-induced ferrosenescence. We have previously defined ferrosenescence as an iron-associated disruption of both the human genome and its repair mechanisms, leading to premature cellular senescence and neurodegeneration. As viruses replicate more efficiently in iron-rich senescent cells, they may have developed the ability to induce this phenotype in host tissues, predisposing to both immune dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorders. In this mini-review, we summarize what is known about the SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular senescence and iron dysmetabolism.

In Brazil, however, this is not the case for most medical schools, considering Brazilian social inequality and uneven access to technology. Recently, the Covid-19 pandemic has also challenged Universities to seek and make a transition toward more effective methods of full-time online education. Thus, the main goal of this work was to verify student's perception and academic performance, assessed upon VM implementation in a Brazilian Medical School. Ribeirao Preto Medical School students answered a 26-question survey with regards to optical microscopy (OM) and VM. Academic performance was compared between participants that were (year of 2019) or were not (year of 2015) exposed to VM. Taken the results together, subjective impressions such as handling, suitability, learning effectiveness, and pleasure using the tools, have shown a higher score for virtual microscopy (median = 29), when compared to optical microscopy (median = 24) with a P-value < 0.001 by Wilcoxon rank test, upon measurement using an ordinal scale.

A group of experts recently proposed strategies that have compelling rationales and are well grounded in behavioral science. However, their approaches may sometimes be unacceptable, impractical, and/or unsuccessful. Therefore, other strategies will be greatly needed to address vaccine hesitancy. The present commentary offers 8 additional promising approaches forming a framework known as PANDEMIC. This acronym stands for the following strategies: presumptive language, asking for advice, norms on an anonymous level, description of favorable attributes, emphasizing clinicians' own experiences, mandated choice, images, and communication of risk. Each of the strategies is discussed in turn. Many of the proposed strategies have empirical support for achieving desired outcomes in other domains. However, the PANDEMIC framework is untested in regard to increasing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations. Therefore, the strategies should be carefully evaluated before they are widely disseminated through public health announcements, email distribution lists, electronic health record messages, and other outlets.","Stevens, Jack",Am J Manag Care,480,10

However, little evidence exists regarding the correct timing for the execution of the swab test, especially in asymptomatic individuals and healthcare workers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze changes over time of individual SARS-CoV-2 swab test positivity during a health surveillance program. METHODS: The study was conducted on 2,071 healthcare workers at the University Hospital of Verona, with a known date of close contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected case, between February 29, and April 17, 2020. The healthcare workers underwent a health surveillance program with repeated swab tests to track their virological status. A generalized additive mixed model was used to investigate how the probability of a positive test result changes over time, since the last known close contact date, in the overall sample of individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and in the subset of individuals with a first negative swab result before proving positive in order to test different surveillance time intervals. RESULTS: Among the 2,071 healthcare workers under study, 191 (9.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 103 (54%) were asymptomatic with no sex or age differences. In 49 (25.7%) cases the first swab after the close contact was negative. Sex, age, symptoms, and time of sampling were not different between individuals with a first negative swab and those who initially tested positive after the close contact. In the overall sample, the estimated probability to test positive was 0.74 on day 1 after the close contact, increasing to 0.77, between days 5 and 8. In the three different scenarios to scheduled repeated testing intervals (3, 5, and 7 days) in the subgroup of individuals with an initially negative swab, the probability peak was on the sixth, ninth and tenth, and 13th and 14th days, respectively.

One of the proteins' expression regulation mechanisms is based on the activity of the microRNA (miRNA) molecules, small non-coding RNAs, the most important function of which is the post-transcriptional negative regulation of gene expression. The study was aimed to investigate the mechanisms of the interactions between miRNA isoforms and ACE2/TMPRSS2 genes in the colon tissues known for the high level of expression of the described enzymes. The search for interactions was performed using the correlation analysis applied to the publicly available paired mRNA/miRNA sequencing data of colon tissues. Among the others, such miRNAs as miR-30c and miR-200c were identified known for their involvement in the coronavirus infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome pathogenesis. Thus, new potential mechanisms for the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 enzymes regulation were ascertained, as well as their possible functional activity in a cell infected with coronavirus.","Nersisyan, S.

Our results emphasize the importance of diminishing the inter-group infections in the effort of substantial flattening and delaying of the epi(demiologic) curve with concomitant mitigation of disastrous economy and social consequences. To exemplify with a limiting case, splitting a population into m (say, 5 or 10) noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields a stretched epidemiologic curve having the maximum number of daily infections reduced and postponed in time by the same factor $m$ (5 or 10). More generally, our study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling between them. This strategy can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g., large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools, (seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdwon strategy, the proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone.","Baldea, Ioan",,480,1

These cells are usually defective for many normal activities or functions due to significant genetic and epigenetic changes. Normal primary cell yields and viability from any original tissue specimens are usually relatively low or highly variable. These normal cells cease after a few passages or population doublings due to very limited proliferative capacity. Animal models (ferret, mouse, etc.) are often used to study virus-host interaction. However, viruses usually need to be adapted to the animals by several passages due to tropism restrictions including viral receptors and intracellular restrictions. Here we summarize applications of conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs), long-term cultures of normal airway epithelial cells from human nose to lung generated by conditional cell reprogramming (CR) technology, as an ex vivo model in studies of emerging viruses. CR allows to robustly propagate cells from non-invasive or minimally invasive specimens, for example, nasal or endobronchial brushing. This process is rapid (2 days) and conditional. The CRCs maintain their differentiation potential and lineage functions, and have been used for studies of adenovirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, parvovirus, and SARS-CoV. The CRCs can be easily used for air-liquid interface (ALI) polarized 3D cultures, and these coupled CRC/ALI cultures mimic physiological conditions and are suitable for studies of viral entry including receptor binding and internalization, innate immune responses, viral replications, and drug discovery as an ex vivo model for emerging viruses.","Liu, Xuefeng; Wu, Yuntao; Rong, Lijun",Virol Sin,480,14

The effectiveness of IM to promote neurodevelopment in preterm infants has been proved, but studies on infants with early brain damage are still lacking. The main aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability and usability of IM, carried out by parents at home, on infants at high risk for Cerebral Palsy. An IM daily diary and an ad hoc questionnaire, called Infant Massage Questionnaire Parent-Infant Experiences (IMQPE), were developed. IMQPE consisted of a total of 30 questions, divided into 5 areas. The parents were trained to carry out the IM with a home-based course, conducted by an expert therapist. The intensive IM program was set according to a defined daily length of at least 20 min, with a frequency of at least 5 days per week for a total of 8 weeks. Data collection consisted in the selection of the variables around the characteristics, both of the infants and the mothers, IM dosage and frequency, different body parts of the infants involved and IMQPE scores. Variable selection was carried out by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) over all possible variable subsets. Nineteen high-risk infants, aged 4.83 ± 1.22 months, received IM at home for 8 weeks. The massage was given by the infants' mothers with a mean daily session dose of 27.79 ± 7.88 min and a total of 21.04 ± 8.49 h. 89.74% and 100% of mothers performed the IM for the minimum daily dosage and the frequency recommended, respectively.

Method: Articles were identified through a literature search until 31 May 2021, in PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Results: Sixty-three studies were included. To date, most studies showed that the viral mutations, especially the D614G variant, correlate with a higher infectivity than the wild-type virus. However, the evidence of the association between viral mutation and severity of the disease is scant. A SARS-CoV-2 variant with a 382-nucleotide deletion was associated with less severe infection in patients. The 11,083G > U mutation was significantly associated with asymptomatic patients. By contrast, ORF1ab 4715L and S protein 614G variants were significantly more frequent in patients from countries where high fatality rates were also reported. The current evidence showed that variants of concern have led to increased infectivity and deteriorating epidemiological situations. However, the relation between this variant and severity of COVID-19 infection was contradictory. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread worldwide.

They are produced by most cells and can be detected in several body fluids, having a huge potential in therapeutic and diagnostic approaches. EVs produced by infected cells usually have a molecular signature that is very distinct from healthy cells. For intracellular pathogens like viruses, EVs can have an even more complex function, since the viral biogenesis pathway can overlap with EV pathways in several ways, generating a continuum of particles, like naked virions, EVs containing infective viral genomes and quasi-enveloped viruses, besides the classical complete viral particles that are secreted to the extracellular space. Those particles can act in recipient cells in different ways. Besides being directly infective, they also can prime neighbor cells rendering them more susceptible to infection, block antiviral responses and deliver isolated viral molecules. On the other hand, they can trigger antiviral responses and cytokine secretion even in uninfected cells near the infection site, helping to fight the infection and protect other cells from the virus. This protective response can also backfire, when a massive inflammation facilitated by those EVs can be responsible for bad clinical outcomes. EVs can help or harm the antiviral response, and sometimes both mechanisms are observed in infections by the same virus. Since those pathways are intrinsically interlinked, understand the role of EVs during viral infections is crucial to comprehend viral mechanisms and respond better to emerging viral diseases.","Martins, Sharon de Toledo; Alves, Lysangela Ronalte",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,480,24

In this single center case series, we characterized the initial clinical presentation in 180 patients with mild COVID-19 and defined the earliest predictors of subsequent deterioration and need for hospitalization. Three broad patient phenotypes and four symptom clusters were characterized, differentiated by varying risk for adverse outcomes. Among 14 symptoms assessed, subjective shortness of breath (SOB) most strongly associated with adverse outcomes (odds ratio (OR) 21.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.7–166.4; p < 0.0001). In combination, SOB and number of comorbidities were highly predictive of subsequent hospitalization (area under the curve (AUC) 92%). Additionally, initial lymphopenia (OR 21.0, 95% CI: 2.1–210.1; p = 0.002) and male sex (OR 3.5, 95% CI: 0.9–13.0; p = 0.05) were associated with increased risk of poor outcomes.

We identified 6 cohort studies and 5 clinical trials involving 2367 subjects treated with ruxolitinib (N = 3) or baricitinib 45 (N = 8). Use of JAK-inhibitors decreased use of invasive mechanical ventilation (RR = 0.63; [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.47, 0.84]; P = 0.002) and had borderline impact on rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR = 0.24 [0.06, 1.02]; P = 0.05) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; RR = 0.50 [0.19, 1.33]; P = 0.16).

The existing literature has established that the efficacy and specificity of MST relies on the reinforcement of auditory-motor functional connectivity in related brain networks. However, to date, no study has attempted to evaluate the underlying cortical network nodes that are key to the efficacy of MST post-stroke. In this case series, we evaluated changes in connectivity within the auditory-motor network and changes in upper extremity function following a 3-week intensive piano training in two stroke survivors presenting different levels of motor impairment. Connectivity was assessed pre- and post-training in the α- and the β-bands within the auditory-motor network using magnetoencephalography while participants were passively listening to a standardized melody. Changes in manual dexterity, grip strength, movement coordination, and use of the upper extremity were also documented in both stroke survivors. After training, an increase in the clinical measures was accompanied by enhancements in connectivity between the auditory and motor network nodes for both the α- and the β-bands, especially in the affected hemisphere. These neurophysiological changes associated with the positive effects of post-stroke MST on motor outcomes delineate a path for a larger scale clinical trial.","Ghai, Shashank; Maso, Fabien Dal; Ogourtsova, Tatiana; Porxas, Alba-Xifra; Villeneuve, Myriam; Penhune, Virginia; Boudrias, Marie-Hélène; Baillet, Sylvain; Lamontagne, Anouk",Brain Sci,480,28

In general, modified live products have been superior to inactivated vaccines for dogs. It can be expected that recombinant and/or DNA vaccines may dominate the market in the future. Although most vaccines on the market are safe and efficacious, there have been exceptions where disease was induced by vaccination or dogs were not protected. The failure of protection may in part be due to variations in individual vaccine batches. Only potency tests but not efficacy tests are required, which may not be sufficient. For example, a virus titer in a vaccine may be meaningless if the minimum protective dose is not known. Overattenuated virus (e.g., CDV-Ond or parvovirus in cat cells) may have a high titer in tissue culture but is not immunogenic. The question of frequency of vaccination of dogs should be addressed. Annual revaccinations for CDV, CPV, and CAV are probably not needed. However, it would be desirable to collect more data to support less frequent vaccinations. Annual immunization for bacterial diseases such as kennel cough, Lyme disease, and leptospirosis should continue. It also would be desirable to develop more oro/nasal vaccines, perhaps combined with newly developed vectors that are less likely to induce undesirable side effects that may be seen after parenteral vaccination. Finally a word of warning against homeopathic ""nosodes"" to replace tested canine vaccines. They will appear highly effective as long as the majority of dogs remain vaccinated.

National, European and International societies provided recommendations on how to safely perform endoscopic procedures during the current pandemic. Until now, the effect of the current pandemic on tertiary endoscopy centers has not been reported. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this was to analyze the influence of the early SARS-CoV2-pandemic on endoscopic care and work flow in 2 European tertiary endoscopy units. METHODS: Data from 2 tertiary endoscopy units (Katowice and Munich) were retrospectively collected during the early pandemic and compared to an equivalent pre-pandemic period. Data include procedures, complications, benchmarks, and influence on endoscopy training. RESULTS: During the early pandemic, we noted a highly significant decrease (49.1%) in the overall number of all endoscopies with a significant increase in therapeutic procedures. Besides, there were no significant differences in the number of urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or interventional endoscopic ultrasound procedures. The exceptional situation reduced endoscopic procedures performed by trainees significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV2-pandemic halved the endoscopy service of 2 tertiary centers while maintaining an urgent therapeutic service. Recommended personal safety measures in endoscopy proved to be efficient and safe in preventing SARS-CoV2 infection of staff or spreading. Unnecessarily, the SARS-CoV2 pandemic prevented routine endoscopy training.","Zorniak, Michal; Sirtl, Simon; Mahajan, Ujjwal Mukund; Stubbe, Hans-Christian; Chapula, Mateusz; Wosiewicz, Piotr; Hartleb, Marek; Mayerle, Julia; Schulz, Christian",Dig Dis,480,24

We therefore investigated the epidemiology of recurrent COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Among patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 11 and July 31, 2020 within an integrated healthcare system, we identified patients with a recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay ≥60 days after an initial positive test. To assign an overall likelihood of COVID-19 recurrence, we combined quantitative data from initial and recurrent positive RT-PCR cycle thresholds—a value inversely correlated with viral RNA burden— with a clinical recurrence likelihood assigned based on independent, standardized case review by two physicians. “Probable” or “possible” recurrence by clinical assessment was confirmed as the final recurrence likelihood only if a cycle threshold value obtained ≥60 days after initial testing was lower than its preceding cycle threshold or if the patient had an interval negative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Among 23,176 patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, 1,301 (5.6%) had at least one additional SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs assay ≥60 days later. Of 122 testing positive, 114 had sufficient data for evaluation. The median interval to the recurrent positive RT-PCR was 85.5 (IQR 74–107) days. After combining clinical and RT-PCR cycle threshold data, four patients (3.5%) met criteria for probable COVID-19 recurrence. All four exhibited symptoms at recurrence and three required a higher level of medical care compared to their initial diagnosis. After including six additional patients (5.3%) with possible recurrence, recurrence incidence was 4.3 (95% CI 2.1–7.9) cases per 10,000 COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Only 0.04% of all COVID-19 patients in our health system experienced probable or possible recurrence; 90% of repeat positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs were not consistent with true recurrence. Our pragmatic approach combining clinical and quantitative RT-PCR data could aid assessment of COVID-19 reinfection or reactivation by clinicians and public health personnel.","Peltan, Ithan D.; Beesley, Sarah J.; Webb, Brandon J.; Lopansri, Bert K.; Sinclair, Will; Jacobs, Jason R.; Brown, Samuel M.",PLoS One,480,20

Recently, ELISA binding cross-reactivity against components of human epidemic coronaviruses with currently available intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF (5% and 10%) have been reported. In this study, the same products were tested for neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their potential as an antiviral therapy. Methods The neutralization capacity of six selected lots of IVIG was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 (two different isolates), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in cell cultures. Infectivity neutralization was measured by determining the percent reduction in plaque-forming units (PFU) and by cytopathic effects for two IVIG lots in one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neutralization was quantified using the plaque reduction neutralization test 50 (PRNT50) in the PFU assay and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the cytopathic/cytotoxic method (calculated as the minus log10 dilution which reduced the viral titer by 50%). Results All IVIG preparations showed neutralization of both SARS-CoV-2 isolates, ranging from 79 to 89.5% with PRNT50 titers from 4.5 to >5 for the PFU method and ranging from 47.0%-64.7% with an IC50 ~1 for the cytopathic method. All IVIG lots produced neutralization of SARS-CoV ranging from 39.5 to 55.1 % and PRNT50 values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3. No IVIG preparation showed significant neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. Conclusion In cell culture neutralization assays, the tested IVIG products contain antibodies with significant cross-neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. However, no neutralization capacity was demonstrated against MERS-CoV. These preparations are currently available and may be immediately useful for COVID-19 management.","Díez, José-María; Romero, Carolina; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Belló-Perez, Melissa; Rodon, Jordi; Honrubia, José Manuel; Segalés, Joaquim; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis; Gajardo, Rodrigo",bioRxiv,480,1

Skeletal muscle damage in COVID-19 may be due to direct infection by the virus SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor, systemic hyper-inflammatory state with cytokine release and homeostatic perturbation, an autoimmune process, or myotoxic drugs. Disclosing the cause of weakness in an individual patient is therefore difficult. Case Description: We report two patients, who survived typical COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care treatment and who developed early on myalgia and severe proximal weakness in all four limbs. Laboratory exams revealed elevated serum creatine kinase and markedly increased C-reactive protein and interleukin 6, concurring with a systemic inflammatory response. On admission in neurorehabilitation (4 and 7 weeks after COVID-19 onset, respectively), the patients presented with proximal flaccid tetraparesis and limb-girdle muscle atrophy. Motor nerve conduction studies showed decreased amplitude and prolonged duration of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) with normal distal motor latencies and normal conduction velocities in median and ulnar nerves. Needle electromyography in proximal muscles revealed spontaneous activity in one and myopathic changes in both patients. Discussion: Clinical, laboratory, and electrodiagnostic findings in these patients were unequivocally consistent with myopathy. Interestingly, increased distal CMAP duration has been described in patients with critical illness myopathy (CIM) and reflects slow muscle fiber conduction velocity due to membrane hypo-excitability, possibly induced by inflammatory cytokines. By analogy with CIM, the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related myopathy might also depend on hyperinflammation and metabolic pathways that may affect muscles in a pathophysiological continuum from hypo-excitability to necrosis.","Versace, Viviana; Sebastianelli, Luca; Ferrazzoli, Davide; Saltuari, Leopold; Kofler, Markus; Löscher, Wolfgang; Uncini, Antonino",Front Neurol,480,1

This study assesses the knowledge and practices of obstetricians and midwives about personal protective equipment (PPE), their risk perception of COVID-19 and satisfaction with the preventive measures adopted at their workplace. METHODS: A questionnaire, designed according to the World Health Organization’s advice on rational use of personal protective equipment for COVID-19, was administered to 452 Pakistani maternity care providers between 1 July and 30 July 2020. RESULTS: Only 32% of pregnant women had a good compliance to their routine antenatal drugs while forgetfulness (27.2%) and vomiting as a side effect of a drug (25.7%) were the major barriers to compliance with routine drugs. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant association between respondents’ compliance with antenatal drugs and number of children as well as level of income (p<0.001). No statistically significant association was found between education level and compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses and other health workers should support pregnant women to set reminders for taking their medications and prescribe alternative dosage forms or products that will not induce vomiting. In addition, antenatal education should emphasize the benefits of adherence to routine taking of medications at every stage of pregnancy and the possible negative consequences of non-compliance.","Izhar, Rubina; Husain, Samia; Tahir, Muhammad A.; Husain, Sonia",Eur J Midwifery,480,8

The aim of the present study was to examine whether first-phase ejection fraction (EF1), the ejection fraction measured in early systole up to the time of peak aortic velocity, a sensitive measure of preclinical heart failure, is associated with survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. A retrospective outcome study was performed in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent echocardiography (n=380) at the West Branch of the Union Hospital, Wuhan, China and in patients admitted to King’s Health Partners in South London, United Kingdom. Association of EF1 with survival was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. EF1 was compared in patients with COVID-19 and in historical controls with similar comorbidities (n=266) who had undergone echocardiography before the COVID-19 pandemic. In patients with COVID-19, EF1 was a strong predictor of survival in each patient group (Wuhan and London). In the combined group, EF1 was a stronger predictor of survival than other clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic characteristics including age, comorbidities, and biochemical markers. A cutoff value of 25% for EF1 gave a hazard ratio of 5.23 ([95% CI, 2.85–9.60]; P<0.001) unadjusted and 4.83 ([95% CI, 2.35–9.95], P<0.001) when adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, hs-cTnI (high-sensitive cardiac troponin), and CRP (C-reactive protein). EF1 was similar in patients with and without COVID-19 (23.2±7.3 versus 22.0±7.6%, P=0.092, adjusted for prevalence of risk factors and comorbidities). Impaired EF1 is strongly associated with mortality in COVID-19 and probably reflects preexisting, preclinical heart failure.","Gu, Haotian; Cirillo, Chiara; Nabeebaccus, Adam A.; Sun, Zhenxing; Fang, Lingyun; Xie, Yuji; Demir, Ozan; Desai, Nishita; He, Lin; Lü, Qing; Nakou, Eleni; O’Gallagher, Kevin; Tountas, Christos; Marvaki, Apostolia; Monaghan, Mark; Perera, Divaka; Pericao, Ana; Ryan, Matthew; Sinclair, Hannah; Stylianidis, Vasileios; Victor, Kelly; Wang, Bin; Wang, Jing; Wang, Rui; Wu, Chun; Yang, Yali; Yuan, Hongliang; Zhang, Danqing; Zhang, Yongxing; Faconti, Luca; Papachristidis, Alexandros; Zhang, Li; Carr-White, Gerald; Shah, Ajay M.; Xie, Mingxing; Chowienczyk, Phil",Hypertension,480,15

Three hundred fifty-four blood samples longitudinally obtained from 81 IgG-seroconverting progressed coronavirus disease 2019 (CoVID-19) patients were quantified for spike 1 (S1), S2, and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific IgM, IgA, IgG, and total Ig antibodies using a microarray, 11 different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)/chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs), and 1 rapid test by seven manufacturers. The assays’ specificity was assessed in 130 non-CoVID-19 pneumonia patients. Using the microarray, NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies continuously displayed higher detection rates during acute CoVID-19 than S1- and S2-specific ones. S1-specific IgG antibodies, however, reached higher peak values. Until the 26th day post-symptom onset, all patients developed IgG responses against S1, S2, and NCP. Although detection rates by ELISAs/CLIAs generally resembled those of the microarray, corresponding to the target antigen, sensitivities and specificities varied among all tests. Notably, patients with more severe CoVID-19 displayed higher IgG and IgA levels, but this difference was mainly observed with S1-specific immunoassays. In patients with high SARS-CoV-2 levels in the lower respiratory tract, we observed high detection rates of IgG and total Ig immunoassays with a particular rise of S1-specific IgG antibodies when viral concentrations in the tracheal aspirate subsequently declined over time. In summary, our study demonstrates that differences in sensitivity among commercial immunoassays during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are only partly related to the target antigen. Importantly, our data indicate that NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies are detected earlier, while higher S1-specific IgA antibody levels occur in severely ill patients.","Semmler, Georg; Traugott, Marianna Theresia; Graninger, Marianne; Hoepler, Wolfgang; Seitz, Tamara; Kelani, Hasan; Karolyi, Mario; Pawelka, Erich; Aragón de La Cruz, Sara; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth; Aberle, Stephan Walter; Stiasny, Karin; Zoufaly, Alexander; Aberle, Judith Helene; Weseslindtner, Lukas",J Clin Microbiol,480,24

There are concerns that these behaviors and mental symptoms have significantly increased during the current Covid-19 pandemic, partly because academic life has changed considerably from face-to-face communication to e-learning and studying at home. Self-regulation and physical activity are hard to maintain during pandemic lockdowns. Short activity breaks could be helpful to avoid physical inactivity and sustain mental health. The breaks should comprise short and easy-implementable physical activity exercises that can be integrated into the learning context. Moreover, cognitive interventions, such as writing about positive events and feelings might help as coping strategy for self-regulation during study breaks. This study investigated and compared the effects of a physical activity intervention and a cognitive intervention (positive expressive writing) on mental health among university students. Both interventions are particularly suitable for use at home. N = 20 university students, studying in Germany, were assigned to a physical activity group or a cognitive intervention group. The physical activity intervention consisted of a mix of physical exercises including endurance exercises, muscular strength, relaxation, and ballroom dance movements. The interventions were carried out guided, once a week, for 5–10 mins at the beginning of classes. The effects of group × time showed no significant interaction on self-reported perceived stress, mood, quality of life (QoL) assessed online and compared at the beginning of the term before the intervention (T0) and at the end of the term after the intervention (T3). However, the physical activity group reported a similar physical activity level per day over time, while the cognitive intervention group showed a decrease in physical activity from T0 to T3. Low-dose, short physical activity interventions as well as cognitive interventions consisting of positive expressive writing could buffer university students' perceived stress, mood, and QoL across the term. Moreover, both interventions seem to be promising in buffering the negative side effects of stress during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Marschin, Verena; Herbert, Cornelia",Front Psychol,480,5

Early reports identify protective roles for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS We leveraged our bioinformatics binding prediction tools for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I and HLA-II alleles that were developed using mass spectrometry-based profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict peptide binding to diverse allele sets. We applied these binding predictors to viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family and specifically focused on T cell epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We assayed a subset of these epitopes in a T cell induction assay for their ability to elicit CD8+ T cell responses. RESULTS We first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then utilized our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,897 HLA-I and 8046 HLA-II candidate peptides which were highly ranked for binding across 13 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. These peptides are predicted to provide over 99% allele coverage for the US, European, and Asian populations. From our SARS-CoV-2-predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 374 pairs identically matched what was previously reported in the ViPR database, originating from other coronaviruses with identical sequences. Of these pairs, 333 (89%) had a positive HLA binding assay result, reinforcing the validity of our predictions. We then demonstrated that a subset of these highly predicted epitopes were immunogenic based on their recognition by specific CD8+ T cells in healthy human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Finally, we characterized the expression of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in virally infected cells to prioritize those which could be potential targets for T cell immunity. CONCLUSIONS Using our bioinformatics platform, we identify multiple putative epitopes that are potential targets for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whose HLA binding properties cover nearly the entire population. We also confirm that our binding predictors can predict epitopes eliciting CD8+ T cell responses from multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Protein expression and population HLA allele coverage, combined with the ability to identify T cell epitopes, should be considered in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design strategies and immune monitoring.","Poran, Asaf; Harjanto, Dewi; Malloy, Matthew; Arieta, Christina M; Rothenberg, Daniel A; Lenkala, Divya; van Buuren, Marit M; Addona, Terri A; Rooney, Michael S; Srinivasan, Lakshmi; Gaynor, Richard B",Genome medicine,480,30

In order to effectively target government responses, it is critical to identify the individuals most at risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), developing severe clinical signs, and mortality. We undertook a systematic review of the literature to present the current status of scientific knowledge in these areas and describe the need for unified global approaches, moving forwards, as well as lessons learnt for future pandemics. METHODS: Medline, Embase and Global Health were searched to the end of April 2020, as well as the Web of Science. Search terms were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. Comparative studies of risk factors from any setting, population group and in any language were included. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened by two reviewers and extracted in duplicate into a standardised form. Data were extracted on risk factors for COVID-19 disease, severe disease, or death and were narratively and descriptively synthesised. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and thirty-eight papers were identified post-deduplication. Thirty-three met our inclusion criteria, of which 26 were from China. Six assessed the risk of contracting the disease, 20 the risk of having severe disease and ten the risk of dying. Age, gender and co-morbidities were commonly assessed as risk factors. The weight of evidence showed increasing age to be associated with severe disease and mortality, and general comorbidities with mortality. Only seven studies presented multivariable analyses and power was generally limited. A wide range of definitions were used for disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of literature generated in the short time since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 has been considerable. Many studies have sought to document the risk factors for COVID-19 disease, disease severity and mortality; age was the only risk factor based on robust studies and with a consistent body of evidence. Mechanistic studies are required to understand why age is such an important risk factor. At the start of pandemics, large, standardised, studies that use multivariable analyses are urgently needed so that the populations most at risk can be rapidly protected.

Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. We further used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The N protein was found to be conserved in the more pathogenic strains (SARS/MERS/COVID-19), but not in the other human coronaviruses that mostly cause mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8–10) were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets provide new strategies for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development.","Ong, Edison; Wong, Mei U; Huffman, Anthony; He, Yongqun",bioRxiv,480,3

It has been proven that converting large-scale public venues such as stadiums and exhibition centres into Fangcang shelter hospitals, which serve as hospitals for isolation, treatment and disease monitoring of patients with mild symptoms, is the most effective way to control virus transmission and reduce mortality. This paper presents some experiences learnt from treating COVID-19 in Wuhan, the first city to report the outbreak and which suffered from a shortage of emergency supplies, heavy workload among staff and a shortage of hospital beds during the early stages of the pandemic. The experiences include location, accessibility, spacious outdoor area, spacious indoor space, power supply, architectural layout design and partition isolation, ventilation, sewage, and problems in the construction and management of Fangcang shelter hospitals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional approaches to disaster preparedness have demonstrated intrinsic problems, such as poor economic performance, inefficiency and lack of flexibility. Converting large-scale public venues into Fangcang shelter hospitals is an important means to rapidly improve the function of the city’s healthcare system during a pandemic. This valuable experience in Wuhan will help other countries in their battle against the current COVID-19 pandemic and will also contribute to disaster preparedness and mitigation in the future.","Fang, Dongping; Pan, Shengjie; Li, Zaishang; Yuan, Ting; Jiang, Benran; Gan, Di; Sheng, Bai; Han, Jing; Wang, Tao; Liu, Zhongmin",BMJ Glob Health,480,16

We have surveyed those structures to catch the occasional errors that could be significant for those important uses and for which we were able to provide demonstrably higher-accuracy corrections. This process relied on new validation and correction methods such as CaBLAM and ISOLDE, not yet in routine use. We found such important and correctable problems in seven early SARS-CoV-2 structures. Two of the structures were soon superseded by new higher-resolution data, confirming our proposed changes. For the other five, we emailed the depositors a documented and illustrated report, and encouraged them to make the model corrections themselves and use the new option at the worldwide Protein Data Base for depositors to re-version their coordinates without changing the PDB code. This quickly and easily makes the better-accuracy coordinates available to anyone who examines or downloads their structure, even before formal publication. The changes have involved sequence misalignments, incorrect RNA conformations near a bound inhibitor, incorrect metal ligands, and cis-trans or peptide flips that prevent good contact at interaction sites. These improvements have propagated into nearly all related structures done afterward. This process constitutes a new form of highly rigorous peer review, which is actually faster and more strict than standard publication review, because it has access to coordinates and maps; journal peer review would also be strengthened by such access.","Croll, Tristan I.; Williams, Christopher J.; Chen, Vincent B.; Richardson, David C.; Richardson, Jane S.",Biophys J,480,1

However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of these inflammatory conditions inducing apoptosis of thymic epithelial cells (TECs), the main components of the thymus, remain largely unknown. In the circulation, mature dendritic cells (mDCs), the predominant initiator of innate and adaptive immune response, can migrate into the thymus. Herein, we demonstrated that mDCs were able to directly inhibit TECs proliferation and induce their apoptosis by activating the Jagged1/Notch3 signaling pathway. Intrathymic injection of either mDCs or recombinant mouse Jagged1-human Fc fusion protein (rmJagged1-hFc) into mice resulted in acute atrophy of the thymus. Furthermore, DAPT, a γ-secretase inhibitor, reversed the effects induced by mDC or rmJagged1-hFc. These findings suggest that acute or aging-related thymus degeneration can be induced either by mass migration of circulating mDCs in a short period of time or by a few but constantly homing mDCs.","Wu, Haojie; Li, Xiaohan; Zhou, Chen; Yu, Qihong; Ge, Shiyao; Pan, Zihui; Zhao, Yangjing; Xia, Sheng; Zhou, Xiaoming; Liu, Xia; Wang, Hui; Shao, Qixiang",Cell Death Discov,480,24

Since its origin in China in December 2019, there is compelling evidence that novel SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible virus, and it is associated to a broad clinical spectrum going from subclinical presentation to severe respiratory distress and multiorgan failure. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a cellular receptor that allows it to infect different host cells and likely disrupts renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system homeostasis. Particularly, a considerable incidence of many renal abnormalities associated to COVID-19 has been reported, including proteinuria, hematuria, and acute kidney injury. Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect podocytes and tubular epithelial cells, which could contribute to the development of the aforementioned renal abnormalities. In this review, we discuss the biological aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, how understanding current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection may partly explain the involvement of the kidneys in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and what questions have arisen and remain to be explored.","Martinez-Rojas, Miguel Angel; Vega-Vega, Olynka; Bobadilla, Norma A.",Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,480,12

Kinocardiography (KCG) combines these techniques by measuring 12 degrees-of-freedom of body motion produced by myocardial contraction and blood flow through the cardiac chambers and major vessels. The integral of kinetic energy (iK) obtained from the linear and rotational SCG/BCG signals, and automatically computed over the cardiac cycle, is used as a marker of cardiac mechanical function. The present work systematically evaluated the test–retest (TRT) reliability of KCG iK derived from BCG/SCG signals in the short term (<15 min) and long term (3–6 h) on 60 healthy volunteers. Additionally, we investigated the difference of repeatability with different body positions. First, we found high short-term TRT reliability for KCG metrics derived from SCG and BCG recordings. Exceptions to this finding were limited to metrics computed in left lateral decubitus position where the TRT reliability was moderate-to-high. Second, we found low-to-moderate long-term TRT reliability for KCG metrics as expected and confirmed by blood pressure measurements. In summary, KCG parameters derived from BCG/SCG signals show high repeatability and should be further investigated to confirm their use for cardiac condition longitudinal monitoring.","Hossein, Amin; Rabineau, Jérémy; Gorlier, Damien; Del Rio, Jose Ignacio Juarez; van de Borne, Philippe; Migeotte, Pierre-François; Nonclercq, Antoine",Sensors (Basel),480,23

The aim of this study was to determine the possible renoprotective effect of the antioxidant raloxifene on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cisplatin-induced acute renal injury was established in female C57 mice that were treated with saline (normal control) or raloxifene over a 7-day period. The body weight of the mice was recorded. Histopathological examinations of the kidney tissues were performed using H&E, PAS staining and TEM. The histomorphology of liver and other organs was observed by H&E staining. The serum levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alanine transaminase (ALT) and glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (AST) were analyzed by specific kits. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) activity, and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the kidney, liver homogenates and HK-2 cells were measured by WST-8 and thiobarbituric acid colorimetric methods. Moreover, the mitochondrial structures of HK-2 cells were performed using TEM. The viability and proliferation of HK-2 cells were examined by CCK-8 and EdU incorporation assays. The mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by JC-1 fluorescence. RESULTS: Raloxifene significantly reduced the levels of serum creatinine, urea, ALT and AST in the cisplatin-treated mice, and alleviated cisplatin-induced renal and hepatic tissue injury. Furthermore, raloxifene also increased the activity of GSH and SOD in the renal tissues and HK-2 cells, and reduced MDA levels, thereby limiting oxidative stress in the kidney. CONCLUSION: Raloxifene protected against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by activating the antioxidant system, along with alleviating liver damage. It should be considered as a potential adjuvant in cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic protocols.","An, Jian-Hong; Li, Chun-Yan; Chen, Chun-Ya; Wu, Jian-Bin; Shen, Hong",Onco Targets Ther,480,23

DATA SOURCES: Published experimental studies and clinical papers that address varied aspects of ventilator-induced lung injury pathogenesis and its consequences. STUDY SELECTION: Published information relevant to the novel hypothesis of progressive lung vulnerability and to the biophysical responses of lung injury and repair. DATA EXTRACTION: None. DATA SYNTHESIS: In acute respiratory distress syndrome, the reduced size and capacity for gas exchange of the functioning “baby lung” imply loss of ventilatory capability that dwindles in proportion to severity of lung injury. Concentrating the entire ventilation workload and increasing perfusion to these already overtaxed units accentuates their potential for progressive injury. Unlike static airspace pressures, which, in theory, apply universally to aerated structures of all dimensions, the components of tidal inflation that relate to power (which include frequency and flow) progressively intensify their tissue-stressing effects on parenchyma and microvasculature as the ventilated compartment shrinks further, especially during the first phase of the evolving injury. This “ventilator-induced lung injury vortex” of the shrinking baby lung is opposed by reactive, adaptive, and reparative processes. In this context, relatively little attention has been paid to the evolving interactions between lung injury and response and to the timing of interventions that worsen, limit or reverse a potentially accelerating ventilator-induced lung injury process. Although universal and modifiable drivers hold the potential to progressively injure the functional lung units of acute respiratory distress syndrome in a positive feedback cycle, measures can be taken to interrupt that process and encourage growth and healing of the “baby lung” of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Marini, John J.; Gattinoni, Luciano",Crit Care Med,480,23

The influenza A virus genome consists of negative sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA. Influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on two surface antigens known as hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The main problem with influenza A viruses infecting humans is drug resistance, which is caused by antigenic changes. A few antiviral drugs are available, but the most popular is the neuraminidase inhibitor — oseltamivir. The resistance against this drug has probably developed through antigenic drift by a point mutation in one amino acid at position 275 (H275Y). In order to prevent a possible influenza pandemic it is necessary to develop fast diagnostic tests. The aim of this project was to develop a new test for detection of influenza A virus and determination of oseltamivir resistance/sensitivity in humans. Detection and differentiation of oseltamivir resistance/sensitivity of influenza A virus was based on real-time PCR. This test contains two TaqMan probes, which work at different wavelengths. Application of techniques like multiplex real-time PCR has greatly enhanced the capability for surveillance and characterization of influenza viruses.

In particular, H5 and H7 haemagglutinin subtypes can evolve from low to highly pathogenic strains in gallinaceous poultry. Ducks on the other hand are a natural reservoir for these viruses and are able to withstand most avian influenza strains. RESULTS: Transcriptomic sequencing of lung and ileum tissue samples from birds infected with high (H5N1) and low (H5N2) pathogenic influenza viruses has allowed us to compare the early host response to these infections in both these species. Chickens (but not ducks) lack the intracellular receptor for viral ssRNA, RIG-I and the gene for an important RIG-I binding protein, RNF135. These differences in gene content partly explain the differences in host responses to low pathogenic and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in chicken and ducks. We reveal very different patterns of expression of members of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) gene family in ducks and chickens. In ducks, IFITM1, 2 and 3 are strongly up regulated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza, where little response is seen in chickens. Clustering of gene expression profiles suggests IFITM1 and 2 have an anti-viral response and IFITM3 may restrict avian influenza virus through cell membrane fusion. We also show, through molecular phylogenetic analyses, that avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 genes have been subject to both episodic and pervasive positive selection at specific codons. In particular, avian IFITM1 showed evidence of positive selection in the duck lineage at sites known to restrict influenza virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together these results support a model where the IFITM123 protein family and RIG-I all play a crucial role in the tolerance of ducks to highly pathogenic and low pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses when compared to the chicken.

Here, we show a comprehensive profile of antibody, B cell and T cell dynamics over time in a cohort of patients who have recovered from mild-moderate COVID-19. Binding and neutralising antibody responses, together with individual serum clonotypes, decay over the first 4 months post-infection. A similar decline in Spike-specific CD4(+) and circulating T follicular helper frequencies occurs. By contrast, S-specific IgG(+) memory B cells consistently accumulate over time, eventually comprising a substantial fraction of circulating the memory B cell pool. Modelling of the concomitant immune kinetics predicts maintenance of serological neutralising activity above a titre of 1:40 in 50% of convalescent participants to 74 days, although there is probably additive protection from B cell and T cell immunity. This study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 immunity after infection might be transiently protective at a population level.

However, this has been difficult to quantify at the population level due to a lack of reliably defined seroreactivity thresholds. Using an orthogonal antibody testing approach, we estimated that about 0.6% of nontriaged adults from the greater Vancouver, Canada, area between May 17 and June 19, 2020, showed clear evidence of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, after adjusting for false-positive and false-negative test results. Using a highly sensitive multiplex assay and positive/negative thresholds established in infants in whom maternal antibodies have waned, we determined that more than 90% of uninfected adults showed antibody reactivity against the spike protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from SARS-CoV-2. This seroreactivity was evenly distributed across age and sex, correlated with circulating coronaviruses’ reactivity, and was partially outcompeted by soluble circulating coronaviruses’ spike. Using a custom SARS-CoV-2 peptide mapping array, we found that this antibody reactivity broadly mapped to spike and to conserved nonstructural viral proteins.

Here, we show that the classical measure of path length fails to define network connectedness and node centrality for complex contagions. Centrality measures and seeding strategies based on the classical definition of path length frequently misidentify the network features that are most effective for spreading complex contagions.

In this paper, a comprehensive review on developed home-based rehabilitation technologies of the last 10 years (2011–2020), categorizing them into upper and lower limb devices and considering both commercialized and state-of-the-art realms. Mechatronic, control, and software aspects of the system are discussed to provide a classified roadmap for home-based systems development. Subsequently, a conceptual framework on the development of smart and intelligent community-based home rehabilitation systems based on novel mechatronic technologies is proposed. In this framework, each rehabilitation device acts as an agent in the network, using the internet of things (IoT) technologies, which facilitates learning from the recorded data of the other agents, as well as the tele-supervision of the treatment by an expert. The presented design paradigm based on the above-mentioned leading technologies could lead to the development of promising home rehabilitation systems, which encourage stroke survivors to engage in under-supervised or unsupervised therapeutic activities.","Akbari, Aylar; Haghverd, Faezeh; Behbahani, Saeed",Front Robot AI,480,1

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained at that time was concerning for allergic fungal sinusitis. Unfortunately, the patient’s referral to ophthalmology was delayed due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. On presentation to ophthalmology one year later, the patient had clinically deteriorated with significant visual and olfactory loss. She underwent emergent endoscopic sinus surgery by otolaryngology with histological analysis of the sinus debris confirming allergic fungal sinusitis. This is a unique case demonstrating the devastating impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on patient care for an otherwise treatable condition.

Quick and accurate diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes is essential to avoid fatal events, for timely intervention, and to improve the prognosis. Objective To prospectively investigate the feasibility and accuracy of a smartwatch in recording multiple electrocardiographic (ECG) leads and detecting ST-segment changes associated with acute coronary syndromes compared with a standard 12-lead ECG. Design, Setting, and Participants A commercially available smartwatch was used in 100 participants to obtain multiple-channel ECGs. The study was conducted from April 19, 2019, to January 23, 2020. Fifty-four patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, 27 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and 19 healthy individuals were included in the study. The watch was placed in different body positions to obtain 9 bipolar ECG tracings (corresponding to Einthoven leads I, II, and III and precordial leads V1-V6) that were compared with a simultaneous standard 12-lead ECG. Main Outcomes and Measures The concordance among the results of the smartwatch and standard ECG recordings was assessed using the Cohen κ coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. Results Of the 100 participants in the study, 67 were men (67%); mean (SD) age was 61 (16) years. Agreement was found between the smartwatch and standard ECG for the identification of a normal ECG (Cohen κ coefficient, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78-1.00), ST-segment elevation changes (Cohen κ coefficient, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.97), and non-ST-segment elevation changes (Cohen κ coefficient, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96). In addition, the Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated agreement between the smartwatch and standard ECG to detect the amplitude of ST-segment changes (bias, -0.003; SD, 0.18; lower limit, -0.36; and upper limit, 0.36). Use of the smartwatch ECG for the diagnosis of normal ECG showed a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI, 60%-97%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI, 95%-100%); for ST elevation, sensitivity was 93% (95% CI, 82%-99%) and specificity was 95% (95% CI, 85%-99%); and for NSTE ECG alterations, sensitivity was 94% (95% CI, 81%-99%) and specificity was 92% (95% CI, 83%-97%). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this study suggest agreement between the multichannel smartwatch ECG and standard ECG for the identification of ST-segment changes in patients with acute coronary syndromes.","Spaccarotella, Carmen Anna Maria; Polimeni, Alberto; Migliarino, Serena; Principe, Elisa; Curcio, Antonio; Mongiardo, Annalisa; Sorrentino, Sabato; De Rosa, Salvatore; Indolfi, Ciro",JAMA cardiology,480,1

Citizens are required to show the health code on their smartphones when using public transport. However, many seniors are not allowed to use public transport due to their difficulties in obtaining health codes, leading to widespread debates about these unfair events. Traditionally, public perceptions and attitudes toward such unfair events are investigated using analytical methods based on interviews or questionnaires. This study crawled seven-month messages from Sina Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, and developed a hybrid approach integrating term-frequency–inverse-document-frequency, latent Dirichlet allocation, and sentiment classification. Results indicate that a rumor about the unfair treatment of elderly travelers triggered public concerns. Primary subjects of concern were the status quo of elderly travelers, the provision of transport services, and unfair event descriptions. Following the government’s responses, people still had negative attitudes toward transport services, while they became more positive about the status quo of elderly travelers. These findings will guide government authorities to explore new forms of automated social control and to improve transport policies in terms of equity and fairness in future pandemics.","Liu, Xinghua; Ye, Qian; Li, Ye; Fan, Jing; Tao, Yue",Int J Environ Res Public Health,480,24

In response to systemic disparities in SARS-CoV2 testing and COVID-19 infections, health systems, city leaders and community stakeholders in Worcester, Massachusetts created a citywide Equity Task Force with a specific goal of making low-barrier testing available to individuals throughout our community. Within months, the state of Massachusetts announced the Stop the Spread campaign, a state-funded testing venture. With this funding, and through our community-based approach, our team tested more than 48,363 individuals between August 3, 2020 and February 28, 2021. Through multiple PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) cycles, we optimized our process to test close to 300 individuals per hour. Our positivity rate ranged from 1.5% with our initial testing events to a high of 13.4% on January 6, 2021. During the challenges of providing traditional inpatient and ambulatory care during the pandemic, our health system, city leadership, and community advocacy groups united to broaden the scope of care to include widespread, population-based SARS-CoV2 testing.

The clinical utility and prognostic value of echocardiography in COVID-19 inpatients is not clearly defined. We aim to identify echocardiographic parameters that are associated with 30-day clinical outcomes secondary to COVID-19 hospitalization. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a large tertiary hospital in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. It included 214 adult inpatients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab and had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed during the index hospitalization. Primary outcome was 30-day all-cause inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day utilization of mechanical ventilator support, vasopressors, or renal replacement therapy. RESULTS: Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction (odds ratio (OR): 3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63–7.57, p = 0.001), moderate to severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction (OR: 7.30, 95% CI: 2.20–24.25, p = 0.001), pulmonary hypertension (OR: 5.39, 95% CI: 1.96–14.86, p = 0.001), and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (OR: 3.92, 95% CI: 1.71–9.03, p = 0.001) were each associated with increased odds of 30-day all-cause inpatient mortality. Pulmonary hypertension and moderate to severe right ventricular dysfunction were each associated with increased odds of 30-day utilization of mechanical ventilator support and vasopressors. CONCLUSIONS: Right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation were associated with increased odds for 30-day inpatient mortality.

Bats have been recognized as reservoirs for several emerging viral pathogens, and are unique among mammals in their vagility, potential for long-distance dispersal, and often very large, colonial populations. We investigate the relative influences of host ecology and population genetic structure for predictions of viral richness in relevant reservoir species. We test the hypothesis that host geographic range area, distribution, population genetic structure, migratory behavior, International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) threat status, body mass, and colony size, are associated with known viral richness in bats. We analyze host traits and viral richness in a generalized linear regression model framework, and include a correction for sampling effort and phylogeny. We find evidence that sampling effort, IUCN status, and population genetic structure correlate with observed viral species richness in bats, and that these associations are independent of phylogeny. This study is an important first step in understanding the mechanisms that promote viral richness in reservoir species, and may aid in predicting the emergence of viral zoonoses from bats.","Turmelle, Amy S.; Olival, Kevin J.",Ecohealth,480,23

We investigated fear and depression among adults in Cameroon during different phases of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: An online survey was conducted in Cameroon from June–December 2020 using a structured questionnaire. Socio-demographic data and information regarding COVID-19 history were obtained. Fear and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Fear of COVID-19 score (FCV-19S) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. Responses were clustered in weeks to better appreciate their evolution over time. RESULTS: Overall, 7381 responses from all ten regions of Cameroon were analysed (median age: 30 years, 73.3% male). The prevalence of depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10) was 8.4%, and that of high fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S scores ≥19) was 57.4%. These rates were similar across genders, age-groups, and region of residence. While mean weekly PHQ-9 scores remained fairly stable throughout the study period (range: 2.53–3.21; p = 0.101), mean FCV-19S scores were highest during the early weeks but decreased significantly thereafter (from 20.31 to 18.34; p < 0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that having a postgraduate degree, a history of quarantine, flu-like symptoms during the past 14 days, and higher FCV-19S scores were associated with more severe depressive symptoms, while obtaining COVID-19 information from various sources reduced the odds for depression. CONCLUSION: Depression amidst the COVID-19 crisis is less prevalent in Cameroon than in other countries. Prompt and widespread dissemination of adequate COVID-19 information may reduce the risks for depression by dispelling fear and anxiety among Cameroonians.","Siewe Fodjo, Joseph Nelson; Ngarka, Leonard; Njamnshi, Wepnyu Y.; Nfor, Leonard N.; Mengnjo, Michel K.; Mendo, Edwige Laure; Angwafor, Samuel A.; Atchou Basseguin, Jonas Guy; Nkouonlack, Cyrille; Njit, Edith N.; Ahidjo, Nene; Chokote, Eric S.; Dema, Fidèle; Fonsah, Julius Y.; Tatah, Godwin Y.; Palmer, Nancy; Seke Etet, Paul F.; Palmer, Dennis; Nsagha, Dickson S.; Etya’ale, Daniel E.; Perrig, Stephen; Sztajzel, Roman; Annoni, Jean-Marie; Zoung-Kanyi Bissek, Anne-Cécile; Leke, Rose G.

In this study, the changes in clinical practice occurred in an orthopaedic center in Milan are described. METHODS: Number and type of admissions, outpatients cancelled and preserved, emergency room, and intensive care unit activities have been analyzed in the timeframe of seven weeks since the beginning of the pandemic (from February 24th to April 10th) and compared with the same period in 2019. RESULTS: The planned surgical admissions declined from 2172 in 2019 to 664 in 2020 (69.42%, p < 0.0001), while emergencies increased from 158 to 268 (69.62%). The rehabilitation admissions declined from 414 to 69 (83.33%). The overall admission decreased by 63.52%, the trend showed a drop in the last weeks. Surgery performed in the COVID-19 operating room increased by 16.7% in the last week. Seven deaths occurred (0.7% of all orthopaedics and trauma admissions) compared with four (0.1%) which happened in the same period in 2019 (p = 0.004). Six of these patients were suffering from COVID-19. A total of 23,580 outpatients (93.8%) were cancelled. Emergency room consultations declined by 68.14% and 63.47% among white and green priority, respectively, while increased by 25% and 100% among yellow and red, respectively. CONCLUSION: These numbers show the radical changed scenario in an orthopaedic center in Milan during COVID-19 pandemic. Elective surgery declined rapidly going close to zero, outpatient admissions were restricted to cases that cannot be postponed, while emergencies increased due to the role played by the hospital as referral orthopaedic centre during the pandemic. The still ongoing emergency will have important impacts on the overall orthopaedic healthcare management for the next months.","Zagra, Luigi; Faraldi, Martina; Pregliasco, Fabrizio; Vinci, Anna; Lombardi, Giovanni; Ottaiano, Immacolata; Accetta, Riccardo; Perazzo, Paolo; D’Apolito, Rocco",Int Orthop,480,17

Though mass vaccination will certainly help in reducing number of COVID-19 patients, an effective therapeutic measure must be available too. Intravenous remdesivir (RDV) was the first drug receiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of COVID-19. However, in a pandemic like COVID-19, it is essential that drug formulations are readily available, affordable and convenient to administer to every patient around the globe. In this study, we have developed a Self-injectable extended release subcutaneous injection of Remdesivir (SelfExRem) for the treatment of COVID-19. As opposed to intravenous injection, extended release subcutaneous injection has the benefits of reducing face-to-face contact, minimizing hospitalization, reducing dosing frequency and reducing overall health care cost. SelfExRem was developed using a biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), dissolved in a biocompatible vehicle. Six different batches were formulated using 2 different grades of low molecular weight PLGA and 3 different PLGA concentration. The force of injection of various polymeric solutions through 23–30-gauge needles were analyzed using a TA.XTplus texture analyzer. The time required for injection was evaluated both manually and by using an autoinjector. In vitro release of all the batches were carried out in 1% v/v tween 80 in phosphate buffer saline. The study indicated that SelfExRem developed with 15% w/v PLGA (75:25) provided a steady release of drug for 48 h and may be a breakthrough approach for the treatment of COVID-19.","Patki, Manali; Palekar, Siddhant; Reznik, Sandra; Patel, Ketan",Int J Pharm,480,22

METHODS: This study is a longitudinal single-arm cohort study conducted in China between May 1 and July 31, 2020. Seventy-two pregnant patients with Covid-19 participated in follow-up surveys until 3 months after giving birth (57 cases) or having abortion (15 cases). We collected data from medical records regarding Covid-19, delivery or abortion, testing results of maternal and neonatal specimens, and questionnaires of quarantine, mother–baby separation, feeding, and measuring of mothers’ mental disorders and infants’ neurobehavioral disorders. RESULTS: All cases infected in the first trimester and 1/3 of cases infected in the second trimester had an abortion to terminate the pregnancy. 22.2% of pregnant patients were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression at 3 months after delivery or induced abortion. Among 57 live births, only one neonate was positive of nucleic acid testing for throat swab, but negative in repeated tests subsequently. The median duration of mother–baby separation was 35 days (interquartile range 16 to 52 days). After the termination of maternal quarantine, 49.1% of mothers chose to prolong the mother–baby separation (median 8 days; IQR 5 to 23 days). The breastfeeding rate was 8.8% at 1 week after birth, 19.3% at the age of 1 month, and 36.8% at the age of 3 months, respectively. The proportion of “monitoring” and “risk” in the social–emotional developmental domain at the age of 3 months was 22.7% and 63.6%, respectively. After the adjustment of preterm, neonatal sex, admitted to NICU, and the mother’s Covid-19 condition, the negative associations were significantly identified (p < 0.05) between mother–baby separation days and three developmental domains: communication, gross motor, and personal–social. CONCLUSIONS: There is no definite evidence on vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to control infection risk, researchers and healthcare providers should pay more attention to maternal mental health and infant’s feeding, closeness with parents, and early development.","Wang, Yuanyuan; Chen, Lian; Wu, Tianchen; Shi, Huifeng; Li, Qin; Jiang, Hai; Zheng, Danni; Wang, Xiaoli; Wei, Yuan; Zhao, Yangyu; Qiao, Jie",BMC Med,480,26

Almost half of the participants (49.7%) reported the presence of insomnia and more than half (50.3%) experienced increased stress levels. Scores on the Athens Insomnia Scale correlated positively with Perceived Stress Scale scores (p < 0.01), and negatively with Family Support Scale scores (p < 0.01). Significantly negative correlations were observed among scores on the Perceived Stress Scale and the Family Support Scale (p < 0.01). The regression models revealed that ‘scores on Perceived Stress Scale’ and ‘years of work experience’ were significant predictors of ‘scores on Athens Insomnia Scale’, each explaining 43.6% and 2.3% of the variance. ‘Scores on Athens Insomnia Scale’ and ‘scores on Family Support Scale’ were significant predictors of ‘scores on Perceived Stress Scale’, explaining 43.7% and 9.2% of the variance. In conclusion, we confirmed that working with COVID-19 patients has a negative impact on the sleep of nurses, possibly mediated by increased levels of stress. Family support, as a protective factor, appears to moderate the deleterious consequences of stress.","Tselebis, Athanasios; Lekka, Dimitra; Sikaras, Christos; Tsomaka, Effrosyni; Tassopoulos, Athanasios; Ilias, Ioannis; Bratis, Dionisios; Pachi, Argyro",Healthcare (Basel),480,16

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended prioritization of HCP for COVID-19 vaccination to maintain provision of critical services and reduce spread of infection in health care settings (2). Early distribution of two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) to HCP allowed assessment of the effectiveness of these vaccines in a real-world setting. A test-negative case-control study is underway to evaluate mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic illness among HCP at 33 U.S. sites across 25 U.S. states. Interim analyses indicated that the VE of a single dose (measured 14 days after the first dose through 6 days after the second dose) was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74%-87%), adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. The adjusted VE of 2 doses (measured ≥7 days after the second dose) was 94% (95% CI = 87%-97%). VE of partial (1-dose) and complete (2-dose) vaccination in this population is comparable to that reported from clinical trials and recent observational studies, supporting the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic disease in adults, with strong 2-dose protection.","Pilishvili, Tamara; Fleming-Dutra, Katherine E.; Farrar, Jennifer L.; Gierke, Ryan; Mohr, Nicholas M.; Talan, David A.; Krishnadasan, Anusha; Harland, Karisa K.; Smithline, Howard A.; Hou, Peter C.; Lee, Lilly C.; Lim, Stephen C.; Moran, Gregory J.; Krebs, Elizabeth; Steele, Mark; Beiser, David G.; Faine, Brett; Haran, John P.; Nandi, Utsav; Schrading, Walter A.; Chinnock, Brian; Henning, Daniel J.; LoVecchio, Frank; Nadle, Joelle; Barter, Devra; Brackney, Monica; Britton, Amber; Marceaux-Galli, Kaytlynn; Lim, Sarah; Phipps, Erin C.; Dumyati, Ghinwa; Pierce, Rebecca; Markus, Tiffanie M.; Anderson, Deverick J.; Debes, Amanda K.; Lin, Michael; Mayer, Jeanmarie; Babcock, Hilary M.; Safdar, Nasia; Fischer, Marc; Singleton, Rosalyn; Chea, Nora; Magill, Shelley S.; Verani, Jennifer; Schrag, Stephanie; Yousaf, Anna; Chung, Yunmi; Onukwube, Jennifer; Xing, Wei; Clinansmith, Bradley; Uribe, Lisandra; Poronsky, Kye E.; Hashimoto, Dean M.; Bahamon, Monica; St. Romain, Michelle; Kean, Efrat; Stubbs, Amy; Roy, Sara; Volturo, Gregory; Galbraith, James; Crosby, James C.; Fuentes, Megan R.; Mulrow, Mary; Lee, Jane; Johnston, Helen; Hansen, AmberJean; Fridkin, Scott K.; Wilson, Lucy E.; Lovett, Sara; Christian, Melissa; Myers, Christopher; Ocampo, Valerie L.S.; Talbot, Keipp; Seidelman, Jessica; Milstone, Aaron M.; Hayden, Mary; Samore, Matthew; Kwon, Jennie H.; Shirley, Daniel; Dillard, Denise; Dobson, Jennifer",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,480,6

Medical masks are made of synthetic materials, mainly polypropylene, and a majority of them are produced in China and imported to the European market. The urgency of the need has so far prevailed over environmental considerations. OBJECTIVE: Assess the environmental impact of different strategies for the use of face mask. METHOD: A prospective analysis was conducted to assess the environmental impact of different strategies for the use of medical and community masks. Eight scenarios, differentiating the typologies of masks and the modes of reuse are compared using three environmental impact indicators: the Global Warming Potential (GWP100), the ecological scarcity (UBP method, from German ‘Umweltbelastungpunkte’) and the plastic leakage (PL). This study attempts to provide clear recommendations that consider both the environmental impact and the protective effectiveness of face masks used in the community. RESULTS: The environmental impact of single-use masks is the most unfavourable, with a GWP of 0.4–1.3 kg CO(2) eq., depending on the transport scenario, and a PL of 1.8 g, for a 1 month protection against COVID-19. The use of home-made cotton masks and prolonged use of medical masks through wait-and-reuse are the scenarios with the lowest impact. CONCLUSION: The use of medical masks with a wait and reuse strategy seems to be the most appropriate when considering both environmental impact and effectiveness. Our results also highlight the need to develop procedures and the legal/operational framework to extend the use of protective equipment during a pandemic.","Bouchet, Alexandre; Boucher, Julien; Schutzbach, Kevin; Senn, Nicolas; Genton, Blaise; Vernez, David",BMJ Open,480,16

The extended durations of these closures present unique challenges, as many families rely on the school as a source of physical activity, mental health services, psychosocial support, child care, and food security. While the school doors may be closed, the school nurse can still play a vital role in emergency management. This article discusses challenges and proposes solutions to maintaining student health and wellness during extended school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it is inevitable that until a vaccine for coronavirus is developed and readily available, many schools will continue to see future closures, though likely for shorter periods of time, as they respond to local outbreaks.","Rothstein, Rachel; Olympia, Robert P.",NASN Sch Nurse,480,16

The current study addressed whether prior experience with disease epidemics among the spine surgeon community had an impact on preparedness and response toward COVID-19. METHODS: A 73-item survey was distributed to spine surgeons worldwide via AO Spine. Questions focused on: demographics, COVID-19 preparedness, response, and impact. Respondents with and without prior epidemic experience (e.g., SARS, H1NI, MERS) were assessed on preparedness and response via univariate and multivariate modeling. Results of the survey were compared against the Global Health Security Index. RESULTS: Totally, 902 surgeons from 7 global regions completed the survey. 24.2% of respondents had prior experience with global health crises. Only 49.6% reported adequate access to personal protective equipment. There were no differences in preparedness reported by respondents with prior epidemic exposure. Government and hospital responses were fairly consistent around the world. Prior epidemic experience did not impact the presence of preparedness guidelines. There were subtle differences in sources of stress, coping strategies, performance of elective surgeries, and impact on income driven by prior epidemic exposure. 94.7% expressed a need for formal, international guidelines to help mitigate the impact of the current and future pandemics. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to note that prior experience with infectious disease crises did not appear to help spine surgeons prepare for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based on survey results, the GHSI was not an effective measure of COVID-19 preparedness. Formal international guidelines for crisis preparedness are needed to mitigate future pandemics.","Weiner, Joseph A.; Swiatek, Peter R.; Johnson, Daniel J.; Louie, Philip K.; Harada, Garrett K.; McCarthy, Michael H.; Germscheid, Niccole; Cheung, Jason P.

Within the first 2 weeks after release, the risk of death from drug overdose is 12.7 times higher than the general population, with risk of death further elevated among females. Although female inmates have higher rates of opioid use disorder and post-release overdose fatality, justice-involved women are under-represented in studies of medications for opioid use disorder. The Reducing Overdose After Release from Incarceration (ROAR) pilot intervention and evaluation (recruitment June 2019 through December 2020) aims to reduce opioid overdose among women released to the community following incarceration in state prison. The evaluation further assesses induction, acceptance and effectiveness of extended release naltrexone in a female post-prison population. METHODS/DESIGN: In the week prior to their release, female adults in custody with moderate to severe opioid use disorder start treatment with extended release naltrexone, an injectable opioid antagonist that blocks the effects of opioids for up to 1 month. All ROAR participants receive training to use naloxone rescue kits and are provided nasal naloxone at release. Ongoing support from a certified recovery mentor to facilitate sustained engagement with treatment for substance use disorders begins in the month prior to release from prison and continues for 6 months in community. We evaluate the association between ROAR participation and the primary outcome of opioid overdose. Using administrative data provided by the Oregon Department of Corrections and the Oregon Health Authority, we compare the odds of overdose among ROAR participants versus a comparison group of females released from prison during the study period. Evaluation activities in community includes survey and qualitative interviews for 6 months post release, as well as a review of clinic records to assess retention on medication among the pilot cohort (N = 100). DISCUSSION: ROAR is a collaboration between Oregon’s public health, criminal justice, and medical communities. The ROAR intervention and evaluation provide critical information on improving interventions to prevent opioid overdose and improve retention on treatment in community in an overlooked, high-risk population: incarcerated women re-entering the community.

The necessity and feasibility of such a vaccine for human and veterinary application is discussed. Developmental stages within the life cycle of the parasite that might act as possible targets for vaccine development are summarised, as well as the target antigens offered by molecular biology and immunology studies. Vaccination trials against cryptosporidiosis carried out so far, including the active and passive immunisation approach, are also overviewed. It seems that with respect to a Cryptosporidium vaccine two target groups can be considered: children of the developing world and neonatal ruminants. Antigens representing possible candidates for a subunit vaccine were identified based on their function, location and/or the immune response they evoke. While the active vaccination of newborn calves, lambs and goat kids has to face a number of important limitations, the passive immunisation approach, where dams were immunised to protect their progeny by colostral transfer, was proven to be a valuable alternative. Finally, a number of points of action for the near future are put forward.","de Graaf, Dirk C.; Spano, Furio; Petry, Franz; Sagodira, Serge; Bonnin, Alain",Int J Parasitol,480,16

The selectivity indices of PpIX and verteporfin were 952.74 and 368.93, respectively, suggesting broad margin of safety. Importantly, PpIX and verteporfin prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice adenovirally transduced with human ACE2. The compounds, sharing a porphyrin ring structure, were shown to bind viral receptor ACE2 and interfere with the interaction between ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain of viral S protein.

Here we present a comprehensive examination of the host- and virus-targeted functions of the flavonolignan silibinin, a potential drug candidate against COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2. As a direct inhibitor of STAT3—a master checkpoint regulator of inflammatory cytokine signaling and immune response—silibinin might be expected to phenotypically integrate the mechanisms of action of IL-6-targeted monoclonal antibodies and pan-JAK1/2 inhibitors to limit the cytokine storm and T-cell lymphopenia in the clinical setting of severe COVID-19. As a computationally predicted, remdesivir-like inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)—the central component of the replication/transcription machinery of SARS-CoV-2—silibinin is expected to reduce viral load and impede delayed interferon responses. The dual ability of silibinin to target both the host cytokine storm and the virus replication machinery provides a strong rationale for the clinical testing of silibinin against the COVID-19 global public health emergency. A randomized, open-label, phase II multicentric clinical trial (SIL-COVID19) will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of silibinin in the prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome in moderate-to-severe COVID-19-positive onco-hematological patients at the Catalan Institute of Oncology in Catalonia, Spain.","Bosch-Barrera, Joaquim; Martin-Castillo, Begoña; Buxó, Maria; Brunet, Joan; Encinar, José Antonio; Menendez, Javier A.",J Clin Med,480,26

In this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable a detailed analysis of commonly discussed tailored measures of epidemic control - among them group-specific protection and the use of tracing apps. We introduce groups into the SEIR model that may differ both, in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions. We allow for different infectiousness parameters within and across groups, different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates, as well as different take-up rates of tracing apps. Our results visualize the sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control, namely a low death toll, avoiding overload of the health system, and a short duration of the epidemic. We show that a combination of tailored mechanisms, e.g., the protection of vulnerable groups together with a “trace & isolate” approach, can be effective in preventing a high death toll. Protection of vulnerable groups without further measures requires unrealistically strict isolation. A key insight is that high compliance is critical for the effectiveness of a “trace & isolate” approach. Our model allows to analyze the interplay of group-specific social distancing and tracing also beyond our case study in scenarios with a large number of groups reflecting, e.g., sectoral, regional, or age differentiation and group-specific take-up rates for tracing apps.","Grimm, Veronika; Mengel, Friederike; Schmidt, Martin",,480,1

In view of this, this study proposes an evaluation model of teachers' educational technology ability based on the fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network. Firstly, the comprehensive evaluation structure system of teachers' educational technology ability is constructed, and then the prediction method of teachers' ability based on fuzzy clustering algorithm is analysed. On this basis, the optimization prediction method of fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network is proposed. Finally, the application effect of fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network in the evaluation of teachers' educational technology ability is analysed. The results show that the evaluation system of teachers' educational technology ability proposed in this study is scientific and reasonable; fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network model can better accurately predict the ability of teachers' educational technology and can quickly realize global optimization. According to the fitness analysis results of the fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network model, the model converges after the 20th iteration and the fitness value remains about 1.45. Therefore, the fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network has stronger adaptability and has been optimized to a certain extent. The average evaluation accuracy of fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network model is 98.44%, and the evaluation results of the model are better than other algorithms.
