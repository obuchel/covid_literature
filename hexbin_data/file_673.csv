Services that would require a long time to understand, use and master are becoming as transparent as possible to the users, that tend to focus only on the final goals. Combined with the advantages of the unmanned vehicles (UV), from the unmanned factor to the reduced size and costs, we found an opportunity to bring to users a wide variety of services supported by UV, through the Internet of Unmanned Vehicles (IoUV). Current solutions were analyzed and we discussed scalability and genericity as the principal concerns. Then, we proposed a solution that combines several services and UVs, available from anywhere at any time, from a cloud platform. The solution considers a cloud distributed architecture, composed by users, services, vehicles and a platform, interconnected through the Internet. Each vehicle provides to the platform an abstract and generic interface for the essential commands. Therefore, this modular design makes easier the creation of new services and the reuse of the different vehicles. To confirm the feasibility of the solution we implemented a prototype considering a cloud-hosted platform and the integration of custom-built small-sized cars, a custom-built quadcopter, and a commercial Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft. To validate the prototype and the vehicles’ remote control, we created several services accessible via a web browser and controlled through a computer keyboard. We tested the solution in a local network, remote networks and mobile networks (i.e., 3G and Long-Term Evolution (LTE)) and proved the benefits of decentralizing the communications into multiple point-to-point links for the remote control. Consequently, the solution can provide scalable UV-based services, with low technical effort, for anyone at anytime and anywhere.","Ramos, João; Ribeiro, Roberto; Safadinho, David; Barroso, João; Rabadão, Carlos; Pereira, António",Sensors (Basel),673,18

Backed by advanced (bio)materials, it has recently paved the way towards novel biosensing concepts supporting bio-analytics applications transversal to the main biomedical stream. The advancements concerning enabling biomaterials and related novel biosensing concepts involving optogenetics are reviewed with particular focus on the use of engineered cells for cell-based sensing platforms and the available toolbox (from mere actuators and reporters to novel multifunctional opto-chemogenetic tools) for optogenetic-enabled real-time cellular diagnostics and biosensor development. The key advantages of these modified cell-based biosensors concern both significantly faster (minutes instead of hours) and higher sensitivity detection of low concentrations of bioactive/toxic analytes (below the threshold concentrations in classical cellular sensors) as well as improved standardization as warranted by unified analytic platforms. These novel multimodal functional electro-optical label-free assays are reviewed among the key elements for optogenetic-based biosensing standardization. This focused review is a potential guide for materials researchers interested in biosensing based on light-responsive biomaterials and related analytic tools.","Gheorghiu, Mihaela; Polonschii, Cristina; Popescu, Octavian; Gheorghiu, Eugen",Materials (Basel),673,18

Res. 185 (2020) 109460],22.4259,3.3771038,2020-07-24,"BACKGROUND: Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by more than one microorganisms is not uncommon and may be potentially challenging, but the relevant data is scarce in ventilated neonates. We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of polymicrobial VAP in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: All neonates with definite diagnosis of VAP from a tertiary level neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Taiwan between October 2017 and September 2020 were prospectively observed and enrolled for analyses. All clinical features, therapeutic interventions and outcomes were compared between the polymicrobial VAP and monomicrobial VAP episodes. Multivariate regression analyses were used to find the independent risk factors for treatment failure. RESULTS: Among 236 episodes of neonatal VAP, 60 (25.4%) were caused by more than one microorganisms. Polymicrobial VAP episodes were more likely to be associated with multidrug-resistant pathogens (53.3% versus 34.7%, P = 0.014), more often occurred in later days of life and in neonates with prolonged intubation and underlying bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Otherwise most clinical characteristics of polymicrobial VAP were similar to those of monomicrobial VAP. The therapeutic responses and treatment outcomes were also comparable between these two groups, although modification of therapeutic antibiotics were significantly more common in polymicrobial VAP episodes than monomicrobial VAP episodes (63.3% versus 46.2%; P < 0.001). None of any specific pathogens was significantly associated with worse outcomes. Instead, it is the severity of illness, including presence of concurrent bacteremia, septic shock, and requirement of high-frequency oscillatory ventilator and underlying neurological sequelae that are independently associated with treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: Polymicrobial VAP accounted for 25.4% of all neonatal VAP in the NICU, and frequently occurred in neonates with prolonged intubation and underlying bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In our cohort, most clinical features, therapeutic responses and final outcomes of neonates with monomicrobial and polymicrobial VAP did not differ significantly.

Indoor infectious viral disease transmission (such as coronavirus, norovirus, influenza) is a complex problem that needs better integration of our current knowledge and intervention strategies. Critical to providing a reduction in transmission is to map the four core technical areas of environmental microbiology, transmission science, building science, and social science. To that end a three-stage science and innovation Summit was held to gather information on current standards, policies and procedures applied to reduce transmission in built spaces, as well as the technical challenges, science needs, and research priorities. The Summit elucidated steps than can be taken to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 indoors and calls for significant investments in research to enhance our knowledge of viral pathogen persistence and transport in the built environment, risk assessment and mitigation strategy such as processes and procedures to reduce the risk of exposure and infection through building systems operations, biosurveillance capacity, communication form leadership, and stakeholder engagement for optimal response.

Offering asymptomatic individuals the option to collect their own samples for STI testing is an effective strategy to increase testing coverage. This study explores students' perceptions of self-collection services. Participants: Four hundred and thirty-four (434) students from a large public university completed an online survey in February 2018. Methods: The cross-sectional survey assessed students' human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/STI testing behaviors, comfort with self-collection procedures, and intention to use self-collection services if offered on campus. Results: Most students (88%) said they would use self-collection test kits they could take home, followed by self-collection in a private room at student health services (59%). Students were most comfortable with testing procedures involving less human interaction and collecting specimens themselves. Cost, accuracy, confidentiality of tests, and provision of clear ""how to"" instructions, topped students' concerns. Conclusion: Offering self-collection options may increase STI testing among asymptomatic college students.","Lindley, Lisa L; Sharif, A'isha M; Chowdhury, Tasnuva",Journal of American college health : J of ACH,673,31

On March 16, the state's governor declared public health emergency in the city of Rio de Janeiro and partial lockdown measures came into force a week later. The main goal of this work is to discuss the impact of the measures on the air quality of the city by comparing the particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations determined during the partial lockdown with values obtained in the same period of 2019 and also with the weeks prior to the virus outbreak. Concentrations varied with substantial differences among pollutants and also among the three studied monitoring stations. CO levels showed the most significant reductions (30.3-48.5%) since they were related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO2 also showed reductions while PM10 levels were only reduced in the first lockdown week. In April, an increase in vehicular flux and movement of people was observed mainly as a consequence of the lack of consensus about the importance and need of social distancing and lockdown. Ozone concentrations increased probably due to the decrease in nitrogen oxides level. When comparing with the same period of 2019, NO2 and CO median values were 24.1-32.9 and 37.0-43.6% lower. Meteorological interferences, mainly the transport of pollutants from the industrial areas might have also impacted the results.","Dantas, Guilherme; Siciliano, Bruno; França, Bruno Boscaro; da Silva, Cleyton M; Arbilla, Graciela",Sci Total Environ,673,13

DESIGN: We first merge various risk factors from federal agencies (e.g. Census Bureau and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) with COVID-19 cases as of June 13th in contiguous US counties (N = 3,042). We then apply negative binomial regression to the county-level dataset to test three interrelated research hypotheses and the moderating role of residential segregation is presented with a figure. RESULTS: Several key results are obtained. (1) Counties with high racial/ethnic density of minority groups experience more confirmed cases than those with low levels of density. (2) High levels of residential segregation between whites and non-whites increase the number of COVID-19 infections in a county, net of other risk factors. (3) The relationship between racial/ethnic density and COVID-19 infections is enhanced with the increase in residential segregation between whites and non-whites in a county. CONCLUSIONS: The pre-existing social structure like residential segregation may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 and aggravate racial/ethnic health disparities in infections. Minorities are disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus and focusing on pre-existing social structures and discrimination in housing market may narrow the uneven burden across racial/ethnic groups.","Yang, Tse-Chuan; Emily Choi, Seung-Won; Sun, Feinuo",Ethn Health,673,5

Este ensaio aponta que as tomadas de decisão sobre (não) vacinar ou sobre (não) seguir as medidas preventivas e de controle da propagação da covid-19 são conformadas por pertencimentos sociais e atravessadas por desigualdades que tendem a se exacerbar. A infodemia que cerca a covid-19 e a hesitação vacinal refletem a tensão entre o risco cientificamente validado e o risco percebido subjetivamente, também influenciada pela crise de confiança na ciência. Percepções de risco e adesão a medidas de saúde extrapolam aspectos subjetivos e racionais e espelham valores e crenças conformados pelas dimensões política, econômica e sociocultural.","Couto, Marcia Thereza; Barbieri, Carolina Luisa Alves; Matos, Camila Carvalho de Souza Amorim",Saúde Soc,673,1

Moreover, accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is required for its correct diagnosis. To address these, first we have analysed publicly available 10 664 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries globally to find mutation points in the coding regions as substitution, deletion, insertion and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) globally and country wise. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment is performed in the presence of reference sequence from NCBI. Once the alignment is done, a consensus sequence is build to analyse each genomic sequence to identify the unique mutation points as substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs globally, thereby resulting in 7209, 11700, 119 and 53 such mutation points respectively. Second, in such categories, unique mutations for individual countries are determined with respect to other 72 countries. In case of India, unique 385, 867, 1 and 11 substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs are present in 566 SARS-CoV-2 genomes while 458, 1343, 8 and 52 mutation points in such categories are common with other countries. In majority (above 10%) of virus population, the most frequent and common mutation points between global excluding India and India are L37F, P323L, F506L, S507G, D614G and Q57H in NSP6, RdRp, Exon, Spike and ORF3a respectively. While for India, the other most frequent mutation points are T1198K, A97V, T315N and P13L in NSP3, RdRp, Spike and ORF8 respectively. These mutations are further visualised in protein structures and phylogenetic analysis has been done to show the diversity in virus genomes. Third, a web application is provided for searching mutation points globally and country wise. Finally, we have identified the potential conserved region as target that belongs to the coding region of ORF1ab, specifically to the NSP6 gene.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated physician perceptions of the appropriateness of telemedicine for patients attending the primary care practices of a federally qualified health center in New York City. METHODS: Anonymous cross-sectional survey including closed and open-ended questions. We used chi-square to test whether providers from certain specialties were more likely to state they would use telemedicine in the future. We used t-test to compare age between those who would vs. would not use telemedicine. Then, we used logistic regression to test whether age and specialty were both correlated with desire to use telemedicine in the future. We used thematic content analysis to describe the reasons providers felt they would not want to use telemedicine in the future, and to describe the situations for which they felt telemedicine would be appropriate. RESULTS: Of 272 FHC providers who were sent the electronic survey, 159(58%) responded within the 2-week survey time frame. Mean age of providers was 45 years (range 28-75). Overall, 81% stated they would use telemedicine in the future. Compared to the Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Behavioral Health, Dental, and OB/GYN specialties, providers from Pediatrics, Med-Peds, Subspecialties and Surgery [Pro-telemedicine specialties] were more likely to believe telemedicine would be useful post pandemic (94% vs. 72%, p<0.05). Providers who reported they would use telemedicine in the future were younger [mean age 44(42-46) vs. 50(46-55), p<0.01). In regression analysis, both pro-telemedicine specialties and age were significantly associated with odds of reporting they would use telemedicine in the future [pro-specialties: 5.2(1.7-16.2); younger age: 1.05(1.01-1.08)]. Providers who did not want to use telemedicine in the future cited concerns about inadequate patient care, lack of physical patient interaction, technology issues, and lack of necessity. Providers who felt telemedicine would be useful cited the following situations: follow up visits, medication refills, urgent care, patient convenience, and specific conditions such has behavioral health, dermatology visits, and chronic care management. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of health providers in this resource poor setting in a federally qualified health center believed that telemedicine would be useful for providing care after the pandemic is over.","Nies, Sarah; Patel, Shae; Shafer, Melissa; Longman, Laura; Sharif, Iman; Pina, Paulo",,673,1

The abdominal CT scan can be used to rule out or confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and a chest CT scan can make the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Observation: We report the observation of a 30-year-old patient, with no particular pathological history, who presented with appendicular syndrome without extra-digestive signs, and especially, without respiratory syndrome. The CRP was at 35mg/l. A thoracoabdominal CT scan was requested to detect an eventual appendicitis. With three straight frosted glass areas on the thoracic area suggesting COVID 19 infectious pneumopathy, a PCR was requested to detect a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, then the patient was appendectomized. Post-operative follow-up was simple and the patient was transferred to a department dedicated to covid-19-positive patients for further management. Conclusion: CT scan is necessary before considering emergency surgery for acute appendicitis because it can change the patient's management circuit.","Elbakouri, Abdelilah; El Azhary, Abdessamad; Bouali, Mounir; Bensardi, Fatimazahra; Elhattabi, Khalid; Fadil, Abdelaziz",Ann Med Surg (Lond),673,16

It is mandatory that the clinical trials be registered in the Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI) before enrollment of study participants. The present study was carried out with the objective of collecting, compiling and analyzing various types of trial data such as study design, interventions, outcomes and study sites. The clinical trial data were collected from the CTRI web portal using the key word “COVID-19” on 14 July 2020. The CTRI data output of every study registered till 14 July 2020 was stored as PDF document and the data were transcribed into a validated excel sheet based on the pre-defined methods and categories and analyzed. A total of 293 clinical studies have been registered in CTRI as on 14 July 2020. Among them, 188 (64.16%) are interventional and 105 (35.83%) are observational studies. The interventions being evaluated are modern medications including drugs and biologicals, AYUSH formulations, Nutraceuticals, Yoga and Naturopathy. Most of the interventions are already in clinical use for non-COVID indications and undergoing repurposing evaluations for COVID-19 in the clinical studies. Trials with AYUSH formulations constitute more than half of the interventional studies (51.06%) while modern medications in 31.09% of the studies. 119 trials (63.3%) of the interventional studies are randomized studies. Large numbers of trials are conducted in the states where the incidence of COVID-19 is high. 146 interventional studies out of 188 are expected to be completed within 6 months and the outcomes of these studies may provide valid information on the potential treatments in COVID-19. © 2021 Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.

Little is known about gut inflammation in cirrhosis and how this differs in acute decompensation (AD). We developed a novel approach to characterise intestinal immunopathology by quantifying faecal cytokines (FC) and GBI markers. Methods: Faeces and plasma were obtained from patients with stable cirrhosis (SC; n=16), AD (n=47), and healthy controls (HC; n=31). A panel of 15 cytokines and GBI markers including intestinal fatty acid-binding protein-2 (FABP2), D-lactate and faecal calprotectin (FCAL) were quantified by electrochemiluminescence/ELISA. Correlations between analytes and clinical metadata with univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: Faecal (F) IL-1ß, IFNÎ³, TNF&#945;, IL-21, IL-17A/F and IL-22 were significantly elevated in AD vs SC (q<0.01). F-IL-23 was significantly elevated in AD vs HC (p=0.0007). FABP2/D-lactate were significantly increased in faeces in AD vs SC and AD vs HC (p<0.0001) and in plasma (p=0.0004; p=0.011). F-FABP2 correlated most strongly with disease severity (Spearman's rho: Child-Pugh 0.466, p<0.0001; MELD 0.488, p<0.0001). FCAL correlated with plasma IL-21, IL-1ß and IL-17F only and none of the faecal analytes. F-cytokines and F-GBI markers were more accurate than plasma in discriminating AD from SC. Conclusions: FC-profiling represents an innovative approach to investigating the localised intestinal cytokine microenvironment in cirrhosis. These data reveal that AD is associated with a highly inflamed and permeable gut-barrier. FC profiles are very different from the classical innate-like features of systemic inflammation. There is non-specific upregulation of TH1/TH17 effector cytokines and those known to mediate intestinal barrier damage. This prevents mucosal healing in AD and further propagates BT and systemic inflammation.","Riva, Antonio; Gray, Elizabeth H; Azarian, Sarah; Zamalloa, Ane; McPhail, Mark Jw; Vincent, Royce P; Williams, Roger; Chokshi, Shilpa; Patel, Vishal C; Edwards, Lindsey A",JHEP Rep,673,16

OPEs were detected in all mask samples, although in highly variable amounts which ranged from 0.02 to a maximum of 27.7 µg/mask, with the highest mean concentrations obtained for KN95 masks (11.6 µg/mask) and the lowest for surgical masks (0.24 µg/mask). Twelve out of 16 tested analytes were detected, with TEP, TPHP, TNBP, TEHP and TClPP being the most common OPEs as well as present at the highest concentrations. The non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of OPE inhalation were calculated as being always several orders of magnitude lower than threshold levels, indicating that the use of face masks is safe with regard to OPE contamination. However, given the wide range of OPEs observed in different masks, it can be concluded that some masks (e.g. reusable) are less OPE-contaminated than others (e.g. KN95). With regard to environmental pollution, the disposal of billions of face masks is adding to the already substantial levels of microplastics and associated toxic additives worldwide, an impact that is lessened by use of reusable masks, which also have the lowest economic cost per user. However, in situations of relatively high risk of viral inhalation, such as poorly ventilated indoor public spaces, we recommend the use of FFP2 masks.","Fernández-Arribas, J; Moreno, T; Bartrolí, R; Eljarrat, E",Environ Int,673,11

A high triglyceride to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (Tg/HDL c) ratio has been associated with reduced insulin sensitivity, metabolic syndrome and adverse cardiovascular events. Our aim in this study was to determine the association between different components of the lipid profile and particularly the Tg/HDL c ratio with severe complications like the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We collected demographic, clinical and biochemical data to conduct a cohort study in 43 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) at baseline and in the subsequent 15 days. Patients were subjected to a very similar treatment scheme with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Descriptive statistics, variable association and logistic regression were applied to identify predictors of disease severity among elements and calculations from the lipid profile. RESULTS: Patients were aged 57 ± 14 years; 55.8% were male from which 75% required hospitalization and 44.2% were female who 58% were hospitalized. The most common comorbidities were type 2 diabetes mellitus (58%) and hypertension (40%). Hospitalized and critical care patients showed lower HDL c blood levels and increased Tg/HDL c ratio than those with outpatient management and mild/asymptomatic COVID-19. Tg/HDL c ratio correlated with variables of disease severity such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (r = 0.356; p < 0.05); National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS 2) (r = 0.495; p < 0.01); quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) (r = 0.538; p < 0.001); increased need of oxygen support (r = 0.447; p < 0.01) and requirement of mechanical ventilation (r = 0.378; p < 0.05). Tg/HDL c ratio had a negative correlation with partial oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO 2/FiO2) ratio (r = -0.332;p < 0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that Tg/HDL c ratio can predict increases in inflammatory factors like LDH (p < 0.01); ferritin (p < 0.01) and D-dimer (p < 0.001). Logistic regression model indicated that &#8805;7.45 Tg/HDL c ratio predicts requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 11.815, CI 1.832-76.186, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The Tg/HDLc ratio can be used as an early biochemical marker of COVID-19 severe prognosis with requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation.","Alcántara-Alonso, Estefanía; Molinar-Ramos, Fernando; González-López, Jesús Alberto; Alcántara-Alonso, Viridiana; Muñoz-Pérez, Marco Antonio; Lozano-Nuevo, José Juan; Benítez-Maldonado, Daniel Rabindranath; Mendoza-Portillo, Elizabeth",Clin Nutr ESPEN,673,0

The tumor board activity was measured from tumor board sheets extracted from the oncologic electronic file between January 7, 2019 and April 24, 2020. The pre-containment activity was compared to the activity of the containment periods but also to the equivalent periods in 2019. The number of meetings held, the average number of files reviewed per meeting including first presentations and the average number of physicians' attendance were the evaluation criteria. The study covered 191 TB that held 3943 multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) and reviewed 72,070 files (including 30,127 first submissions). There was a moderate decrease of 8 % in the number of meetings after March 16, 2020. The number of files examined decreased by 23 % in the following month and even more by 33 % in the third period. The physicians' number who attended MTM also decreased by 25 %. The negative impact was higher in the Mediterranean part of the region. This first study of tumor board activity, covering a large region but little affected by the pandemic, shows that its impact on the participation to the MTM has been moderate. In addition, tumor boards have followed the recommendations for optimizing quorum. However, the decrease in average MTM activity, particularly for first submissions, suggests a potential delay in patient management. Complementary qualitative and quantitative works are warranted to estimate the real impact on carcinologic outcomes.","Grosclaude, Pascale; Azria, David; Guimbaud, Rosine; Thibault, Séverine; Daubisse-Marliac, Laetitia; Cartron, Guillaume; Renaudie, Marie-José; Dalbies, Pierre-Adrien; Delord, Jean-Pierre; Bauvin, Eric",Bull Cancer,673,16

We aimed to quantify the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples from children compared with adults. METHODS: We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from adult and pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and from their contacts who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Manitoba between March and December 2020. We compared viral growth in cell culture, cycle threshold values from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene and the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50/mL) between adults and children. RESULTS: Among 305 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, 97 samples were from children aged 10 years or younger, 78 were from children aged 11-17 years and 130 were from adults (&#8805; 18 yr). Viral growth in culture was present in 31% of samples, including 18 (19%) samples from children 10 years or younger, 18 (23%) from children aged 11-17 years and 57 (44%) from adults (children v. adults, odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.72). The cycle threshold was 25.1 (95% CI 17.7-31.3) in children 10 years or younger, 22.2 (95% CI 18.3-29.0) in children aged 11-17 years and 18.7 (95% CI 17.9-30.4) in adults (p < 0.001). The median TCID50/mL was significantly lower in children aged 11-17 years (316, interquartile range [IQR] 178-2125) than adults (5620, IQR 1171 to 17 800, p < 0.001).

DESIGN: Nationwide, population based cohort study. SETTING: Denmark from 13 March 2019 to 27 January 2021. PARTICIPANTS: All Danish residents >1 year of age. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Population based healthcare registries that encompass the entire Danish population were used to compare hospital admission and mortality rates during the covid-19 pandemic (from 11 March 2020 to 27 January 2021) with the prepandemic baseline data (from 13 March 2019 to 10 March 2020). Hospital admissions were categorised as covid-19 when patients were assigned a diagnosis code for covid-19 within five days of admission. All patients were followed until migration, death, or end of follow-up, whichever came first. Rate ratios for hospital admissions were computed using Poisson regression and were directly standardised using the Danish population on 1 January 2019 as reference. 30 day mortality rate ratios were examined by Cox regression, adjusted for age and sex, and covid-19 diagnosis was used as a competing risk. RESULTS: 5 753 179 residents were identified during 567.8 million person weeks of observation, with 1 113 705 hospital admissions among 675 447 people. Compared with the prepandemic baseline period (mean hospital admission rate 204.1 per 100 000/week), the overall hospital admission rate for non-covid-19 conditions decreased to 142.8 per 100 000/week (rate ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.74) after the first national lockdown, followed by a gradual return to baseline levels until the second national lockdown when it decreased to 158.3 per 100 000/week (0.78, 0.73 to 0.82). This pattern was mirrored for most major diagnosis groups except for non-covid-19 respiratory diseases, nervous system diseases, cancer, heart failure, sepsis, and non-covid-19 respiratory infections, which remained lower throughout the study period. Overall 30 day mortality rates were higher during the first national lockdown (mortality rate ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.32) and the second national lockdown (1.20, 1.16 to 1.24), and these results were similar across most major diagnosis groups. For non-covid-19 respiratory diseases, cancer, pneumonia, and sepsis, the 30 day mortality rate ratios were also higher between lockdown periods. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admissions for all major non-covid-19 disease groups decreased during national lockdowns compared with the prepandemic baseline period. Additionally, mortality rates were higher overall and for patients admitted to hospital with conditions such as respiratory diseases, cancer, pneumonia, and sepsis. Increased attention towards management of serious non-covid-19 medical conditions is warranted.","Bodilsen, Jacob; Nielsen, Peter Brønnum; Søgaard, Mette; Dalager-Pedersen, Michael; Speiser, Lasse Ole Zacho; Yndigegn, Troels; Nielsen, Henrik; Larsen, Torben Bjerregaard; Skjøth, Flemming",BMJ,673,24

While there are no practice guidelines specific to AYA telemedicine, observations made during this implementation can highlight challenges encountered and suggest solutions to some of these challenges. METHODS: Over the course of several weeks in March, 2020, the Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine Clinic at the University of California San Francisco rapidly replaced most in-person visits with telemedicine visits. This required logistical problem-solving, collaboration of all clinic staff members, and continuous reassessment of clinical practices. This article describes observations made during these processes. RESULTS: Telemedicine visits increased from zero to 97% of patient encounters in one month. The number of visits per month was comparable with that one year prior. While there were limitations to the clinic's ability to carry out health supervision visits, many general health, mental health, reproductive health, eating disorders, and addiction treatment services were implemented via telemedicine. Providers identified creative solutions for challenges that arose to managing general confidentiality issues as well as specific challenges related to mental health, reproductive health, eating disorders, and addiction care. Opportunities to implement and expand high-quality AYA telemedicine were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to widespread telemedicine implementation. While telemedicine seems to be feasible and acceptable for our clinic patients, unanswered questions remain regarding confidentiality, quality of care, and health disparities. Clinical guidelines are also needed to guide best practices for telemedicine in this patient population.","Barney, Angela; Buckelew, Sara; Mesheriakova, Veronika; Raymond-Flesch, Marissa",J Adolesc Health,673,7

It initiates when the virus attaches to the host cell and ends when the viral contents reach the cytosol. Genetically unrelated viruses can subvert analogous subcellular mechanisms and use similar trafficking pathways for successful entry. Antiviral strategies targeting early steps of infection are therefore appealing, particularly when the probability for successful interference through a common step is highest. We describe here potent inhibitory effects on content release and infection by chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) containing the envelope proteins of Zaire ebolavirus (VSV-ZEBOV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) elicited by Apilimod and Vacuolin-1, small-molecule inhibitors of the main endosomal phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate/phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase, PIKfyve. We also describe potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 by Apilimod. These results define tools for studying the intracellular trafficking of pathogens elicited by inhibition of PIKfyve kinase and suggest the potential for targeting this kinase in developing small-molecule antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.","Kang, Yuan-Lin; Chou, Yi-Ying; Rothlauf, Paul W; Liu, Zhuoming; Soh, Timothy K; Cureton, David; Case, James Brett; Chen, Rita E; Diamond, Michael S; Whelan, Sean P J; Kirchhausen, Tom",Proc.

The aims of this study were to quantify the effects of lockdown on pediatric care in the Netherlands, to elucidate the cause of the observed reduction in pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions, and to summarize the literature regarding the effects of lockdown on pediatric care worldwide. ED visits and hospital admission data of 8 general hospitals in the Netherlands between January 2016 and June 2020 were summarized per diagnosis group (communicable infections, noncommunicable infections, (probable) infection-related, and noninfectious). The effects of lockdown were quantified with a linear mixed effects model. A literature review regarding the effect of lockdowns on pediatric clinical care was performed. In total, 126,198 ED visits and 47,648 admissions were registered in the study period. The estimated reduction in general pediatric care was 59% and 56% for ED visits and admissions, respectively. The largest reduction was observed for communicable infections (ED visits: 76%; admissions: 77%), whereas the reduction in noninfectious diagnoses was smaller (ED visits 36%; admissions: 37%). Similar reductions were reported worldwide, with decreases of 30-89% for ED visits and 19-73% for admissions.Conclusion: Pediatric ED utilization and hospitalization during lockdown were decreased in the Netherlands and other countries, which can largely be attributed to a decrease in communicable infectious diseases. Care utilization for other conditions was decreased as well, which may indicate that care avoidance during a pandemic is significant. What is Known: â¢ The COVID-19 pandemic had enormous impact on society. â¢ Countries imposed lockdowns to curb transmission rates, which were followed by a reduction in care utilization worldwide. What is New: â¢ The Dutch lockdown caused a significant decrease in pediatric ED utilization and hospitalization, especially in ED visits and hospital admissions because of infections that were not caused by SARS-CoV-2. â¢ Care utilization for noninfectious diagnoses was decreased as well, which may indicate that pediatric care avoidance during a pandemic is significant.","Kruizinga, Matthijs D; Peeters, Daphne; van Veen, Mirjam; van Houten, Marlies; Wieringa, Jantien; Noordzij, Jeroen G; Bekhof, Jolita; Tramper-Stranders, Gerdien; Vet, Nienke J; Driessen, Gertjan J A",Eur. j. pediatr,673,26

Therefore, this work explores the chemical complexity of the underexplored species, Amphilophium paniculatum (L.) Kunth as a potential source of inhibitory phytochemicals against the recently emerging coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Overall, 13 structurally varied metabolites were isolated from the ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions of A. paniculatum leaves for the first time in the genus and identified by different spectral techniques, including 1H and 13C NMR, DEPT, and HR–ESI–MS analyses. The characterized compounds (1–13), along with those previously obtained by our group from the same species (14–22) revealed varying binding affinities to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, among which, eight molecules exhibited lower binding energies (–9.54 to –7.45 kcal/mol) than the ligand N3 (–7.44 kcal/mol);with polyphenolic metabolites, namely flavonoids, phenylethanoids, and lignans had the most stable interactions, respectively. These results highlighted the noteworthy diversity of A. paniculatum metabolites and their marked homogeneity with those produced by other Bignoniaceae plants, which would help expand our phytochemical and chemotaxonomic knowledge on this species.

Metabolic adaptation to glucose shortage is essential to maintain tumor cells' survival because of their high glucose requirement. This study evaluated the hypothesis that acidosis might promote tumor survival during glucose shortage and if so, explored a novel drug targeting metabolic vulnerability to glucose shortage. METHODS: Cell survival and bioenergetics metabolism were assessed in lung cancer cell lines. Our in-house small-molecule compounds were screened to identify those that kill cancer cells under low-glucose conditions. Cytotoxicity against non-cancerous cells was also assessed. Tumor growth was evaluated in vivo using a mouse engraft model. RESULTS: Acidosis limited the cellular consumption of glucose and ATP, causing tumor cells to enter a metabolically dormant but energetically economic state, which promoted tumor cell survival during glucose deficiency. We identified ESI-09, a previously known exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EAPC) inhibitor, as an anti-cancer compound that inhibited cancer cells under low-glucose conditions even when associated with acidosis. Bioenergetic studies showed that independent of EPAC inhibition, ESI-09 was a safer mitochondrial uncoupler than a classical uncoupler and created a futile cycle of mitochondrial respiration, leading to decreased ATP production, increased ATP dissipation, and fuel scavenging. Accordingly, ESI-09 exhibited more cytotoxic effects under low-glucose conditions than under normal glucose conditions. ESI-09 was also more effective than actively proliferating cells on quiescent glucose-restricted cells. Cisplatin showed opposite effects. ESI-09 inhibited tumor growth in lung cancer engraft mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the acidosis-induced promotion of tumor survival during glucose shortage and demonstrates that ESI-09 is a novel potent anti-cancer mitochondrial uncoupler that targets a metabolic vulnerability to glucose shortage even when associated with acidosis. The higher cytotoxicity under lower-than-normal glucose conditions suggests that ESI-09 is safer than conventional chemotherapy, can target the metabolic vulnerability of tumor cells to low-glucose stress, and is applicable to many cancer cell types.","Maeda, Yuki; Kikuchi, Ryota; Kawagoe, Junichiro; Tsuji, Takao; Koyama, Nobuyuki; Yamaguchi, Kazuhiro; Nakamura, Hiroyuki; Aoshiba, Kazutetsu",Mol Metab,673,26

Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients, including 19 cases of nucleic acid false-negative patients and 31 cases of nucleic acid positive patients, were enrolled. Their epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory examination data and imaging characteristics were analyzed. Risk factors for false negatives were discussed. Compared with the nucleic acid positive group, the false-negative group had less epidemiological exposure (52.6% vs 83.9%; P = .025), less chest discomfort (5.3% vs 32.3%; P = .035), and faster recovery (10 [8, 13] vs 15 [11, 18.5] days; P = .005).

Thus, the absence of epidemiological exposure may be a potential risk factor for false-negative nucleic acids. The false-negative cases of COVID-19 are worth noting because they have a risk of viral transmission without positive test results, lighter clinical manifestations, and less history of epidemiological exposure.","Rong, Yan; Wang, Fei; Liu, Jing; Zhou, Yang; Li, Xiaoli; Liang, Xinhua; Zhang, Dandan; Zeng, Huadong; Wang, Jing; Shi, Yi",J Med Virol,673,21

Vaccine uptake remains a barrier to full population inoculation against this highly infectious disease. Objective: The purpose of this report is to describe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine interest rates in a racially, geographically, and ethnically diverse study cohort and characterize vaccine interest across a racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse study population. Design: This report describes responses to a survey administered between November 2020 and May 2021 using a community convenience sample through a partnership between the National Minority Quality Forum (NMQF) and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) as part of the Minority and Rural Coronavirus Insights Study (MRCIS). Analysis of survey responses from 3,624 participants are provided. Results: Early data from the MRCIS cohort suggest that [SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy] is more prevalent in Black versus Non-Hispanic Whites survey respondents, and the Hispanic community has positive interest in the vaccine, to a similar degree as Whites. The persistent presence of [vaccine undecided] across different sites and racial/ethnic groups uncovers the need for more public health efforts to influence positive views about vaccination. Conclusion: These findings highlights the urgent need for interventional educational campaigns targeted at populations at risk of low vaccine interest. Focused efforts are needed to combat misinformation and explain vaccine safety and effectiveness to promote its uptake and avoid low inoculation rates. Public health communication must consider differences in population groups, regions, and social determinants of health to fully address vaccine uptake disparities and overcome alleged hesitancy. Key Points -Willingness to receive the SARS CoV-2 varies among minority populations. -[SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy] is more prevalent in the non-Hispanic Black population than the non-Hispanic White and Hispanic populations. -Public health infrastructure is needed in underserved communities for efficient assessment and targeted communication of public health priorities such as the SARS CoV-2 vaccination.","Landry, Latrice; Lee, LaTasha; Meyer, William; Puckrein, Gary; Chalasani, Nishanth; Xu, Liou; Stair, Taylor; Wiltz, Gary; Sampson, Marian; Gregerson, Paul; Barron, Charles; Marable, Jeffrey; Akinboboye, Ola",,673,21

Potentially, the pandemic crisis may result in increased problem gambling, for example, due to COVID-19-related psychological distress, unemployment, and financial difficulties. In addition, the cancellation of sports in early parts of the crisis has been suspected to alter gambling behaviors. Policy makers have called for action and, in some cases, have changed regulations, and media have reported possible increases in treatment seeking. However, research data are hitherto lacking. The present study assessed the treatment uptake at a regional specialized gambling-disorder unit in the healthcare system of Region Skåne, Sweden. Number of patients, treatment contacts, and patterns of rescheduling or cancellations of appointments were quantified for each month, January-December 2020, and compared to corresponding months of 2018 and 2019. Possible trends were analyzed, using an interrupted time-series analysis. Results did not indicate an increase in treatment uptake for gambling disorder during the months of COVID-19 impact in Sweden. The proportion of digital treatment increased, but total treatment uptake was unaffected by the pandemic. In conclusion, during the first ten months of the pandemic in Sweden, no obvious increase in treatment uptake for gambling disorder could be seen. Moreover, longer follow-up may be necessary in order to see if effects of worsening socioeconomic conditions may be a possible long-term risk factor of increased gambling after COVID-19.","Håkansson, Anders; Åkesson, Gunny; Grudet, Cécile; Broman, Niroshani",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),673,6

The first positive case in Switzerland was confirmed on 25 February 2020 in a patient from canton Tessin, who most likely caught the virus during a visit to Milan, Italy [2]. The country has since been preparing for an imminent public health emergency caused by the pandemic. As of 14 May 2020, the Swiss healthcare system is facing a total of 30,463 corona virus-positive people [3]. With numbers of new infections decreasing after the first pandemic wave, the continuing endemic situation will continue to be a major challenge for the Swiss healthcare system. It remains crucial to separate the clinically low-symptomatic from the severely affected patients in order to offer a specific therapeutic strategy to every SARS-CoV-2 patient. Reports from Chinese cohorts describe an increasing role of imaging strategies in the detection and surveillance of COVID-19 patients because of insufficient testing sensitivity of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests [4]. Chest computed tomography (CT), with a reported sensitivity of up to 97% [5, 6], gained importance particularly in patients with false negative RT-PCR results. In this short communication, we describe our first clinical experiences with 55 COVID-19 patients in Central Switzerland, who were either imaged with a standard chest x-ray, chest CT, or both.

Aim of this study is to investigate the use and effect of prone position in this population during the first 2020 pandemic wave. METHODS: Retrospective, multicentre, national cohort study conducted between February 24 and June 14, 2020, in 24 Italian Intensive Care Units (ICU) on adult patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by COVID-19. Clinical data were collected on the day of ICU admission. Information regarding the use of prone position was collected daily. Follow-up for patient outcomes was performed on July 15, 2020. The respiratory effects of the first prone position were studied in a subset of 78 patients. Patients were classified as Oxygen Responders if the PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased &#8805; 20 mmHg during prone position and as Carbon Dioxide Responders if the ventilatory ratio was reduced during prone position. RESULTS: Of 1057 included patients, mild, moderate and severe ARDS was present in 15, 50 and 35% of patients, respectively, and had a resulting mortality of 25, 33 and 41%. Prone position was applied in 61% of the patients. Patients placed prone had a more severe disease and died significantly more (45% vs. 33%, p < 0.001). Overall, prone position induced a significant increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio, while no change in respiratory system compliance or ventilatory ratio was observed.

Patients and Methods: This retrospective case series includes the first 370 patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed Covid-19 illness between March 10, 2020 and May 13, 2020, at a 242-bed teaching hospital. To determine independent association between demographic factors, comorbidities and AKI incidence, multivariable-logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios adjusted for clinical covariates. Results: Median age of patients was 71 (59-82) years and 44.3% were female. Patients with AKI were significantly older with a higher comorbidity-burden and mortality-rate (58.1% vs 19.6%, p<.001) when compared to those without AKI. Increasing age, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia and being of African-American descent showed higher odds of AKI. Patients with AKI had significantly higher odds of mortality when compared to patients without AKI, and this effect was proportional to the stage of AKI. Increasing age and acute respiratory distress syndrome also revealed higher adjusted odds of mortality. Conclusion: AKI is a common complication among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. We found significantly higher odds of AKI with increasing age, among hyperlipidemics and patients with chronic kidney disease and among African-Americans.

In response to the rapidly increasing number of confirmed U.S. cases, state and local governments suggested social distancing, issued stay-at-home orders, and restricted travel, fundamentally changing how individuals allocate time. Directly impacted time activities, such as work, eating food away from home, grocery shopping, and childcare significantly impact two food-related topics: household food waste and diet quality. In order to investigate these non-marginal time changes, we predict weekly time allocated to seven activities for households in the National Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey using information from the American Time Use Survey. Jointly estimating household production functions for food waste and diet quality, we find that time events that are related to fresh produce consumption, such as increased grocery store trips and time spent in FAH activities, are related to higher diet quality, but lower food waste. While time events that are associated with quick convenient meals, such as time spent in secondary childcare and work time, are also associated with lower food waste, these events decrease household diet quality. We then predict the level of household food waste and diet quality for three COVID-19 scenarios: one where the household head is likely able to work remotely, another where the household head is likely to lose their job, and a third, where the household head is likely to be considered an essential worker. Households without children that are likely able to work remotely are predicted to have lower levels of food waste and higher diet quality, while households without children in the other two COVID-19 scenarios are predicted to have only minor differences.","Scharadin, Benjamin; Yu, Yang; Jaenicke, Edward C",Rev Econ Househ,673,25

Additionally, much of the population, such as the aged or immunocompromised, are unable to mount an effective immunologic response for existing vaccines. Vectored Immunoprophylaxis (VIP) is a novel approach designed to address these challenges. Rather than utilizing an antigen to trigger a response from the host’s immune system as is normally done with traditional vaccines, VIP genetically engineers the production of tailored antibodies from non-hematopoietic cells, bypassing the humoral immune system. Direct administration of genes encoding for neutralizing antibodies has proven to be effective in both preventing and treating several infectious diseases in animal models. While, a significant amount of work has focused on HIV, including an ongoing clinical trial, the approach has also been shown to be effective for malaria, dengue, hepatitis C, influenza, and more. In addition to presenting itself as a potentially efficient approach to solving long-standing vaccine challenges, the approach may be the best, if not only, method to vaccinate immunocompromised individuals. Many issues still need to be addressed, including which tissue(s) makes the most suitable platform, which vector(s) are most efficient at transducing the platform tissue used to secrete the antibodies, and what are the long-term effects of such a treatment.

Communication robots should ideally be as small as an infant in order to reduce the user’s feeling of threat. In addition, non-verbal communication (such as gestures) is also important in facilitating smooth interactions between humans and robots. There are currently a few communication robots that are small sized and can generate hand gestures. In this paper, we propose a small robot hand, which is optimized for gesture communication by using a shape memory alloy (SMA). The SMA employed is a Ti–Ni alloy, which is used as an actuator. The SMA shrinks when it transforms into the austenite phase at temperatures higher than the transformation temperature. When it is in the martensitic phase at a lower temperature, it is expanded by an external force. Each finger of the robot hand is driven by an individual SMA wire. The specifications of the small robot including the hand size, operation angles in each finger joint, response times and power consumption were determined according to the human finger and existing small communication robots. These required specifications have been fulfilled by carefully designing the geometry and heating/cooling power control. A questionnaire-based survey was also conducted with a robot hand. The five-finger hand was successfully shown to generate recognizable symbolic gestures.

We tested the sensitivity and performance of a simple and rapid SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific T cell test based on the stimulation of whole blood with peptides covering the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, followed by cytokine (IFN-Î³, IL-2) measurement in different cohorts including BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals (n = 112), convalescent asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients (n = 130), and SARS-CoV-1-convalescent individuals (n = 12). The sensitivity of this rapid test is comparable to that of traditional methods of T cell analysis (ELISPOT, activation-induced marker). Using this test, we observed a similar mean magnitude of T cell responses between the vaccinees and SARS-CoV-2 convalescents 3 months after vaccination or virus priming. However, a wide heterogeneity of the magnitude of spike-specific T cell responses characterized the individual responses, irrespective of the time of analysis. The magnitude of these spike-specific T cell responses cannot be predicted from the neutralizing antibody levels. Hence, both humoral and cellular spike-specific immunity should be tested after vaccination to define the correlates of protection necessary to evaluate current vaccine strategies.","Tan, Anthony T; Lim, Joey Me; Le Bert, Nina; Kunasegaran, Kamini; Chia, Adeline; Qui, Martin Dc; Tan, Nicole; Chia, Wan Ni; de Alwis, Ruklanthi; Ying, Ding; Sim, Jean Xy; Ooi, Eng Eong; Wang, Lin-Fa; Chen, Mark I-Cheng; Young, Barnaby E; Hsu, Li Yang; Low, Jenny Gh; Lye, David C; Bertoletti, Antonio",J. clin. invest,673,16

Some of these people developed mental health problems, and many solutions have been put in place to address the mental health issues of patients and health professionals affected by the disease. However, not much attention has been given to students, particularly those from medical school. The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the mental health status of students from a medical college in Hubei province. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The WeChat-based survey program Questionnaire Star, which contained questions from Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), was utilized for the present study. RESULTS: A total of 217 students participated in the survey. Among these students, 127 were female and 90 were male. Furthermore, 77 students (35.5%) who participated in the survey were in a state of depression, and 48 (22.1%) were in a state of anxiety. The majority of students who were in depressed (n=75) or anxiety (n=46) states had mild or moderate states.

Despite Arabic being the fifth most commonly spoken language and one of the six official languages of the United Nations, there is no Arabic version for an olfactory-specific quality of life assessment tool. Method: The Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (QOD-NS) is a validated questionnaire that assesses many aspects of a patient’s daily life. We translated this questionnaire to the Arabic language following European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group Translation Procedure guidelines. A pilot-testing of the Arabic version was done among 20 participants, 10 of whom were confirmed to have normosmia based on scoring at least 11/12 on the Sniffin’ Sticks (SS) olfactory testing (Group 1) and another 10 participants who reported anosmia and scored less than 7/12 on the SS test. Patients could agree, partially agree, partially disagree, or disagree with each questionnaire statement. Results: The pilot study revealed that participants with confirmed anosmia had higher questionnaire scores compared to participants with normosomia (median 22 compared to 1, p value < 0.001). For each statement on the Arabic questionnaire, all questions scored at least 80% of intra-rater reliability, and the overall intra-rater reliability was 90%.

These genetically similar viruses can interfere with the replication process of each other and even compete for the metabolites required for the maintenance of the replication cycle. Due to the similarity in clinical symptoms of most viral respiratory tract infections, and their coincidence with COVID‐19, caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, it is recommended to develop a comprehensive diagnostic panel for detection of respiratory and nonrespiratory viruses through the evaluation of patient samples. Given the resulting changes in blood markers, such as coagulation factors and white blood cell count following virus infection, these markers can be of diagnostic value in the detection of mixed infection in individuals already diagnosed with a certain viral illness. In this review, we seek to investigate the coinfection of SARS‐CoV‐2 with other respiratory and nonrespiratory viruses to provide novel insights into the development of highly sensitive diagnostics and effective treatment modalities.","Aghbash, Parisa S.; Eslami, Narges; Shirvaliloo, Milad; Baghi, Hossein B.",J Med Virol,673,30

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of behavioral intention of free/self-paid COVID-19 vaccination and its associations with prosociality and social responsibility among university students in China. METHODS: An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 6922 university students in five provinces in China during November 1-28, 2020. With informed consent, participants filled out an online survey link distributed to them via WeChat study groups. The response rate was 72.3%. RESULTS: The prevalence of behavioral intentions of free COVID-19 vaccination was 78.1%, but it dropped to 57.7% if the COVID-19 vaccination involved self-payment (400 RMB; around 42 USD). After adjusting for background factors, prosociality (free vaccination: adjusted odds ratio [ORa] = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.09-1.12; self-paid vaccination: ORa = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.07-1.09) and social responsibility (free vaccination: ORa = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.14-1.19; self-paid vaccination: ORa = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.11-1.14) were positively associated with the two variables of COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated the positive effects of prosociality and social responsibility on the intention of COVID-19 vaccination. Accordingly, modification of prosociality and social responsibility can potentially improve COVID-19 vaccination.

Plants and many organisms protect themselves from viruses through the production of miRNAs, which are complementary to 3UTR of viruses resulting in degrading the viral mRNA or block the translation on ribosomes. As pandemic, COVID-19, and its consequences on the global economy, we hypothesized a new approach for the treatment of COVID-19 paints. This approach includes designing a mix of miRNAs targeting several regions on COVID-19 open reading frame (ORF) and 3 UTR and suitable delivery system targeting respiratory system tissues.

Patients are frequently treated with antibiotics although ARI are most commonly caused by virus, strengthening the need for improved diagnostic methods. OBJECTIVES: Detect viral and bacterial RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from children aged 6–23 months with ARI using nCounter. STUDY DESIGN: A custom-designed nCounter probeset containing viral and bacterial targets was tested in NPA of ARI patients. RESULTS: Initially, spiked control viral RNAs were detectable in ≥6.25 ng input RNA, indicating absence of inhibitors in NPA. nCounter applied to a larger NPA sample (n = 61) enabled the multiplex detection of different pathogens: RNA viruses Parainfluenza virus (PIV 1–3) and RSV A-B in 21%, Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 5%, Bocavirus (BoV), CoV, Influenza virus (IV) A in 3% and, Rhinovirus (RV) in 2% of samples, respectively. RSV A-B was confirmed by Real Time PCR (86.2–96.9% agreement). DNA virus (AV) was detected at RNA level, reflecting viral replication, in 10% of samples. Bacterial transcripts from Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were detected in 77, 69, 26, 8, 3 and 2% of samples, respectively. CONCLUSION: nCounter is robust and sensitive for the simultaneous detection of viral (both RNA and DNA) and bacterial transcripts in NPA with low RNA input (<10 ng). This medium-throughput technique will increase our understanding of ARI pathogenesis and may provide an evidence-based approach for the targeted and rational use of antibiotics in pediatric ARI.","Fukutani, Kiyoshi F.; Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M.; Van der Gucht, Winke; Wollants, Elke; Khouri, Ricardo; Dierckx, Tim; Van Ranst, Marc; Houspie, Lieselot; Bouzas, Maiara L.; Oliveira, Juliana R.; Barral, Aldina; Van Weyenbergh, Johan; de Oliveira, Camila I.",J Clin Virol,673,16

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory condition of the urinary bladder characterized by the hallmark symptoms of pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction. To facilitate IC/BPS research, we used transgenic technology to develop a novel urothelial MCP-1 secretion mouse model (URO-MCP-1). A transgene consisting of the uroplakin II gene promoter and the mouse MCP-1 coding sequence with a secretory element was constructed and microinjected. URO-MCP-1 mice were found to express MCP-1 mRNA in the bladder epithelium and MCP-1 protein in the urine, and developed bladder inflammation 24 hours after intravesical administration of a single sub-noxious dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The inflamed bladders of URO-MCP-1 mice exhibited elevated mRNAs for interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, substance P precursor, and nerve growth factor as well as increased macrophage infiltration. In parallel with these phenotypic changes, URO-MCP-1 mice manifested significant functional changes at days 1 and 3 after cystitis induction. These functional changes included pelvic pain as measured by von Frey filament stimulation and voiding dysfunction (increased urinary frequency, reduced average volume voided per micturition, and reduced maximum volume voided per micturition) as measured by micturition cages. Micturition changes remained evident at day 7 after cystitis induction, although these changes were not statistically significant. Control wild-type C57BL/6 mice manifested no clear changes in histological, biochemical and behavioral features after similar cystitis induction with LPS. Taken together, our results indicate that URO-MCP-1 mice are hypersensitive to bladder irritants such as LPS and develop pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction upon cystitis induction, providing a novel model for IC/BPS research.","Xu, Suming; Wang, Xu; Wang, Yaoqin; Lutgendorf, Susan; Bradley, Catherine; Schrepf, Andrew; Kreder, Karl; O'Donnell, Michael; Luo, Yi",PLoS One,673,1

A Population-Based Study,22.264862,3.5825293,2021-04-04,"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has enormously impacted the delivery of clinical healthcare and hospital management practices in most of the hospitals around the world for both Covid and no-Covid patients. In this context, it is extremely important to assess whether the clinical management of no-Covid cases has not seriously been compromised during the first epidemic outbreak. Among no-Covid cases, patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke need non-deferrable emergency care and are the natural candidates as no-Covid patients to be studied. Preliminary evidence suggests that i) the time from onset of symptoms to emergency department (ED) presentation has increased in Covid-19 times as well 30-day mortality during the pandemic has been higher. We aimed to complement this evidence assessing if the additional stress due to the high inflow of Covid-19 patients at hospital level has modified AMI and Stroke admission criteria and related mortality rates in a causal inference framework. Methods: To study the impact of Covid pandemic on mortality rates for AMI and Stroke we adopt two quasi-experimental approaches, regression-discontinuity design (RDD) and difference-in-regression-discontinuity (DRD) designs by which we identify the plausible causal effect on mortality of the Covid-19-related hospital stress due to the introduction of State of Emergency restrictions. Findings: We check the causal effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on mortality rates of AMI and stroke over several time-windows of 15-days around the implementation date of the State of Emergency restrictions for COVID-19 (March, 9th). Despite the potential adverse effect on expected mortality due to a longer time to hospitalization, the AMI and Stroke mortality rates are overall not statistically different from the one observed in the control group. The obtained results provided by RDD and DRD models are robust also when we account for seasonality and unobserved factors. Interpretation: In a quasi-experimental setting we assessed the causal impact of the hospital and staff extra-burden generated by the first wave of Covid-19 patients on mortality rates of no-Covid non-deferrable urgent cases (AMI and Stroke) hospitalized at Spedali Civili of Brescia, one of the most hit provinces in Italy by Covid-19 during March and May 2020. We find a non-statistically significant impact on mortality rates for AMI and Stroke patients providing evidence of the hospital ability to manage -with the implementation of a double track organization- the simultaneously delivery of high quality cares to both Covid and no-Covid patients. Availability of similar data for the regional context as a whole is needed to further substantiate the findings and explore existing differences in efficacy of different managerial settings implemented in Lombardy hospitals.","Rossi, C.; Berta, P.; Curello, S.; Lovaglio, P.

METHODS: The aim of the study was to determine the effects of post-hospital clinic (POSH) and telephone (TPOSH) follow-up provider visits versus no visit on 30-day readmission. We used a retrospective cohort design based on data from 1/1/2017 to 12/31/2019 on adult patients (n = 213,513) discharged home from 15 Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals. Completion of POSH or TPOSH provider visits within 7 days of discharge was the exposure and all-cause 30-day inpatient and observation stay readmission was the primary outcome. We used matching weights to balance the groups and Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model to assess for readmission risk. RESULTS: Unweighted all-cause 30-day readmission rate was highest for patients who completed a TPOSH (17.3%) followed by no visit (14.2%), non-POSH (evaluation and management visits that were not focused on the hospitalization: 13.6%) and POSH (12.6%) visits. The matching weighted models showed that the effects of POSH and TPOSH visits varied across patient subgroups. For high risk (LACE 11+) medicine patients, both POSH (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.85, P < .001) and TPOSH (HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99, P = .03) were associated with 23 and 9% lower risk of 30-day readmission, respectively, compared to no visit. For medium to low risk medicine patients (LACE< 11) and all surgical patients regardless of LACE score or age, there were no significant associations for either visit type with risk of 30-day readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Post-hospital telephone follow-up provider visits had only modest effects on 30-day readmission in high-risk medicine patients compared to clinic visits. It remains to be determined if greater use and comfort with virtual visits by providers and patients as a result of the pandemic might improve the effectiveness of these encounters.","Nguyen, Huong Q.; Baecker, Aileen; Ho, Timothy; Huynh, Dan N.; Watson, Heather L.; Li, Jing; Shen, Ernest",BMC Health Serv Res,673,27

Amongst the detected Covid-19 cases, several cases are also found asymptomatic. The presently available Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) system for detecting COVID-19 lacks due to limited availability of test kits and relatively low positive symptoms in the early stages of the disease, urging the need for alternative solutions. The tool based on Artificial Intelligence might help the world to develop an additional COVID-19 disease mitigation policy. In this paper, an automated Covid-19 detection system has been proposed, which uses indications from Computer Tomography (CT) images to train the new powered deep learning model- U-Net architecture. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated using 1000 Chest CT images. The images were obtained from three different sources – Two different GitHub repository sources and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology's excellent collection. Out of 1000 images, 552 images were of normal persons, and 448 images were obtained from COVID-19 affected people. The proposed algorithm has achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 94.86% and 93.47% respectively, with an overall accuracy of 94.10%.

However, as the epidemiology of diseases and the approach to their management vary internationally, POCUS may not be universally applicable. The resources available for medical education are generally limited. Thus, when considering the development of a training program during the internship year, we sought to determine interns' perceptions of the applicability of POCUS to clinical practice, the current skill gaps, and barriers to training. Methods A validated questionnaire was distributed to the interns of the College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), Riyadh to determine their proficiency in POCUS, and their opinions on its applicability on a 5-point Likert scale. Each skill gap was calculated by subtracting self-reported proficiency in POCUS from its perceived applicability. Results Of the 300 total interns (male: 200, female: 100), 229 participated [response rate: 76%; male: 136 (68%), female: 93 (93%)]. The use of POCUS to detect abdominal free fluid was perceived to be the most applicable use (mean: 3.9 ±1.1); scanning for consolidation was the least applicable (mean: 3.0 ±1.2). Knowledge and proficiency among the sample were generally poor. The skill gap was greatest for the assessment of inferior vena cava collapsibility (mean: 1.4 ±1.3) and least for the identification of pneumothorax (mean: 0.5 ±1.5). Although three-quarters of the participants (170) agreed that POCUS was an essential skill, 36 (16%) stated that they had no interest in it, and nearly half (101) believed that they did not have time to learn POCUS. Conclusions While POCUS is applicable to medical interns in Saudi Arabia, significant skill gaps exist. However, our sample's perception of the applicability of POCUS was less favorable than that of internal medicine (IM) residents in Canada. Thus, initiating POCUS training during the internship year may yield suboptimal results. Interns must prioritize medical licensing examinations and applications for residency training. Indeed, many interns believe that they do not have enough time to learn POCUS. Thus, prioritizing the training of residents in POCUS may be a more effective use of the finite resources available for medical education.","Jarwan, Waleed; Alshamrani, Abdullah A; Alghamdi, Afnan; Mahmood, Naveed; Kharal, Yousuf M; Rajendram, Rajkumar; Hussain, Arif",Cureus,673,5

We performed a meta-analysis comparing the sensitivity of nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs against a composite reference standard for the initial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ambulatory patients. The study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020221827). Data sources included studies appearing between January 1, 2020 and March 20, 2021, identified by searches of PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. Studies included at least 20 subjects who simultaneously provided nasal and nasopharyngeal specimens for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, and for which confusion matrices could be constructed. Authors individually assessed studies for inclusion and compared assessments. Each author independently extracted all data elements; differences were reconciled by review of initial data sources. Extracted data included specimen site, patient characteristics, collection site, and confusion matrices comparing results for nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs. Assessed against a composite reference standard, anterior nares swabs are less sensitive (82% - 88%) than nasopharyngeal swabs (98%). For populations with 10% specimen positivity, the negative predictive values of all swab types were greater than 98%. Mid-turbinate and anterior nares swabs seem to perform similarly. The lower sensitivity associated with nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is justified by the ability to screen more patients and reduced personal protective equipment requirements. Our conclusions are limited by the small number of studies and the significant heterogeneity of study designs and study outcomes.","Zhou, Yaolin; O’Leary, Timothy J.",PLoS One,673,20

Repurposing of known active compounds against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new effective and time-saving trend in anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. Thorough inhibition of the coronaviral-2 proteins (i.e., multitarget inhibition) is a possible powerful favorable strategy for developing effectively potent drugs for COVID-19. In this new research study, I succeeded to repurpose the two antioxidant polyhydroxy-1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the first multitarget coronaviral protein blockers with extremely higher potencies (reach about 65 and 304 times, for CoViTris2020, and 20 and 93 times, for ChloViD2020, more potent than remdesivir and favipiravir, respectively). These two 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were computationally studied (through molecular docking in almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins) and biologically assessed (through a newly established robust in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay) for their anticoronaviral-2 bioactivities. The data obtained from the docking investigation showed that both ligands promisingly exhibited very strong inhibitory binding affinities with almost all docked enzymes (e.g., they displayed extremely lower binding energies of − 12.00 and − 9.60 kcal/mol, respectively, with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase “RdRp”). The results of the biological assay revealed that CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 significantly displayed very high anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC(50) = 0.31 and 1.01 μM, respectively). Further in vivo/clinical studies for the development of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as anti-COVID-19 medications are required. In brief, the ascent of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the two lead members of the novel family of anti-COVID-19 polyphenolic 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives represents a promising hope in COVID-19 therapy. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 life cycle with surprising EC(50) values of 0.31 and 1.01 μM, respectively. CoViTris2020 strongly inhibits coronaviral-2 RdRp with exceptionally lower inhibitory binding energy of − 12.00 kcal/mol. [Image: see text]","Rabie, Amgad M.",Mol Divers,673,1

Bovine noroviruses (BoNoVs) and neboviruses were detected in 56 (33.5%) and 37 (22.1%) fecal samples, respectively. Sequences of the RdRp and capsid gene of selected BoNoVs showed that the GIII.1 and GIII.2 genotypes were in circulation in Turkey. Two of the BoNoV strains were identified as recombinant strains (GIII.P1/GIII.2). All examined neboviruses possessed a Nebraska-like RdRp gene. The two nebovirus strains were classified into lineage 4 based on phylogenetic analysis of VP1 amino acid sequences. One of them showed evidence of a recombination event within the S domain.

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 50 UK participants who were shielding and/or over the age of 70 and who used medicines for a long-term condition, using telephone or video conferencing. Participants were recruited through personal/professional networks and through patient/carer organisations. Participants were asked about their experiences of managing medicines during the pandemic and how this differed from previous practices. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. KEY FINDINGS: Patients’ and their families’ experiences of managing medicines safely during the pandemic varied greatly. Analysis suggests that this was based on the patient’s own agency, the functioning of their medicines system pre-pandemic and their relationships with family, friends, community networks and pharmacy staff. Medicine safety issues reported included omitted doses and less-effective formulations being used. Participants also described experiencing high levels of anxiety related to obtaining medicines, monitoring medicines and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 while accessing healthcare services for medicine-related issues. Effects of the pandemic on medicines adherence were reported to be positive by some and negative by others. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy staff have a key role to play by establishing good relationships with patients and their families, working with prescribers to ensure medicines systems are as joined up as possible, and signposting to community networks that can help with medicines collection.","Garfield, Sara; Wheeler, Carly; Boucher, Charles; Etkind, Mike; Lloyd, Jill; Norton, John; Ogunleye, Della; Taylor, Alex; Williams, Marney; Grimes, Tamasine; Kelly, Dervla; Franklin, Bryony Dean",Int J Pharm Pract,673,3

In December 2019, a new coronavirus emerged from bats and was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Disease outbreaks such as SARS in 2002–2003, MERS in 2012 and the current COVID-19 pandemic are the result of higher mutation rates of coronaviruses and their unique capacity for genetic recombination, resulting in adaptations that make them more suitable to cross the species barriers and infect other species. This ability for host switching and interspecies infection is often attributed to the great diversity of these viruses, which is a result of viral and host factors such as the low fidelity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the high frequency of their homologous RNA recombination, and the adaptation of the S protein to bind host receptors like the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) in MERS-CoV. This review presents an overview of the zoonotic transmission of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, focusing on the viral, host and environmental factors that favor the spillover of these viruses into humans, as well as the biological and ecological factors that make bats the perfect animal reservoir of infection for these viruses.","da Silva, Priscilla Gomes; Mesquita, João Rodrigo; de São José Nascimento, Maria; Ferreira, Vanessa Andreia Martins",Sci Total Environ,673,20

Although cigarette smoke is generally believed to be harmful to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatments were surprisingly found to suppress the expression of ACE2 in HepG2 cells. We thus tried to clarify the mechanism of CSE effects on expression of ACE2 in mammalian cells. Because RNA-seq analysis suggested that suppressive effects on ACE2 might be inversely correlated with induction of the genes regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the AHR agonists 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) and omeprazole (OMP) were tested to assess whether those treatments affected ACE2 expression. Both FICZ and OMP clearly suppressed ACE2 expression in a dose-dependent manner along with inducing CYP1A1. Knock-down experiments indicated a reduction of ACE2 by FICZ treatment in an AHR-dependent manner. Finally, treatments of AHR agonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection into Vero E6 cells as determined with immunoblotting analyses detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid protein. We here demonstrate that treatment with AHR agonists, including CSE, FICZ, and OMP, decreases expression of ACE2 via AHR activation, resulting in suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian cells.","Tanimoto, Keiji; Hirota, Kiichi; Fukazawa, Takahiro; Matsuo, Yoshiyuki; Nomura, Toshihito; Tanuza, Nazmul; Hirohashi, Nobuyuki; Bono, Hidemasa; Sakaguchi, Takemasa",bioRxiv,673,13

Results have been analyzed in order to compare the reliability and applicability of both methods. Observations made with eye tracking and event tracking led to similar results regarding recommendation interface evaluation. In general, vertical interfaces showed higher effectiveness compared to horizontal ones, with the first and second positions working best, and the worse performance of horizontal interfaces probably being connected with banner blindness.

While the avoidance of social contacts was possible in many areas, the responsibility to provide themselves with food was placed in the hands of private households. Objectives To investigate whether and to what extent the restrictions led to changes regarding visits to supermarkets using cars. Materials and Methods Data were available on the parking movements on 136 parking spaces of supermarkets in Germany between the beginning of February and the end of May. The analyses focused on changes in the total number of parking events per day and slot as well as their duration. Results Regarding the parking events, there was a clear reduction until the end of April, interrupted by an increase around Easter. After the introduction of mandatory masking, the values recovered to just below the level before lockdown. The duration changed relatively slightly. Initially it decreased, but later rose slightly above the level observed before the restrictions. Over the medium term, there was a slight reduction of parking events and an extension of their duration by a little more than 5%. Discussion Despite the explicit exclusion of food purchases from the lockdown measures, a dynamic adaptation behaviour of the population to the changing circumstances is also evident in this context. In terms of parking movements, a lasting effect on shopping behaviour seems unlikely.","Hepp, Tobias; Marquart, Pia; Jauck, Christoph; Gefeller, Olaf",Gesundheitswesen,673,30

A literature review was performed to assess six aspects of the research progress and limitations of carotid ultrasonography and carotid atherosclerosis-related risk factors: (1) structures of the carotid intima and media; (2) plaques; (3) inflammation; (4) dynamics of carotid blood flow; (5) early detection and intervention; and (6) risk factors for CVD. Although carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaques are well-acknowledged independent predictors of CVD risk, normative and cut-off values are difficult to define due to the heterogeneous measurements reported in previous studies. Plaque properties, including location, number, density, and size, become more important risk predictors for cardiovascular disease, but a better approach for clinical use needs to be further established. Three-dimensional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound are promising for promoting risk stratification with more details on plaque morphology. Moreover, inflammatory diseases and biomarkers should be evaluated for a full assessment of the inflammatory burden for atherosclerosis. Carotid flow velocity is not only an indicator for stenosis but also a potential risk predictor. Carotid atherosclerosis should be detected and treated early, and additional clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy of these measures in reducing CVD risk. Cardiovascular risk factors tend to affect carotid plaques, and early treat-to-target therapy might yield clinical benefits. Based on the aforementioned six aspects, we consider that these six important factors act like a “SPIDER” spinning the web of atherosclerosis; a timely comprehensive assessment and intervention may halt the progression to CVD. Carotid ultrasound results should be combined with other atherosclerotic factors, and a comprehensive risk assessment may help to guide cardiovascular prevention decisions.","Li, Hongwei; Xu, Xiaolin; Luo, Baoming; Zhang, Yuling",Front Cardiovasc Med,673,16

Average annual tuberculosis (TB) incidence rates among the Guarani-Kaiowá are nearly 400/100,000 in Mato Grosso do Sul state, ten times the national average. Although stigma is considered crucial for TB control in indigenous communities, few studies have investigated TB stigma among indigenous populations. This study sought to understand the role of TB-related stigma and perceptions of TB in maintaining hyperendemic TB transmission in the Guarani-Kaiowá communities. METHODS: Various forms of stigma were explored through semi-structured interviews with 19 patients, 11 relatives, and 23 community members. Patients were identified from the registry of the healthcare service. Community members, selected by snowball sampling, were matched by gender and village of residence. Interviews were conducted in Guarani and Portuguese and later translated into English. Framework analysis was performed using NVivo. RESULTS: Traditional beliefs of a weakening of the body allowing the disease to enter were common, but the exact mechanism of transmission was unknown. Strong community/public stigma associated TB with uncleanliness, abuse, and irresponsibility. Anticipated stigma led to significant treatment delays for fear of exclusion and losing employment. While most patients felt supported by their families, nearly all patients related experienced/enacted stigma in the community such as gossip, avoidance, and social exclusion, leading to long-lasting internalized/self-stigma. Secondary stigmatization of relatives was widespread, and blanket latent TB infection (LTBI) treatment of patients’ households was a contributing factor in treatment delay. The healthcare service unnecessarily added to stigmatization by enforcing separate utensils and sleeping arrangements for patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that stigma is a driver for treatment delay and continued transmission of TB in the community. The stigmatization of TB was rooted in a poor understanding of TB transmission, partly because of incorrect orientation by the healthcare service. Interventions to reduce TB-associated stigma are urgently needed.","Kolte, Ida Viktoria; Pereira, Lucia; Benites, Aparecida; de Sousa, Islândia Maria Carvalho; Basta, Paulo Cesar",PLoS One,673,11

The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the key role of CHWs. Improving how CHW programmes are governed is increasingly recognized as important for achieving universal access to healthcare and other health-related goals. This paper, the third in a series on “Community Health Workers at the Dawn of a New Era”, aims to raise critical questions that decision-makers need to consider for governing CHW programmes, illustrate the options for governance using examples of national CHW programmes, and set out a research agenda for understanding how CHW programmes are governed and how this can be improved. METHODS: We draw from a review of the literature as well as from the knowledge and experience of those involved in the planning and management of CHW programmes. RESULTS: Governing comprises the processes and structures through which individuals, groups, programmes, and organizations exercise rights, resolve differences, and express interests. Because CHW programmes are located between the formal health system and communities, and because they involve a wide range of stakeholders, their governance is complex. In addition, these programmes frequently fall outside of the governance structures of the formal health system or are poorly integrated with it, making governing these programmes more challenging. We discuss the following important questions that decision-makers need to consider in relation to governing CHW programmes: (1) How and where within political structures are policies made for CHW programmes? (2) Who implements decisions regarding CHW programmes and at what levels of government? (3) What laws and regulations are needed to support the programme? (4) How should the programme be adapted across different settings or groups within the country or region? CONCLUSION: The most appropriate and acceptable models for governing CHW programmes depend on communities, on local health systems, and on the political system in which the programme is located. Stakeholders in each setting need to consider what systems are currently in place and how they might be adapted to local needs and systems.

A Mathematical Modeling Study,22.47303,3.417899,2021-09-18,"I have spent a considerable time in visiting and even staying at various hospitals since my childhood. With many of the memories still intact, the one encounter whose mark is an enduring one in my mind is when I caught dengue fever and was admitted to a public hospital. During this stay, I remember largely being restless inside my room. However, visiting an outdoor ground near my ward was always a rejuvenating experience and made me feel stronger and better. It was during that time when I truly realized the significance of indoor as well as outdoor design quality of health care buildings and how they impact the well-being of their users. To say the least, that short stay at the hospital was one of the major reasons that why for my graduate and undergraduate theses, I chose to explore the role of well-designed and accessible outdoor spaces especially gardens in health care buildings for promoting mental as well as physical health and well-being among users. Presently, as we steer through a deadly pandemic, my own experiences from this hospital stay makes me want to reflect back and reemphasize on why there is a need for health care policy makers and relevant governmental bodies to strategize and prioritize long-term goals for implementing measures such as evidence-based design considerations of hospitals, especially in developing countries, and to promote accessible, inclusive, and safe healing spaces where patients may leave with positive experiences instead of negative reminiscences and where the staff can also use these spaces for respite.","Iqbal, Saad Arslan",J Patient Exp,673,16

It stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome, which affects the lungs. The process of replication and progression of the COVID-19 virus causes the formation of an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Many studies have been carried out that have demonstrated that hydrogen has strong anti-inflammatory properties. It reduces hypotension and other symptoms by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxygen mixture, enriched with Hydrogen, - helps to reduce the resistance of the respiratory tract and frees up access to the pulmonary alveolus, which improves the penetration of oxygen into the lungs. Since hydrogen is an antioxidant, it helps to reduce the burden on the immune system, helps to maintain the body's health and its ability to quickly recover. When electrolysers are used to produce an oxygen-hydrogen mixture, alkaline mist and other impurities can enter the patient's lungs and cause poisoning and chemical burns. For this reason, the use of atomic hydrogen obtained from metal hydride sources for ventilation of the lungs will be more effective for treating COVID-19 than a molecular hydrogen-oxygen mixture from an electrolyzer. A functional diagram of a metal hydride source of atomic hydrogen to an artificial lung ventilator is shown. It is possible to create a series of hydrogen storage tanks of various capacities.","Zolotarenko, An.D.; Zolotarenko, Al.D.; Veziroglu, A.; Veziroglu, T. N.; Shvachko, N. A.; Pomytkin, A.

However, the latter represent an important part of clinical practice and have significantly influenced the evolution of medicine, contributing significantly to the advancement of scientific knowledge. Vitamin B(12) deficiency shares several common symptoms that affect several tissues and organs with health aliments, so its diagnosis could be unobvious for the broad array of its effects and investigation methods used. In this review, we focused our attention on some case reports related to the vitamin B(12) deficiency associated to anemia, neurologic disorders, and hyperhomocysteinemia. B(12) deficiency reversal is simply achieved by prompt therapy, even though it is not the same for several disorders.","Azzini, Elena; Raguzzini, Anna; Polito, Angela",Int J Mol Sci,673,16

The dissection of complex protein dynamics is typically performed using relaxation rates determined at high and ultra-high field. Here we expand this range of the spectral density to low fields through field cycling using the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS coronavirus as a model system. The field-cycling approach enables site-specific measurements of R (1) at low fields with the sensitivity and resolution of a high-field magnet. These data, together with high-field relaxation and heteronuclear NOE, provide evidence for correlated rigid-body motions of the entire β-hairpin, and corresponding motions of adjacent loops with a time constant of 0.8 ns (mesodynamics). MD simulations substantiate these findings and provide direct verification of the time scale and collective nature of these motions.","Clarkson, Michael W.; Lei, Ming; Eisenmesser, Elan Z.; Labeikovsky, Wladimir; Redfield, Alfred; Kern, Dorothee",J Biomol NMR,673,27

Furthermore, some distrust fact-checkers because of alleged liberal bias. We explore a solution to these problems: using politically balanced groups of laypeople to identify misinformation at scale. Examining 207 news articles flagged for fact-checking by Facebook algorithms, we compare accuracy ratings of three professional fact-checkers who researched each article to those of 1128 Americans from Amazon Mechanical Turk who rated each article’s headline and lede. The average ratings of small, politically balanced crowds of laypeople (i) correlate with the average fact-checker ratings as well as the fact-checkers’ ratings correlate with each other and (ii) predict whether the majority of fact-checkers rated a headline as “true” with high accuracy. Furthermore, cognitive reflection, political knowledge, and Democratic Party preference are positively related to agreement with fact-checkers, and identifying each headline’s publisher leads to a small increase in agreement with fact-checkers.","Allen, Jennifer; Arechar, Antonio A.; Pennycook, Gordon; Rand, David G.",Science Advances,673,30

This patient clinical course was further complicated by COVID-19 infection. This is only the 2nd known case report of COVID 19 in CVID with GLILD. The clinical course and outcome of COVID 19 infection with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and GLILD is not well known. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient met the clinical features of CVID secondary to low IgG/IgA, recurrent infections, and failure to respond to pneumococcal vaccination. He was treated with monthly maintenance IVIG therapy. Our patient also was diagnosed with co-existing GLILD that despite IVIG treatment was progressing. The patient needed to be started on Rituxan and Mycophenolate mofetil to achieve control but unfortunately became infected with COVID19 delaying his treatment for GLILD. Our patient only suffered from mild COVID 19 infection and was able to make antibodies to this. We believe severe infection was avoided as his CVID was well controlled with IVIG therapy despite progression of his granulomatous interstitial lung disease. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our patient with CVID with co-existing biopsy proven granulomatous interstitial lung disease despite being very high risk for severe COVID 19 infections only had mild infection. This was believed to be due to well controlled CVID with IVIG therapy.","Pattanaik, Debendra; Ritter, Shaunah; Fahhoum, Joseph",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,673,1
