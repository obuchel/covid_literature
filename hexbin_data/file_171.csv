392,Extracorporeal life support for management of refractory cardiac or respiratory failure: initial experience in a tertiary centre,2010-05-21,"INTRODUCTION: Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been indicated as treatment for acute respiratory and/or cardiac failure. Here we describe our first year experience of in-hospital ECLS activity, the operative algorithm and the protocol for centralization of adult patients from district hospitals. METHODS: At a tertiary referral trauma center (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy), an ECLS program was developed from 2008 by the Emergency Department and Heart and Vessel Department ICUs. The ECLS team consists of an intensivist, a cardiac surgeon, a cardiologist and a perfusionist, all trained in ECLS technique. ECMO support was applied in case of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) not responsive to conventional treatments. The use of veno-arterial (V-A) ECLS for cardiac support was reserved for cases of cardiac shock refractory to standard treatment and cardiac arrests not responding to conventional resuscitation. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were treated with ECLS during the first year of activity. Among them, 13 received ECMO for ARDS (5 H1N1-virus related), with a 62% survival. In one case of post-traumatic ARDS, V-A ECLS support permitted multiple organ donation after cerebral death was confirmed. Patients treated with V-A ECLS due to cardiogenic shock (N = 4) had a survival rate of 50%. No patients on V-A ECLS support after cardiac arrest survived (N = 4). CONCLUSIONS: In our centre, an ECLS Service was instituted over a relatively limited period of time. A strict collaboration between different specialists can be regarded as a key feature to efficiently implement the process.","Peris, Adriano; Cianchi, Giovanni; Biondi, Simona; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Pasquini, Andrea; Bonacchi, Massimo; Ciapetti, Marco; Zagli, Giovanni; Bacci, Simona; Lazzeri, Chiara; Bernardo, Pasquale; Mascitelli, Erminia; Sani, Guido; Gensini, Gian Franco",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2879235/,171
3714,ACVIM consensus statement on the diagnosis of immune‐mediated hemolytic anemia in dogs and cats,2019-02-26,"Immune‐mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs. IMHA also occurs in cats, although less commonly. IMHA is considered secondary when it can be attributed to an underlying disease, and as primary (idiopathic) if no cause is found. Eliminating diseases that cause IMHA may attenuate or stop immune‐mediated erythrocyte destruction, and adverse consequences of long‐term immunosuppressive treatment can be avoided. Infections, cancer, drugs, vaccines, and inflammatory processes may be underlying causes of IMHA. Evidence for these comorbidities has not been systematically evaluated, rendering evidence‐based decisions difficult. We identified and extracted data from studies published in the veterinary literature and developed a novel tool for evaluation of evidence quality, using it to assess study design, diagnostic criteria for IMHA, comorbidities, and causality. Succinct evidence summary statements were written, along with screening recommendations. Statements were refined by conducting 3 iterations of Delphi review with panel and task force members. Commentary was solicited from several professional bodies to maximize clinical applicability before the recommendations were submitted. The resulting document is intended to provide clinical guidelines for diagnosis of, and underlying disease screening for, IMHA in dogs and cats. These should be implemented with consideration of animal, owner, and geographical factors.","Garden, Oliver A.; Kidd, Linda; Mexas, Angela M.; Chang, Yu‐Mei; Jeffery, Unity; Blois, Shauna L.; Fogle, Jonathan E.; MacNeill, Amy L.; Lubas, George; Birkenheuer, Adam; Buoncompagni, Simona; Dandrieux, Julien R.

3788,"Disaster preparedness for earthquakes in hemodialysis units in Gyeongju and Pohang, South Korea",2019-02-18,"In 2016 and 2017, there were earthquakes greater than 5.0 in magnitude on the Korean Peninsula, which has previously been considered an earthquake-free zone. Patients with chronic kidney disease are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes, as the term “renal disaster” suggests. In the event of a major earthquake, patients on hemodialysis face the risk of losing maintenance dialysis due to infrastructure disruption. In this review, we share the experience of an earthquake in Pohang that posed a serious risk to patients on hemodialysis. We review the disaster response system in Japan and propose a disaster preparedness plan with respect to hemodialysis. Korean nephrologists and staff in dialysis facilities should be trained in emergency response to mitigate risk from natural disasters. Dialysis staff should be familiar with the action plan for natural disaster events that disrupt hemodialysis, such as outages and water treatment system failures caused by earthquakes. Patients on hemodialysis also need to be educated about disaster preparedness. In the event of a disaster situation that results in dialysis failure, patients need to know what to do. At the local and national government level, long-term preparations should be made to handle renal disaster and patient safety logistics. Moreover, Korean nephrologists should also be prepared to manage cardiovascular disease and diabetes in disaster situations. Further evaluation and management of social and national disaster preparedness of hemodialysis units to earthquakes in Korea are needed.","Yoo, Kyung Don; Kim, Hyo Jin; Kim, Yunmi; Park, Jae Yoon; Shin, Sung Joon; Han, Seung Hyeok; Kim, Dong Ki; Lim, Chun Soo; Kim, Yon Su",Kidney Res Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6481979/,171
10094,Gastrointestinal Motility and Disease in Large Animals,2008-06-28,"Abstract: In addition to the well‐documented seasonal cycles of mating and birth, there are also significant seasonal cycles of illness and death among many animal populations. Challenging winter conditions (i.e., low ambient temperature and decreased food availability) can directly induce death via hypothermia, starvation, or shock. Coping with these challenges can also indirectly increase morbidity and mortality by increasing glucocorticoid secretion, which can compromise immune function. Many environmental challenges are recurrent and thus predictable; animals could enhance survival, and presumably increase fitness, if they could anticipate immunologically challenging conditions in order to cope with these seasonal threats to health. The annual cycle of changing photoperiod provides an accurate indicator of time of year and thus allows immunological adjustments prior to the deterioration of conditions. Pineal melatonin codes day length information. Short day lengths enhance several aspects of immune function in laboratory studies, and melatonin appears to mediate many of the enhanced immunological effects of photoperiod. Generally, field studies report compromised immune function during the short days of autumn and winter. The conflict between laboratory and field data is addressed with a multifactor approach. The evidence for seasonal fluctuations in lymphatic tissue size and structure, as well as immune function and disease processes, is reviewed. The role of pineal melatonin and the hormones regulated by melatonin is discussed from an evolutionary and adaptive functional perspective. Finally, the clinical significance of seasonal fluctuations in immune function is presented. Taken together, it appears that seasonal fluctuations in immune parameters, mediated by melatonin, could have profound effects on the etiology and progression of diseases in humans and nonhuman animals. An adaptive functional perspective is critical to gain insights into the interaction among melatonin, immune function, and disease processes.","Nelson, Randy J.; Demas, Gregory E.; Klein, Sabra L.; Kriegsfeld, Lance J.",J Pineal Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166827/,171

12849,High HbA1c is associated with decreased 6-month survival and poor outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a retrospective cohort study,2020-09-03,"In this review, we summarise the evidence for a role of the ribonuclease angiogenin in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, with a specific focus on Parkinson’s disease (PD). Angiogenin is a stress-induced, secreted ribonuclease with both nuclear and cytosolic activities. Loss-of-function mutations in the angiogenin gene (ANG) have been initially discovered in familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), however, variants in ANG have subsequently been identified in PD and Alzheimer’s disease. Delivery of angiogenin protein reduces neurodegeneration and delays disease progression in in vitro and in vivo models of ALS and in vitro models of PD. In the nucleus, angiogenin promotes ribosomal RNA transcription. Under stress conditions, angiogenin also translocates to the cytosol where it cleaves non-coding RNA into RNA fragments, in particular transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Stress-induced tRNA fragments have been proposed to have multiple cellular functions, including inhibition of ribosome biogenesis, inhibition of protein translation and inhibition of apoptosis. We will discuss recent evidence of tRNA fragment accumulation in PD, as well as their potential neuroprotective activities.","Prehn, Jochen H M; Jirström, Elisabeth",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470775/,171
13427,Lingual Osseous Choristoma Causing Odynophagia in a Young Female,2020-10-23,"Glycyrrhizic acid (GL) and its derivants, glycyrrhetinic acid 3-O-mono-β-d-glucuronide (GAMG) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) hydrolyzed in subcritical water, are bioactive substances and edulcorators. In this work, a separation strategy for these three substances was established. The effects of adsorbent and eluent were investigated by static/dynamic adsorption and multi-stage desorption with the mechanism analysis. The adsorption of them onto EXA50 resin was well fitted by the pseudo second-order kinetic model. The optimal dynamic adsorption flow rate was 6 bed volume (BV)/h, and water of pH = 12 was used to elute GL at 4 BV/h, then n-buthanol was used subsequently to elute GA at 1 BV/h, and finally 90% ethanol was applied to elute GAMG at 2 BV/h. As a result, purities of these compounds increased, which demonstrated that this adsorption-desorption technology was simple and efficient, and indicated the potential for large-scale purification and preparation of GL and its derivants in the future.","Fan, Rui",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7570570/,171
14747,Clip placement to prevent delayed bleeding after colonic endoscopic mucosal resection (CLIPPER): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,2021-01-18,"INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE: This study evaluates the outcomes of robotic duodenal switch (RDS) when compared to conventional laparoscopy (LDS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP), patients who underwent RDS were compared to those of LDS (2015–2018) for perioperative characteristics and thirty-day postoperative outcomes. Operative complexity, complications, and resource utilization trends were plotted over the included years for the two approaches. Multivariable analysis was conducted to characterize the impact of each approach on these outcomes. RESULTS: Of 7235 minimally invasive operations, 5720 (79.1%) were LDS while 1515 (20.9%) were RDS. Intraoperative endoscopy, anastomosis testing, and shorter operative duration were associated with LDS. RDS group had more concomitant procedures with less attending assistance. The odds ratios of organ space infection and sepsis were equivalent. RDS increased the odds ratios for venous thromboembolism [VTE] (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1–4.8, p = 0.02) and early discharge (OR = 7.3, CI = 4.9–10.9, p < 0.01). The difference in wound infection between LDS and RDS has been decreasing (1.5% and 1.5% in 2018 from 2.3% and 4.1% in 2015, respectively) over the years. Similarly, the decreasing trends were noted for systemic infections. CONCLUSION: While the development of VTE after RDS was higher, most of the other complications were comparable between LDS and RDS in this study. RDS may reduce the need for advanced intraoperative assistance and minimize hospital stay in select cases, without increasing morbidity. The recent trends suggest a gradual decrease in the variations between LDS and RDS outcomes over time.","Al-Mazrou, Ahmed M.; Cruz, Mariana Vigiola; Dakin, Gregory; Bellorin-Marin, Omar E.; Pomp, Alfons; Afaneh, Cheguevara",Obes Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7813533/,171

15532,The effect of the SIMS Programme versus existing preschool oral healthcare programme on oral hygiene level of preschool children: study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial,2021-02-22,"Pediatric (PARDS) and neonatal (NARDS) acute respiratory distress syndrome have different age-specific characteristics and definitions. Trials on surfactant for ARDS in children and neonates have been performed well before the PARDS and NARDS definitions and yielded conflicting results. This is mainly due to heterogeneity in study design reflecting historic lack of pathobiology knowledge. We reviewed the available clinical and preclinical data to create an expert consensus aiming to inform future research steps and advance the knowledge in this area. Eight trials investigated the use of surfactant for ARDS in children and ten in neonates, respectively. There were improvements in oxygenation (7/8 trials in children, 7/10 in neonates) and mortality (3/8 trials in children, 1/10 in neonates) improved. Trials were heterogeneous for patients’ characteristics, surfactant type and administration strategy. Key pathobiological concepts were missed in study design. Consensus with strong agreement was reached on four statements: 1. There are sufficient preclinical and clinical data to support targeted research on surfactant therapies for PARDS and NARDS. Studies should be performed according to the currently available definitions and considering recent pathobiology knowledge. 2. PARDS and NARDS should be considered as syndromes and should be pre-clinically studied according to key characteristics, such as direct or indirect (primary or secondary) nature, clinical severity, infectious or non-infectious origin or patients’ age. 3. Explanatory should be preferred over pragmatic design for future trials on PARDS and NARDS. 4. Different clinical outcomes need to be chosen for PARDS and NARDS, according to the trial phase and design, trigger type, severity class and/or surfactant treatment policy. We advocate for further well-designed preclinical and clinical studies to investigate the use of surfactant for PARDS and NARDS following these principles.

The objective of this study was to assess time trends in suicide mortality in Canada by sex and age group. METHODS: We extracted data from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database for all suicide deaths among individuals aged 10 years and older based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Ninth Revision (E950-959; 1981 to 1999) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (X60-X84, Y87·0; 2000 to 2017) for a 37-year period, from 1981 to 2017. We calculated annual age-standardized, sex-specific, and age group-specific suicide mortality rates, and used Joinpoint Regression for time trend analysis. RESULTS: The age-standardized suicide mortality rate in Canada decreased by 24.0% from 1981 to 2017. From 1981 to 2007, there was a significant annual average decrease in the suicide rate by 1.1% (95% confidence interval, −1.3 to −0.9), followed by no significant change between 2007 and 2017. From 1981 to 2017 and from 1990 to 2017, females aged 10 to 24 and 45 to 64 years old, respectively, had a significant increase in suicide mortality rates. However, males had the highest suicide mortality rates in all years in the study; the average male-to-female ratio was 3.4:1. CONCLUSION: The 3-decade decline in suicide mortality rates in Canada paralleled the global trend in rate reductions. However, since 2008, the suicide rate in Canada was relatively unchanged. Although rates were consistently higher among males, we found significant rate increases among females in specific age groups. Suicide prevention efforts tailored for adult males and young and middle-aged females could help reduce the suicide mortality rate in Canada.","Varin, Mélanie; Orpana, Heather M.; Palladino, Elia; Pollock, Nathaniel J.; Baker, Melissa M.",Can J Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7917569/,171

The quantitative measurements including the rice and unity indices are adopted to evaluate the cohesions of the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps in bill voting, in which the strategies employed by the pro-democracy camp are further analyzed. Before the 2010s, the moderate democrats deliberately separated from the administration and some of them also kept distance from the radical groups. However, since the radical ideologies gained supports from time to time, the moderate democrats had been forced to follow more pro-active lines against the administration. Although the political sphere of Hong Kong has drastically changed after the 2019 Anti-extradition Protests, the cohesion of the pro-democracy parties in the previous terms of the Legislative Council still facilitates to understand the legislative process in the city.

16846,Good habits from the pandemic age to bring home: Effective communication and briefing tools,2021-04-17,"Treatment against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is mainly hampered by drug toxicity, long treatment regimens and/or high costs. Thus, the identification of novel and low-cost antileishmanial agents is urgent. Acarbose (ACA) is a specific inhibitor of glucosidase-like proteins, which has been used for treating diabetes. In the present study, we show that this molecule also presents in vitro and in vivo specific antileishmanial activity against Leishmania infantum. Results showed an in vitro direct action against L. infantum promastigotes and amastigotes, and low toxicity to mammalian cells. In addition, in vivo experiments performed using free ACA or incorporated in a Pluronic(®) F127-based polymeric micelle system called ACA/Mic proved effective for the treatment of L. infantum-infected BALB/c mice. Treated animals presented significant reductions in the parasite load in their spleens, livers, bone marrows and draining lymph nodes when compared to the controls, as well as the development of antileishmanial Th1-type humoral and cellular responses based on high levels of IFN-γ, IL-12, TNF-α, GM-CSF, nitrite and IgG2a isotype antibodies. In addition, ACA or ACA-treated animals suffered from low organ toxicity. Treatment with ACA/Mic outperformed treatments using either Miltefosine or free ACA based on parasitological and immunological evaluations performed one and 15 days post-therapy. In conclusion, data suggest that the ACA/Mic is a potential therapeutic agent against L. infantum and merits further consideration for VL treatment.","Costa, Rafaella R.; Oliveira-da-Silva, João A.; Reis, Thiago A.

However, it is non-specific and could be increased in several cancers and some benign conditions. We report the case of a 70-year-old man followed since 2014 for a left colon adenocarcinoma with the persistence of an increased CEA. There was no evidence of recurrence, but a right lobar thyroid nodule without a significantly increased uptake was incidentally discovered on the CT scan of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT. We suspected a medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) explaining the persistent elevation of CEA. Plasma calcitonin levels were 47 ng/L (N < 10). Fine needle aspiration cytology found atypia of undetermined significance and the patient was reluctant to undergo surgery without any further exploration. We performed a (18)F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA) PET/CT preoperatively which revealed a punctiform focus of the right thyroid lobe corresponding to a pT1aN1aMxR0 medullary thyroid carcinoma, histopathologically confirmed. This case highlights that despite the potential usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in case of an unknown source of elevated CEA this imaging may be falsely negative as in the case of MTC and should lead to further explorations.","Lugat, Alexandre; Hulo, Pauline; Ansquer, Catherine; Touchefeu, Yann; Mirallié, Eric; Bennouna, Jaafar; Drui, Delphine",Curr Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8395414/,171

However, the effect of an individual’s H5 exposure history on antibody responses to subsequent H5 vaccination is poorly understood. To investigate this, we analyzed the IgG responses to H5 influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005 (Ind05) virus vaccination in three cohorts: (i) a doubly primed group that had received two H5 virus vaccinations, namely, against influenza A/Vietnam/203/2004 (Vie04) virus 5 years prior and A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (HK97) 11 years prior to the Ind05 vaccination; (ii) a singly primed group that had received a vaccination against Vie04 virus 5 years prior to the Ind05 vaccination; and (iii) an H5-naive group that received two doses of the Ind05 vaccine 28 days apart. Hemagglutinin (HA)-reactive IgG levels were estimated by a multiplex assay against an HA panel that included 21 H5 strains and 9 other strains representing the H1, H3, H7, and H9 subtypes. Relative HA antibody landscapes were generated to quantitatively analyze the magnitude and breadth of antibody binding after vaccination. We found that short-interval priming and boosting with the Ind05 vaccine in the naive group generated a low anti-H5 response. Both primed groups generated robust antibody responses reactive to a broad range of H5 strains after receiving a booster injection of Ind05 vaccine; IgG antibody levels persisted longer in subjects who had been doubly primed years ago. Notably, the IgG responses were strongest against the first priming H5 strain, which reflects influenza virus immune imprinting. Finally, the broad anti-H5 IgG response was stronger against strains having a small antigenic distance from the initial priming strain.","Wang, Jiong; Li, Dongmei; Perry, Sheldon; Hilchey, Shannon P.; Wiltse, Alexander; Treanor, John J.; Sangster, Mark Y.; Zand, Martin S.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406322/,171

22312,2014 ACVIM Forum Research Report Program,2014-05-19,"Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis (Link) Schneider) wax is used for various dermatological and pharmaceutical applications. Several reports have previously shown beneficial properties of Jojoba wax and extracts, including antimicrobial activity. The current research aimed to elucidate the impact of Jojoba wax on skin residential bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), fungal (Malassezia furfur), and virus infection (herpes simplex 1; HSV-1). First, the capacity of four commercial wax preparations to attenuate their growth was evaluated. The results suggest that the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Malassezia furfur was unaffected by Jojoba in pharmacologically relevant concentrations. However, the wax significantly attenuated HSV-1 plaque formation. Next, a complete dose–response analysis of four different Jojoba varieties (Benzioni, Shiloah, Hatzerim, and Sheva) revealed a similar anti-viral effect with high potency (EC(50) of 0.96 ± 0.4 µg/mL) that blocked HSV-1 plaque formation. The antiviral activity of the wax was also confirmed by real-time PCR, as well as viral protein expression by immunohistochemical staining. Chemical characterization of the fatty acid and fatty alcohol composition was performed, showing high similarity between the wax of the investigated varieties. Lastly, our results demonstrate that the observed effects are independent of simmondsin, repeatedly associated with the medicinal impact of Jojoba wax, and that Jojoba wax presence is required to gain protection against HSV-1 infection. Collectively, our results support the use of Jojoba wax against HSV-1 skin infections.","Tietel, Zipora; Melamed, Sarit; Eretz-Kdosha, Noy; Guetta, Ami; Gvirtz, Raanan; Ogen-Shtern, Navit; Dag, Arnon; Cohen, Guy",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8512747/,171

We make 10 specific recommendations: 1) relevant organizations should provide LMIC-specific COPD management guidance; 2) patient and professional organizations must persuade policy-makers of the importance of lung function testing programs in LMICs; 3) healthcare education and training should emphasize the early-life origins of COPD; 4) urgent action is required by governments to reduce airborne exposures, including exposures to tobacco smoke and indoor and outdoor air pollution; 5) guidance for COPD in LMICs should explicitly link across Essential Medicine Lists and the World Health Organization package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings and should consider availability, affordability, sustainability, and cost-effective use of medicines; 6) the pharmaceutical industry should work to make effective COPD and tobacco-dependence medicines globally accessible and affordable; 7) implementation of locally adapted, cost-effective pulmonary rehabilitation programs should be an international priority; 8) the World Health Organization Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases should specify how improvements in respiratory health will be achieved; 9) research funders should increase the proportion of funding allocated to COPD in LMICs; and 10) the respiratory community should leverage the skills and enthusiasm of earlier-career clinicians and researchers to improve global respiratory health.","Hurst, John R.; Buist, A.

26030,"Catastrophic Anachronisms: The Past, Present and Future of Disaster Medicine",2006,"Ageing individuals are immunologically characterized by loss of immunological protection and responsiveness, and autoimmunity occurs with increased incidence. Here we review studies on specific age-related changes in B cell generation, activation, and maintenance as well as characteristics of B cell responses and antibody levels during ageing in relation to other cells and factors that are interwoven with B cell biological processes. In the elderly, fewer new B cells are generated, B cell responsiveness to antigens is impaired, and smaller and fewer germinal centers are formed within an immune response with participation of less potent T cells and follicular dendritic cells, leading to the production of reduced, often insufficient plasma cell numbers. Recall responses in the elderly appear to be limited by the cells’ proliferative capacity. Hence, vaccine responsiveness is often insufficient and autoantibody production emerges in the elderly. In total, B cells appear to be less affected by age as compared with T cells. Recently, new concepts have been developed to counteract immunosenescence beyond active vaccination, comprising the generation of specific monoclonal antibodies for passive vaccination, immune rejuvenation by immunoablation followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, and modulation of lifestyle.","Mei, Henrik E.; Radbruch, Andreas",Immunosenescence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122841/,171

Various precautionary measures are being imposed all over the world which is affecting the routine life of an individual and also the economy worldwide. Although, a definite vaccine is still not known to medical science but they are able to distinguish Covid-19 from the other types of flu. Presently this is being done by detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus using RT-PCR technique as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, Geneva, 2020). Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is a nucleic acid amplification test that converts the RNA into DNA and subsequently amplifies the specific DNA targets. This method was already being employed to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Emery et al. in Emerg Infect Dis 10(2):311, 2004). The entire process of DNA amplification takes place in three steps: denaturation, annealing, and extension for which the sample is required to be maintained at constant temperatures of 95, 55 and 72 °C, respectively. This article introduces the technology to achieve a constant temperature which can be tweaked to develop on-chip RT-PCR.","Duryodhan, V.

34036,Barriers and challenges in the process of including critically ill patients in clinical studies,2020-06-08,"The purpose of this paper is to define a general frame to convert the Conditional Possibility Tables (CPT) of an existing possibilistic network into uncertain gates. In possibilistic networks, CPT parameters must be elicited by an expert but when the number of parents of a variable grows, the number of parameters to elicit grows exponentially. This problem generates difficulties for experts to elicit all parameters because it is time-consuming. One solution consists in using uncertain gates to compute automatically CPTs. This is useful in knowledge engineering. When possibilistic networks already exist, it can be interesting to transform them by using uncertain gates because we can highlight the combination behaviour of the variables. To illustrate our approach, we will present at first a simple example of the estimation for 3 test CPTs with behaviours MIN, MAX and weighted average. Then, we will perform a more significant experimentation which will consist in converting a set of Bayesian networks into possibilistic networks to perform the estimation of CPTs by uncertain gates.","Petiot, Guillaume",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274654/,171

59523,Subconjunctival draining minimally-invasive glaucoma devices for medically uncontrolled glaucoma.,2018,"BACKGROUND Repeat surgery of the chronically dissected aorta following repair of a Type-A acute aortic dissection (AAD) still represents a challenge. The proposed surgical options are as follows: (1) staged procedure with elephant trunk (ET) technique, (2) traditional frozen elephant trunk (FET) intervention, and (3) beating heart cerebral vessel debranching followed by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). However, a marked enlargement of the proximal descending thoracic aorta might make it difficult to perform FET/ET intervention. Furthermore, because in conventional surgery for AAD, a prosthetic graft replacement is generally limited to the ascending aorta, and in repeat surgery, this short Dacron graft rarely provides enough room to allow a beating heart cerebral vessel debranching and obtaining a reliable landing zone for the implantation of a firmly anchored stent graft. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all the five consecutive patients treated in our institution, between 2014 and 2017, for chronic aortic dissection after successful surgical treatment of acute Type-A aortic dissection with graft replacement limited to the ascending aorta. The five patients underwent repair utilizing a modified FET technique with total aortic arch and upper descending aorta exclusion without touching the native dissected aorta. RESULTS No early- or midterm mortality was observed. Mean time interval between the initial and the reoperative procedure was 26 months (range, 3-80 months). No patient had a minor/major neurologic event. Mean circulatory arrest time was 16 minutes (range, 11-25 minutes). Mean follow-up time was 22 months (range, 9-42 months). CONCLUSIONS We report our initial experience with a modified FET technique realized by anastomosing the stent graft with the previously implanted ascending aortic graft in Hishimaru's zone 0 and by rerouting all cerebral vessels without ""touching"" the native chronically dissected aorta. A larger number of patients and a longer follow-up will be required to confirm these initial encouraging results.","Martinelli, Gian Luca; Cotroneo, Attilio; Tolva, Valerio; Armienti, Felice; Bobbio, Mario; Musica, Gabriele; Visetti, Enrico; Tesler, Ugo Filippo",Aorta,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-3402071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074646/,171

This study's aim is to determine the gap between the vaccination willingness and uptake. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a face-to-face questionnaire survey among the persons aged 50-69 years in 13 communities in Shanghai in November-December 2020 to measure vaccination willingness, vaccine price sensitivity, vaccination service accessibility, and vaccine hesitancy. Then, we explored the factors influencing the vaccination uptake using a structural equation model. RESULTS Vaccination willingness was 70.5% (self-paid influenza vaccine), 79.4% (free PPV23 for local persons), 54.7% (self-paid PPV23 for non-local persons), and 16.6% (self-paid HZV); however, actual uptake was 10.8% (influenza vaccine), 11.0% (free PPV23), and 2.5% (self-paid PPV23). Moreover, vaccination uptake was strongly influenced by service accessibility (β = 0.941), followed by willingness (β = 0.201), price sensitivity (β = -0.188), and medical history of vaccine-preventable diseases and underlying diseases (β = 0.176). Related knowledge (β = 0.017) and vaccine hesitancy (β = -0.003) affected the uptake indirectly. CONCLUSION There is a gap between the vaccination willingness and uptake in Chinese elderly. It warrants specific measures, including increasing service accessibility and reforming payment mechanism, to bridge the gap.","Lu, Xinyue; Lu, Jia; Zhang, Liping; Mei, Kewen; Guan, Baichu; Lu, Yihan",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1954910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287096/,171

The prediction of malignancy is an enigma. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between operative measurements and malignancy prognosis of SPTP patients. Methods A cohort of consecutive 102 patients were enrolled in this study. Preoperative measurements and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results Eighteen patients (17.6%) were confirmed as malignant. The malignant SPTP of the optimal cut-off value was 47.9 (p=0.012) for prognostic nutritional index (PNI). The value of PNI≤47.9 and incomplete capsule were significantly correlated with malignancy. Univariate analysis showed that the PNI≤47.9 (p=0.013) and incomplete capsule (p<0.001) were predictors of disease-specific survival (DSS). Multivariate analysis identified the PNI≤47.9 (p=0.036) and incomplete capsule (p=0.023) as the independent prognostic factors of DSS. The new score of 0,1,2 based on PNI and capsule presence stratified the patients into 3 groups. The patients with low PNI and incomplete capsule achieved the worst prognosis. Conclusion The combination test of operative PNI and capsule presence would be a reliable indicator of the aggressive natural history of SPTP.","Song, He; Dong, Ming",Cancer management and research,https://doi.org/10.2147/cmar.s256650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765072/,171

This study will explore the role of miR-342/MAPK1 axis in regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. We found miR-342 was downregulated in LPS-induced A549 cells compared with control group with DMSO, accompanied by elevated inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis. Overexpression of miR-342 reduced LPS-induced inflammatory responses and apoptosis in LPS-stimulated A549 cells, and had a protective role in LPS-treated mice with ALI by decreasing levels of inflammatory cytokines, improving survival of mice with ALI, and ameliorating the lung permeability. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that miR-342 regulated the expression of MAPK1 by directly targeting its 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR). Mechanistically, MAPK1 silencing abrogated LPS-induced inflammatory injury in A549 cells, and partially enhanced the protective effect of miR-342. Therefore, miR-342 attenuates LPS-induced ALI by targeting MAPK1 expression, thereby protecting against A549 cell injury induced by LPS and lung injury of mice with ALI.","Zhu, Siliang; Song, Wenke; Sun, Yanqi; Zhou, Yongqin; Kong, Fanpo",Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1440-1681.13315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32248545/,171
62935,Exercise for reducing falls in people living with and beyond cancer.,2018,"Common mental health problems of anxiety and depression affect significant proportions of the global population. Within the UK, and increasingly across western countries, a key policy response has been the introduction of high volume, low intensity psychological assessment and treatment services, such as the NHS's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service, the largest service delivery model yet to be implemented at a national level (England). IAPT may be delivered in face-to-face meetings or over the telephone, as well as through other media. In order to increase access and achieve wide reach with efficient use of resources, IAPT's service models utilise relatively structured and standardised protocols, whilst aiming simultaneously to deliver a tailored and personalised experience for patients. Previous research has revealed that this can be a challenging balance for front-line practitioners to strike. Here we report research into the telephone delivery of guided self-help, low intensity interventions within IAPT, examining the challenges faced in remote delivery when combining structure with personalisation during assessment and treatment sessions. We show the ways in which the lack of flexibility in adhering to a system-driven structure can displace, defer or disrupt the emergence of the patient's story, thereby compromising the personalisation and responsiveness of the service. Our study contributes new insights to our understanding of the association between personalisation, engagement and patient experience within high volume, low-intensity psychological treatment services. Our research on the telephone delivery of IAPT is particularly timely in view of the current global Covid-19 health crisis, as a result of which face-to-face delivery of IAPT has had to be (temporarily) suspended.","Drew, P; Irvine, A; Barkham, M; Faija, C; Gellatly, J; Ardern, K; Armitage, J C; Brooks, H; Rushton, K; Welsh, C; Bower, P; Bee, P",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934041/,171

Many guilds of nematodes exist-ranging from the free-living Caenorhabditis elegans to various parasitic species such as entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), which are parasites of insects. Despite ecological differences, previous research has shown that both EPNs and C. elegans respond to prenol (3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol), an odor associated with EPN-infections. However, it is unclear how C. elegans responds to prenol. By utilizing natural variation and genetic neuron ablation to investigate the response of C. elegans to prenol, we found that the AWC neurons are involved in the detection of prenol and that several genes (including dcap-1, dcap-2, and clec-39) influence response to this odorant. Furthermore, we identified that the response to prenol is mediated by the canonically proposed pathway required for other AWC-sensed attractants. However, upon testing genetically diverse isolates, we found that the response of some strains to prenol differed from their response to isoamyl alcohol (IAA), suggesting that the pathways mediating response to these two odorants may be genetically distinct. Further, evaluations leveraging natural variation and genome wide association revealed specific genes that influence nematode behavior and provide a foundation for future studies to better understand the role of prenol in nematode behavioral ecology.","Baiocchi, Tiffany; Anesko, Kyle; Mercado, Nathan; Park, Heenam; Kin, Kassandra; Strickhouser-Monzon, Brandon; Robles, Priscila; Bowman, Christian; Wang, Han; Sternberg, Paul W; Dillman, Adler R",Genetics,https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.120.303280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680884/,171

Thiol-disulfide homeostasis as a marker of oxidative stress was analyzed before the IUD insertion and on the 6th month after insertion. Results: The LNG-IUD group had similar native thiol levels with Cu-IUD (293.1 ± 43.5 µmol/l vs. 290.4 ± 42.4 µmol/l respectively, p = 819). In the copper-IUD group total thiol levels were higher than LNG-IUD group (345.5 ± 58.2 µmol/l vs. 319.5 ± 52.4 µmol/l, p = .031).

Similar to the treatment of individual components, pathogen inactivation (PI) technologies are available to treat WB. The impact of PI on WB function is not well understood. This study investigated the impact of PI of WB with riboflavin/ultraviolet (UV) light on its hemostatic function by modeling transfusion scenarios for trauma patients and assessing transfusion efficacy by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). As fibrinogen is affected by PI of WB, the effect of fibrinogen supplementation commonly used in trauma patients was also analyzed in this model. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Trauma transfusion scenarios were simulated by mixing untreated WB or WB treated with the Mirasol PI technology (riboflavin/UV) in different ratios with hemodiluted blood, and the thromboelasticity was monitored by ROTEM. The impact of supplementation with the fibrinogen concentrate RiaSTAP was investigated in this model. RESULTS Pathogen-inactivated WB (PI-WB) showed decreased activity in the hemostatic profile compared to the untreated control. Hemodiluted blood at a hematocrit (hct) of 20%, which was reconstituted with PI-WB or untreated WB, exhibited increased alpha values, maximum clot firmness, and clot formation time. Simulating transfusion scenarios by blood replacement with PI-WB resulted in a significant difference in ROTEM parameters between reconstituted PI-treated and -untreated WB (p ≥ .05). The effect of PI treatment waned when PI-WB was enriched with fibrinogen. CONCLUSION ROTEM investigations suggest that PI treatment has a negative impact on WB clot formation unless fibrinogen supplementation is used.","Arbaeen, Ahmad F; Schubert, Peter; Sheffield, William P; Devine, Dana V",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745131/,171
66316,Xerostomia and Taste Alterations in COVID-19.,2020-12-23,"INTRODUCTION Globally, health information technologies are now being used by nurses in a variety of settings. However, nurse leaders often do not have the necessary strategic and tactical informatics competencies to adequately ensure their effective adoption and use. Although informatics competencies and competency frameworks have been identified and developed, to date there has not been review or consolidation of the work completed in this area. In order to address this gap, a scoping review is being conducted. The objectives of this scoping review are to: (1) identify informatics competencies of relevance to nurse leaders, (2) identify frameworks or theories that have been used to develop informatics competencies for nurse leaders, (3) identify instruments used to assess the informatics competencies of nurse leaders and (4) examine the psychometric properties of identified instruments. METHODS Using the Arksey and O'Malley five-step framework, a literature review will be conducted using a scoping review methodology. The search will encompass academic and grey literature and include two primary databases and five secondary databases. Identified studies and documents will be independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers. Data from the studies and documents will be extracted and compiled into a chart. Qualitative data will be subject to a thematic analysis and descriptive statistics applied to the quantitative data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval was not required for this study.

METHODS From January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2014, we collected retrospective data from patients with large incisional hernias (IHs). Laparoscopic IH repair is performed by applying a three-dimensional polyester knit structure mesh with a resorbable collagen barrier on peritoneal side (Parietex™ Composite Mesh; Covidien, New Haven, CT). Patients were divided into three groups according to the different fixation devices. The mean follow-up was 19 (12-156) months. RESULTS The mean defect size was 12.83 cm (10-26 cm) and the mean body mass index was 30.8 kg/m2 (26-39 kg/m2). The EMS stapler™ was used on 260 patients, the Protack® on 210 patients, and the AbsorbaTack™ on 30 patients. The mean operative time was 69.9 minutes (38-130 minutes). Intraoperative morbidity rate was 1.6% (8 cases). Early reoperation rate was 0.2% (1 case). The mean length of hospital stay was 2.3 days (range 2-7 days). Seromas were observed in 20 patients (4.0%) and neuralgia in 10 patients (2.0%). Recurrence was observed in 12 patients (2.4%) with the majority in the absorbable tack group (10%). There were no conversions (0%) to open technique. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic approach seems to be safe and appropriate for treatment of MIH. The Parietex composite mesh we used guarantees excellent intraabdominal laparoscopic repair of abdominal wall defects. Absorbatack system seems to give less postoperative neuralgia, but it is related to a high recurrence rate. Protack system seems to give more postoperative neuralgia than the Endopath EMS. In our experience, the best fixation system is the latter.","Caruso, Francesco; Ciccarese, Francesca; Cesana, Giovanni; Uccelli, Matteo; Castello, Giorgio; Olmi, Stefano",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

68783,Tea tree oil for Demodex blepharitis.,2020-06-20,"OBJECTIVES Health and job satisfaction are key independent determinants of ability to work to older ages. We investigated the interaction of these two important factors on health-related job loss (HRJL) over 2 years of follow-up comparing male and female older workers. METHODS A population sample of adults aged 50-64 years, recruited from 24 English general practices in the Health and Employment After Fifty (HEAF) study, completed questionnaires at baseline with follow-ups at 12 and 24 months. Multiple-record Cox proportional hazards models were performed to explore the main effects of, and potential interactions between, job satisfaction and self-rated health (SRH) as predictors of time to first HRJL. RESULTS Of the initial 8134 participants, 5143 were ever in work in the study period. Among men, 5.7% and 14.3% reported job dissatisfaction (those in good and poor SRH, respectively), while among women these percentages were 4.6 and 12.9. HRJL was reported by 106 men and 176 women. Men in good health dissatisfied with their job had a sixfold (HR=6.4; 95% CI 3.3 to 12.4) increased risk of HRJL compared with men satisfied with their job (significant multiplicative interaction). Women dissatisfied with their job were more likely to have an HRJL within 2 years of follow-up irrespective of their SRH. CONCLUSIONS SRH and job dissatisfaction have important individual effects on the risk of stopping work for health among older workers. These findings point to the importance of job satisfaction in reducing health-related exit from paid work among older workers.","D'Angelo, Stefania; Syddall, Holly; Ntani, Georgia; Harris, E Clare; Linaker, Cathy; Cooper, Cyrus; Stevens, Martin; Walker-Bone, Karen",Occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2020-106600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917741/,171

Their discrimination can be problematic however due to their isomeric natue. This study demonstrates a systematic investigation of the fragmentations of l-leucine, l-isoleucine and l-allo-isoleucine in combination with a thorough theoretical rationalisation. Collision induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) of all three amino acids were collected under a range of different collision energies to identify spontaneous and sequential fragmentation processes. We demonstrate that the three structural isomers can be distinguished by their CID MS/MS spectra, and additional computational modelling is used to rationalise these differences.","Jiang, Candy; Arthur, Christopher J; Gates, Paul J",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0an00778a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797137/,171

This review summarizes the potential benefit of their use for the critically ill. RECENT FINDINGS Increased clinical evidence from randomized clinical trials of biomarker-guided treatment suggests a trend for appropriate but short antimicrobial treatment for the critically ill. Procalcitonin (PCT) is the most studied biomarker; in the majority of randomized clinical trials, the use of a stopping rule of antibiotics on the day when PCT is below 80% from baseline or less than 0.5 ng/ml was proven effective to reduce length of antimicrobial treatment, antibiotic-associated adverse events and infectious complications like infections by multidrug-resistant organisms and Clostridium difficile. Survival benefit was also noted.

74130,Garlic for the common cold.,2014,"Subclinical inflammation has been associated with psychosis; however, it remains unknown whether this phenomenon appears also in the premorbid phase. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing peripheral blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines between individuals at risk of psychosis and controls. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that the levels of these markers may be different in high-risk converters versus non-converters. Two independent reviewers searched electronic databases until Dec 16th, 2020. After reviewing publication records, 16 studies (548 high-risk individuals and 559 controls) were included. Random-effects meta-analyses with Hedges' g as the effect size estimate were performed. Individuals at clinical risk of psychosis had significantly higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared to controls (g = 0.33, 95%CI: 0.06-0.60, p = 0.018). Heterogeneity was not significant in this subgroup analysis. Changes in the levels of IL-6 in subjects at familial risk of psychosis were not significant (g = 0.04, 95%CI: -0.24 to 0.31, p = 0.798). The use of antidepressants was associated with significantly higher levels of IL-6 in high-risk individuals (Beta = 1.56, 95%CI: 0.60-2.53, p = 0.001). No significant differences in the levels of immune-inflammatory markers were found between high-risk converters and non-converters. Our findings suggest that individuals at clinical risk of psychosis show subclinical inflammation in terms of elevated IL-6 levels. This phenomenon might be related to the use of antidepressants. The present meta-analysis does not support the usefulness of single immune-inflammatory markers in predicting transition to psychosis.","Misiak, Błażej; Bartoli, Francesco; Carrà, Giuseppe; Stańczykiewicz, Bartłomiej; Gładka, Anna; Frydecka, Dorota; Samochowiec, Jerzy; Jarosz, Konrad; Hadryś, Tomasz; Miller, Brian J",Psychoneuroendocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740587/,171

Some were transferred to the newly formed COVID-19 wards in a large Danish hospital, were given new tasks, and had to collaborate with new colleagues, while treating a new deadly and contagious disease. This study aimed to describe the reflections and experiences of the nursing staff attending supervision sessions. The palliative unit offered supervision from April 2020. A total of 9 supervision sessions were held as part of this study, and 57 nursing staff members participated in the sessions. The supervision was available to employees until the first COVID wave subsided in June 2020. During each session, supervisors took field notes and wrote field memos. The topics raised by the nursing staff during the supervision sessions ranged between pride and uncertainty. Nursing staff in COVID-19 wards were at risk of feeling an increasing burden, and there was a need for ongoing managerial attention as well as continuous visible presence and support.","Marsaa, Kristoffer; Mendahl, Janni; Heilman, Henriette; Johansson, Hélène; Husum, Mette; Lippert, Dorthe; Sandholm, Niels; Konradsen, Hanne",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/njh.0000000000000722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633094/,171
75169,Effect of anesthesia depth on postoperative clinical outcome in patients with supratentorial tumor (DEPTH): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,2017,"Background/Aim Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a commonly encountered emergency where early identification of complicated cases is important. Inflammatory markers like lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are simple and readily available markers. In this study, we evaluated the utility of these markers in the early identification of patients with complicated AP. Patients and Methods All patients with a diagnosis of AP admitted to the University Medical Center in Las Vegas/Nevada between August 2015 and September 2018 were identified using ICD-10 codes. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Epidemiological measures and their associated confidence intervals were calculated using MedCalc (v. 18). Results The LMR showed a significant difference between groups, with the non-complicated cases consistently higher than the complicated cases but without significant temporal differences. The NLR showed a significant difference with a significant temporal relation. Using the bound of the 95% confidence interval separating the two groups, LMR <2 was found to be associated with a complicated case and NLR >10.5 was suggestive of a complicated case. High specificity (85-92%) with low sensitivity (23-69%) was noted; hence, these cut points were very good at discerning non-complicated cases. Conclusion Our data show persistently low LMR that is associated with severe AP and a value of <2.0 can be used clinically to predict severe AP on admission. It also shows that elevated NLR is associated with complicated AP and prolonged hospital stay with a value >10.5 that can be used to predict severe complicated AP and to monitor response to treatment over time.","Mubder, Mohamad; Dhindsa, Banreet; Nguyen, Danny; Saghir, Syed; Cross, Chad; Makar, Ranjit; Ohning, Gordon",Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,https://doi.org/10.4103/sjg.sjg_49_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719240/,171
77396,Error in Results Section.,2019-12-30,"Development of protein 3-D structural comparison methods is essential for understanding protein functions. Some amino acids share structural similarities while others vary considerably. These structures determine the chemical and physical properties of amino acids. Grouping amino acids with similar structures potentially improves the ability to identify structurally conserved regions and increases the global structural similarity between proteins. We systematically studied the effects of amino acid grouping on the numbers of Specific/specific, Common/common, and statistically different keys to achieve a better understanding of protein structure relations. Common keys represent substructures found in all types of proteins and Specific keys represent substructures exclusively belonging to a certain type of proteins in a data set. Our results show that applying amino acid grouping to the Triangular Spatial Relationship (TSR)-based method, while computing structural similarity among proteins, improves the accuracy of protein clustering in certain cases. In addition, applying amino acid grouping facilitates the process of identification or discovery of conserved structural motifs. The results from the principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrate that applying amino acid grouping captures slightly more structural variation than when amino acid grouping is not used, indicating that amino acid grouping reduces structure diversity as predicted. The TSR-based method uniquely identifies and discovers binding sites for drugs or interacting proteins. The binding sites of nsp16 of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that we have defined will aid future antiviral drug design for improving therapeutic outcome. This approach for incorporating the amino acid grouping feature into our structural comparison method is promising and provides a deeper insight into understanding of structural relations of proteins.","Sarkar, Titli; Raghavan, Vijay V; Chen, Feng; Riley, Andrew; Zhou, Sophia; Xu, Wu",Computational biology and chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2021.107479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951604/,171

In addition to carbohydrate, dietary protein has been shown to contribute to postprandial glycaemic excursions with recommendations to consider protein when calculating mealtime insulin doses. The aim of this review is to identify and synthesize evidence about the glycaemic impact of dietary protein and insulin requirements for individuals with Type 1 diabetes. METHODS A systematic literature search of relevant biomedical databases was performed to identify research on the glycaemic impact of dietary protein when consumed alone, and in combination with other macronutrients in individuals with Type 1 diabetes. RESULTS The review included 14 published studies dated from 1992 to 2018, and included studies that researched the impact of protein alone (n = 2) and protein in a mixed meal (n = 12). When protein was consumed alone a glycaemic effect was not seen until ≥ 75 g. In a carbohydrate-containing meal ≥ 12.5 g of protein impacted the postprandial glucose. Inclusion of fat in a high-protein meal enhanced the glycaemic response and further increased insulin requirements. The timing of the glycaemic effect from dietary protein ranged from 90 to 240 min. Studies indicate that the postprandial glycaemic response and insulin requirements for protein are different when protein is consumed alone or with carbohydrate and/or fat. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review provides evidence that dietary protein contributes to postprandial glycaemic excursions and insulin requirements. These insights have important implications for the education of people with Type 1 diabetes and highlights the need for more effective insulin dosing strategies for mixed macronutrient meals.

It is caused by disruption in any part of the mitral valve apparatus. Surgical intervention remains the mainstay of management for severe cases. CASE SUMMARY We are reporting a case of pneumonia with severe sepsis, that had a complicated hospital course. The patient developed multi-organ failure. Echocardiography on admission showed severe mitral regurgitation. He required early mechanical ventilation and then Veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV-ECMO) over 29 days. He might be the first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in our hospital. Mitral valve replacement was done after stabilization of the patient and weaning from the ECMO. DISCUSSION Our report demonstrates that the use of a long term VV-ECMO as a bridge for stabilization, facilitates management of the critically ill respiratory failure patient with severe MR and patient outcomes. Still the long-term results and the optimal timing of intervention need more research to define. CONCLUSION Our report demonstrates that the use of a long term VV ECMO facilitates management of patients with respiratory failure associated with severe MR. Future studies focusing on stabilizing such patients, might help to define the optimal timing for intervention in these patients and the long-term outcome.","Abdalghafoor, Tamer; Sarhan, Hatem; Kindawi, Ali",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/02676591211003237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33779404/,171

82484,Upregulation of ACE/ACE2 Balance in Nasal Mucosa: A Working Hypothesis to Explain the Absence of Nasal Inflammatory Symptoms in COVID-19 Disease.,2021-06-15,"Aluminium is a ubiquitous element that occurs naturally in the soil making human exposure to it is unavoidable. It is implicated in the aetiology of different neurodegenerative diseases and can induce liver injury. In addition, insulin resistance (IR) plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and the progression of liver disorders. The increased consumption of fructose contained in soft drinks and western pattern diet results in IR that along with the wide distribution of aluminium make the concurrent exposure conceivable and increase the risk of liver injury. Therefore, the present study explores the hepatotoxic effects of aluminium and fructose administered concurrently and evaluates the possible protection by monoammonium glycyrrhizinate (MAG). Liver injury was induced by the administration of aluminium chloride (34 mg/kg/day) plus 10% (w/v) fructose in drinking water. Male rats were treated with either MAG (40 mg/kg/day) or silymarin (SIL, 100 mg/kg/day). The concurrent administration of aluminium and fructose (FRUAL) induced liver injury manifested as a significant elevation of serum liver enzymes and bilirubin, as well as reduction of albumin level and prothrombin time. On the other hand, the administration of MAG improved the FRUAL-induced aberrations of liver function tests and hepatic cytoarchitecture. We assume that the MAG-induced suppression of oxidative stress, toll-like receptor 4 pathway activation, inflammation, and apoptosis play a crucial role in the hepatoprotective effect of MAG in this model. Intriguingly, the hepatoprotective effect MAG against FRUAL-induced liver injury surpasses that of the gold standard SIL, suggesting MAG as a better alternative to SIL.","Zakaria, Sarah; Hasan, Rehab A; Mahmoud, Mona F; El Fayoumi, Hassan M; Mahmoud, Amr A A",Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1440-1681.13257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31944346/,171
84996,Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Incidence during COVID-19 Pandemic in Southern Germany.,2020-10-31,"BACKGROUND Immune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with unique immune-related adverse events (irAEs). As most of the immune checkpoint inhibitors are new to the market, it is important to conduct studies using real-world data sources to investigate their safety profiles. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to develop a framework for signal detection and filtration of novel irAEs for 6 Food and Drug Administration-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors. METHODS In our framework, we first used the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) standardized in an Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) common data model (CDM) to collect immune checkpoint inhibitor-related event data and conducted irAE signal detection. OHDSI CDM is a standard-driven data model that focuses on transforming different databases into a common format and standardizing medical terms to a common representation. We then filtered those already known irAEs from drug labels and literature by using a customized text-mining pipeline based on clinical text analysis and knowledge extraction system with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) as a dictionary. Finally, we classified the irAE detection results into three different categories to discover potentially new irAE signals. RESULTS By our text-mining pipeline, 490 irAE terms were identified from drug labels, and 918 terms were identified from the literature. In addition, of the 94 positive signals detected using CDM-based FAERS, 53 signals (56%) were labeled signals, 10 (11%) were unlabeled published signals, and 31 (33%) were potentially new signals. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that our approach is effective for irAE signal detection and filtration. Moreover, our CDM-based framework could facilitate adverse drug events detection and filtration toward the goal of next-generation pharmacovigilance that seamlessly integrates electronic health record data for improved signal detection.","Yu, Yue; Ruddy, Kathryn; Mansfield, Aaron; Zong, Nansu; Wen, Andrew; Tsuji, Shintaro; Huang, Ming; Liu, Hongfang; Shah, Nilay; Jiang, Guoqian",JMIR medical informatics,https://doi.org/10.2196/17353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530430/,171

Although the majority of dogs and cats are subclinically infected, some will develop mild to moderate enteritis. Immature animals, animals from intensive housing backgrounds, and animals with concurrent disease are especially predisposed to infection and the development of clinical signs. Bacterial culture methods applied in diagnostic laboratories remain biased to C. jejuni and C. coli detection, but molecular methods to diagnose Campylobacter spp. infections in dogs and cats have become widely available and can aid rapid and accurate diagnosis. Multilocus sequence typing has also been developed for subtyping different strains and has been used in epidemiological investigations. In the majority of cases, clinical signs are self-limiting and antimicrobial treatment is not warranted. Campylobacter spp. isolated from dogs and cats have shown resistance to commonly used antimicrobials, so antimicrobial therapy should only be administered where this is justified. Contact with dogs and cats is a recognised risk factor for human campylobacteriosis, thus people living or working in close contact with cats and dogs should be made aware of the zoonotic organisms these animals can shed.","Acke, E",New Zealand veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2018.1475268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29756542/,171

91835,Surgery for small asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms.,2020-07-01,"Immunoadhesins are engineered proteins combining the constant domain (Fc) of an antibody with a ligand-binding (adhesion) domain. They have significant potential as therapeutic agents, because they maintain the favourable pharmacokinetics of antibodies with an expanded repertoire of ligand-binding domains: proteins, peptides, or small molecules. We have recently reported that the addition of a cholesterol group to two HIV antibodies can dramatically improve their antiviral potency. Cholesterol, which can be conjugated at various positions in the antibody, including the constant (Fc) domain, endows the conjugate with affinity for the membrane lipid rafts, thus increasing its concentration at the site where viral entry occurs. Here, we extend this strategy to an HIV immunoadhesin, combining a cholesterol-conjugated Fc domain with the peptide fusion inhibitor C41. The immunoadhesin C41-Fc-chol displayed high affinity for Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells, and when tested on a panel of HIV-1 strains, it was considerably more potent than the unconjugated C41-Fc construct. Potentiation of antiviral activity was comparable to what was previously observed for the cholesterol-conjugated HIV antibodies. Given the key role of cholesterol in lipid raft formation and viral fusion, we expect that the same strategy should be broadly applicable to enveloped viruses, for many of which it is already known the sequence of a peptide fusion inhibitor similar to C41. Moreover, the sequence of heptad repeat-derived fusion inhibitors can often be predicted from genomic information alone, opening a path to immunoadhesins against emerging viruses.","Urbanowicz, Richard A; Lacek, Krzysztof; Lahm, Armin; Bienkowska-Szewczyk, Krystyna; Ball, Jonathan K; Nicosia, Alfredo; Cortese, Riccardo; Pessi, Antonello",Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/psc.2802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26292842/,171

Grapevine leafroll-associated virus type 3 (GLRaV-3) has a close association with the disease and is prevalent in South African vineyards. GLD can be controlled using a combination of virus-free planting material, systemic insecticides to control vector populations and removal of infected vines by roguing. Infected vines are identified each autumn using either symptom display (in red cultivars) or ELISA (in white cultivars). While ELISA is a simple, reliable means of testing for GLRaV-3, it is time consuming, laborious and insensitive and a quicker, more sensitive method of detecting GLRaV-3 in the field is needed. A single-tube one-step reverse transcription (RT) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay combined with a simple RNA extraction protocol was developed for the rapid and easy detection of GLRaV-3. Hydroxy napthol blue was included as an indicator and under isothermal conditions at 60 °C the target viral gene could be amplified in under 2h and positive results could be easily seen by examining the colour change from violet to sky blue. Using this method, 50 samples could be also pooled together with a single positive sample still being detected. A direct comparison of ELISA, nested PCR and RT-LAMP showed that RT-LAMP is as sensitive as nested PCR and could be performed in a much shorter time with less equipment.

96347,Alvimopan for recovery of bowel function after radical cystectomy.,2017,"BACKGROUND The World Health Organization has declared the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. Given the sudden infection from and extensive dispersion of COVID-19 and the absence of specific drugs, those infected are in danger if they are not treated in time. Consequently, COVID-19 has become an important factor influencing adolescents' mental health. The purpose of this study is to explore the intervention effect of the integration model on the negative emotions of adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Adolescents were randomly selected from five middle schools in Zhejiang Province of China from May 2020 to July 2020. First, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and Psychological Well-Being Scale were used for measurement. Then, 72 patients with moderate and severe anxiety symptoms were chosen as the research objects, and the intervention and comparison time was determined to be eight weeks. The subjects were randomly divided into the experiment group (35 members) and the control group (34 members). The integration model was employed on the experiment group. RESULTS Grade, physical condition, and sleep time are important factors influencing the anxiety level of adolescents during the COVID-19 period, and the anxiety risk of adolescents is higher during their third year of junior high school. After the intervention, the SAS score of the experiment group is lower than that of the control group, and the decrease in the SAS score is higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the positive emotion score of the experiment group is higher than that of the control group, and the negative emotion score of the former is lower than that of the latter. The variances in the positive and negative emotion scores are higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). The variance in the overall well-being index is also greater in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION The intervention using the integrated model can significantly reduce negative emotions such as anxiety, increase positive emotions, and improve the overall well-being of adolescents during the epidemic period.","Chen, Jun; Sang, Guoqiang; Zhang, Yu; Jiang, Aifeng",Psychiatria Danubina,https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.86; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33857051/,171

96651,Prof. Sandip Kumar Ray.,2020,"Fistula in ano is a very common presentation to colorectal clinic. Embarrassment due to the symptoms makes accurate estimations of incidence difficult. It is estimated that up to 40% of peri-anal abscess will be accompanied by or preceded by a fistula. Fistulae can be classified into simple fistulae that involve no or minimal sphincter muscle and complex, which involve significant amounts of the anal sphincter muscle, possibly with multiple tracts. For complex fistulae a seton suture is usually placed through the tract and out through the anus to form a loop allowing pockets of sepsis to drain internally and externally and a mature tract of fibrous tissue to develop. Following this period definitive fistula treatment is considered. This can involve a number of procedures that have tremendously varied success rates in the literature. The first stage of surgical treatment is often a core fistulectomy, which entails surgical removal of the tract. This may be followed by insertion of fibrin glue, a collagen plug or formation of a rotation skin flap from surrounding tissue in order to close the resultant tissue defect. All current treatments have a significant failure rate. If this wound breaks down the surgery can leave a large painful peri-anal wound that can lead to ongoing fistulation. Should this occur resiting of the seton will be required with the patient only getting back to square one after months of healing around the seton. In addition removing cores of fibrous tissue passing through the sphincter can threaten the sphincter function resulting in impaired continence. Having seen radiofrequency ablation used to close varicose veins the authors propose that one could use similar techniques to close a fibrous tract matured with a seton in order to close a fistula. The authors propose that a short length radiofrequency catheter could be used to treat fistula in ano. This would in theory be less painful with less tissue destruction. In addition there would be no necessity for extensive incisions. As the energy penetration can be controlled the procedure will be safe even if it fails, without causing a large wound or tissue necrosis. All other treatment options will still be available.","Keogh, Kenneth M; Smart, Neil J",Medical hypotheses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2015.11.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26804594/,171
98957,Nasal Pressure Injuries During the COVID-19 Epidemic.,2020-04-30,"Background Viral load and shedding duration are highly associated with the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, limited studies have reported on viral load or shedding in children and adolescents infected with sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Purpose This study aimed to investigate the natural course of viral load in asymptomatic or mild pediatric cases. Methods Thirty-one children (<18 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were hospitalized and enrolled in this study. Viral loads were evaluated in nasopharyngeal swab samples using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (E, RdRp, N genes). Ct values were measured when patients met the clinical criteria to be released from quarantine. Results The mean age of the patients was 9.8 years, 18 (58%) had mild disease, and 13 (42%) were asymptomatic. Most children were infected by adult family members, most commonly by their mothers. The most common symptoms were fever and sputum (26%), followed by cough and runny nose. Nine patients (29%) had a high or intermediate viral load (Ct value≤30) when they had no clinical symptoms. Viral load showed no difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Viral rebounds were found in 15 cases (48%), which contributed to prolonged viral detection. The mean duration of viral detection was 25.6 days. Viral loads were significantly lower in patients with viral rebounds than in those with no rebound (E, p=0.003; RdRp, p=0.01; N, p=0.02). Conclusion Our study showed that many pediatric patients with COVID-19 experienced viral rebound and showed viral detection for more than 3 weeks. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between viral rebound and infectiousness in COVID-19.","Chu, Mi Ae; Jang, Yoon Young; Lee, Dong Won; Kim, Sung Hoon; Ryoo, Namhee; Park, Sunggyun; Lee, Jae Hee; Chung, Hai Lee",Clinical and experimental pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3345/cep.2020.02033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645257/,171

Acceptable positive surgical margin rates, thorough extended lymph node dissection based on tenets of oncological principles and acceptable short-term oncologic outcomes have been reported. Learning curve towards safe incorporation of intracorporeal urinary diversion and its evolution are presented. SUMMARY The technical tips and tricks have led to evolution of technique translating into improved surgical outcomes. RARC is a well tolerated and effective alternative to open cystectomy and urinary diversion. Intracorporeal urinary diversion is the next challenge on the horizon with an acceptable learning curve and outcomes; this evolution will lead to improvement in quality of life after this morbid surgical procedure.","Poch, Michael A; Raza, Johar; Nyquist, John; Guru, Khurshid A",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0b013e32835b65e9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23202288/,171

99886,Perioperative Psychological Interventions in Heart Surgery.,2021-05-17,"OBJECTIVE This study assessed thyroid function in patients affected by the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), based on the hypothesis that the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 may influence thyroid function and/or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may directly act on thyroid cells, such as previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1 infection. DESIGN AND METHODS This single-center study was retrospective and consisted in evaluating thyroid function tests and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) values in 287 consecutive patients (193 males, mean age 64.3±14.0 years, range: 27-92), hospitalized for COVID-19 in non-intensive care units. RESULTS Fifty-eight patients (20.2%) were found with thyrotoxicosis (overt in 31 cases), 15 (5.2%) with hypothyroidism (overt in only 2 cases), 214 (74.6%) with normal thyroid function. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) values were inversely correlated with age of patients (rho -0.27; p<0.001) and IL-6 (rho -0.41; p<0.001). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, thyrotoxicosis resulted to be significantly associated with higher IL-6 (odds ratio 3.25, 95% confidence interval 1.97-5.36; p<0.001), whereas the association with age of patients was lost (p=0.09). CONCLUSIONS This study provides a first evidence that COVID-19 may be associated with high risk of thyrotoxicosis in relationship with systemic immune activation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lania, Andrea; Sandri, Maria Teresa; Cellini, Miriam; Mirani, Marco; Lavezzi, Elisabetta; Mazziotti, Gherardo",European journal of endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1530/eje-20-0335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32698147/,171

Two cases were pubic symphysis diastasis, 15 were anterior ring fracture (7 were bilateral), and 1 was vertical displacement of pubic symphysis associated with pubic ramus fracture. According to Tile classification, 8, 4, and 6 cases were types C1, C2, and C3, respectively. All patients accepted the operation of pelvic fractures on both rings, while the anterior ring injuries were treated with minimally invasive internal fixation. The period from injury to operation was 5 to 32 days (11.2 ± 3.7). Four patients had pubic symphysis diastasis or pelvic anterior ring fracture medial obturator foramen reduced with modified Pfannenstiel incision and fixed with cannulated screws, 14 patients (22 fractures) had a fractured lateral obturator foramen reduced with modified Pfannenstiel incision associated with small iliac crest incision and fixed with locking reconstruction plates. Clinical data, such as operation time, intraoperative bleeding, Matta standard to assess the reduction quality of fracture, and complications, were collected and analyzed.The operation time ranged from 30 to 65 minutes (42.8 ± 18.7), and the intraoperative bleeding volume was 30 to 150 mL (66.5 ± 22.8). All cases were continuously followed-up for 16 to 42 months (30.2 ± 4.6). All fractures were healed between 3 and 9 months postoperatively (4.9 ± 2.7 months). According to the Matta standard assessment, 18, 7, and 1 cases were excellent, good, and fair, respectively, with a 96.2% (25/26) rate of satisfaction. Neither reduction loss, fixation failure, nor infection occurred; complications included 1 patient with fatal liquefaction, 1 patient had lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury, and 1 patient complained of discomfort in the inguinal area due to fixation stimulation.Minimally invasive internal fixation for pelvic anterior ring injury in Tile C pelvic fracture has the advantages of less damage, safer manipulation, less complications, and good prognosis.","Sun, Xiaochen; Yan, Huimin; Wang, Jianmin; Liu, Zhaojie; Tian, Wei; Jia, Jian",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32791662/,171

In total, 337 participants completed four self-report questionnaires: selected subscales of the World Health Organisation's COVID-19 Behavioural Insights Tool, UCLA Loneliness Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Beck Hopelessness Scale. In addition to descriptive statistics and intercorrelations, structural equation modelling was used to compare three models of the potential role (predictor or moderator/mediator) that the three abovementioned COVID-19-related variables could play in psychological wellbeing. The results showed high levels of psychological distress among the current sample. Generally, better knowledge of COVID-19 and engaging in protective behaviours were found to be related to lower levels of psychological distress, whereas increased risk perception was found to be associated with increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. It was also found that behaviour mediated the effect of knowledge on psychological wellbeing, suggesting that while publicising information about COVID-19 remains necessary, providing the public with a means to engage in protective behaviours is central for promoting psychological wellbeing.","Padmanabhanunni, Anita; Pretorius, Tyrone",Psychological reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941211025269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152883/,171

This review sought to identify prognostic factors of depression or depressive symptoms up to 1 year after hip fracture surgery in adults. This review also sought to describe proposed underlying mechanisms for their association with depression or depressive symptoms. METHODS We searched for published (MEDLINE, Embase, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Web of Science Core Collection) and unpublished (OpenGrey, Greynet, BASE, conference proceedings) studies. We did not impose any date, geographical, or language limitations. Screening (Covidence), extraction (Checklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies, adapted for use with prognostic factors studies Checklist), and quality appraisal (Quality in Prognosis Studies tool) were completed in duplicate. Results were summarised narratively. RESULTS In total, 37 prognostic factors were identified from 12 studies included in this review. The quality of the underlying evidence was poor, with all studies at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Most factors did not have a proposed mechanism for the association. Where factors were investigated by more than one study, the evidence was often conflicting. CONCLUSION Due to conflicting and low quality of available evidence it is not possible to make clinical recommendations based on factors prognostic of depression or depressive symptoms after hip fracture. Further high-quality research investigating prognostic factors is warranted to inform future intervention and/or stratified approaches to care after hip fracture.

103236,Cost-Effective Microscopic Draping: COVID-19 Umbrella.,2021-03-26,"INTRODUCTION Quorum-sensing (QS) is a microbial cell-to-cell communication system that utilizes small signaling molecules to mediates interactions between cross-kingdom microorganisms, including Gram-positive and -negative microbes. QS molecules include N-acyl-homoserine-lactones (AHLs), furanosyl borate, hydroxyl-palmitic acid methylester, and methyl-dodecanoic acid. These signaling molecules maintain the symbiotic relationship between a host and the healthy microbial flora and also control various microbial virulence factors. This manuscript has been developed based on published scientific papers. AREAS COVERED Furanones, glycosylated chemicals, heavy metals, and nanomaterials are considered QS inhibitors (QSIs) and are therefore capable of inhibiting the microbial QS system. QSIs are currently being considered as antimicrobial therapeutic options. Currently, the low speed at which new antimicrobial agents are being developed impairs the treatment of drug-resistant infections. Therefore, QSIs are currently being studied as potential interventions targeting QS-signaling molecules and quorum quenching (QQ) enzymes to reduce microbial virulence. EXPERT OPINION QSIs represent a novel opportunity to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, no clinical trials have been conducted thus far assessing their efficacy. With the recent advancements in technology and the development of well-designed clinical trials aimed at targeting various components of the, QS system, these agents will undoubtedly provide a useful alternative to treat infectious diseases.","Haque, Mainul; Islam, Salequl; Sheikh, Md Arif; Dhingra, Sameer; Uwambaye, Peace; Labricciosa, Francesco Maria; Iskandar, Katia; Charan, Jaykaran; Abukabda, Alaeddin Bashir; Jahan, Dilshad",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2021.1843427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33131352/,171
103952,Unlocking Dysphagia: Intentional Ingestion of Foreign Bodies.,2020-07-07,"RATIONALE Mechanical ventilation is a mainstay of intensive care but contributes to the mortality of patients through ventilator induced lung injury. Extracellular Cyclophilin A is an emerging inflammatory mediator and metalloproteinase inducer, and the gene responsible for its expression has recently been linked to COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVES Here we explore the involvement of extracellular Cyclophilin A in the pathophysiology of ventilator-induced lung injury. METHODS Mice were ventilated with low or high tidal volume for up to 3 hours, with or without blockade of extracellular Cyclophilin A signalling, and lung injury and inflammation were evaluated. Human primary alveolar epithelial cells were exposed to in vitro stretch to explore the cellular source of extracellular Cyclophilin A, and Cyclophilin A levels were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, to evaluate clinical relevance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS High tidal volume ventilation in mice provoked a rapid increase in soluble Cyclophilin A levels in the alveolar space, but not plasma. In vivo ventilation and in vitro stretch experiments indicated alveolar epithelium as the likely major source. In vivo blockade of extracellular Cyclophilin A signalling substantially attenuated physiological dysfunction, macrophage activation and matrix metalloproteinases. Finally, we found that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome showed markedly elevated levels of extracellular Cyclophilin A within bronchoalveolar lavage. CONCLUSIONS Cyclophilin A is upregulated within the lungs of injuriously ventilated mice (and critically ill patients), where it plays a significant role in lung injury. Extracellular Cyclophilin A represents an exciting novel target for pharmacological intervention.","Koh, Marissa W; Baldi, Rhianna F; Soni, Sanooj; Handslip, Rhodri; Tan, Ying Ying; O'Dea, Kieran P; Malesevic, Miroslav; McAuley, Daniel F; O'Kane, Cecilia M; Patel, Brijesh V; Takata, Masao; Wilson, Michael R",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202009-3545oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33848447/,171

Resilience and psychopathological symptoms of nurses in the isolation ward was assessed by Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90). A total resilience score was 87.04 ± 22.78. The SCL-90 score was 160- to 281 (202.5 ± 40.79). Only 8.70% of the nurses (n = 8) had a total SCL-90 score >160, suggesting positive symptoms. The majority of nurses had 0 to 90 positive self-assessment items (median 14); 19.57% (n = 18) had > 43 positive items.

105018,Pediatric intensive care preparedness and ECMO availability in children with COVID-19: An international survey.,2020-12-19,"INTRODUCTION The first decade of the 21st century has witnessed three major influenza public health emergencies: (1) the severe acute respiratory syndrome of 2002-2003; (2) the avian flu of 2006; and (3) the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza. An effective public health response to an influenza public health emergency depends on the majority of uninfected health care personnel (HCP) continuing to report to work. The purposes of this study were to determine the state of the evidence concerning the willingness of HCP to work during an influenza public health emergency, to identify the gaps for future investigation, and to facilitate evidence-based influenza public health emergency planning. METHODS A systemic literature review of relevant, peer-reviewed, quantitative, English language studies published from January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2010 was conducted. Search strategies included the Cochrane Library, PubMed, PubMed Central, EBSCO Psychological and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Google Scholar, ancestry searching of citations in relevant publications, and information from individuals with a known interest in the topic. RESULTS Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Factors associated with a willingness to work during an influenza public health emergency include: being male, being a doctor or nurse, working in a clinical or emergency department, working full-time, prior influenza education and training, prior experience working during an influenza emergency, the perception of value in response, the belief in duty, the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), and confidence in one's employer. Factors found to be associated with less willingness were: being female, being in a supportive staff position, working part-time, the peak phase of the influenza emergency, concern for family and loved ones, and personal obligations. Interventions that resulted in the greatest increase in the HCP's willingness to work were preferential access to Tamiflu for the HCP and his/her family, and the provision of a vaccine for the individual and his/her family. CONCLUSIONS Understanding the factors that contribute to the willingness of HCP to report to work during an influenza public health emergency is critical to emergency planning and preparedness. Information from this review can guide emergency policy makers, planners, and implementers in both understanding and influencing the willingness of HCP to work during an influenza public health emergency.","Devnani, Mahesh",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x12001331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23031432/,171

Median docking time was shorter with the Xi robot [7.5 (95% CI 6-8) versus 10 (95% CI 9-12) min, p = 0.003] as was operation duration [114 (95% CI 104-123) versus 119 (95% CI 116-126) min, p = 0.041] and skin closure to room exit [12 (95% CI 10-24) versus 13 (95% CI 12-15) min, p = 0.081]. Anesthesiologists expressed greater comfort with the Xi system, because the patient's head was not covered by the robot. Outcomes for Si and Xi operations such as median blood loss (20 cc versus 20 cc), transfusion rate (0 versus 0), major complication rate (3.2 versus 3.3%), and the 30- and 90-day mortality were no different (one 30-day death in the Si group). The technical changes that are required for robotic Si-to-Xi conversion are shown. The Xi system may offer improved operational efficiency.","Smood, Benjamin; Ghanim, Asem; Wei, Benjamin; Cerfolio, Robert J",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-018-0779-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29363007/,171
106424,Screening strategies for hypertension.,2020-05-07,"BACKGROUND Surgical excision of apocrine glands is the effective treatment for axillary bromhidrosis. Skin necrosis, the most serious adverse result observed postoperatively, results in a prolonged wound healing and leads to unsightly scars in the axillary fossae. It is mainly caused by the skin damage during the operation and postoperative seroma or haematoma formation. OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects and complications of our surgical modality for axillary bromhidrosis. METHODS Sixty-three patients with bromhidrosis were treated. An incision about two-thirds of the length of the widest transverse diameter was made on the axillary crease. The loosened layers between the dermis and axillary superficial fascia containing apocrine glands were carefully undermined with an iris scissor. The entire apocrine glands-axillary superficial fascia complex was dissected from the centre to the superior and inferior margins with an electrosurgical pencil. RESULTS Of the 126 axillae, malodour was eradicated in 112 axillae and reduced sharply in 14. There were three cases of skin necroses. The Dermatology Life Quality Index score decreased significantly and the quality of life improved after the operation. CONCLUSION Our surgical technique can achieve minimal tissue damage and maintain no hematoma postoperatively. The rate of skin necrosis was low. Quality of life improved after the procedure in this patient population.","He, J; Wang, T; Dong, J",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-3083.2011.04149.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21689166/,171

107482,Mefloquine for preventing malaria during travel to endemic areas.,2017,"OBJECTIVE Substance use disorder (SUD) is a chronic remitting and relapsing disorder, and abrupt discontinuation of the substance due to nonavailability in the absence of treatment precipitates withdrawals and craving. The objective of this study was to assess the craving and withdrawal coping mechanisms used by patients with SUDs as a result of disruption in availability of substances and medications due to sudden lockdown in response to coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS A survey was administered via telephone from June 25, 2020, to July 15, 2020, to patients who had previously attended the substance use clinic of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India from January 1, 2020, to March 21, 2020 (up to the time of lockdown). Sociodemographic and clinical details were obtained from case record files. A 16-item questionnaire was developed to collect information on coping with craving and withdrawal symptoms. A total of 215 patients were registered in the substance use clinic during this period for the treatment of SUDs, and of those, 43 could not be contacted due to various reasons such as wrong contact numbers, patient expired (not related to substance withdrawal), or not willing to talk. The mean age of the subjects was 37.05 (SD = 13.22) years, and men outnumbered women. The remaining 172 patients were contacted via telephone, and responses were gathered regarding withdrawal symptoms and coping with craving. RESULTS More than two-thirds of the patients were still maintaining abstinence from their primary substance of abuse during lockdown. A large number of patients (n = 41, 43.2%) reported difficulty in obtaining prescribed medication for detoxification without renewal of their prescription. More than 66% of patients reported that they were able to control their craving, and many kept themselves busy with household activities. CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients who had completed the acute phase of withdrawals were able to maintain abstinence in the absence of renewal of prescribed medication and substance of abuse due to sudden disruption in supply. The patients were able to use certain strategies to control their craving.","Sidana, Ajeet; Chavan, Bir Singh; Rohilla, Ravi; Singh, Jasvir",The primary care companion for CNS disorders,https://doi.org/10.4088/pcc.20m02802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34000123/,171

110717,Separating the Physician and Patient: A Paradigm Shift for Routine Otolaryngology Examinations in COVID-19-Like Aerosol-Contaminated Environments.,2021-02-02,"BACKGROUND Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) generally occurs in young adults, whereas pediatric PSP is uncommon. It is difficult to source reliable data on pediatric PSP, the management of which is based on guidelines for adult PSP; however, the rate of recurrence after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for pediatric PSP is reported to be higher. METHODS We reviewed retrospectively a collective total of 66 surgical cases of a first pneumothorax episode in 46 children under 16 years of age, who were treated at our hospital between February, 2005 and November, 2017. RESULTS The surgical cases were divided into two groups, depending on how the treated lesions were covered. In the dual-covering (DC) group, the PSP was covered by oxidized regenerated cellulose and polyglycolic acid (8 patients; 13 cases) and in the single-covering (SC) group, the PSP was covered by oxidized regenerated cellulose (38 patients; 53 cases). There was no incidence of recurrence after surgery in the DC group, but 17 cases (32.1%) of recurrence after surgery in the SC group. This difference was significant. CONCLUSION The DC method prevented the recurrence of PSP more effectively than the SC method after VATS in pediatric patients. Long-term follow-up after VATS for pediatric PSP is also important because of the risk of delayed recurrence.","Yamanaka, Sumitaka; Kurihara, Masatoshi; Watanabe, Kenichi",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-019-01785-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955098/,171

At first, it may seem that leaving medical school admissions partly to chance could erode autonomy and meritocracy. Yet our current system for selecting medical students is strained by a limited predictive ability. In the search for good doctors, we lack meaningful, quantifiable, and comparable criteria. Partial or weighted admissions lotteries can offer us an escape. They have the potential to reduce mental and financial burdens on both applicants and medical schools, avoiding an overemphasis on marginal differences between applicants. Lotteries are also a simple way to address persistent admissions disparities by being truly non-discriminatory.

These were first isolated in humans as causal microorganisms responsible for common cold. The 2002-2003 SARS epidemic caused by SARS-CoV and 2012 MERS epidemic (64 countries affected) caused by MERS-CoV showed their acute and fatal side. These two CoV infections killed thousands of patients infected worldwide. However, WHO has still reported the MERS case in December 2019 in middle-eastern country (Saudi Arabia), indicating the MERS epidemic has not ended completely yet. Although we have not yet understood completely these two CoV epidemics, a third most dangerous and severe CoV infection has been originated in the Wuhan city, Hubei district of China in December 2019. This CoV infection called COVID-19 or SARS-CoV2 infection has now spread to 210 countries and territories around the world. COVID-19 has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). It has infected more than 16.69 million people with more than 663,540 deaths across the world.

If the world is to drastically reduce the incidence of DR-TB, we must stop creating new DR-TB as an essential first step. The DR-TB epidemic that is ongoing should also be directly addressed. First-line drug resistance must be rapidly detected using universal molecular testing for resistance to at least rifampin and, preferably, other key drugs at initial TB diagnosis. DR-TB treatment outcomes must also improve dramatically. Effective use of currently available, new, and repurposed drugs, combined with patient-centered treatment that aids adherence and reduces catastrophic costs, are essential. Innovations within sight, such as short, highly effective, broadly indicated regimens, paired with point-of-care drug susceptibility testing, could accelerate progress in treatment outcomes. Preventing or containing resistance to second-line and novel drugs is also critical and will require high-quality systems for diagnosis, regimen selection, and treatment monitoring. Finally, earlier detection and/or prevention of DR-TB is necessary, with particular attention to airborne infection control, case finding, and preventive therapy for contacts of patients with DR-TB. Implementing these strategies can overcome the barrier that DR-TB represents for global TB elimination efforts, and could ultimately make global elimination of DR-TB (fewer than one annual case per million population worldwide) attainable. There is a strong cost-effectiveness case to support pursuing DR-TB elimination; however, achieving this goal will require substantial global investment plus political and societal commitment at national and local levels.","Kendall, E A; Sahu, S; Pai, M; Fox, G J; Varaine, F; Cox, H; Cegielski, J P; Mabote, L; Vassall, A; Dowdy, D W",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,https://doi.org/10.5588/ijtld.18.0217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31097060/,171

Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The glycosites exhibited glycoform heterogeneity as expected for a human cell-expressed protein subunit. We identified masses that correspond to 157 N-glycans, primarily of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, completely of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells, regardless of the glycosites' location. Moreover, the N-glycan compositions were conserved among different sizes of subunits. Our study indicate that the S protein N-glycosylation occurs regularly at each site, albeit the occupied N-glycans were diverse and heterogenous. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.","Zhang, Yong; Zhao, Wanjun; Mao, Yonghong; Chen, Yaohui; Wang, Shisheng; Zhong, Yi; Su, Tao; Gong, Meng; Du, Dan; Lu, Xiaofeng; Cheng, Jingqiu; Yang, Hao",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.ra120.002295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33581318/,171

However, they can be challenging to design and implement. AREAS COVERED A total of 18 performance-based agreements were identified through a literature review. All but 2 of the agreements identified were pay-for-performance schemes, agreed between providers and payers at the national level. No examples were found of agreements between healthcare providers and manufacturers at the local level. The potential for these local agreements was illustrated by hypothetical case studies of water quality management and an integrated chronic kidney disease programme. EXPERT OPINION Performance-based risk-sharing agreements can work to the advantage of patients, health care providers, payers, and technology manufacturers, particularly if they facilitate the introduction of technologies or systems of care that might not have been introduced otherwise. However, the design, conduct, and implementation of PBRSAs in renal care pose a number of challenges. Efforts should be made to overcome these challenges, so that more renal care patients can benefit from technological advances and new models of care.","Drummond, Michael; Federici, Carlo; Busink, Ellen; Apel, Christian; Kendzia, Dana; Brouwer, Werner",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1876566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439090/,171

METHODS Twenty-five MMTC patients were retrospectively evaluated. All patients had undergone whole-body (18)F-FDG-PET/CT including 20 who had also undergone (111)In-Octreotide SPECT within a maximum interval of 6 weeks. Diagnostic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) alone or as part of (18)F-FDG-PET/CT examination was performed in all patients. RESULTS Contrast-enhanced CT detected a total of 131 lesions including 79 enlarged lymph nodes and 14 bone lesions. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT visualized a total of 92 true positive lesions (SUVmax range 1.1-10.0, mean 4.0 ± 1.7) including 66 lymph nodes, 7 of which were not enlarged on CT, and 8 bone metastases. In the 20 patients studied with both techniques, a total of 64 and 46 true positive lesions were detected by (18)F-FDG-PET/CT and (111)In-Octreotide SPECT, respectively. In particular, (18)F-FDG uptake was found in 43 lymph nodes and in 7 bone metastases whereas (111)In-Octreotide uptake was detected in 27 lymph nodes and in 10 bone metastases. CONCLUSIONS In MMTC patients, (18)F-FDG-PET/CT provides a useful contribution mainly in evaluating lymph node involvement whereas (111)In-Octreotide SPECT can contribute to the detection and somatostatin receptor characterization especially of bone lesions.","De Luca, Serena; Fonti, Rosa; Camera, Luigi; Salvatore, Barbara; Faggiano, Antongiulio; Ciarmiello, Andrea; Segreto, Sabrina; Colao, Annamaria; Salvatore, Marco; Del Vecchio, Silvana",Annals of nuclear medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12149-015-1056-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26753628/,171

Allelic variants in ABCB1 and ERCC1 might be associated with early occurrence (ie, end of Week 2 treatment) of grade 3/4 neutropenia. Pharmacogenetic analyses were performed to uncover associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes, patient baseline characteristics, and early occurrence of grade 3/4 neutropenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS ABCB1 (rs1045642, rs1128503) and ERCC1 (rs3212986, rs11615) were analyzed in germline DNA from palbociclib-treated patients from PALOMA-2 (n=584) and PALOMA-3 (n=442). SNP, race, and Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) data were available for 652 patients. Univariate and multivariable analyses evaluated associations between SNPs, patient baseline characteristics, and early occurrence of grade 3/4 neutropenia. Analyses were stratified by Asian (n=122) and non-Asian (n=530) ethnicity. Median progression-free survival (mPFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The effect of genetic variants on palbociclib pharmacokinetics was analyzed. RESULTS ABCB1 and ERCC1_rs11615 SNP frequencies differed between Asian and non-Asian patients. Multivariable analysis showed that low baseline ANC was a strong independent risk factor for C1D15 grade 3/4 neutropenia regardless of race (Asians: odds ratio [OR]=6.033, 95% CI=2.615-13.922, P<0.0001; Non-Asians: OR=6.884, 95% CI=4.138-11.451, P<0.0001). ABCB1_rs1128503 (C/C vs T/T: OR=0.57, 95% CI=0.311-1.047, P=0.070) and ERCC1_rs11615 (A/A vs G/G: OR=1.75, 95% CI=0.901-3.397, P=0.098) were potential independent risk factors for C1D15 grade 3/4 neutropenia in non-Asian patients. Palbociclib mPFS was consistent across genetic variants; exposure was not associated with ABCB1 genotype. CONCLUSION This is the first comprehensive assessment of pharmacogenetic data in relationship to exposure to a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Pharmacogenetic testing may inform about potentially increased likelihood of patients developing severe neutropenia (NCT01740427, NCT01942135). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Palbociclib plus endocrine therapy improves HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC) outcomes, but is commonly associated with neutropenia. Genetic variants in ABCB1 may influence palbociclib exposure, and in ERCC1 are associated with chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia. Here, the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes and baseline characteristics with neutropenia were assessed. Low baseline absolute neutrophil count was a strong risk factor (P<0.0001) for grade 3/4 neutropenia. There was a trend indicating that ABCB1_rs1128503 and ERCC1_rs11615 were potential risk factors (P<0.10) for grade 3/4 neutropenia in non-Asian patients. Pharmacogenetic testing could inform clinicians about the likelihood of severe neutropenia with palbociclib.","Iwata, Hiroji; Umeyama, Yoshiko; Liu, Yuan; Zhang, Zhe; Schnell, Patrick; Mori, Yuko; Fletcher, Olivia; Marshall, Jean-Claude; Johnson, Jillian G; Wood, Linda S; Toi, Masakazu; Finn, Richard S; Turner, Nicholas C; Bartlett, Cynthia Huang; Cristofanilli, Massimo",The oncologist,https://doi.org/10.1002/onco.13811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955129/,171

137305,Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for secondary prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events in people with antiphospholipid syndrome.,2017,"Plants deploy cell surface receptors known as pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize non-self molecules from pathogens and microbes to defend against invaders. PRRs typically recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) that are usually widely conserved, some even across kingdoms. Here, we report an oomycete-specific family of small secreted cysteine-rich (SCR) proteins that displays divergent patterns of sequence variation in the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans A subclass that includes the conserved effector PcF from Phytophthora cactorum activates immunity in a wide range of plant species. In contrast, the more diverse SCR74 subclass is specific to P. infestans and tends to trigger immune responses only in a limited number of wild potato genotypes. The SCR74 response was recently mapped to a G-type lectin receptor kinase (G-LecRK) locus in the wild potato Solanum microdontum subsp. gigantophyllum. The G-LecRK locus displays a high diversity in Solanum host species compared to other solanaceous plants. We propose that the diversification of the SCR74 proteins in P. infestans is driven by a fast coevolutionary arms race with cell surface immune receptors in wild potato, which contrasts the presumed slower dynamics between conserved apoplastic effectors and PRRs. Understanding the molecular determinants of plant immune responses to these divergent molecular patterns in oomycetes is expected to contribute to deploying multiple layers of disease resistance in crop plants.IMPORTANCE Immune receptors at the plant cell surface can recognize invading microbes. The perceived microbial molecules are typically widely conserved and therefore the matching surface receptors can detect a broad spectrum of pathogens. Here we describe a family of Phytophthora small extracellular proteins that consists of conserved subfamilies that are widely recognized by solanaceous plants. Remarkably, one subclass of SCR74 proteins is highly diverse, restricted to the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans and is specifically detected in wild potato plants. The diversification of this subfamily exhibits signatures of a coevolutionary arms race with surface receptors in potato. Insights into the molecular interaction between these potato-specific receptors and the recognized Phytophthora proteins are expected to contribute to disease resistance breeding in potato.","Lin, Xiao; Wang, Shumei; de Rond, Laura; Bertolin, Nicoletta; Wouters, Roland H M; Wouters, Doret; Domazakis, Emmanouil; Bitew, Mulusew Kassa; Win, Joe; Dong, Suomeng; Visser, Richard G F; Birch, Paul; Kamoun, Sophien; Vleeshouwers, Vivianne G A A",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00947-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32605983/,171
139039,Error in the Results Section.,2021-01-19,"We previously reported that vestigial-like 1 (VGLL1), a cofactor of transcriptional enhanced associate domain 4 (TEAD4), is transcriptionally regulated by PI3K and β-catenin signaling and is involved in gastric cancer malignancy. However, the precise mechanism underlying the regulation of VGLL1 activation remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-mediated activation of VGLL1 and the VGLL1-TEAD4 interaction in gastric cancer cells. We showed that TGF-β enhanced VGLL1 phosphorylation and that this phosphorylated VGLL1 functioned as a transcription cofactor of TEAD4 in NUGC3 cells. TGF-β also increased the phosphorylation of ERK and ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) in NUGC3 cells, thereby triggering the translocation of phosphorylated RSK2 to the nucleus. Site-directed mutagenesis and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that RSK2 phosphorylated VGLL1 at S84 in the presence of TGF-β. Mutation of VGLL1 at S84 suppressed VGLL1-TEAD4 binding and the subsequent transcriptional activation of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9). Moreover, VGLL1 peptide containing S84 suppressed the TGF-β-induced MMP9 expression and reduced the invasion and proliferation of gastric cancer cells, whereas VGLL1 peptide containing S84A did not. Furthermore, suppression of expression or activation of VGLL1 enhances the therapeutic effects of lapatinib. Collectively, these results indicate that VGLL1 phosphorylation via TGF-β/ERK/RSK2 signaling plays a crucial role in MMP9-mediated malignancy of gastric cancer. In addition, our study highlights the therapeutic potential of the peptide containing VGLL1 S84 for the treatment of gastric cancer.","Im, Joo-Young; Kim, Da-Mi; Park, Hyunkyung; Kang, Mi-Jung; Kim, Da-Yoon; Chang, Kwan Young; Kim, Bo-Kyung; Won, Misun",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

139188,Immediate versus deferred delivery of the preterm baby with suspected fetal compromise for improving outcomes.,2016,"A coarse-grained force field for molecular dynamics simulations of the native structures of proteins in a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) framework is developed. The parameters for bonded interactions are derived by mapping the bonds and angles for 20 amino acids onto target distributions obtained from fully atomistic simulations in explicit solvent. A dual-basin potential is introduced for stabilizing backbone angles, to cover a wide spectrum of protein secondary structures. The backbone dihedral potential enables folding of the protein from an unfolded initial state to the folded native structure. The proposed force field is validated by evaluating the structural properties of several model peptides and proteins including the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide, consisting of α-helices, β-sheets, loops and turns. Detailed comparisons with fully atomistic simulations are carried out to assess the ability of the proposed force field to stabilize the different secondary structures present in proteins. The compact conformations of the native states were evident from the radius of gyration and the high intensity peaks of the root mean square deviation histograms, which were found to be within 0.4 nm. The Ramachandran-like energy landscape on the phase space of backbone angles (θ) and dihedrals (ϕ) effectively captured the conformational phase space of α-helices at ∼(ϕ = 50°,θ = 90°) and β-strands at ∼(ϕ = ±180°,θ = 90-120°). Furthermore, the residue-residue native contacts were also well reproduced by the proposed DPD model. The applicability of the model to multidomain complexes was assessed using lysozyme and a large α-helical bacterial pore-forming toxin, cytolysin A. Our study illustrates that the proposed force field is generic, and can potentially be extended for efficient in silico investigations of membrane bound polypeptides and proteins using DPD simulations.","Vaiwala, Rakesh; Ayappa, K Ganapathy",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1sm01194d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651150/,171

Eligibility for nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) remains controversial, especially regarding TND. In this study, we compared long-term oncologic outcomes after NSM between patients with a TND ≤ 1 cm and those with a TND > 1 cm. METHODS Overall, 1369 patients with primary breast cancer who underwent NSM with immediate reconstruction from March 2003 to December 2015 were included for analysis. After propensity score matching, 495 patients with a TND ≤ 1 cm (group A) and 495 patients with a TND > 1 cm (group B) on imaging were selected to compare long-term oncologic outcomes. RESULTS After matching, the median follow-up periods for surviving patients were 109 months and 112 months for groups A and B, respectively. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to the 5-year cumulative local recurrence (8.1% vs. 6.3%; p = 0.268), NAC recurrence (5.1% vs. 2.8%; p = 0.072), regional recurrence (2.0% vs. 3.6%; p = 0.125), or distant recurrence (5.9% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.480) rates. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the groups with respect to the 10-year local recurrence-free survival (87.1% vs. 90.7%; p = 0.164) or disease-free survival (77.9% vs. 81.6%; p = 0.222) rates.

However, there are scholars who challenge this view and argue that redundancy is an essential element in facilitating reliable and safe operations in health care delivery processes. The ambiguity on redundancy has led to limited insights in health care settings. PURPOSE This article seeks to provide clarity by investigating the conceptualization of redundancy within and across disparate contexts within hospital operations. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH An exploratory study using different hospital departments was conducted in two large hospitals as case studies to allow for in-depth understanding of the conceptualization of redundancy across hospital departments. Data sources included 42 semistructured interviews, surveys, field notes from site observations, and document analysis. RESULTS/FINDINGS The findings revealed alternative conceptualizations of redundancy, these being safety, care, heterogeneity, sustenance, and waste, and highlight their dominance in distinct hospital departments. The first four categories are positive in connotation, whereas the last, waste, has a negative connotation. Further, the analysis revealed that the conceptualization of redundancy is context dependent. CONCLUSION Contrary to the general cognition of redundancy in the social science and management literature, our research found that redundancy might have a valuable role to play in core health care management concerns such as patient-centeredness, patient safety, and quality of care. This work is one of the first comprehensive studies on redundancy in the health care settings and is expected to steer scholarly conversations on redundancy in a more positive light.

Recently, the guidelines for the management of Chinese HCC patients were updated. Objective The past decade has witnessed a great improvement in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study reviews the recommendations in the 2019 Chinese guidelines and makes comparison with the practices from the Western world. Evidence Review The updated recommendations on the surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment algorithm of HCC in the 2019 Chinese guidelines were summarized, and comparisons among the updated Chinese guidelines, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines were made. Findings Besides imaging and pathological diagnoses, novel biomarkers like the seven-micro-RNA panel are advocated for early diagnoses and therapeutic efficacy evaluation in the updated Chinese guidelines. The China liver cancer (CNLC) staging system, proposed in the 2017 guidelines, continues to be the standard model for patient classification, with subsequent modifications and updates being made in treatment allocations. Compared to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system, the CNLC staging system employs resection, transplantation, and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for more progressed HCC. TACE in combination with other regional therapies like ablation or with systemic therapies like sorafenib are also encouraged in select patients in China. The systemic treatments for HCC have evolved considerably since lenvatinib, regorafenib, carbozantinib, ramucirumab and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)were first prescribed as first-line or second-line agents. Conclusions and Relevances Novel biomarkers, imaging and operative techniques are recommended in the updated Chinese guideline.

147585,Near infrared spectrophotometry (cerebral oximetry) in predicting the return of spontaneous circulation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,2014,"BACKGROUND Transplant recipients who develop COVID-19 may be at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Determining the status of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in both candidates and recipients will be important to understand the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 in this population. While there are multiple tests to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, their performance is variable. Tests vary according to their platforms and the antigenic targets which make interpretation of the results challenging. Furthermore, for some assays, sensitivity and specificity is less than optimal. Additionally, currently available serological tests do not exclude the possibility that positive responses are due to cross reactive antibodies to community coronaviruses rather than SARS-CoV-2. METHODS This study describes the development and validation of a high throughput multiplex antibody detection assay. RESULTS The multiplex assay has the capacity to identify, simultaneously, patient responses to 5 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely, the full spike protein, 3 individual domains of the spike protein (S1, S2 and receptor binding domain) and the nucleocapsid protein. The antibody response to the above proteins are SARS-CoV-2 specific, as antibodies against 4 common coronaviruses do not cross-react. CONCLUSIONS This new assay provides a novel tool to interrogate the spectrum of immune responses to SAR-CoV-2 and is uniquely suitable for use in the transplant setting. Test configuration is essentially identical to the single antigen bead assays used in the majority of histocompatibility laboratories around the world and could easily be implemented into routine screening of transplant candidates and recipients.","Bray, Robert A; Lee, Jar-How; Brescia, Peter; Kumar, Deepali; Nong, Thoa; Shih, Remi; Woodle, E Steve; Maltzman, Jonathan S; Gebel, Howard M",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33273320/,171

The aim of this study was to determine whether serum endocan levels are prognostic for survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Serum endocan levels were measured in 64 HCC patients who were naïve to treatment, eight apparently healthy subjects, and 68 patients with liver cirrhosis; the latter two groups served as controls. Prognostic factors for the survival of HCC patients were examined using a Cox proportional hazards model. The median serum endocan levels were 1.145 ng/mL (range, 0.93-1.68 ng/mL) in healthy subjects, 1.93 ng/mL (range, 0.45-8.47 ng/mL) in liver cirrhosis patients, and 3.73 ng/mL (range, 0.74-10.95 ng/mL) in HCC patients (P = 0.0001). In HCC patients, elevated serum endocan levels were significantly associated with poor hepatic function (P = 0.015), a greater number of tumors (P = 0.034), and vascular invasion (P = 0.043). The median follow-up period was 23.0 months, and 33 HCC patients died during follow up. Multivariate analysis showed that serum endocan levels ≥ 2.20 ng/mL (hazard ratio 2.36, 95% confidence interval 1.22-5.36, P = 0.008) as well as elevated serum α-fetoprotein and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin levels were independent prognostic biomarkers for poor survival. The combination of serum endocan and these two additional markers was significantly predictive of worse survival (P < 0.0001). Thus, serum endocan may be a prognostic biomarker for survival in HCC patients, and the combination of serum endocan, α-fetoprotein, and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin levels can result in better prognostic stratification of these patients.","Ozaki, Kazuaki; Toshikuni, Nobuyuki; George, Joseph; Minato, Takahiro; Matsue, Yasuhiro; Arisawa, Tomiyasu; Tsutsumi, Mikihiro",Journal of Cancer,https://doi.org/10.7150/jca.7691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665346/,171

The study aims to assess religious coping in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY It was an online survey. The sample was collected using a snowball sampling technique as the data were collected through Google forms. The survey started on 22 April 2020 and was closed on 28 May 2020. The participants were from two countries, India and Nigeria. The inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 60 years, having completed at least 10 years of formal education, and have internet access. For data collection, Semi-structured proforma (demographic and personal characteristics) and Brief RCOPE was used to see the extent to which individuals engage in positive and negative forms of religious coping. RESULTS A total of 647 individuals (360 from Nigeria and 287 from India) participated in the survey. A total of 188 (65.5%) participants in India reported no change in their religious activities since they heard about COVID-19, while, 160 (44.4%) in Nigeria reported a decrease in religious activities. Positive religious coping in the Nigerian population was significantly higher than the Indian population. Similarly, negative religious coping was significantly higher (for most of the items in the brief RCOPE) in the Indian population than the Nigerian population. CONCLUSION Significant percentages of people after the COVID-19 pandemic took religious coping steps to overcome their problems.

151552,Foam dressings for healing diabetic foot ulcers.,2011,"Lesion analysis is a fundamental and classical approach for inferring the causal contributions of brain regions to brain function. However, many studies have been limited by the shortcomings of methodology or clinical data. Aiming to overcome these limitations, we here use an objective multivariate approach based on game theory, Multi-perturbation Shapley value Analysis, in conjunction with data from a large cohort of 394 acute stroke patients, to derive causal contributions of brain regions to four principal functional components of the widely used National Institutes of Health Stroke Score measure. The analysis was based on a high-resolution parcellation of the brain into 294 grey and white matter regions. Through initial lesion symptom mapping for identifying all potential candidate regions and repeated iterations of the game-theoretical approach to remove non-significant contributions, the analysis derived the smallest sets of regions contributing to each of the four principal functional components as well as functional interactions among the regions. Specifically, the factor 'language and consciousness' was related to contributions of cortical regions in the left hemisphere, including the prefrontal gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus, the ventromedial putamen and the inferior frontal gyrus. Right and left motor functions were associated with contributions of the left and right dorsolateral putamen and the posterior limb of the internal capsule, correspondingly. Moreover, the superior corona radiata and the paracentral lobe of the right hemisphere as well as the right caudal area 23 of the cingulate gyrus were mainly related to left motor function, while the prefrontal gyrus, the external capsule and the sagittal stratum fasciculi of the left hemisphere contributed to right motor function. Our approach demonstrates a practically feasible strategy for applying an objective lesion inference method to a high-resolution map of the human brain and distilling a small, characteristic set of grey and white matter structures contributing to fundamental brain functions.

152560,Slow versus fast subcutaneous heparin injections for prevention of bruising and site pain intensity.,2021-06-08,"OBJECTIVES The purpose of this case series was to describe the effects of a biopsychosocial approach that embeds pain neuroscience education (PNE) within physical therapy for improving foot and ankle function, pain, and psychosocial factors in patients with chronic plantar fasciitis. METHODS Seven female patients (mean [SD] age = 49.0 [11.4] years) receiving physical therapy for chronic plantar fasciitis were enrolled. Along with formal physical therapy, patients received six 15-minute PNE sessions. Knowledge of pain neuroscience was assessed before and after PNE with the Revised Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire. Patients completed questionnaires for foot and ankle function (Activities of Daily Living subscale of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure), pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale), pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), and fear of movement (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia) at baseline (before treatment) and 6 and 12 weeks. Local and remote pain sensitivity was assessed using a pressure algometer at baseline and 6 weeks. RESULTS Patients attended a mean (range) of 8.7 (7 to 12) physical therapy sessions over a mean (range) of 46.7 (42 to 56) days. After PNE, six (86%) patients demonstrated increased knowledge of pain neuroscience. At 12 weeks, six (86%) patients met or exceeded minimally clinically important difference (MCID) for foot and ankle function and pain. Five (71%) patients met or exceeded MCID for pain catastrophizing and fear of movement. Local pain sensitivity was reduced in six (86%) patients. CONCLUSIONS Physical therapy integrating PNE is potentially beneficial for patients with chronic plantar fasciitis. Future studies should examine the efficacy of PNE in randomized trials with larger representative samples.","Mills, Katherine M; Preston, Emily B; Choffin Schmitt, Breanna M; Brochu, Haley K; Schafer, Eden A; Robinette, Payton E; Sterling, Emma K; Coronado, Rogelio A",The Journal of manual & manipulative therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/10669817.2020.1821327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32933452/,171

Plasma samples collected up to 24h after drug administration were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, whereas blood PGE2 levels were measured by immunoenzymatic assay. In plasma, the terminal half-live of flunixin, meloxicam and gabapentin were 6.0 h (range, 3.4-11.0 h), 16.7h (range, 13.7-21.3h) and 15.3h (range, 11-32.9h), respectively. The co-administration of single doses of gabapentin and meloxicam did not seem to affect the pharmacokinetic profile of the two drugs except for gabapentin that reached significantly (P<0.05) higher maximum serum concentration (Cmax) when co-administered with meloxicam, than when administered alone. At 5, 360 and 720 min after dehorning, a significant (P<0.01) decrease in PGE2 concentration was observed in flunixin-treated animals compared with control calves. Moreover, circulating log PGE2 concentrations were inversely proportional to log flunixin concentrations (R(2)=0.75; P<0.0001). None of the other drugs significantly affected blood PGE2 levels. Further assessment of oral meloxicam and gabapentin in established pain models is required to formulate science based analgesic recommendations to enhance animal well-being after dehorning.","Fraccaro, E; Coetzee, J F; Odore, R; Edwards-Callaway, L N; Kukanich, B; Badino, P; Bertolotti, L; Glynn, H; Dockweiler, J; Allen, K; Bergamasco, L",Research in veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.01.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23434065/,171

Gene biomarkers are promising to distinguish specific infections from others with similar presenting symptoms for the prescription of correct therapeutics, preventing pandemics. While routine laboratory methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure gene biomarkers have provided highly sensitive and specific viral detection techniques over the years, they are still hampered by their precision and resource intensity precluding their point-of-care use. Recently, there has been growing interest in employing microfluidic technologies to advance current methods for infectious disease determination via gene biomarker measurements. Here, based on the requirement of infection detection, we will review three microfluidic approaches to compartmentalize gene biomarkers: (1) microwell-based PCR platforms; (2) droplet-based PCR; and (3) point-of-care devices including centrifugal chip, SlipChip, and self-powered integrated microfluidic point-of-care low-cost enabling chip. By capturing target genes in microwells with a small sample volume (∼μl), sensitivity can be enhanced. Additionally, with the advance of significant sample volume minimization (∼pl) using droplet technology, gene quantification is possible. These improvements in cost, automation, usability, and portability have thereby allowed point-of-care applications to decentralize testing platforms from laboratory-based settings to field use against infections.","Kathrada, Ahmad Ismat; Wei, Shih-Chung; Xu, Ying; Cheow, Lih Feng; Chen, Chia-Hung",Biomicrofluidics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0032849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312326/,171

To combat its effects, many governments have opted for strategies of social isolation that involve a radical change in people's behavior. AREAS COVERED For patients with hemophilia, the negative consequences of these measures can be greater, given they modify aspects of health care and lifestyles needed to counteract the adverse effects of hemophilia. The long-term consequences of the pandemic on patients with hemophilia are not well known. The aim of this special report is to show what COVID-19 could mean for this population, beyond the risk of infection. EXPERT OPINION Considerations of the clinical, care, therapeutic, physical, nutritional, mental health, pain, and disability aspects that might be affected are included. Strategies are also suggested to minimize the effects that these issues can have on patients' lives. Patients, health professionals, and society as a whole must work together to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on people with hemophilia.","De la Corte-Rodriguez, Hortensia; Alvarez-Roman, M Teresa; Rodriguez-Merchan, Emerito Carlos; Jimenez-Yuste, Víctor",Expert review of hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474086.2020.1818066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862729/,171

COVID-19 affects all ages but presents less complications and fatalities in children. Neonatal infections have rarely been reported worldwide, and vertical transmission is uncertain. METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study of all infants born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers admitted to 2 hospitals in South (Bari) and North (Varese) of Italy from April to December 2020. A molecular nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was made at birth for all enrolled newborns to evaluate vertical transmission of infection. We also evaluated postnatal transmission with a second nasopharyngeal swab made at 1 month of life and described maternal and neonatal clinical findings and short-term outcomes. RESULTS 176/179 (97%) newborns were SARS-CoV-2 negative at birth and 151/156 (97%) infants were still negative at 1 month of life. All newborns were asymptomatic. Seventy percent of newborns were breastfed during hospitalization. At 1 month of life, 76% of infants were breastfed. CONCLUSION According to our results, vertical and perinatal infection is very rare. Breastfeeding does not increase the risk of COVID-19 and should be encouraged.","Capozza, Manuela; Salvatore, Silvia; Baldassarre, Maria Elisabetta; Inting, Silvia; Panza, Raffaella; Fanelli, Margherita; Perniciaro, Simona; Morlacchi, Laura; Vimercati, Antonella; Agosti, Massimo; Laforgia, Nicola",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000518060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628414/,171

161087,Oxygen therapy for pneumonia in adults.,2012,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of CO2-insufflation with 5 and 10 mmHg on cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics in neonates. BACKGROUND An increasing percentage of surgical interventions in neonates are performed by minimal invasive techniques. Recently, concerns have been raised regarding a decrease of cerebral oxygenation in neonates during thoracoscopy as a result of CO2-insufflation. METHODS This was an animal experimental study. Piglets were anesthetized, intubated, ventilated, and surgically prepared for CO2-insufflation. Insufflation was done with 5 or 10 mmHg CO2 during 1 h. Arterial saturation (SaO2), heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), and cerebral oxygenation (rScO2) were monitored. CFTOE, an estimator of cerebral oxygen extraction ((SaO2 - rScO2)/SaO2)), was calculated. Arterial blood gases were drawn every 15': pre (T0), during (T1-T4) and after CO2-insufflation (T5). RESULTS Ten piglets (4 kg) were randomized for 5 (P5) and 10 (P10) mmHg CO2-insufflation. Two P10 piglets needed resuscitation after insufflation, none P5. Linear mixed-effect modeling of paCO2, pH, and SaO2 showed that values were dependent on time and time squared (p < 0.001) but were not different between the 5 and 10 mmHg groups. Analysis demonstrated significant changes over time in heart rate and MABP between the 5 and 10 mmHg groups, with a significant higher heart rate and lower blood pressure in the 10 mmHg group (p < 0.001). For rScO2 and cFTOE, no group differences could be demonstrated, but a significant effect of time was found: rScO2 increased and cFTOE decreased (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Insufflation of CO2 during thoracoscopy with 10 mmHg caused more severe hemodynamic instability and seems to be related with a decrease of cerebral perfusion as represented by a higher oxygen extraction. CO2-insufflation of 5 mmHg for thoracoscopy seems to have no adverse effects on cerebral oxygenation.","Stolwijk, Lisanne J; Tytgat, Stefaan H A J; Keunen, Kristin; Suksamanapan, Nutnicha; van Herwaarden, Maud Y A; Groenendaal, Floris; Lemmers, Petra M A; van der Zee, David C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-4009-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25487546/,171

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently used clinically because it has higher binding specificity for insoluble fibrin (IF) than urokinase (UK), but even pro-tPA has catalytic activity in places other than IF. Meanwhile, UK has the advantage that it is specifically activated on IF, but it only binds IF weakly. Unlike the anti-IF monoclonal antibody (mAb) established in the past, our anti-IF mAb recognizes a pit structure formed only in IF. Here, we developed a new mAb against the pit, 1101, that does not affect coagulation or fibrinolysis, and prepared a fusion protein of UK with humanized 1101 Fab to transport UK selectively to IF. In IF-containing lesions, UK is cleaved by plasmin at two sites, Lys158/Ile159 and Lys135/Lys136. Cleavage of the former leads to activation of UK; however, because activated UK is linked by S-S bonds before and after cleavage, it is not released from the fusion. Cleavage at the latter site causes UK to leave the fusion protein; hence, we mutated Lys135/Lys136 to Gly135/Gly136 to prevent release of UK. This engineered UK-antibody fusion, AMU1114, significantly decreased the systemic side effects of UK in vivo. In a mouse thrombus formation experiment, the vascular patency rate was 0% (0/10) in the control, 50% (5/10) in the tPA, and 90% (9/10) in the AMU1114 treatment group. These data support future clinical development of AMU1114.","Hanaoka, Shingo; Saijou, Shinji; Matsumura, Yasuhiro",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.06.284596,171

Of the various types of educational leadership, transformational leadership is recognized as the most suitable for use in academic environment. It focuses on the division of leadership responsibilities among academics with varying skills in order to handle collectively the spectrum of leadership responsibilities needed in a variety of contexts. Methods/Analysis: This perspective is embodied in this study paper, which examined the degree to which members of the Senate of three Universities of Greece, engaged in three distinct types of leadership (transformational leadership, transactional leadership, and leadership to be avoided) via digital leadership. The findings were interpreted using descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive data analysis algorithms. Findings: The findings indicate that participants demonstrate a high level of Transformational and Transactional Leadership. They demonstrated a high level of Digital Leadership while avoiding Passive-To Avoid Leadership. The study demonstrates that Digital Leadership has a relatively favorable association with the leadership outcome, which is translated as a high level of performance and satisfaction coexisting with a high level of digital leadership execution. Novelty /Improvement: The research project indicates that a good leader who practices transformational leadership and is prepared with the necessary digital skills would be more effective in carrying out administrative responsibilities in an academic environment. © 2021 by the authors.

The extent of exposure of health care workers and the general public to SARS-CoV-2 needs to be assessed to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study is an attempt in assessing the anti-SARs-COV-2 antibody in health care workers. Methods: This laboratory-based cross-sectional study was performed in Manmohan Memorial Medical College and Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu from November 2020 to January 2021. A total of 185 HCWs were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in the blood serum specimens . A structured questionnaire was administered to collect information from HCWs. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody screening was performed using a lateral flow immunoassay. Data were analyzed according to standard statistical methods using SPSS version 20. Results: A total of 185 HCWs were participated in the study, among which 41 (22.2%) of them tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Among the 41 individuals who tested positive, 37 of them tested positive for IgG only and 4 of them tested positive for both IgM and IgG antibodies. Presence of history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (p<0.001), presence of flu-like symptoms within the last 6 months (p<0.001), and presence of positive contact history (p=0.002) were statistically significant with antibody screening among HCWs. Conclusion: The burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers seems to be high and HCWs are at risk of acquiring infection in the workplace. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody screening among health care workers is highly recommended in multiple healthcare settings that can help in monitoring transmission dynamics and evaluation of infection control policies.","Aryal, S.; Pandit, S.; Pokhrel, S.; Chhusyabaga, M.; Bista, P.; Bhatt, M.

OBJECTIVES To study the risk of COVID-19 infection in the presence of preexisting CV diseases and to describe new CV manifestations during COVID-19. METHODS A ""scoping review"" was carried out via PubMed, to synthesize the results of research currently published on this subject. RESULTS Patients with cardiovascular disease were at greater risk of developing COVID-19, especially in its severe form. These patients were five to ten times more at risk of death. Cardiac manifestations, de novo, were dominated by acute myocardial damage, defined by a significant elevation of cardiac troponins. These occurred in 7 to 17% of hospitalized patients. The presence of a new heart lesion in patients with COVID-19 was consistently associated with a poor prognosis. CONCLUSION Given the enormous cardiovascular challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the prognostic impact of heart damage, additional research at a high level of evidence will be necessary.","Yahia, Faten; Zakhama, Lilia; Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed",La Tunisie medicale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395790/,171

Pairs of BMV RNA3 variants carrying marker mutations at different locations were coinoculated on a local lesion host, and the progeny RNA3 in a large number of lesions was analyzed. The majority of doubly infected lesions accumulated the RNA3 recombinants. The distribution of the recombinant types was relatively even, indicating that both RNA3 counterparts could serve as donor or as acceptor molecules. The frequency of crossovers between one pair of RNA3 variants, which possessed closely located markers, was similar to that of another pair of RNA3 variants with more distant markers, suggesting the existence of an internal recombination hot spot. The majority of crossovers were precise, but some recombinants had minor sequence modifications, possibly marking the sites of imprecise homologous crossovers. Our results suggest discontinuous RNA replication, with the replicase changing among the homologous RNA templates and generating RNA diversity. This approach can be easily extended to other RNA viruses for identification of homologous recombination hot spots.","Bruyere, A; Wantroba, M; Flasinski, S; Dzianott, A; Bujarski, J J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10756034/,171

MATERIALS AND METHODS We present a series of consecutive patients with malignant liver tumors in hepatocaval confluence treated in a single center with extreme liver surgery (April 2008-March 2015). Data were collected prospectively and analyzed with SPSS 21.0. RESULTS 12 patients were included. 50 % were male and 50 % were female with a mean age of 59 ± 10 years old. The median of comorbidities was 7 according to the Charlson Age Comorbidity Index. The 75 % of the tumors were metastases, most of them from colorectal cancer. Most of the patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and in 58 % preoperative portal embolization was performed. Major hepatectomies were performed (66.7 % extended right hepatectomy, 33.3 % left extended hepatectomy). The 83.3 % of the patients needed vascular reconstruction. Postoperative morbidity was more than grade II in 50 % of the patients according to Dindo-Clavien classification. There was no intraoperative mortality. The postoperative mortality rate at 90 days was 33 % due to hepatic failure and biliary fistula. In December 2015, 33 % of the patients are still alive with a mean survival of 19 months (13-23) with an ECOG Performance Status of 0. CONCLUSION Extreme liver surgery carries a high rate of morbidity and mortality that seem to increase with age and with higher tumor volumes, according to the literature. It is a therapeutic option to consider in patients with low comorbidity suffering from malignant neoplasms that involve the hepatocaval confluence, when no other treatment with curative intention can be performed.","Codony, C; López-Ben, S; Albiol, M; Falgueras, L; Castro, E; Codina-Barreras, A; Casellas, M; Gil, J; Codina-Cazador, A; Figueras, J",Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26960560/,171

However, some partial idiotypic sharing was observed between the Id-bearing antibody and a mAb with a similar antigenic site specificity. The anti-Id inhibited the virus-binding and neutralizing activities of the immunizing antibody, demonstrating that they recognize paratope-associated idiotopes. Mice immunized with affinity-purified anti-Id developed MHV-A59-specific antibodies that neutralized viral infectivity to high titers. Moreover, these animals survived an otherwise lethal challenge with viral murine hepatitis virus, unlike control mice immunized with normal rabbit Ig. These results indicate that at least a subpopulation of the polyclonal anti-Id could induce a protective immune response directed toward a biologically important MHV-A59 epitope, and demonstrate the feasibility of antiidiotypic vaccination against a coronavirus infection.","Lamarre, A; Lecomte, J; Talbot, P J",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1661313/,171

It is essential to design hospital support systems and occupational health policy to promote the psychological well-being of nurses during future outbreaks of emerging infections.","Chan, Sophia S C; Leung, Gabriel M; Tiwari, Agnes F Y; Salili, Farideh; Leung, Sharron S K; Wong, David C N; Wong, Alan S F; Lai, Adela S F; Lam, Tai Hing",Family & community health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15958885/,171
199468,Medicines and Illusions in the fight against COVID-19 in Brazil,2021,"Temporary abdominal closure (TAC) techniques are routinely used in the open abdomen. Ideally, they should prevent evisceration, aid in removal of unwanted fluid from the peritoneal cavity, facilitate in achieving safe definitive fascial closure, as well as prevent the development of intra-abdominal complications. TAC techniques used in the open abdomen were compared with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) to identify which was superior. A systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines involving Medline, Excerpta Medica, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Clinicaltrials.gov. All studies describing TAC technique use in the open abdomen were eligible for inclusion. Data were analyzed per TAC technique in the form of a meta-analysis. A total of 225 articles were included in the final analysis. A meta-analysis involving only randomized controlled trials showed that NPWT with continuous fascial closure was superior to NPWT alone for definitive fascial closure [mean difference (MD): 35% ± 23%; P = 0.0044]. A subsequent meta-analysis involving all included studies confirmed its superiority across outcomes for definitive fascial closure (MD: 19% ± 3%; P < 0.0001), perioperative (MD: -4.0% ± 2.4%; P = 0.0013) and in-hospital (MD: -5.0% ± 2.9%; P = 0.0013) mortality, entero-atmospheric fistula (MD: -2.0% ± 1.8%; P = 0.0041), ventral hernia (MD: -4.0% ± 2.4%; P = 0.0010), and intra-abdominal abscess (MD: -3.1% ± 2.1%; P = 0.0044). Therefore, it was concluded that NPWT with continuous fascial traction is superior to NPWT alone.","Cristaudo, Adam; Jennings, Scott; Gunnarsson, Ronny; DeCosta, Alan",The American surgeon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228207/,171

201780,Lived Experiences of COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit Survivors,2020,"Direct viral damage and uncontrolled inflammation contribute to disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte [NLR], lymphocyte-to-monocyte [LMR] and platelet-to-lymphocyte [PLR] ratios in COVID-19 patients. All 184 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in our institution between March - April 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were grouped into intubated and non-intubated, and subgrouped into survived and deceased. An unpaired Student's t-test was used for continuous variables, and the Pearson Chi-square (χ2) test for categorical. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to assess the independent relationship between NLR, LMR and PLR and unfavorable outcomes. Non-parametric correlations were calculated using Spearman's Rho correlation coefficient. The mean age of the patients was 64.7; mean BMI was 29.10; 73 (39.67%) were female and 111 male (60.33%). No statistical difference between groups was identified with regard to NLR (mean 8.29, standard deviation [SD] 7.86). On multivariate regression analysis, only PLR and LMR were shown to influence the ratio and it was positively correlated with PLR, lactate and C-reactive protein [CRP]. LMR for non-intubated survived [NI-S] (mean 2.29, SD 1.31) and non-intubated deceased [NI-D] (mean 1.79, SD 0.81) groups were statistically significant (p=0.03). LMR was influenced only by NLR on regression analysis. A positive correlation of LMR with body mass index [BMI] was ascertained. No statistical significance was found between groups for PLR (mean 269.85, SD 207.98) and the ratio was influenced by age and NLR on regression analysis, and positively correlated with NLR. To conclude, previously reported findings of a prognostic role of NLR, LMR and PLR in COVID-19 were not validated in our cohort and we would caution against using the ratios in question as independent markers for disease severity.","Kalabin, Aleksandr; Mani, Vishnu Raj Kumar; Valdivieso, Sebastian Cristobal; Donaldson, Brian",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33664172/,171

Although it is common practice for patients to be transferred between provinces for specialist care, the upsurge in the COVID-19 pandemic has led to some hospitals considering reserving intensive care and critical care beds for COVID-19 patients from their province. The Constitution provides that nobody may be refused emergency medical treatment, nor may they be unfairly discriminated against. This is also implicit in the 'equitable' provision of healthcare services referred to in the National Health Act 61 of 2003. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa COVID-19 guidelines, or other similar widely accepted guidelines, may be used, provided they do not unfairly discriminate against patients on the basis of age. According to the Constitution, a hospital that wishes to turn away an emergency treatment request from another province because it is reserving beds for COVID-19 patients from its home province will have to show that it is 'reasonable and justifiable' to do so. It will have to show that the other province's patient was being subjected to the same criteria for admission as its home province COVID-19 patients, because, for instance, occupation of the bed by another COVID-19 patient from the home province was imminent.","McQuoid-Mason, D J",S Afr Med J,,171

210822,Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests and Mortality In Swiss Cantons with High and Low COVID-19 Incidence: A Nationwide Analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused worldwide fear and uncertainty. Historically, the biomedical disease paradigm established its dominance in tackling emerging infectious illnesses mainly due to innovation in medication and advances in technology. Traditional and religious remedies have emerged as plausible options for prevention and treatment of COVID-19, especially in Africa and Asia. The appeal of religious and traditional therapies against COVID-19 in the African setting must be understood within the historical, social, and political context. This study explored how women and community members dealt with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 in Mwanza, Tanzania. METHODS: This study was conducted in Nyamagana and Ilemela districts of Mwanza, Tanzania, between July and August 2020. We conducted 18 mobile phone in-depth interviews with a purposively selected sample of women aged 27-57 years participating in an existing longitudinal study. For safety reasons, smart mobile phones were used to collect the data. Each interview was audio recorded after obtaining verbal consent from the participants. The audio files were transferred to computers for analysis. Four researchers conducted a multistage, inductive analysis of the data. RESULTS: Participants reported wide use and perceived high efficacy of traditional remedies and prayer to prevent and treat suspected symptoms of COVID-19. Use was either alone or combined with public health recommendations such as hand washing and crowd avoidance. Despite acknowledging that a pathogen causes COVID-19, participants attested to the relevance and power of traditional herbal medication and prayer to curb COVID-19. Four main factors underline the symbolic efficacy of the traditional and religious treatment paradigms: personal, communal, and official reinforcement of their efficacy; connection to local knowledge and belief systems; the failure of biomedicine to offer a quick and effective solution; and availability. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of emerging contagious illnesses, communities turn to resilient and trusted treatment paradigms to quell fear and embrace hope. To tackle emerging infections effectively, it is essential to engage the broader sociopolitical landscape, including communal considerations of therapeutic efficacy.","Mshana, Gerry; Mchome, Zaina; Aloyce, Diana; Peter, Esther; Kapiga, Saidi; Stöckl, Heidi",J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,,171

Additionally, the disease prevalence in pediatric immunocompromised patients remains unknown. METHODS: This cross-sectional study tested convenience samples from pediatric patients who had clinically indicated lab work collected and an immunocompromising condition, including oncologic diagnoses, solid organ transplant, bone marrow transplant, primary immunodeficiency, and rheumatologic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease on systemic immunosuppression, for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We tested sera from 485 children and observed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 1.0% (CI 95%: 0.3-2.4%). Two patients were positive by NP swab RT-PCR, but only one seroconverted. Patients with oncologic diagnoses or solid organ transplant were most likely to be tested for COVID-19 when presenting with respiratory illness as compared to other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised children was similar to that of an immunocompetent pediatric population (0.6%, CI 95%: 0.3-1.1%), suggesting an adequate antibody response. However, none of the patients who tested positive for antibodies or via NP RT-PCR had more than a mild illness course and two patients did not have any reported illness, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not cause a worse clinical outcome in immunosuppressed children, in contrast to immunocompromised adults.","Freeman, Megan Culler; Rapsinski, Glenn J; Zilla, Megan L; Wheeler, Sarah E",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,,171
216679,Testing an early online intervention for the treatment of disturbed sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic (Sleep COVID-19): structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,2020,"Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) affects up to 80% of critically ill, mechanically ventilated (MV) adults. Delirium is associated with substantial negative outcomes, including increased hospital complications and long-term effects on cognition and health status in ICU survivors. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of a Family Automated Voice Reorientation (FAVoR) intervention on delirium among critically ill MV patients. The FAVoR intervention uses scripted audio messages, which are recorded by the patient's family and played at hourly intervals during daytime hours. This ongoing orientation to the ICU environment through recorded messages in a voice familiar to the patient may enable the patient to more accurately interpret the environment and thus reduce risk of delirium. The study's primary aim is to test the effect of the FAVoR intervention on delirium in critically ill MV adults in the ICU. The secondary aims are to explore: (1) if the effect of FAVoR on delirium is mediated by sleep, (2) if selected biobehavioral factors moderate the effects of FAVoR on delirium, and (3) the effects of FAVoR on short-term and long-term outcomes, including cognition and health status. Subjects (n = 178) are randomly assigned to the intervention or control group within 48 h of initial ICU admission and intubation. The intervention group receives FAVoR over a 5-day period, while the control group receives usual care. Delirium-free days, sleep and activity, cognition, patient-reported health status and sleep quality, and data regarding iatrogenic/environmental and biobehavioral factors are collected.","Munro, Cindy L; Liang, Zhan; Ji, Ming; Elías, Maya N; Chen, Xusheng; Calero, Karel; Ely, E Wesley",Contemp Clin Trials,,171

Current research utilized an Analytical Quality by Design approach to optimize levels and combinations of critical gas pressure (sheath, auxiliary, sweep) and temperature (ion transfer tube, vaporizer) parameters for high-sensitivity mass spectrometric quantification of brain tissue glutamine. A Design of Experiments (DOE) matrix for evaluation of relationships between these multiple independent variables and a singular response variable, e.g. glutamine chromatogram area, was developed by statistical response surface methodology using central composite design. A second-order polynomial equation was generated to identify and predict singular versus combinatory effects of synergistic and antagonistic factors on chromatograph area. Predicted versus found outcomes overlapped, with enhanced area associated with the latter. DOE methodology was subsequently used to evaluate liquid chromatographic variable effects, e.g. flow rate, column temperature, and mobile phase composition on the response variable. Results demonstrate that combinatory AQbD-guided mass spectrometric/liquid chromatographic optimization significantly enhanced analytical sensitivity for Gln, thus enabling down-sized brain tissue sample volume procurement for quantification of this critical amino acid.","Bheemanapally, Khaggeswar; Ibrahim, Mostafa M H; Briski, Karen P",Sci Rep,,171

We sought to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, their duration, and capacity for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in volunteers while the pandemic spread within our community starting in March 2020. Those participants with the highest starting titers had the longest-lasting response, up to 12 months post-diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity was correlated with anti-RBD antibody levels. The majority of our participants with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis had very mild or asymptomatic infections. We also detected low and largely non-neutralizing anti-RBD IgG titers in a few participants with no known COVID-19 diagnosis. Finally, we found that antibody responses induced by vaccination were significantly higher than those induced by natural infection. Thus, our study suggests that vaccination is still critical even for those naturally infected or diagnosed with COVID-19.","Hedges, Jodi F.; Thompson, Macy A.; Snyder, Deann T.; Robison, Amanda Taylor Matthew P.; Jutila, Mark A.",Vaccines,,171

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, treatment decision-making for older patients is especially challenging and encourages us to re-focus our treatment priorities. While we work to avoid treatment delays and maintain therapeutic benefit, we also need to minimize the risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposures, myelosuppression, general chemotherapy toxicity, and functional decline. Herein, we propose multidisciplinary care considerations for the aging patient with breast cancer, with the goal to promote a team-based, multidisciplinary treatment approach during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. These considerations remain relevant as we navigate the 'new normal' for the approximately 30% of breast cancer patients age &#8805;70 years who are diagnosed in the U.S. annually and for the thousands of older patients living with recurrent and/or metastatic disease.","Freedman, Rachel A; Sedrak, Mina S; Bellon, Jennifer R; Block, Caroline C; Lin, Nancy U; King, Tari A; Minami, Christina; VanderWalde, Noam; Jolly, Trevor A; Muss, Hyman B; Winer, Eric P",J. natl. cancer inst,,171

This review will provide a systematic framework for infectious risk mitigation strategies relevant to these therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: We classify risk mitigation strategies according to the following framework: (1) screening and patient selection, (2) vaccinations, (3) antibiotic prophylaxis, (4) laboratory and MRI monitoring, (5) adjusting dose and frequency of DMT, and (6) behavioral modifications to limit the risk of infection. We systematically apply this framework to the infections for which risk mitigations are available: hepatitis B, herpetic infections, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and tuberculosis. We also discuss up-to-date recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccinations for patients on DMTs. We offer a practical, comprehensive, DMT-specific framework of derisking strategies designed to minimize the risk of infections associated with the newer MS therapies.","Smith, Tyler Ellis; Kister, Ilya",Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,,171
267234,"Tracheotomy in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Weaning, Decannulation, and Survival",2021,"BACKGROUND: Based on inhibition of viral replication and limited reports on clinical efficacy, hydroxychloroquine is being considered as prophylaxis and treatment of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Although hydroxychloroquine is generally considered safe during pregnancy based on studies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and other rheumatic conditions, there may still be reluctance to institute this antimalarial during pregnancy for the sole purpose of antiviral therapy. METHODS: To provide data regarding any potential fetal/neonatal cardiotoxicity, we leveraged a unique opportunity in which neonatal ECGs and hydroxychloroquine blood levels were available in a recently completed study evaluating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily to prevent the recurrence of congenital heart block associated with anti-SSA/Ro (anti-Sjögren's Syndrome A/Ro) antibodies. RESULTS: Forty-five ECGs were available for corrected QT interval (QTc) measurement, and levels of hydroxychloroquine were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy and in the cord blood, providing unambiguous assurance of drug exposure. Overall, there was no correlation between cord blood levels of hydroxychloroquine and the neonatal QTc (R=0.02, P=0.86) or the mean of hydroxychloroquine values obtained throughout each individual pregnancy and the QTc (R=0.04, P=0.80). In total 5 (11% [95% CI, 4%-24%]) neonates had prolongation of the QTc >2 SD above historical healthy controls (2 markedly and 3 marginally) but ECGs were otherwise normal. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, these data provide reassurances that the maternal use of hydroxychloroquine is associated with a low incidence of infant QTc prolongation. However, if included in clinical COVID-19 studies, early postnatal ECGs should be considered.

Even in the United States, as armed white-supremacist, pro-Trump forces face off against protesters seeking justice for African Americans, the hostility is increasingly palpable, and often frightening. Yet as millions of Black Lives Matter protesters demonstrated after the brutal police killing of George Floyd, the current, intersecting crises – worsened by Trump's criminalization of anti-racism protesters and his dismissal of science – demand a serious, engaged, response from activists as well as artists. The title of this article is meant to evoke not only the state of the unusually cruel moment through which we are living, but also the very different approaches to performance of both Brecht and Artaud, whose ideas, along with those of others – including Benjamin, Butler, Latour, Mbembe, and Césaire – inform the radical, open-ended, post-pandemic theatre practice proposed in this essay.

275855,Sending retirees to the frontlines?,2020,"On March 16, 2020, 198,000 dentists in the United States closed their doors to patients, fueled by concerns that aerosols generated during dental procedures are potential vehicles for transmission of respiratory pathogens through saliva. Our knowledge of these aerosol constituents is sparse and gleaned from case reports and poorly controlled studies. Therefore, we tracked the origins of microbiota in aerosols generated during ultrasonic scaling, implant osteotomy, and restorative procedures by combining reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (to identify and quantify SARS-CoV-2) and 16S sequencing (to characterize the entire microbiome) with fine-scale enumeration and source tracking. Linear discriminant analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distances revealed significant class separation between the salivary microbiome and aerosol microbiota deposited on the operator, patient, assistant, or the environment (P < 0.01, analysis of similarities). We also discovered that 78% of the microbiota in condensate could be traced to the dental irrigant, while saliva contributed to a median of 0% of aerosol microbiota. We also identified low copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the saliva of several asymptomatic patients but none in aerosols generated from these patients. Together, the bacterial and viral data encourage us to conclude that when infection control measures are used, such as preoperative mouth rinses and intraoral high-volume evacuation, dental treatment is not a factor in increasing the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients and that standard infection control practices are sufficiently capable of protecting personnel and patients from exposure to potential pathogens. This information is of immediate urgency, not only for safe resumption of dental treatment during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but also to inform evidence-based selection of personal protection equipment and infection control practices at a time when resources are stretched and personal protection equipment needs to be prioritized.","Meethil, A P; Saraswat, S; Chaudhary, P P; Dabdoub, S M; Kumar, P S",J Dent Res,,171

298455,The relationship of large city out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and the prevalence of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This online cross-sectional study investigated the severity of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms among university students and determined the association between various factors and the levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after the movement control order (MCO) was lifted. METHODS: A total of 316 participants were administered a self-report questionnaire that collected data on sociodemographic attributes, personal characteristics, COVID-19-related stressors, religious coping, and clinical characteristics. In addition, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were administered. RESULTS: Regarding depression, 15.5%, 11.7%, and 9.2% of the participants reported mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe depression, respectively. For anxiety, 7.0%, 16.5%, and 13.2% of the respondents had mild, moderate, and severe to extremely severe anxiety, respectively. Moreover, 26.3% of participants had mild stress, 9.5% had moderate stress, and 6.6% had severe to extremely severe stress. The multiple linear regression model revealed that frustration because of loss of daily routine and study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated depressive symptoms, while a greater degree of family and friends social support was associated with less depressive symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. It was also found that frustration because of study disruption and having preexisting medical, depressive, and anxiety disorders were associated with elevated anxiety symptoms, while being enrolled in medicine-based courses and having a greater degree of family support were factors associated with less anxiety symptoms after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status. CONCLUSION: There is a need to conduct a longitudinal study in the future to confirm the causal relationship between the significant predictive factors and depression and anxiety identified in this study, and maintenance of a persistent flow of academic activities and social interaction may be of utmost importance to safeguard the mental wellbeing of university students.","Woon, Luke Sy-Cherng; Leong Bin Abdullah, Mohammad Farris Iman; Sidi, Hatta; Mansor, Nor Shuhada; Nik Jaafar, Nik Ruzyanei",PLoS One,,171

Detecting these infections, particularly asymptomatic ones, is critical to stemming further transmission of the virus in the months ahead. This will require active surveillance efforts in which these undetected cases are proactively sought out rather than waiting for individuals to present to testing sites for diagnosis. However, finding these pockets of asymptomatic cases (i.e., hotspots) is akin to searching for needles in a haystack as choosing where and when to test within communities is hampered by a lack of epidemiological information to guide decision makers' allocation of these resources. Making sequential decisions with partial information is a classic problem in decision science, the explore v. exploit dilemma. Using methods-bandit algorithms-similar to those used to search for other kinds of lost or hidden objects, from downed aircraft or underground oil deposits, we can address the explore v. exploit tradeoff facing active surveillance efforts and optimize the deployment of mobile testing resources to maximize the yield of new SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses. These bandit algorithms can be implemented easily as a guide to active case finding for SARS-CoV-2. A simple Thompson sampling algorithm and an extension of it to integrate spatial correlation in the data are now embedded in a fully functional prototype of a web app to allow policymakers to use either of these algorithms to target SARS-CoV-2 testing. In this instance, potential testing locations were identified by using mobility data from UberMedia to target high-frequency venues in Columbus, Ohio, as part of a planned feasibility study of the algorithms in the field. However, it is easily adaptable to other jurisdictions, requiring only a set of candidate test locations with point-to-point distances between all locations, whether or not mobility data are integrated into decision making in choosing places to test.","Gonsalves, Gregg S; Copple, J Tyler; Paltiel, A David; Fenichel, Eli P; Bayham, Jude; Abraham, Mark; Kline, David; Malloy, Sam; Rayo, Michael F; Zhang, Net; Faulkner, Daria; Morey, Dane A; Wu, Frank; Thornhill, Thomas; Iloglu, Suzan; Warren, Joshua L",Med Decis Making,,171

SARS-CoV-2 infects the pancreas through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), where it is highly expressed compared to other organs, leading to pancreatic damage with subsequent impairment of insulin secretion and development of hyperglycemia even in non-DM patients. Thus, this review aims to provide an overview of the potential link between COVID-19 and hyperglycemia as a risk factor for DM development in relation to DM pharmacotherapy. For that, a systematic search was done in the database of MEDLINE through Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM), and Wanfang Data. Data obtained underline that SARS-CoV-2 infection in DM patients is more severe and associated with poor clinical outcomes due to preexistence of comorbidities and inflammation disorders. SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs glucose homeostasis and metabolism in DM and non-DM patients due to cytokine storm (CS) development, downregulation of ACE2, and direct injury of pancreatic beta-cells. Therefore, the potent anti-inflammatory effect of diabetic pharmacotherapies such as metformin, pioglitazone, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors may mitigate COVID-19 severity. In addition, some antidiabetic agents and also insulin may reduce SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and severity through the modulation of the ACE2 receptor expression. The findings presented here illustrate that insulin therapy might seem as more appropriate than other anti-DM pharmacotherapies in the management of COVID-19 patients with DM due to low risk of uncontrolled hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). From these findings, we could not give the final conclusion about the efficacy of diabetic pharmacotherapy in COVID-19;thus, clinical trial and prospective studies are warranted to confirm this finding and concern.","Al-Kuraishy, H.

Objective: To determine the proportion of improper face mask use, the factors associated with face mask protection efficacy, and ways to improve efficacy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in China from July to August 2020 in 5 kinds of public places. Participants included convenience samples of individuals wearing face masks and able to taste the check solution. Exposures: Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, including sex, age, and education level; information on face mask model and the worn duration was recorded. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome as airtightness, assessed by detecting face-to-face mask gaps, movement of cotton fiber placed at the face mask edges, and using a qualitative fit test with a bitter solution spray. Masks were further assessed for whether sealing the upper face mask edge with an adhesive tape strip was associated with improved face mask airtightness. Results: Among 6003 face mask wearers enrolled, the mean (SD) age of participants was 31.1 (13.7) years, and 3047 participants (50.8%) were female. The first qualitative fit test found air leakage in 2754 participants (45.9%; 95% CI, 44.6%-47.1%), which was mostly attributable to gaps at the upper face mask edge. After sealing the upper face mask edge with an adhesive tape strip, 69.7% (95% CI, 68.0%-71.5%) of masks that had exhibited leakage became airtight in the second qualitative fit test, and the rate of airtightness reached 96.2% (95% CI, 95.4%-96.8%) in a third qualitative fit test after new surgical face masks with tape on the upper edge were provided to those who had not converted initially. The tape was well tolerated; overall, 6 participants (1.2%) reported a rash and 24 participants (5.8%) reported significant discomfort. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of face mask fit among participants in China, although most people used face masks in public places, compromised protection due to suboptimal airtightness was common.

Masks were further assessed for whether sealing the upper face mask edge with an adhesive tape strip was associated with improved face mask airtightness. Results: Among 6003 face mask wearers enrolled, the mean (SD) age of participants was 31.1 (13.7) years, and 3047 participants (50.8%) were female. The first qualitative fit test found air leakage in 2754 participants (45.9%; 95% CI, 44.6%-47.1%), which was mostly attributable to gaps at the upper face mask edge. After sealing the upper face mask edge with an adhesive tape strip, 69.7% (95% CI, 68.0%-71.5%) of masks that had exhibited leakage became airtight in the second qualitative fit test, and the rate of airtightness reached 96.2% (95% CI, 95.4%-96.8%) in a third qualitative fit test after new surgical face masks with tape on the upper edge were provided to those who had not converted initially. The tape was well tolerated; overall, 6 participants (1.2%) reported a rash and 24 participants (5.8%) reported significant discomfort. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of face mask fit among participants in China, although most people used face masks in public places, compromised protection due to suboptimal airtightness was common. The simple approach of sealing the upper edge of the face mask with an adhesive tape strip was associated with substantially improved its airtightness.","Pan, Xiangbin; Li, Xi; Kong, Pengxu; Wang, Lin; Deng, Rundi; Wen, Bin; Xiao, Luoxi; Song, Honglin; Sun, Yi; Zhou, Hongmei; Lu, Jiang; Wang, Yang; Guo, Qiuzhe; Duo, Lin; Sun, Chengye",JAMA Netw Open,,171

316718,Situational Awareness Huddles in a Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Decades of warnings that the trade and consumption of wildlife could result in serious zoonotic pandemics have gone largely unheeded. Now the world is ravaged by COVID-19, with tremendous loss of life, economic and societal disruption, and dire predictions of more destructive and frequent pandemics. There are now calls to tightly regulate and even enact complete wildlife trade bans, while others call for more nuanced approaches since many rural communities rely on wildlife for sustenance. Given pressures from political and societal drivers and resource limitations to enforcing bans, increased regulation is a more likely outcome rather than broad bans. But imposition of tight regulations will require monitoring and assessing trade situations for zoonotic risks. We present a tool for relevant stakeholders, including government authorities in the public health and wildlife sectors, to assess wildlife trade situations for risks of potentially serious zoonoses in order to inform policies to tightly regulate and control the trade, much of which is illegal in most countries. The tool is based on available knowledge of different wildlife taxa traded in the Asia-Pacific Region and known to carry highly virulent and transmissible viruses combined with relative risks associated with different broad categories of market types and trade chains.","Wikramanayake, Eric Pfeiffer Dirk U.; Magouras, Ioannis Conan Anne Ziegler Stefan Bonebrake Timothy C.; Olson, David",One Health,,171

The patients were all male, aged 35-72 years old. There were 26 cases of hypopharyngeal cancer, 4 cases of recurrent laryngeal cancer, 2 cases of cervical esophageal cancer, 1 case of tonsillar cancer, 1 case of parotid gland cancer, 3 cases of postoperative pharyngeal fistula after hypopharyngeal cancer, 2 cases of esophageal fistula after trauma, 2 cases of esophageal stricture after hypopharyngeal carcinoma operation, 1 case of autoimmune laryngeal stenosis, and 1 case of cheek defect after maxillary sinus cancer operation.""Point"" was the origin of the supraclavicular artery in the transverse carotid artery. ""Line"" was an extension line made along the starting point of the supraclavicular vessel for anterograde anatomy of 1-2 cm and the direction of the blood vessel. The extension line was used as the central axis of the designed island flap. Characteristics of flap blood supply, the time of flap preparation, flap survival, donor area recovery and clinical follow-up were recorded. Results: The arterial blood supply of the flap was constant, and the venous reflux was variable. The area of the prepared flap was (4-8) cm×(10-18) cm, and the preparation time was 30-60 min, with a median of 42 min. Skin flap survival rate was 100%. Partial necrosis of skin flap occurred in 1 patient and postoperative pharyngeal fistula occurred in 5 patients, all of whom were cured by dressing change. The donor site defects were closed and sutured directly. 3 patients had partial incision dehiscence and healed after dressing change. During the follow-up, 1 patient was lost, and the remaining 42 patients were followed up for 8 to 55 months.40 patients involved swallowing function, all of them returned to regular diet or soft fluid after operation.40 patients involved malignant tumors and local tumor recurrence in 3 patients among whom, there were 2 cases of lymph node recurrence, and 2 cases of distant metastasis, including 1 case of lung metastasis and 1 case of bone metastasis.

Resumption of employment after lung transplantation is generally supported. In Switzerland, there are no data on long-term employment in people with cystic fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation. METHODS: In a single-centre, cross-sectional study at a Swiss university hospital, clinical data from lung transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis, covering the transplantation period from January 1996 to December 2016, were analysed retrospectively. The potential influence of pre-lung transplantation factors (age, sex, lung function, body mass index, six-minute walk test distance, lung transplantation wait list time, paid employment on the wait list, education, relationship status, housing situation) and post-lung transplantation factors (chronic allograft dysfunction [CLAD], dialysis, cancer diagnosis [except skin cancer]) on paid employment and work percentage after lung transplantation were investigated using mixed logistic and linear regression models. Descriptive analyses of paid employment were performed for various periods after lung transplantation (&lt;1, 1&ndash;3, 3&ndash;5, 5&ndash;10, &gt;10 years). Data are reported as odds ratios (ORs) or coefficients (&beta;) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Eighty-four subjects (46.4% female) with a mean &plusmn; SD age of 29.9 &plusmn; 8.4 years were included in the study. Mean wait time for lung transplantation was 42.7 &plusmn; 40.2 weeks. The number (percentage) of subjects employed &lt;1 year, 1&ndash;3 years, 3&ndash;5 years, 5&ndash;10 years and &gt;10 years after lung transplantation was n = 23 (28%), n = 51 (65%), n = 44 (75%), n = 30 (68%) and n = 21 (75%), respectively. In mixed logistic regression models, pre-lung transplantation paid employment (OR 24.03, 95% CI 6.08 to 164.39, p &lt;0.0001), academic education (OR 7.81, 95% CI 1.66 to 48.66, p = 0.01) and time post lung transplantation (on log scale, OR 5.81, 95% CI 3.15 to 12.78, p &lt;0.0001) were the main factors influencing post-lung transplantation paid employment status. In mixed linear regression models, pre-lung transplantation paid employment (&beta; = 21.40, 95% CI 10.98 to 31.81, p = 0.00014), academic education (&beta; = 12.54, 95% CI 0.48 to 24.55, p = 0.05) and time post lung transplantation (on log scale, &beta; = 8.96, 95% CI 6.17 to 11.82, p &lt;0.0001) were the main factors influencing work percentage post lung transplantation. No evidence for an influence of clinical factors such as CLAD, cancer or dialysis on post-lung transplantation employment and work percentage was found. CONCLUSION: Pre-transplant employment is the dominant factor influencing lung transplantation employment in people with cystic fibrosis. People with cystic fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation should be encouraged to work for as long as their health status permits. Professional reintegration after successful lung transplantation should be supported by a multi-disciplinary lung transplant team.","Radtke, Thomas; Königs, André; Chen, Xijin; Braun, Julia; Dressel, Holger; Benden, Christian",Swiss Med Wkly,,171
320825,Death Cafés for prevention of burnout in intensive care unit employees: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (STOPTHEBURN),2020,"The continued absence of viable vaccines, limited diagnostic tools, insufficient protocol for isolation period, and weak health care system in developing countries with Nigeria inclusive heightens the tension trailing the arrival of Novel SARS-CoV-2 that was officially declared a global health emergency by World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. In this context, this study assesses the adequacy and potency of treatment for pneumonia associated with the Novel SARS-CoV-2. Counting from 27th February 2020, exponential rise in cases of SARS-CoV-2 has been recorded in Nigeria. Despite limited data on person-to-person transmission or nosocomial transmission, we report the epidemiological features of a familial cluster of 4 positive cases to SARS-CoV-2 in Nasarawa State, North Central Nigeria. This cluster presented with an unexplained pneumonia after having contact with a family member who died after manifesting symptoms of Novel SARS-CoV-2; the test came out positive after his demise. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were performed using nasopharyngeal swabs (Novel Coronavirus PCR Fluorescence Diagnostic Kit, BioGerm Medical Biotechnology at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Abuja. Nigeria. From March 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of four patients out of a family of 10 who were positive to novel coronavirus. Four family members (aged 36-43 years) all presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. These conditions continued to manifest at the Federal Medical Center, Keffi in Nasarawa State, 3-7 days after symptom onset. Their nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these 10 family members were taken and four returned positive to coronavirus, while six tested negative. The epidemiological evidence from our study on familial cluster analysis reveals possible transmission of Novel SARS-CoV-2 during the incubation period. Study outcomes underscore the importance of probing contact history of potentially infected individuals, for prompt identification to preventing further spread.","Akyala, Adamu Ishaku; Muhammad, Liman; Akabe, Emmanuel; Akinyoade, Akinyinka; Agogo, Emmanuel",Pan Afr Med J,,171
320920,Some Additional Aspects,2020,"BACKGROUND: Care homes have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to suffer large outbreaks even when community infection rates are declining, thus representing important pockets of transmission. We assessed occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among staff in six care homes experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak during the peak of the pandemic in London, England. METHODS: Care home staff were tested for SARS-COV-2 infection by RT-PCR and asked to report any symptoms, their contact with residents and if they worked in different care homes. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on RT-PCR positive samples. RESULTS: In total, 53 (21%) of 254 staff were SARS-CoV-2 positive but only 12/53 (23%) were symptomatic. Among staff working in a single care home, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 15% (2/13), 16% (7/45) and 18% (30/169) in those reporting no, occasional and regular contact with residents. In contrast, staff working across different care homes (14/27, 52%) had a 3.0-fold (95% CI, 1.9-4.8; P<0.001) higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity than staff working in single care homes (39/227, 17%). WGS identified SARS-CoV-2 clusters involving staff only, including some that included staff working across different care homes. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 positivity was significantly higher among staff working across different care homes than those who were working in the same care home. We found local clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection between staff only, including those with minimal resident contact. Infection control should be extended for all contact, including those between staff, whilst on care home premises.","Ladhani, Shamez N; Chow, J Yimmy; Janarthanan, Roshni; Fok, Jonathan; Crawley-Boevey, Emma; Vusirikala, Amoolya; Fernandez, Elena; Perez, Marina Sanchez; Tang, Suzanne; Dun-Campbell, Kate; Wynne-Evans, Edward; Bell, Anita; Patel, Bharat; Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Aiano, Felicity; Paranthaman, Karthik; Ma, Thomas; Saavedra-Campos, Maria; Myers, Richard; Ellis, Joanna; Lackenby, Angie; Gopal, Robin; Patel, Monika; Chand, Meera; Brown, Kevin; Hopkins, Susan; Consortium, CoG; Shetty, Nandini; Zambon, Maria; Ramsay, Mary E",J Infect,,171

Currently, there is no decisive therapy for COVID-19 or related complications. The only hope to mitigate this pandemic is through vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines are being developed rapidly, compared to traditional vaccines, and are being approved via Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) worldwide. So far, there are 232 vaccine candidates. One hundred and seventy-two are in preclinical development and 60 in clinical development, of which 9 are approved under EUA by different countries. This includes the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), Canada, Russia, China, and India. Distributing vaccination to all, with a safe and efficacious vaccine is the leading priority for all nations to combat this COVID-19 pandemic. However, the current accelerated process of COVID-19 vaccine development and EUA has many unanswered questions. In addition, the change in strain of SARS-CoV-2 in UK and South Africa, and its increasing spread across the world have raised more challenges, both for the vaccine developers as well as the governments across the world.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study evaluated patients' clinical state with the Diagnostic Interview for Psychoses (DIP), and assessed language and communication disturbances (LCD) with the RL-CC-SR in all participants (213 healthy controls (HC), 83 SZ patients, 31 SZ first-degree relatives). Data from the current sample of SZ (n=50), and HC (n=213) was analysed to calculate the relationships between LCD, social and clinical variables using descriptive statistics methods, T-test and Pearson's correlations (SPSS-26, 2019). RESULTS: The quotient scores (<6) and raw scores on all three CC-SR subscales demonstrated prominent LCD in SZ: (i) language structure (LS) (SZ:11.92±8.01, HC:7.54±5.91; p<0.001), (ii) pragmatic skills (PS) (SZ:11.30±10.07, HC:8.71±7.39; p=0.040), (iii) social engagement (SE) (SZ:31.94±11.76, HC:19.42±10.35; p<0.001).

We collected daily COVID-19 diagnoses and mortality data from the WHO's daily situation reports dated January 1 to December 31, 2020. We performed three time-series models [simple exponential smoothing, auto-regressive integrated moving average, and automatic forecasting time-series (Prophet)] to identify the global trend of rCFR for COVID-19. We used beta regression models to investigate the association between the rCFR and potential predictors of each country and reported incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of each variable. The weekly global cumulative COVID-19 rCFR reached a peak at 7.23% during the 17th week (April 22-28, 2020). We found a positive and increasing trend for global daily rCFR values of COVID-19 until the 17th week (pre-peak period) and then a strong declining trend up until the 53rd week (post-peak period) toward 2.2% (December 29-31, 2020). In pre-peak of rCFR, the percentage of people aged 65 and above and the prevalence of obesity were significantly associated with the COVID-19 rCFR. The declining trend of global COVID-19 rCFR was not merely because of increased COVID-19 testing, because COVID-19 tests per 1,000 population had poor predictive value. Decreasing rCFR could be explained by an increased rate of infection in younger people or by the improvement of health care management, shielding from infection, and/or repurposing of several drugs that had shown a beneficial effect on reducing fatality because of COVID-19.","Hasan, Mohammad Nayeem; Haider, Najmul; Stigler, Florian L; Khan, Rumi Ahmed; McCoy, David; Zumla, Alimuddin; Kock, Richard A; Uddin, Md Jamal",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,171
336041,Perioperative Psychological Interventions in Heart Surgery,2021,"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China in late 2019 and subsequently caused a pandemic. Surveillance is important to better appreciate this evolving pandemic and to longitudinally monitor the effectiveness of public health measures. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide a rapid, easy to establish and costeffective laboratory-based surveillance tool for SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN: We used minipools of RNA prepared from nucleic acid extractions of routine respiratory samples. We technically validated the assay and distributed the protocol within an informal network of five German university laboratories. RESULTS: We tested a total of 70 minipools resembling 700 samples shortly before the upsurge of cases in Germany from 17.02.2020 to 10.03.2020. One minipool reacted positive and after resolution one individual sample tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. This sample was from a hospitalized patient not suspected of having contracted SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach of a laboratory-based surveillance for SARSCoV-2 using minipools proved its concept is easily adaptable and resource-saving. It might assist not only public health laboratories in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.","Eis-Hübinger, Anna M; Hönemann, Mario; Wenzel, Jürgen J; Berger, Annemarie; Widera, Marek; Schmidt, Barbara; Aldabbagh, Souhaib; Marx, Benjamin; Streeck, Hendrik; Ciesek, Sandra; Liebert, Uwe G; Huzly, Daniela; Hengel, Hartmut; Panning, Marcus",J Clin Virol,,171

DESIGN: Longitudinal study of patients discharged from hospitals to post-acute care organizations. SETTING: 12 hospitals and 14 PACO Portuguese organizations. PARTICIPANTS: 181 patients participated in the both stages of data gathering. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' physical and mental health status was measured through the SF-36 scale. The experience of transition from hospital to post-acute care organizations was measured with the Care Transition Measure. The Picker Adult In-Patient Questionnaire was used to measure patients' experience in these organizations. RESULTS: Patients reporting better physical condition in post-acute care organizations had a better experience on discharge [b = 0.21, 95% CI (0.10, 0.31)] and perceive fewer problems inside facilities [b = -0.19, 95% CI (-0.31, 0.08)]. The experience in post-acute care organizations is significantly related to patients' mental health status [b = -0.47, 95% CI (-0.59, -0.36)]. Patients showing higher levels of physical recovery had a better experience on discharge [b = -0.18, 95% CI (0.08, 0.28)], while those registering better mental recovery experienced fewer problems during their stay [b = -0.41, 95% CI (-0.52, -0.30)]. CONCLUSIONS: PACO play a key role in maintaining and promoting patients' health and this goal is influenced by their experience both in the transition from hospitals to PACO and while staying in these facilities.","Nascimento, Generosa do; Nunes, Francisco Guilherme; Anderson, Janet E",Int. j. qual. health care,,171

350179,COVID-19 Combat Fatigue among the Healthcare Workers: Time for Retrospection and Action,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Acute presentations of COVID-19 infection vary, ranging from asymptomatic carriage through to severe clinical manifestations including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Longer term sequelae of COVID-19 infection includes lung fibrosis in a proportion of patients. Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) is a mucin like glycoprotein that has been proposed as a marker of pulmonary epithelial cell injury. We sought to determine whether KL-6 was a marker of 1) the severity of acute COVID-19 infection, or 2) the persistence of symptoms/radiological abnormalities at medium term follow up. METHODS: Prospective single centre observational study. RESULTS: Convalescent KL-6 levels were available for 93 patients (male 63%, mean age 55.8 years) who attended an 12-week follow up appointment after being admitted to hospital with COVID-19. For 67 patients a baseline KL-6 result was available for comparison. There was no significant correlations between baseline KL-6 and the admission CXR severity score or clinical severity NEWS score. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the baseline KL-6 level and an initial requirement for oxygen on admission or the severity of acute infection as measured at 28 days. There was no significant difference in the 12-week KL-6 level and the presence or absence of subjective breathlessness but patients with abnormal CT scans at 12 weeks had significantly higher convalescent KL-6 levels compared to the remainder of the cohort (median 1101 IU/ml vs 409 IU/ml). CONCLUSIONS: The association between high KL-6 levels at 12 weeks and persisting CT abnormalities (GGO/fibrosis), is a finding that requires further exploration. Whether KL-6 may help differentiate those patients with persisting dyspnoea due to complications rather than deconditioning or dysfunctional breathing alone, is an important future research question.","Arnold, David T; Donald, Charmaine; Lyon, Max; Hamilton, Fergus W; Morley, Anna J; Attwood, Marie; Dipper, Alexandra; Barratt, Shaney L",PLoS One,,171

In Italy, we gradually approached the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this phase, the activities restarted according to a temporal plan. During the second phase, ""social distancing"" will continue and telemedicine will continue to play a pivotal role. Now, during the second phase of the fight against the pandemic, we need: (1) to maintain social distancing; (2) to face new imminent criticalities highlighted in recent studies published in Telemedicine and e-Health; (3) to protect fragile subjects and to support disabled subjects; and (4) to still care/rehabilitate critical patients (still present even if in a decreased number). Telemedicine is still important and must also be rethought. The study, starting from the needs of chronic patients, highlighted in the recent studies published in this journal, expanded the possibilities of multiple opportunities for telemedicine integration during the second phase. An emerged categorization takes into consideration (1) the subjects with fragility, including those with rare diseases; (2) the experience gained during the emergency; (3) the new opportunities emerged for telemedicine boundaries; and (4) the new needs for telemedicine-based pulmonary rehabilitation at home.","Giansanti, Daniele",Telemed. j. e. health,,171

353558,Bilateral Longus Colli Abscesses as a Complication of Advanced Bacterial Rhinosinusitis,2021,"BACKGROUND: To halt the spread of COVID-19, Austria implemented a 7-week 'lockdown' in March/April 2020. We assess whether the ensuing reduction in social contacts led to increased loneliness among older adults (60+). METHODS: Three analyses were conducted: (i) a comparison between pre-pandemic (SHARE: 2013-17) and pandemic (May 2020) levels of loneliness (UCLA-3 scale), (ii) an assessment of the cross-sectional correlation between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness (May 2020) and (iii) a longitudinal analysis of weekly changes (March-June 2020) in loneliness (Corona panel). RESULTS: We found (i) increased loneliness in 2020 compared with previous years, (ii) a moderate positive association between the number of restriction measures older adults were affected from and their loneliness and (iii) that loneliness was higher during 'lockdown' compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have indeed resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects seem to be short-lived, and thus no strong negative consequences for older adults' mental health are expected. Nonetheless, the effects on loneliness, and subsequent mental health issues, could be both more long-lasting and severe if future restriction measures are enacted repeatedly and/or over longer time periods.","Stolz, Erwin; Mayerl, Hannes; Freidl, Wolfgang",Eur J Public Health,,171

In general, conserved quantities allow to reduce the formulation of a mechanical problem to fewer degrees of freedom, a process known as dynamical reduction. However, extant reductions are either non-general, or hide the problem's symmetry or include unexplained definitions. This paper presents a dynamical reduction that avoids these issues, and hence is general and natural. Any three-body configuration defines a triangle, and its orientation in space. Accordingly, we decompose the dynamical variables into the geometry (shape + size) and orientation of the triangle. The geometry variables are shown to describe the motion of an abstract point in a curved 3d space, subject to a potential-derived force and a magnetic-like force with a monopole charge. The orientation variables are shown to obey a dynamics analogous to the Euler equations for a rotating rigid body, only here the moments of inertia depend on the geometry variables, rather than being constant. The reduction rests on a novel symmetric solution to the center of mass constraint inspired by Lagrange's solution to the cubic. The formulation of the orientation variables is novel and rests on a little known generalization of the Euler-Lagrange equations to non-coordinate velocities. Applications to special exact solutions and to the statistical solution are described or discussed. Moreover, a generalization to the four-body problem is presented.","Kol, Barak",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12372v1.pdf,171

In addition to its anti-viral activity, the anti-inflammatory activity of chloroquine may also contribute to its efficacy. Based on our data obtained from an animal infection model of melioidosis (a disease caused by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei), treatment with chloroquine can result in the phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK3ß). This serine/threonine protein kinase is now recognised as a point of convergence for host inflammatory response. In view of this, it is plausible that the mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effect of chloroquine against COVID-19 involves inhibition of host GSK3ß.","Embi, Mohammed Noor; Ganesan, Nagesswary; Sidek, Hasidah Mohd",Drug Discov Ther,,171

The feast in honor of a rural spirit, previously the most popular village event, was reduced to a ceremony with offerings and prayers in front of the altar which was performed by the representatives of Doàn clan. On the one hand, this version of the ceremony weakens the integration of the village community and eliminates such an important religious practice as pilgrimage. On the other hand, restrictive measures brought the ceremony closer to its traditional form: ordinary community members, women, tourists were excluded from participation in the rituals, while the Doàn clan's members directly communicated with the spirits, the way it is prescribed by tradition. © 2021 Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

A better knowledge of the living conditions during the first lockdown is necessary to prevent the risk of poor mental health (PMH) in this population. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to compare the mental health of caregivers of PWD living at home or in nursing-homes and to identify specific factors influencing their mental health. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional online survey in France from March 17 to May 11, 2020. Three hundred and eighty-nine caregivers accompanying a PWD living at home (HC) and 159 accompanying a PWD living in a nursing home (NHC) participated in the study. Caregivers' mental health including anxiety, depression, stress, and burden was assessed with self-reported standardized scales. RESULTS: Half of the caregivers exhibited PMH, including depression, anxiety, or self-reported stress. Similar PMH rates were provided whatever the PWD place of residence. Regarding HC, our results also highlighted a number of risk factors for PMH, including the fact that caregiver live with PWD, to give increased support to PWD, and to feel more isolated for managing PWD since lockdown. CONCLUSION: PMH was observed for caregivers of PWD during lockdown, whatever PWD living place, suggesting that concern for PWD may explain more of caregiver distress than increased material tasks. In the future, it will be necessary to pay attention to caregivers after the crisis by estimating the longer-term impact on their mental health.","Borg, Céline; Rouch, Isabelle; Pongan, Elodie; Getenet, Jean Claude; Bachelet, Romain; Herrmann, Mathieu; Bohec, Anne-Lise; Laurent, Bernard; Rey, Romain; Dorey, Jean-Michel",J. alzheimers dis,,171
397790,Locally Informed Modeling to Predict Hospital and Intensive Care Unit Capacity During the COVID-19 Epidemic,2020,"Abstract A new virus called Sars-CoV-2, or COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 and caused several changes worldwide. In light of this, countries adopted preventive measures against this pandemic, such as social isolation, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and special care with people who are at higher risk, such as elderly, people with hypertension or chronic conditions, and recently newborns, pregnant and puerperal women were also included. For puerperal women breastfeeding, it is an extremely important moment, which, in addition to being a natural feeding moment, it is an opportunity to strengthen the mother-baby bond. Aiming at a more cautious approach to avoid possible transmissions of COVID-19 during breastfeeding, preventive measures can hinder this binomial and bring harm to both.","Paz, Monique Maria Silva da; Almeida, Milene de Oliveira; Cabral, Nadine Oliveira; Assis, Thais Josy Castro Freire de; Mendes, Cristina Katya Torres Teixeira",Rev.

Para tanto, foram utilizados oito equinos da raça Puro Sangue Árabe, distribuídos de forma que todos animais passaram por dois grupos, com intervalo entre eles de 7 dias: Grupo maltodextrina (GM n=8), que ingeriram 1g de maltodextrina + veículo, 45 min antes de cada teste e Grupo controle (GC n=8) que ingeriram veículo (1g/kg de farelo de trigo + 0,1g/kg de óleo de soja) 45 min antes de cada teste. O teste padrão de exercício progressivo (TPEP) consistiu em inclinação da esteira a +6%, com velocidade inicial de 1,8 m/s por 5min, a 4 m/s por 3min, a 6 m/s por 2 min, seguidos de fases a 7, 8 e 9 m/s por dois minutos cada, de modo que a manta da esteira foi parada quando os cavalos não conseguiram acompanhar a velocidade, mesmo sendo estimulados. Após o término do exercício o animal foi monitorado quanto a concentração de glicose plasmática e lactato sanguíneo, além dos valores da frequência cardíaca e índices de desempenho: distância percorrida, V200 e V4. Para análise estatística os os animais foram considerados como blocos, para diminuir o efeito da variabilidade devido ao desempenho de cada animal. A normalidade das variáveis-resposta foi confirmada utilizando o teste de Shapiro-Wilk e o teste de Tukey.

406523,"Abortion at the edges: Politics, practices, performances",2020,"BACKGROUND: Alpha-tocopherol (&#945;T), the bioactive constituent of vitamin E, is essential for fertility and neurological development. Synthetic &#945;T (8 stereoisomers; all rac-&#945;T) is added to infant formula at higher concentrations than natural &#945;T (RRR-&#945;T only) to adjust for bio-potency differences, but its effects on brain development are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine the impact of bio-potency-adjusted dietary all rac-&#945;T versus RRR-&#945;T, fed to dams, on the hippocampal gene expression in weanling mice. METHODS: Male/female pairs of C57BL/6J mice were fed AIN 93-G containing RRR-&#945;T (NAT) or all rac-&#945;T (SYN) at 37.5 or 75 IU/kg (n = 10/group) throughout gestation and lactation. Male pups were euthanized at 21 days. Half the brain was evaluated for the &#945;T concentration and stereoisomer distribution. The hippocampus was dissected from the other half, and RNA was extracted and sequenced. Milk &#945;T was analyzed in separate dams. RESULTS: A total of 797 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the hippocampi across the 4 dietary groups, at a false discovery rate of 10%. Comparing the NAT-37.5 group to the NAT-75 group or the SYN-37.5 group to the SYN-75 group, small differences in brain &#945;T concentrations (10%; P < 0.05) led to subtle changes (<10%) in gene expression of 600 (NAT) or 487 genes (SYN), which were statistically significant. Marked differences in brain &#945;T stereoisomer profiles (P < 0.0001) had a small effect on fewer genes (NAT-37.5 vs. SYN-37.5, 179; NAT-75 vs. SYN-75, 182). Most of the DEGs were involved in transcription regulation and synapse formation. A network analysis constructed around known vitamin E interacting proteins (VIPs) revealed a group of 32 DEGs between NAT-37.5 vs. SYN-37.5, explained by expression of the gene for the VIP, protein kinase C zeta (Pkcz). CONCLUSIONS: In weanling mouse hippocampi, a network of genes involved in transcription regulation and synapse formation was differentially affected by dam diet &#945;T concentration and source: all rac-&#945;T or RRR-&#945;T.","Rhodes, Justin S; Rendeiro, Catarina; Mun, Jonathan G; Du, Kristy; Thaman, Pragya; Snyder, Amanda; Pinardo, Heinrich; Drnevich, Jenny; Chandrasekaran, Sriram; Lai, Chron-Si; Schimpf, Karen J; Kuchan, Matthew J",J. nutr,,171
407827,It's a long war;Not over yet!,2021,"During the cardiac cycle, there is a multi-phasic bidirectional longitudinal movement (LMov) of the intima-media complex of large arteries, i.e. along the arteries. On the left side the common carotid artery (CCA) arises directly from the aortic arc, whereas on the right side the CCA originate from the innominate artery. The aim of this study was to compare LMov of the left and right CCA of healthy subjects to investigate whether the difference in anatomy are of importance for LMov. The CCA's of 93 healthy subjects were investigated using in-house developed ultrasound methods. Although the basic pattern were the same in the majority of subjects, several phases of LMov were significantly larger on the left side (the first retrograde phase, p=00006; the second antegrade, ""returning"" phase, p<0.00001; and the rapid retrograde phase of movement at the end of the cardiac cycle, p<0.000001). In contrast, no significant side-difference in the amplitude of the first antegrade movement was seen. The maximal (peak-to-peak) LMov was significantly larger on the left side (p=0.002). The side differences found seem to increase with aging, and may be related to the difference in anatomy, including possible difference in distance to the heart and especially the presence of an extra bifurcation on the right side. Our data provide an important base for the further study of the relation between the longitudinal movement and atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic plaques.","Zhu, Yuxiang; Cinthio, Magnus; Erlöv, Tobias; Bjarnegård, Niclas; Ahlgren, Åsa Rydén",Clin. physiol. funct. imaging,,171
408482,"Update Alert: Ventilation Techniques and Risk for Transmission of Coronavirus Disease, Including COVID-19",2020,"SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, infected over 100 million people globally by February 2021. Reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to other species has been documented in pet cats and dogs, big cats and gorillas in zoos, and farmed mink. As SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to known bat viruses, assessment of the potential risk of transmission of the virus from humans to bats, and its subsequent impacts on conservation and public health, is warranted. A qualitative risk assessment was conducted by a multi-disciplinary group to assess this risk in bats in the Australian context, with the aim of informing risk management strategies for human activities involving interactions with bats. The overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 establishing in an Australian bat population was assessed to be Low, however with a High level of uncertainty. The outcome of the assessment indicates that, for the Australian situation where the prevalence of COVID-19 in humans is very low, it is reasonable for research and rehabilitation of bats to continue, provided additional biosecurity measures are applied. Risk assessment is challenging for an emerging disease where information is lacking and the situation is changing rapidly;assessments should be revised if human prevalence or other important factors change significantly. The framework developed here, based on established animal disease risk assessment approaches adapted to assess reverse zoonotic transmission, has potential application to a range of wildlife species and situations.","Cox-Witton, K.; Baker, M.

We showed that photo-activated TiO2 efficiently inhibits hepatitis C virus infection, and week indoor light with intensity of 0.6 mW/cm2 at broad-spectrum wavelength and around 0.15 mW/cm2 of UVA band also lead to partial inhibition. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that hydroxyl radicals produced by photo-activated TiO2 do not destroy virion structure and contents, but attack viral RNA genome, thus inactivating the virus. Furthermore, we showed that photo-activated TiO2 inactivates a broad range of human viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, we showed that photo-catalyzed nanosized TiO2 inactivates pathogenic viruses, paving a way to its field application in control of viral infectious diseases.","Tong, Yimin; Shi, Gansheng; Hu, Gaowei; Hu, Xiaoyou; Han, Lin; Xie, Xiaofeng; Xu, Yongfen; Zhang, Rong; Sun, Jing; Zhong, Jin",Chem Eng J,,171
414683,Persistence of immunoglobulin G after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite worldwide calls for precautionary measures to combat COVID-19, the public's preventive intention still varies significantly among different regions. Exploring the influencing factors of the public's preventive intention is very important to curtail the spread of COVID-19. Previous studies have found that fear can effectively improve the public's preventive intention, but they ignore the impact of differences in cultural values. The present study examines the combined effect of fear and collectivism on the public's preventive intention towards COVID-19 through the analysis of social media big data. METHODS: The Sina microblog posts of 108,914 active users from Chinese mainland 31 provinces were downloaded. The data was retrieved from January 11 to February 21, 2020. Afterwards, we conducted a province-level analysis of the contents of downloaded posts. Three lexicons were applied to automatically recognise the scores of fear, collectivism, and preventive intention of 31 provinces. After that, a multiple regression model was established to examine the combined effect of fear and collectivism on the public's preventive intention towards COVID-19. The simple slope test and the Johnson-Neyman technique were used to test the interaction of fear and collectivism on preventive intention. RESULTS: The study reveals that: (a) both fear and collectivism can positively predict people's preventive intention and (b) there is an interaction of fear and collectivism on people's preventive intention, where fear and collectivism reduce each other's positive influence on people's preventive intention. CONCLUSION: The promotion of fear on people's preventive intention may be limited and conditional, and values of collectivism can well compensate for the promotion of fear on preventive intention. These results provide scientific inspiration on how to enhance the public's preventive intention towards COVID-19 effectively.","Huang, Feng; Ding, Huimin; Liu, Zeyu; Wu, Peijing; Zhu, Meng; Li, Ang; Zhu, Tingshao",BMC Public Health,,171

The aim of this study is to assess the characteristics of immigrant patients who attended a Hospital Emergency Department during the first three waves of the coronavirus pandemic. Methods: A retrospective, descriptive study of immigrant patients treated in a Hospital Emergency Department between March 15 and November 30, 2020. A descriptive analysis and a comparative analysis were carried out according to place of origin, gender and age. For the comparative analysis, the chi-square test for qualitative variables was used. For the comparative analysis according to gender, Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used for normal or non-normal quantitative variables, respectively. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for normal or non-normal quantitative variables according to age. Results: We have analyzed 633 immigrant patients who visited the emergency department during the study period. Of the sample, 50.1% patients were women and 78% of all patients came from Africa. The mean age of the patients was 44.1 years. Most patients (72.5%) were discharged to home after evaluation in the emergency department, especially European patients. One-quarter of patients required social resources to be able to comply with quarantine measures, of whom 87% were African. Forty-seven percent of patients became infected at home and 41% in the workplace. Conclusions: The immigrant population is generally younger and less infected than the population at large. In addition, the use of social resources to guarantee patient isolation has often proved essential in controlling outbreaks that have arisen in these communities.","Yuguero, Oriol; Calahorra, Marta; Cuevas, Sabrina; Giménez, Natalia; Hernández, Iñaki; Lacasta, Jose Daniel; Porque, Juliana; Pardos, César",J Migr Health,,171

This study performed a systematic review in PubMed/EMBASE of studies reporting the prevalence of VTE in patients with COVID-19 who were totally screened/assessed for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or for pulmonary embolism (PE). Among 47 candidate studies (n = 6459; 33 in Europe), 17 studies (n = 3973; weighted age 63.0 years, males 60%, intensive care unit (ICU) 16%) reported the prevalence of PE with a pooled estimate of 32% (95% CI: 25, 40%), and 32 studies (n = 2552; weighted age 62.6 years, males 57%, ICU 49%) reported the prevalence of DVT with a pooled estimate of 27% (95% CI: 21, 34%). A total of 36 studies reported the use of at least prophylactic antithrombotic treatment in the majority of their patients. Meta-regression analysis showed that the prevalence of VTE was higher across studies with a higher percentage of ICU patients and higher study population mean D-dimer values, and lower in studies with mixed dosing of anticoagulation in â©¾ 50% of the population compared to studies with standard prophylactic dosing of anticoagulation in < 50% of the population.

METHODS: The prospective observational multicentre study carried out from 1 March till 30 June 2020 included adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support or high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO). RESULTS: Seventy-four patients, 46 males and 28 females, median age 67.5 (Q1-Q3: 56-75) years, were included. Sixty-four patients (86.5%) had comorbidity. Sixty-six patients (89.2%) were mechanically ventilated, four of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. Eight patients (10.8%) were treated with non-invasive ventilation and HFNO only. The median of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 22.5 days. Eighteen patients (24.3%) needed continuous renal replacement therapy. Thirty patients (40.5%) died. Age and acute kidney injury were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital death, and chronic kidney disease showed trend towards statistical significance for poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient number of intensive care beds, organ support equipment and well-trained staff is a decisive factor in managing the COVID-19 epidemic. The study focused on the needs of intensive care in the COVID-19 patients. Advanced age and acute kidney injury were identified as independent predictors for in-hospital mortality.

432485,Adjunctive IgM-enriched immunoglobulin therapy with a personalised dose based on serum IgM-titres versus standard dose in the treatment of septic shock: a randomised controlled trial (IgM-fat trial),2021,"OBJECTIVES: 1.5 million people in the UK have mild to moderate learning disabilities. STIs and bloodborne viruses (BBVs) are over-represented in people experiencing broader health inequalities, which include those with mild learning disabilities. Self-managed care, including self-sampling for STIs/BBVs, is increasingly commonplace, requiring agency and health literacy. To inform the development of a partner notification trial, we explored barriers and facilitators to correct use of an STI/BBV self-sampling pack among people with mild learning disabilities. METHODS: Using purposive and convenience sampling we conducted four interviews and five gender-specific focus groups with 25 people (13 women, 12 men) with mild learning disabilities (July-August 2018) in Scotland. We balanced deductive and inductive thematic analyses of audio transcripts to explore issues associated with barriers and facilitators to correct use of the pack. RESULTS: All participants found at least one element of the pack challenging or impossible, but welcomed the opportunity to undertake sexual health screening without attending a clinic and welcomed the inclusion of condoms. Reported barriers to correct use included perceived overly complex STI/BBV information and instructions, feeling overwhelmed and the manual dexterity required for blood sampling. Many women struggled interpreting anatomical diagrams depicting vulvovaginal self-swabbing. Facilitators included pre-existing STI/BBV knowledge, familiarity with self-management, good social support and knowing that the service afforded privacy. CONCLUSION: In the first study to explore the usability of self-sampling packs for STI/BBV in people with learning disabilities, participants found it challenging to use the pack. Limiting information to the minimum required to inform decision-making, 'easy read' formats, simple language, large font sizes and simpler diagrams could improve acceptability.

434140,"Command, control and communication (C3) during the COVID-19 pandemic;adapting a military framework to crisis response in a tertiary UK critical care centre",2021,"In the absence of a specific treatment or vaccines, public health strategies are the main measures to use in the initial stages of a pandemic to allow surveillance of infectious diseases. During the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), several countries initiated various public health strategies, such as contact tracing and quarantine. The present study aims to conduct a systematic literature review to identify the presence of educational initiatives that promote the implementation of public health strategies before public health emergencies, with a special focus on contact tracing applications. Using Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, and Gothenburg University search engines, all published scientific articles were included, while conference, reports, and non-scientific papers were excluded. The outcomes of the reviewed studies indicate that the effective implementation of public health strategies depends on the peoples' willingness to participate and collaborate with local authorities. Several factors may influence such willingness, of which ethical, psychological, and practical factors seem to be the most important and frequently discussed. Moreover, individual willingness and readiness of a community may also vary based on the acquired level of knowledge about the incident and its cause and available management options. Educational initiatives, proper communication, and timely information at the community level were found to be the necessary steps to counteract misinformation and to promote a successful implementation of public health strategies and attenuate the effects of a pandemic. The systematic review conducted as a part of this study would benefit the relevant stakeholders and policy makers and assist with effective designing and implementation.","Khorram-Manesh, Amir; Dulebenets, Maxim A; Goniewicz, Krzysztof",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,171
436184,Threshold Effect of the Government Intervention in the Relationship Between Business Cycle and Population Health: Evidence From China,2021,"OBJECTIVE: We study the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India and model the epidemic to guide those involved in formulating policy and building healthcare capacity. METHODS: This effect is studied using the SEIR compartmental model. We estimate the infection rate using a least square method with Poisson noise and calculate the reproduction number. RESULTS: The infection rate is estimated to be 0.270 and the reproduction number to be 2.70. The approximate peak of the epidemic will be August 9, 2020. A 25% drop in infection rate will delay the peak by 11 days for a 1 month intervention period. The total infected individuals in India will be 9% of the total population. CONCLUSION: The predictions are sensitive to changes in the behaviour of people and their practice of social distancing.","Shah, Parth Vipul",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,171
436757,Interventional Surgical Treatment Options,2020,"BACKGROUND: A pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 has been sweeping the world since December. It begins as a respiratory infection that, mainly in men with diabetes or renal impairment, evolves into a systemic disease, with SARDS, progressive endothelial cell damage, abnormal clotting and impaired cardiovascular and liver function. Some clinical trials are testing biological drugs to limit the immune system dysregulation, ""cytokines storm,"" that causes the systemic complications of COVID-19. The contraindications of these drugs and their cost raise concerns over the implications of their widespread availability. OBJECTIVES: Numerous clinical and experimental studies have revealed a role for the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP-phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) pathway in modulating low-grade inflammation in patients with metabolic diseases, offering cardiovascular protection. PDE5 inhibition favors an anti-inflammatory response by modulating activated T cells, reducing cytokine release, lowering fibrosis, increasing oxygen diffusion, stimulating vascular repair. PDE5 is highly expressed in the lungs, where its inhibition improves pulmonary fibrosis, a complication of severe COVID-19 disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of all evidence documenting any involvement of the NO-cGMP-PDE5 axis in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, presenting the ongoing clinical trials aimed at modulating this axis, including our own ""silDEnafil administration in DiAbetic and dysmetaboLic patients with COVID-19 (DEDALO trial)."" RESULTS: The reviewed evidence suggests that PDE5 inhibitors could offer a new strategy in managing COVID-19 by (i) counteracting the Ang-II-mediated downregulation of AT-1 receptor; (ii) acting on monocyte switching, thus reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, interstitial infiltration and the vessel damage responsible for alveolar hemorrhage-necrosis; (iii) inhibiting the transition of endothelial and smooth muscle cells to mesenchymal cells in the pulmonary artery, preventing clotting and thrombotic complications. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: If the ongoing trials presented herein should provide positive findings, the low cost, wide availability and temperature stability of PDE5 inhibitors could make them a major resource to combat COVID-19 in developing countries.","Isidori, Andrea M; Giannetta, Elisa; Pofi, Riccardo; Venneri, Mary A; Gianfrilli, Daniele; Campolo, Federica; Mastroianni, Claudio M; Lenzi, Andrea; d039,; Ettorre, Gabriella",Androl.

Using electronic health record data from a St. Louis-region hospital network, we performed multi-state analyses to examine longitudinal transitions and outcomes among hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with respect to fifteen mutually-exclusive clinical states. Between March 15 and July 25, 2020, 1,577 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 (49.9% male, median age 63 years [IQR 50, 75], 58.8% Black). Overall, 34.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26.4%, 41.8%) had an ICU admission and 12.3% (CI 8.5%, 16.1%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The risk of decompensation peaked immediately after admission, discharges peaked around day 3 to 5, and deaths plateaued between days 7 and 16.

448252,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and donation after circulatory death during the COVID-19 pandemia,2020,"Access and personalized instruction required for laboratory education can be highly compromised due to regulatory constraints in times such as COVID-19 pandemic or resource shortages at other times. This directly impacts the student engagement and immersion that are necessary for conceptual and procedural understanding for scientific experimentation. While online and remote laboratories have potential to address the aforementioned challenges, theoretical perspectives of laboratory learning outcomes are critical to enhance their impact and are sparsely examined in the literature. Using Transactional Distance Theory (TDT), this paper addresses the gap through a case study on Universal Testing Machine (UTM). By comparing physical (PL-UTM) and remotely triggerable (RT-UTM) laboratory platforms, the structure and interactions as per TDT are analysed. Characterization of interactivity between remote learners and instructors disclose indicative parameters that affect transactional distances and aid in conceptual understanding in remote laboratory learning environment. An extensive pedagogical study through development of two instruments towards assessing conceptual understanding and perception of platform effectiveness that was conducted both on physical laboratory and RT-UTM showed: (1) remote users conducted experiments 3 times more frequently (2) completed assignments in 30% less time and (3) had over 200% improvement in scores when RT-UTM platform was integrated into mainstream learning.","Achuthan, Krishnashree Raghavan Dhananjay Balakrishnan Shankar Francis Saneesh P.; Kani, Kolil Vysakh",International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education,,171
449396,Personal protective equipment and intensive care unit healthcare worker safety in the COVID-19 era (PPE-SAFE): An international survey,2020,"Bacterial sepsis and severe COVID-19 share similar clinical manifestations and are both associated with dysregulation of the myeloid cell compartment. We previously reported an expanded CD14+ monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis and validated expansion of this cell subpopulation in publicly available transcriptomics data. Here, using published datasets, we show that the gene expression program associated with MS1 correlated with sepsis severity and was up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. To examine the ontogeny and function of MS1 cells, we developed a cellular model for inducing CD14+ MS1 monocytes from healthy bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We found that plasma from patients with bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 induced myelopoiesis in HSPCs in vitro and expression of the MS1 gene program in monocytes and neutrophils that differentiated from these HSPCs. Furthermore, we found that plasma concentrations of IL-6, and to a lesser extent IL-10, correlated with increased myeloid cell output from HSPCs in vitro and enhanced expression of the MS1 gene program. We validated the requirement for these two cytokines to induce the MS1 gene program through CRISPR-Cas9 editing of their receptors in HSPCs. Using this cellular model system, we demonstrated that induced MS1 cells were broadly immunosuppressive and showed decreased responsiveness to stimulation with a synthetic RNA analog. Our in vitro study suggests a potential role for systemic cytokines in inducing myelopoiesis during severe bacterial or SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Reyes, Miguel; Filbin, Michael R; Bhattacharyya, Roby P; Sonny, Abraham; Mehta, Arnav; Billman, Kianna; Kays, Kyle R; Pinilla-Vera, Mayra; Benson, Maura E; Cosimi, Lisa A; Hung, Deborah T; Levy, Bruce D; Villani, Alexandra-Chloe; Sade-Feldman, Moshe; Baron, Rebecca M; Goldberg, Marcia B; Blainey, Paul C; Hacohen, Nir",Sci. transl. med,,171

METHODS: Inclusion criteria were: (1) clinical and molecular diagnosis of SMA2 or SMA3; (2) nusinersen treatment started in adult age (>18 years); (3) clinical data available at least at baseline (T0-beginning of treatment) and 6 months (T6). RESULTS: We included 116 patients (13 SMA2 and 103 SMA3) with median age at first administration of 34 years (range 18-72). The Hammersmith Functional Rating Scale Expanded (HFMSE) in patients with SMA3 increased significantly from baseline to T6 (median change +1 point, p<0.0001), T10 (+2, p<0.0001) and T14 (+3, p<0.0001). HFMSE changes were independently significant in SMA3 sitter and walker subgroups. The Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) in SMA3 significantly improved between T0 and T14 (median +0.5, p=0.012), with most of the benefit observed in sitters (+2, p=0.018). Conversely, patients with SMA2 had no significant changes of median HFMSE and RULM between T0 and the following time points, although a trend for improvement of RULM was observed in those with some residual baseline function. The rate of patients showing clinically meaningful improvements (as defined during clinical trials) increased from 53% to 69% from T6 to T14. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide further evidence of nusinersen safety and efficacy in adult SMA2 and SMA3, with the latter appearing to be cumulative over time. In patients with extremely advanced disease, effects on residual motor function are less clear.","Maggi, Lorenzo; Bello, Luca; Bonanno, Silvia; Govoni, Alessandra; Caponnetto, Claudia; Passamano, Luigia; Grandis, Marina; Trojsi, Francesca; Cerri, Federica; Ferraro, Manfredi; Bozzoni, Virginia; Caumo, Luca; Piras, Rachele; Tanel, Raffaella; Saccani, Elena; Meneri, Megi; Vacchiano, Veria; Ricci, Giulia; Soraru039,; Gianni,; D039,; Errico, Eustachio; Tramacere, Irene; Bortolani, Sara; Pavesi, Giovanni; Zanin, Riccardo; Silvestrini, Mauro; Politano, Luisa; Schenone, Angelo; Previtali, Stefano Carlo; Berardinelli, Angela; Turri, Mara; Verriello, Lorenzo; Coccia, Michela; Mantegazza, Renato; Liguori, Rocco; Filosto, Massimiliano; Marrosu, Gianni; Siciliano, Gabriele; Simone, Isabella Laura; Mongini, Tiziana; Comi, Giacomo; Pegoraro, Elena",,,171

This study aimed to investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: From February 21 to April 24, 2020, 66 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at Chungnam National University Hospital were analyzed; all patients underwent routine urinalysis and were tested for serum creatinine, urine protein to creatinine ratio (PCR), and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR). RESULTS: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred in 3 (4.5%) of the 66 patients, and 1 patient with AKI stage 3 underwent hemodialysis. Upon follow-up, all 3 patients recovered normal renal function. Compared with patients with mild COVID-19, AKI (n = 3) occurred in patients with severe COVID-19, of whom both urine PCR and ACR were markedly increased. CONCLUSION: The incidence of AKI was not high in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: The study was conducted in the pandemic wards of Adiyaman University Training and Research Hospital during April and May 2020. All patients admitted to the COVID-19 pandemic wards during the study period were invited to participate in the study. The study included 40 adults who agreed to participate and underwent a mucociliary clearance test successfully. The primary outcome was mucociliary clearance time and the secondary variables of interest were age, sex, and sino-nasal outcome test-22 scores. The control group included 40 concomitant healthy patients who visited the outpatient ear, nose and throat clinic with non-nasal symptoms. RESULTS: The study included 40 COVID-19-positive patients and 40 healthy controls. The mean mucociliary clearance times of the study (15.53 ± 5.57 min) and control (9.50 ± 3.70 min) groups were significantly different (Z = 4.675, p < 0.001). However, the mucociliary clearance time was not significantly different between males and females (t = 0.590, p = 0.558).

477221,23 Rapid design and deployment of an adult critical care transport team – the launch of big CATS,2020,"BACKGROUND: Protecting first-line healthcare providers against work-related COVID-19 infection at the onset of the pandemic has been a crucial challenge in the United States. Anesthesiologists in particular are considered at risk, since aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubation and extubation, have been shown to significantly increase the odds for respiratory infections during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks. This study assessed the incidence of COVID-19-like symptoms and presence of COVID-19 antibodies after work-related COVID-19 exposures, among physicians working in a large academic hospital in New York City (NYC). METHODS: An e-mail survey was addressed to anesthesiologists and affiliated intensive care providers at Columbia University Irving Medical Center on April 15, 2020. The survey assessed 4 domains: 1) demographics and medical history, 2) community exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., use of NYC subway), 3) work-related exposure to COVID-19, and 4) development of COVID-19-like symptoms after work exposure. The first 100 survey responders were invited to undergo a blood test to assess antibody status (presence of IgM/IgG specific to COVID-19). Work-related exposure was defined as any episode where the provider was not wearing adequate personal protective equipment (airborne or droplet/contact protection depending on the exposure type). Based on the clinical scenario, work exposure was categorized as high-risk (e.g., exposure during intubation) or low-risk (e.g., exposure during doffing). RESULTS: 205 healthcare providers were contacted and 105 completed the survey (51%); 91 completed the serological test. Sixty-one of the respondents (58%) reported at least one work-related exposure and 54% of the exposures were high-risk. Among respondents reporting a work-related exposure, 16 (26.2%) reported post-exposure COVID-19-like symptoms. The most frequent symptoms were myalgia (9 cases), diarrhea (8 cases), fever (7 cases), and sore throat (7 cases). COVID-19 antibodies were detected in 11 of the 91 tested respondents (12.1%), with no difference between respondents with (11.8%) or without (12.5%) a work- related exposure, including high-risk exposure. Compared with antibody negative respondents, antibody positive respondents were more likely to use NYC subway to commute to work and report COVID-19-like symptoms in the last 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: In the epicenter of the United States' pandemic and within 6-8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak, a small proportion of anesthesiologists and affiliated intensive care providers reported COVID-19-like symptoms after a work-related exposure and even fewer had detectable COVID-19 antibodies. Presence of COVID-19 antibodies appeared to be associated with community/environmental transmission rather than secondary to work-related exposures involving high risk procedures.","Morcuende, Miguel; Guglielminotti, Jean; Landau, Ruth",,,171
477685,High prevalence of acute stress disorder and persisting symptoms in ICU survivors after COVID-19,2021,"Introduction: In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, characterized by a picture of atypical pneumonia composed of fever, dry cough and progressive dyspnea. Autopsy analyzes of patients with Covid-19 were performed, and hyperactivation of cytotoxic T cells was observed, suggesting an increase in humoral-type immunological signaling, where interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a mediator present that can fit as a potential critical agent for exacerbation of inflammatory conditions. In addition, not only interleukin-6, but also serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin have been recognized as strong predictors of COVID-19 severity. Recent studies have shown that the use of liraglutide has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. Thus, the present case report discusses the possible anti-inflammatory properties of the antidiabetic drug liraglutide (Saxenda), in Covid-19. Clinical Case: JCMS, 45 years, male, married, obese grade 2 (BMI: 38.2), sought medical service on August 18, 2020, bringing a positive result of the RT-PCR test for Covid-19, performed in last day. The patient was in good general condition, reporting mild headache and adynamia. He was prescribed to start a treatment with Saxenda (6mg/ml - started 0.6mg/day at week 1, with a gradual increase up to 3mg/day at week 5);Jardiance (25mg / day);Fluimicil (600mg);Ivermectin (6mg) and Colchicine (0.5mg every 12 hours). In addition, collection of laboratory tests was requested. Examination results: IL6: &amp;lt;1.5 pg/mL;Ferritin: 819 ng/ml;C-reactive protein: 5.1mg/L. On August 24, the patient was tachycardic (HR 120–140 bpm) associated with headache and fever (38 °C). Azithromycin (500mg), dexamethasone (4mg) and dipyrone (1g) were prescribed. Collection of laboratory tests was requested. Examination results: IL6: 9.3 pg/mL;Ferritin: 1085 ng/ml;C-reactive protein:23.9mg/L. On September 3, the patient was in good general condition, eupneic, afebrile, with no complaints to declare. On September 6, the collection of laboratory tests was requested. Examination results: IL6: &amp;lt;1.5 pg/mL;Ferritin: 687 ng/ml;C-reactive protein: 1.7mg/L. Conclusion: Based on the described report, it is possible to observe a good clinical and laboratory evolution of the patient with Covid-19 who, among the drugs used, made use of liraglutida. Diabetes and obesity are considered significant risk factors for morbidity and mortality by COVID-19, since they are a condition of low-grade chronic inflammation and in these conditions, inflammatory markers such as CRP, IL-6 and ferritin have strong signs of alteration. Thus, the possible beneficial effect of the administration of liraglutide in obese patients is highlighted, as a potential anti-inflammatory effect, especially in the COVID-19 era.","Hanada, Taliê Zanchetta Buani Knack Rafael Silvestre Knack Renata Silvestre",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,171

While conservation, ecological and veterinary professions are getting increasingly engaged with OH, most of the medical/clinical and social sciences professions are only peripherally aware of its nuances. The OH initiatives, by their essentially multidisciplinary nature, entail working across ministries and navigating tacit institutional hierarchies and allocating leadership roles. The logical operational step will be the constitution of One Health Committees (OHC) at the State and district levels.

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health problem. A fraction of the population is at increased risk of developing complications of this disease, in particular older subjects as well as diabetic, obese and hypertensive patients. With regard to patients with high blood pressure, the existence of an increased risk remains to be confirmed in large controlled trials. So far the findings regarding this question are reassuring, whether these patients are treated or not. There seems to be no reason to worry when using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. The observations available to date suggest that COVID-19 vaccine can be administered safely to hypertensive patients. In conclusion, there is no reason to implement changes in the care of hypertensive patients due to the pandemic.","Wuerzner, Grégoire; Waeber, Bernard",Praxis (Bern 1994),,171
483985,Integrating nutrition into the mathematics curriculum in Australian primary schools: protocol for a randomised controlled trial,2020,"Since the first reported case of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China, researchers and governments have witnessed an unseen rise in the number of cases. Thanks to the rapid work of Chinese scientists, the pathogen now called SARS-CoV-2 has been identified and its whole genome was deposited in public databases by early January 2020. The availability of the genome has allowed researchers to develop Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays, which are now the gold-standard for molecular diagnosis of the respiratory syndrome COVID19. Because of the rising number of cases and rapid spreading, the world has been facing a shortage of RT-PCR supplies, especially the ones involved in RNA extraction. This has been a major bottleneck to increase testing capacity in many countries that do not significantly manufacture these supplies, such as Brazil. Additionally, RT-qPCR scalability is highly dependent on equipment that usually performs testing of 96 samples at a time. In this work, we describe a cost-effective molecular NGS-based test for diagnosis of COVID19, which uses a single-step RNA extraction and presents high scalability and accuracy when compared to the gold-standard RT-qPCR. A single run of the NGS-based test using the Illumina NextSeq 550 mid-end sequencing equipment is able to multiplex 1,536 patient's samples, providing individual semi-qualitative results (detected, not detected). Detected results are provided with fragments per million (FPM) values, which was demonstrated to correlate with RT-qPCR Cycle Threshold (CT) values. Besides, usage of the high-end Illumina Novaseq platform may yield diagnostic for up to 6144 samples in a single run. Performance results when compared with RT-qPCR show general accuracy of 96%, and 98% when only samples with CT values (gene N) lower than 30 are considered. We have also developed an online platform, termed VarsVID, to help test executors to easily scale testing numbers. Sample registering, wet-lab worksheets generation, sample sheet for sequencing and results' display are all features provided by VarsVID. Altogether, these results will contribute to control COVID19 pandemics.","de Mello Malta, Fernanda; Amgarten, Deyvid; Val, Felipe Camilo; Cervato, Murilo Castro; de Azevedo, Bruna Mascaro Cordeiro; de Souza Basqueira, Marcela; Dos Santos Alves, Camila Oliveira; Nobrega, Maria Soares; de Souza Reis, Rodrigo; Sebe, Pedro; Gretschischkin, Michel Chieregato; de Oliveira, Diego Delgado Colombo; Nakamura, Carolina Naomi Izo; Chazanas, Pedro Lui Nigro; Pinho, João Renato Rebello",Sci Rep,,171
486425,Pityriasis rosea following CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccination: a case report,2021,"INTRODUCTION: In the 5 months since it began, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed extraordinary demands on health systems around the world including surgery. Competing health objectives and resource redeployment threaten to retard the scale-up of surgical services in low- and middle-income countries where access to safe, affordable and timely care is low. The key aspiration of the Lancet Commission on global surgery was promotion of resilience in surgical systems. The current pandemic provides an opportunity to stress-test those systems and identify fault-lines that may not be easily apparent outside of times of crisis. METHODS: We endeavoured to explore vulnerable points in surgical systems learning from the experience of past outbreaks, using examples from the current pandemic, and make recommendations for future health emergencies. The 6-component framework for surgical systems planning was used to categorise the effects of COVID-19 on surgical systems, with a particular focus on low- and middle-income countries. Key vulnerabilities were identified and recommendations were made for the current pandemic and for the future. RESULTS: Multiple stress points were identified throughout all of the 6 components of surgical systems. The impact is expected to be highest in the workforce, service delivery and infrastructure domains. Innovative new technologies should be employed to allow consistent, high-quality surgical care to continue even in times of crisis. CONCLUSIONS: If robust progress towards global surgery goals for 2030 is to continue, the stress points identified should be reinforced. An ongoing process of reappraisal and fortification will keep surgical systems in low- and middle-income countries responsive to ""old threats and new challenges"". Multiple opportunities exist to help realise the dream of surgical systems resilient to external shocks.","Mazingi, Dennis; Navarro, Sergio; Bobel, Matthew C; Dube, Andile; Mbanje, Chenesa; Lavy, Chris",World J Surg,,171

This pilot study was undertaken to inform feasibility and safety of further definitive studies. This was a prospective, interventional and randomized open label pilot trial in patients with severe COVID-19. Twenty COVID-19 patients received two 200 ml transfusions of convalescent patient CP over 24-h compared with 20 who received standard of care. The primary outcome was the requirement for ventilation (non-invasive or mechanical ventilation). The secondary outcomes were biochemical parameters and mortality at 28 days. The CP group were a higher risk group with higher ferritin levels (p < 0.05) though respiratory indices did not differ. The primary outcome measure was required in 6 controls and 4 patients on CP (risk ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.22-2.0, p = 0.72); mean time on ventilation (NIV or MV) did not differ. There were no differences in secondary measures at the end of the study. Two patients died in the control and one patient in the CP arm. There were no significant differences in the primary or secondary outcome measures between CP and standard therapy, although a larger definitive study is needed for confirmation.

However, despite subjecting each participant to the same training program, the training effect solely depended on the individual. This study aimed to evaluate whether certain blood parameters influenced the effect of a low-load resistance training program on muscle thickness in the community-dwelling elderly population. METHODS: Sixty-nine community-dwelling Japanese (49 women and 20 men) subjects aged 69.4 ± 6.5 years were included. Low-load resistance training was performed twice a week for 12 weeks. Muscle thickness at the anterior aspects of the thigh (AT) was measured using a B-mode ultrasound device, and 22 blood parameter levels were assessed before and after the program. We checked the first quartile value of each parameter to establish cutoff values, and participants were divided into low or normal groups for each parameter. RESULTS: A low-load resistance training program significantly increased muscle thickness at the AT. The interaction between time and groups was examined at low (< 4.1 g/dL) versus normal (&#8805; 4.1 g/dL) serum albumin (Alb) levels. Although there was no difference in muscle thickness at the AT before the training intervention, the hypertrophic effects were higher in the normal serum Alb level group than in the low serum Alb level group. The binomial logistic regression analysis showed that participants in the low serum Alb group had an odds ratio of 7.08 for decreased muscle thickness at the AT. The effect of a low-load resistance training program on lower limb muscle thickness appears to be limited in participants with low serum Alb levels before training interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Serum Alb level may act as a biomarker to predict the effects of low-load resistance training programs on muscle hypertrophy in elderly individuals.

Based on the projection of the RNA-seq data into lower dimensions, we observe that the cases are separated from controls, and almost all cases never return to cluster with the controls over time. Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes between clusters identifies up-regulation of immune response genes. This observation is also supported by deconvolution analysis to identify the changes in cell type composition due to Lyme disease infection. Importantly, we developed several machine learning classifiers that attempt to perform various Lyme disease classifications.

Given the unresolved debate, we investigated the association of ARBs with in-hospital outcomes of these patients. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we studied patients with COVID-19 who referred to Sina Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from February 20 to May 29, 2020. Patients with either positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction test of swab specimens, or high clinical suspicion according to the World Health Organization's interim guidance were included. We followed-up patients for incurring death, severe COVID-19, and in-hospital complications. RESULTS: We evaluated 681 patients with COVID-19 of whom 37 patients were excluded due to incomplete medical records and 8 patients who used ACEIs which left 636 patients in the analysis. In this cohort, 108 (17.0%) patients expired and 407 (64.0%) patients incurred severe COVID-19. Of 254 (39.9%) patients with hypertension, 122 (48.0%) patients were receiving an ARB. After adjustment for possible confounders, we found no independent association between taking ARBs and in-hospital outcomes except for acute kidney injury (AKI), in patients with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19, either hypertensive or not-hypertensive. We found that discontinuation of ARBs during hospitalization was associated with a greater risk of mortality, invasive ventilation, and AKI (All PË0.002). CONCLUSIONS: We found that taking ARBs by patients with hypertension and confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 is not associated with poorer in-hospital outcomes after adjustment for possible confounders.","Soleimani, Abbas; Kazemian, Sina; Karbalai Saleh, Shahrokh; Aminorroaya, Arya; Shajari, Zahra; Hadadi, Azar; Talebpour, Mohammad; Sadeghian, Hakimeh; Payandemehr, Pooya; Sotoodehnia, Mehran; Bahreini, Maryam; Najmeddin, Farhad; Heidarzadeh, Ali; Zivari, Ensieh; Ashraf, Haleh",Am. j. hypertens,,171
507030,Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome in a patient with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The North American Spine Society (NASS) spine fellowship directory is an established resource that provides applicants with access to important information about different fellowship programs. Additionally, some programs have created websites to provide information about their fellowship program. There has been limited research on the amount and breadth of information provided by these different resources. PURPOSE: To assess and compare the scope of information provided by the North American Spine Society (NASS) fellowship directory and individual fellowship program websites. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Web Content Accessibility Study. PATIENT SAMPLE: There were no patient data used in this study. All reported data were accessed from public websites and the NASS fellowship directory (August 2022 fellowships). OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were reported as the presence or lack thereof of 22 topics pertaining to the specifics of each individual spine fellowship program on both the NASS fellowship directory and individual fellowship program websites. METHODS: The NASS fellowship directory (August 2022 fellowships) and individual program websites were evaluated by two independent reviewers. Program websites were identified via Google search with a systematic protocol. Within each platform, the availability of various data were recorded. Twenty-four different data points were assessed for each program and were categorized into four main categories-general program information, fellow profiles, clinical roles, and nonclinical roles of the fellow. Chi-squared tests were used to compare differences in the availability of specific data provided by the NASS fellowship directory and individual program websites. RESULTS: Seventy-four fellowship programs were identified. The NASS fellowship directory was more likely to provide information about the application process, a description of the program, fellow salary, faculty members, case descriptions, and research requirements (p<.05). The program websites were more likely to provide information about current and previous fellows-including a list of current fellow(s), their education/training, and a list of the previous fellows and their job choice (p<.05). Program websites were also more likely to discuss rotation schedules, clinic expectations, research opportunities, journal club, institutional meetings, sponsored national meetings, and current/previous research (p<.05). However, certain information, including specific clinical responsibilities (eg, rotation schedule, call expectations, clinic expectations) and the profiles of current and previous fellows, were not well represented on either platform. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the type of information provided by the NASS fellowship directory and program websites. Furthermore, there were key pieces of information that were not well represented on either platform.","Gerlach, Erik B; Plantz, Mark A; Swiatek, Peter R; Arpey, Nicholas C; Cantrell, Colin K; Divi, Srikanth N; Hsu, Wellington K; Patel, Alpesh A",Spine j,,171

The median age was 57 (interquartile range [IQR] 47-67), 60% were male, 40% Caucasian, and 30% Black/African American. Median time from transplant to COVID-19 testing was 2822 days (IQR 1272-4592). The most common symptom was fever, followed by cough, myalgia, chills, and fatigue. The most common chest X-ray and computed tomography abnormality was multifocal patchy opacities. Three patients had no abnormal findings. Leukopenia was seen in 20% of patients, and allograft function was stable in 50% of patients. Nine patients were on tacrolimus and a mycophenolic antimetabolite, and 70% were on prednisone. Hospitalized patients had their antimetabolite agent stopped. All hospitalized patients received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Three patients died (30%), and 5 (50%) developed acute kidney injury.

520072,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the city of Cape Town, South Africa: a retrospective, descriptive analysis of prehospital patient records",2021,"OBJECTIVE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many psychiatrists have rapidly transitioned to telemedicine. This qualitative study sought to understand how this dramatic change in delivery has affected mental health care, including modes of telemedicine psychiatrists used, barriers encountered, and future plans. The aim was to inform the ongoing COVID-19 response and pass on lessons learned to psychiatrists who are starting to offer telemedicine. METHODS: From March 31 to April 9, 2020, semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 outpatient psychiatrists practicing in five U.S. states with significant early COVID-19 activity. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to develop interview summaries, and a matrix analysis was conducted to identify and refine themes. RESULTS: At the time of the interviews, all 20 psychiatrists had been using telemedicine for 2-4 weeks. Telemedicine encompassed video visits, phone visits, or both. Although many continued to prefer in-person care and planned to return to it after the pandemic, psychiatrists largely perceived the transition positively. However, several noted challenges affecting the quality of provider-patient interactions, such as decreased clinical data for assessment, diminished patient privacy, and increased distractions in the patient's home setting. Several psychiatrists noted that their disadvantaged patients lacked reliable access to a smartphone, computer, or the Internet. Participants identified several strategies that helped them improve telemedicine visit quality. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a dramatic shift in how psychiatrists deliver care. Findings highlight that although psychiatrists expressed some concerns about the quality of these encounters, the transition has been largely positive for both patients and physicians.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Sousa, Jessica; Raja, Pushpa; Mehrotra, Ateev; Barnett, Michael L; Huskamp, Haiden A",Psychiatr Serv,,171

Different approaches are being used for treatment of this infection and its consequences, but limited results have been achieved and new therapeutics are still needed. One of the most interesting biotherapeutics in this era are Nanobodies which have shown very promising results in recent researches. Scope of review Here, we have reviewed the potentials of Nanobodies in Covid-19 treatment. We have also discussed the properties of these biotherapeutics that make them very suitable for pulmonary drug delivery, which seems to be very important route of administration in this disease. Major conclusion Nanobodies with their special biological and biophysical characteristics and their resistance against harsh manufacturing condition, can be considered as promising, targeted biotherapeutics which can be administered by pulmonary delivery pharmaceutical systems against Covid-19. General significance Covid-19 has become a global problem during the last two years and with emerging mutant strains, prophylactic and therapeutic approaches are still highly needed.

597370,Let's Talk About It: What COVID-19 Has Taught a South African Intensive Care Unit About Communication,2021-04-16,"Urgent demand for portable diagnosis has promoted a new sensing strategy that uses personal glucometer (PGM) to detect non-glucose targets. Even though great progresses have been achieved in terms of target range and sensing principle, issues such as low final signal-to-background ratio and hard-to-realize one-tube smart analysis still exist and challenge real-world applications in gene detection. Here we propose a practical solution via coupling isothermal amplification (i.e. LAMP) and three-way amplifiable catalytic hairpin assembly (i.e. CHA) to a PGM. It allows direct transduction from genomic information to commercial portable devices with all of ultra-high sensitivity, specificity and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Compared with previous report without signal amplification, the introduction of CHA has successfully improved the signal amplitude by at least 12.5 folds. More importantly, through importing an effective three-way junction based transduction, we also innovatively develop a one-tube logical or multiplex analysis strategy in PGM based detection. Totally four situations of two foodborne bacteria genes, in Cronobacter sakazakii (ompA) and Escherichia coli (malB), could be directly readout using the final PGM signals, with the lowest detection amount down to less than 100 molecular copies (6.6 × 10(−18) M). It is believed such a LAMP-CHA-PGM method has been already sensitive, specific, and of great potential for practically portable gene diagnostics.","Guo, Lulu; Lu, Baiyang; Dong, Qing; Tang, Yidan; Du, Yan; Li, Bingling",Anal Chim Acta,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145848/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003267020301379; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267020301379; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2020.01.068,171

599926,Protocol for a cohort study of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate and incidence of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,2021-06-21,"PURPOSE: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is associated with the presence and severity of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). We aimed to investigate the relationship between the severity of OSA and NAFLD and to recognize a polysomnographic parameter correlated with progression of fibrosis, determined by a non-invasive score of liver fibrosis, FIBrosis-4 index (FIB-4), in patients affected by severe obesity and OSA. METHODS: We enrolled 334 patients (Body Mass Index, BMI 44.78 ± 8.99 kg/m(2)), divided into classes according to severity of OSA evaluated with Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI): OSAS 0 or absent (17%), mild OSA (26%), moderate OSA (20%), severe OSAS (37%). We studied anthropometric, polysomnographic, biochemical data and FIB-4. A multiple regression model was computed to identify a polysomnographic independent predictor of FIB-4 among those parameters previously simple correlated with FIB-4. RESULTS: The severity of OSA was associated with a decrease in High-Density Lipoprotein–cholesterol (HDL) and an increase in BMI, triglycerides, Homeostasis model assessment insulin-resistance index (HOMA), transaminases and FIB-4. FIB-4 correlated with sex, age, BMI, AHI, mean percentage oxyhaemoglobin (meanSaO2%), number of desaturations, platelets, transaminases, HDL, triglycerides and HOMA. The only variables independently related to FIB-4 were sex, BMI, triglycerides and meanSpO2 (r = 0.47, AdjRsqr = 0.197). CONCLUSION: MeanSpO2% represented an independent determinant for the worsening of FIB-4 in patients with severe obesity and OSA. Hence, it could hypothesize a clinical role of meanSaO2% in recognizing patients with obesity and OSA and higher risk of developing advanced fibrosis and, thus, to undergo further investigation.

There is a paucity of literature in blacks with HCM overall and specifically on quality of life and functional capacity. Symptom experience in this population is conceptualized as the integration of quality of life, functional capacity and NYHA class. Objective This study aimed to examine differences in functional capacity, quality of life and NYHA between blacks and whites with HCM. Methods The study was a secondary analysis of a dataset of consecutively enrolled patients with HCM, referred for care at a large HCM specialty center. Data analyzed included demographics, co-morbidities, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ) scores on quality of life (QOL), age-adjusted functional capacity measured by METs achieved on symptom limited stress echocardiography, and NYHA class. Results Blacks comprised 13.1% of the total sample of 434 subjects. Women were underrepresented in both groups, 27 (47.4%) blacks, 153 (40.6%) whites. Blacks were younger, 54.6 (13.4) vs 62.5 (14.8) years old, p<0.001. Both groups had similar number of co-morbidities. Blacks had higher levels of Class II obesity (BMI 35-39.9); there were no differences in prevalence in HTN or other co-morbid conditions. NYHA class was similar between groups, though blacks were less likely to be asymptomatic (NYHA class I). Blacks had higher mean MLWHFQ scores, 31.2 (27.2) vs 23.9 (22.1), p=0.04 reflecting poorer QOL than whites. Blacks were also more likely to have a functional capacity objectively measured as METs that was “below average for age” than whites, 25 (64.1%) vs 115 (47.7%), p=0.029. None of the blacks (0%) in this cohort had an “excellent for age” functional capacity compared to 19 (7.9%) of whites p= 0.035. Conclusions Despite similar NYHA class, co-morbidities and significantly younger age, blacks with HCM had poorer QOL and worse objectively measured functional capacity than whites with HCM. These findings suggest that the symptom experience may differ between blacks and whites with HCM. Research with sample sizes including more blacks with HCM and more precise measurement of symptoms is needed to generalize these results and examine potential contributing factors.","Arabadjian, Milla E.; Yu, Gary; Vorderstrasse, Allison; Sherrid, Mark; Dickson, Victoria Vaughan",Journal of Cardiac Failure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420309714; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1071916420309714,171
602920,An Approved Landing Site (ALS) improves the logistics of interhospital transfer of critically ill patients by helicopter,2021-08-03,"INTRODUCTION: Ivermectin is a drug with antiviral properties and has been proposed as an alternative treatment for patients with COVID-19, in some countries; however, there is limited evidence to support its clinical use. Accordingly, the aim of this review and meta-analysis is to obtain superior evidence on the effectiveness and safety of ivermectin in treatment of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search in the medical databases and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases for randomised clinical trials and quasi-randomised trials published from December 2019. The criteria for inclusion are that infection needs to be confirmed by a real-time PCR or serology test, and the effect of ivermectin has been compared with placebo, symptomatic treatment or no treatment. We will exclude observational studies and clinical trials that involved patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, but without a laboratorial diagnosis. Outcomes of interest include mortality, time to symptom resolution, time of hospitalisation, frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome, admission to intensive care unit, viral load, PCR-negative status, percentage of infection after prophylactic use, and total incidence of adverse and side effects. Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Two reviewers will independently select the studies and assess their eligibility. Two other reviewers will independently extract data from each study. Meta-analysis will then be carried out using fixed-effects or random-effects model, using the mean difference for continuous outcomes and the relative risk for dichotomous outcomes. Bias risk will be assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The quality of evidence for each outcome will be assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. Review Manager V.5.3.5 will be used for synthesis and subgroup analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Owing to the nature of the review, ethical approval is not required.

Communities therefore have to monitor the incidence of COVID-19 carefully and attempt to project the demand for health care. To enable such projections, we have developed an interactive web application that simulates an age-structured SEIR model with separate compartments for severely and critically ill patients. The tool allows the users to modify most parameters of the model, including age specific assumptions on severity. Infection control and mitigation measures that reduce transmission can be specified, as well as age-group specific isolation. The simulation of the model runs entirely on the client side in the browser; all parameter settings and results of the simulation can be exported for further downstream analysis.

This virus was first identified around December 2019, from central China, but later spread in the rest of the world. To ensure better healthcare service management, an accurate prediction of the uncertain gruesomeness is situational demand. In orders with limited information frameworks, demonstrating and predicting COVID-19 turns into a challenging endeavor. The primary objective of this study is to propose a hybrid model that incorporates ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting the COVID-19 epidemic. A real-time COVID-19 time series data has been used on the window periods January 22, 2020, to May 18, 2020. The time-series data first decomposed using EEMD to produce sub-signals and make original data denoised, and ANN architecture has built to train the denoised data. Finally, the result of the proposed model has compared with some traditional statistical analysis. The result of this investigation shows our proposed model outperforms compared with traditional statistical analysis. Thus the model might be promising for COVID-19 epidemic prediction.

METHODS: A 10-year retrospective study (January 2006 to December 2015) was conducted. The number of patients assessed, sources and reasons for referral, and treatments provided were reviewed. The numbers of ER assessments and reassessments for abortion, hemorrhage, and ectopic pregnancy from January 2004 to December 2005 (pre-EPAC) and January 2006 to December 2015 (post-EPAC) were also reviewed. RESULTS: There were 11 349 new referrals and 10 764 follow-up visits. The reasons for referral were threatened miscarriage (n = 3568, 31.4%), missed miscarriage (n = 3056, 26.9%), incomplete miscarriage (n = 1064, 9.4%), complete miscarriage (n = 991, 8.7%), ectopic pregnancy (n = 857, 7.6%), hyperemesis gravidarum (n = 139, 1.2%), and others (n = 1674, 14.8%). There has been a significant decreasing trend (tau = −0.60, P = 0.0127) and a significant decrease in the post-EPAC rate of ER reassessments (P = 0.0396) for hemorrhage, with a concomitant decrease in EPAC visits for hemorrhage. In addition, there has been a significant increasing trend (tau = 0.64, P = 0.0081) and a significant increase in the post-EPAC rate of ER assessments (P = 0.00001) for ectopic pregnancies. CONCLUSION: Over the 10-year period, the EPAC has remained a vital service for managing early pregnancy complications for women. However, the clinic has not yet had a sustained impact on ER visits for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and hemorrhage. It is possible that a reduction in ER assessments and reassessments for early pregnancy complications can be achieved through a clinic with daily access.","Pinnaduwage, Lakmini; Honeyford, Joanne; Lackie, Elyse; Tunde-Byass, Modupe",J Obstet Gynaecol Can,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1701216317309118; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2017.12.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1701216317309118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30103874/,171
610977,The skin in the era of coronavirus pandemic,2020-07-17,"Many studies have evaluated factors that influence the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries. This multicountry study assessed the influence of democracy and other factors on the case fatality rate of COVID-19 during the early stage of the pandemic. We accessed the World Health Organization, World Bank, and the Democracy Index 2019 databases for data from the 148 countries. Multiple analyses were conducted to examine the association between the Democracy Index and case fatality rate of COVID-19. Within 148 countries, the percentage of the population aged 65 years and above (p = 0.0193), and health expenditure as a percentage of GDP (p = 0.0237) were positively associated with countries’ case fatality rates. By contrast, hospital beds per capita helped to reduce the case fatality rates. In particular, the Democracy Index was positively associated with case fatality rates in a subgroup of 47 high-income countries. This study suggests that enhancing the health system with increased hospital beds and healthcare workforce per capita should reduce case fatality rate.

Its structure was elucidated using a combination of NMR and mass spectrometry. The absolute configuration was established by chemical syntheses of compound 2 as well as a new stereoisomer (3). The comparable bioactivities of artemisinin (1) and its isomer (−)-6-epi-artemisinin (2) revealed that this change in configuration was not critical to their biological properties. Bioactivity was assessed using an apoptosis induction assay, a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor assay, and a haematin polymerization inhibitory activity (HPIA) assay. This is the first report of an artemisinin-related compound from a genus not belonging to Artemisia and it is the first isolation of an artemisinin-related natural product that is the opposite enantiomeric series relative to artemisinin from Artemisia annua.","Randrianarivo, Saholinirina; Rasolohery, Claudine; Rafanomezantsoa, Sitraka; Randriamampionona, Heriniaina; Haramaty, Liti; Rafanomezantsoa, Roger Marie; Andrianasolo, Eric H.",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26185540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577011/,171

Considering the strategy of Korea entailing massive testing and contact tracing from the beginning of epidemic, the number of undiagnosed missing cases in Korea may be negligible. This study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among individuals who were never diagnosed with COVID-19 in Daegu, the epicenter of COVID-19 epidemic in Korea. METHODS: Serologic testing for immunoglobulin G antibody based on immunochromatographic assay was conducted in 103 patients and 95 guardians aged 18 to 82 years without any history of COVID-19 diagnosis, who visited outpatient clinics of a single university-affiliated hospital from May 25 to June 5, 2020. RESULTS: The estimated seroprevalence was 7.6% (95% confidence interval, 4.3%–12.2%) with 15 positive cases. Among them, only one had a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed case among their close contacts and 13 did not experience COVID-19-related symptoms. Seroprevalence was similar between patients and guardians. Based on this figure, the number of undiagnosed missing cases in Daegu was estimated to be a dozen times more than the number of confirmed cases based on PCR testing. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitation of a small and unrepresentative sample, this is the first study on seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Korea. Our study suggested that the number of undiagnosed missing cases was substantial even with the stringent strategy adopted in Korea, similar to that of other countries.","Song, Suk-Kyoon; Lee, Duk-Hee; Nam, Jun-Ho; Kim, Kyung-Tae; Do, Jung-Suk; Kang, Dae-Won; Kim, Sang-Gyung; Cho, Myung-Rae",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32715672/,171

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis in HCT patients with HMPV (n = 23) or respiratory syncytial virus (n = 23) detected in bronchoalveolar lavage samples by reverse transcription PCR between 2006 and 2011 to determine disease characteristics and factors associated with outcome. Mortality rates at 100 days were 43% for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract disease. Steroid therapy, oxygen requirement >2 L or mechanical ventilation, and bone marrow as cell source were significant risk factors for overall and virus-related mortality in multivariable models, whereas the virus type was not. The presence of centrilobular/nodular radiographic infiltrates was a possible protective factor for mechanical ventilation. Thus, HMPV lower respiratory tract disease is associated with high mortality in HCT recipients. Earlier detection in combination with new antiviral therapy is needed to reduce mortality among HCT recipients.","Renaud, Christian; Xie, Hu; Seo, Sachiko; Kuypers, Jane; Cent, Anne; Corey, Lawrence; Leisenring, Wendy; Boeckh, Michael; Englund, Janet A.",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23680472/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879113002000; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.05.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879113002000,171

One difficulty is due to ignoring or overestimating time delay between reporting and death. We claim that all of these cause large errors and artificial time dependence of the CFR. We find that for each country, there is a unique value of the time lag between reported cases and deaths versus time, that yields the optimal correlation between them is a specific sense. We find that the resulting corrected CFR (deaths shifted back by this time lag, divided by cases) is actually constant over many months, for many countries, but also for the entire world. This optimal time lag and constant CFR for each country can be found through a simple data driven algorithm. The traditional CFR (ignoring time lag) is spuriously time-dependent and its evolution is hard to quantify. Our corrected CFR is constant over time, therefore an important index of the pandemic in each country, and can be inferred from data earlier on, facilitating improved early estimates of COVID-19 mortality.","Rosakis, Phoebus; Marketou, Maria E.",J Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320303911?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320303911; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.06.010; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05860v1.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32534001/,171

Nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) has been increasingly recognized in affected patients. We aim to evaluate the correlation of thyroid hormones with markers of inflammation and association with disease outcome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and in two profiles of NTIS (low T3-normal/low FT4 vs. low T3-high FT4). METHODS: consecutive patients admitted to a nonintensive care unit for COVID-19 were recruited. Infection was mild in 22%, moderate in 27.1% and severe in 50.8%; 7.41% died. T4, T3, FT4, FT3, and their ratios (T3/T4, FT3/FT4) were correlated with albumin, ferritin, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. RESULTS: Fifty five patients (50.9% men, median age 56 years) were included. Albumin correlated positively with T3 and hormones ratios, but negatively with FT4. T3, FT3, T3/T4, and FT3/FT4 correlated inversely with ferritin, fibrinogen, ESR, CRP, LDH, and D-dimer. FT4 showed direct correlation with fibrinogen and ESR. T3/T4 was lower in severe compared to mild/moderate disease [7.5 (4.5–15.5) vs. 9.2 (5.8–18.1); p = 0.04], and lower in patients who died than in those discharged [5 (4.53–5.6) vs. 8.1 (4.7–18.1); p = 0.03]. A low T3/high FT4 profile was associated with lower albumin, higher ferritin, and severity. CONCLUSION: In this cohort, thyroid hormones correlated with inflammation and outcome. T3 and T3/T4 correlated inversely with inflammatory markers; a low T3/T4 ratio was associated with severity and poor prognosis. Patients with low T3 but high FT4 had higher ferritin, lower albumin, and more severe disease at presentation.","Ilera, Verónica; Delfino, Laura C.; Zunino, Anabela; Glikman, Patricia; Drnovsek, Mónica; Reyes, Adriana; Dios, Alicia; Toibaro, Javier; Pachioli, Valeria; Lannes, Nayla; Guida, Alberto; Gauna, Alicia",Endocrine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-021-02863-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34515958/,171

To capture the similarities, common characteristics, and evolution behavior for prediction concerning SARS-CoV-2. And how reverse engineering using Artificial intelligence (AI) and big data is efficient and provides wide horizons. The results show that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same highest active amino acids (S, L, and T) with the mentioned viral families. As known, that affects the building function of the proteins. We have also devised a mathematical formula representing how we calculate the evolution difference percentage between each virus concerning its phylogenic tree. It shows that SARS-CoV-2 has fast mutation evolution concerning its time of arising. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to predict the next evolved instance of SARS-CoV-2 by utilizing the phylogenic tree data as a corpus using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM).

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is the diagnostic criterion for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, RNA detection has many limitations, such as being time-consuming and cost-prohibitive, and it must be performed in specialized laboratories. Virus antibody detection is a routine method for screening for multiple viruses, but data about SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection are limited. METHOD: Throat swabs and blood were collected from 67 suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection patients at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University and Zunyi Fourth People’s Hospital isolated observation departments. Throat swab samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by real-time PCR. Blood was used subjected to SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detection by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gold immunochromatography assay (GICA). Blood underwent C-reactive protein detection by immunoturbidimetry, and white blood cells, neutrophil percentages and lymphocyte percentages were counted and calculated, respectively. Clinical symptoms, age and lifestyle habits (smoking and drinking) in all patients were recorded. Data were analysed using SPSS version 19. The results were confirmed by T and χ(2) tests; correlations with detection results were analysed by kappa coefficients. Odds ratio (OR) and corrected OR values were analysed by logistic regression. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients included in this study, 26 were SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive. GICA IgM sensitivity was 50.9% (13/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgM sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgG sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 95.1% (39/41). The kappa coefficients between RNA detection and ELISA IgG, ELISA IgM, and GICA IgM results were 0.741 (P < 0.01), 0.681 (P < 0.01) and 0.430 (P < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: Among the candidate blood indicators, serum IgG and IgM detected by ELISA had the best consistency and validity when compared with standard RNA detection; these indicators can be used as potential preliminary screening tools to identify those who should undergo nucleic acid detection in laboratories without RNA detection abilities or as a supplement to RNA detection.","Xiang, Jialin; Chen, Zuyi; Zhou, Jie; Tian, Di; Ran, Xiusheng; Zhang, Zhimin; Shi, Shi; Xiao, Daimin; Zhou, Yuanzhong",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05489-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33081702/,171

University buildings were unoccupied with little water usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. It's an opportunity to study microbiological quality of long-term stagnant water (LTSW) in university buildings. The tap water samples were collected for three months from four types of campus buildings to monitor water quality and microbial risks after long-term stagnation. Specifically, the residual chlorine, turbidity, and iron/zinc were disqualified, and the heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) exceeded the Chinese national standard above 100 times. It took 4-54 days for these parameters to recover to the routine levels. Six species of pathogens were detected with high frequency and levels (101-105 copies/100 mL). Remarkably, L. pneumophilia occurred in 91% of samples with turbidity > 1 NTU. The absence of the culturable cells for these bacteria possibly implied their occurrence in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) status. The bacterial community of the stagnant tap water differed significantly and reached a steady state in more than 50 days. Furthermore, a high concentration of endotoxin (>10 EU/mL) was found in LTSW, which was in accordance with the high proportion of dead bacteria. The results suggested that the increased microbiological risks require more attention and the countermeasures before the building reopens should be taken.","Ye, Chengsong; Xian, Xuanxuan; Bao, Ruihan; Zhang, Yiting; Feng, Mingbao; Lin, Wenfang; Yu, Xin",The Science of the total environment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34592279/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150616,171

This protocol describes the use of text messaging (as used in the Text4Hope-Addiction Support program) as a convenient, evidence-based, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention with high user satisfaction proven in prior research. OBJECTIVE: The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive text messaging (Text4Hope-Addiction Support) to reduce drug or alcohol cravings as well as anxiety and depression, typically associated with alcohol and substance use disorders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; demographic correlates of the same; and the outcomes of the Text4Hope-Addiction Support intervention in mitigating cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. METHODS: Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess cravings for the primary substance of addiction (Brief Substance Craving Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of receiving text messages), program midpoint (6 weeks), and program end (12 weeks). RESULTS: As of October 2020, data collection is in progress; and it is expected to be completed by fall 2021. Data analysis will include parametric and nonparametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (ie, cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction.

BACKGROUND: Health care providers caring for patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic are at increased risk of decreased professional quality of life and increased moral distress. METHODS: A convergent mixed‐methods design and snowball sampling was used to collect survey data (n = 171) and semi‐structured interviews (n = 23) among health care providers working in the inpatient setting. RESULTS: Perceived lack of support from executive leadership, access to personal protective equipment and constantly changing guidelines led to decreased professional quality of life and increased moral distress among health care providers. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study indicate that shared governance, disaster management training and enhanced communication may assist executive leadership to reduce the likelihood of decreased professional quality of life and increased moral distress in front line health care providers.

However, the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. This study reveals that EV71 infection in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) and neuroblastoma (SK‐N‐SH) cells stimulated the autophagic process, which was demonstrated by an increase of punctate GFP‐microtubule‐associated protein 1 light chain 3 (GFP‐LC3), the level of autophagosome‐bound LC3‐II protein and double‐membrane autophagosome formation. EV71‐induced autophagy benefited EV71 replication, which was confirmed by the autophagic inducer rapamycin and the inhibitor 3‐methyladenine. Signaling pathway investigation revealed that the decreased expression of phosphorylated mTOR and phosphorylated p70S6K is involved in EV71‐induced autophagy in a cell‐specific manner. The expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (Erk) was suppressed consistently in EV71‐infected cells. However it did not participate in the autophagic response of the cell. Other signaling pathway molecules, such as Erk, PI3K/Akt, Bcl‐2, BNIP3, and Beclin‐1 were not affected by infection with EV71. Electron microscopy showed co‐localization of autophagosome‐like vesicles with either EV71‐VP1 or LC3 protein in neurons of the cervical spinal cord in ICR mice infected with EV71. In conclusion, EV71 infection triggered autophagic flux and induced autophagosome formation both in vitro and in vivo. Autophagy induced by EV71 is beneficial for viral replication. Understanding the role of autophagy induced by EV71 in vitro and the formation of autophagosome‐like vesicle in vivo provide new insights into the pathogenesis of EV71 infection. J. Med.

International databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched for studies published from 1990 to 2020 that attempted to promote forgiveness in older adults. Most intervention studies are group treatments targeted towards community-dwelling older adults. Participants in these studies are mainly women. The intervention objectives and contents vary widely and often criteria are not well-defined. Participants that received forgiveness interventions reported significantly higher levels of forgiveness than participants that did not receive treatment. Additionally, forgiveness interventions resulted in more changes in depression, stress and anger than no intervention conditions. Forgiveness treatment also enhances positive states (satisfaction with life, subjective happiness, and psychological wellbeing). The reported effects are moderate. The specific treatment model (e.g., Enright’s, Worthington’s) and format (e.g., group-based interventions and individually delivered programs) do not differentially predict better outcomes.

SARS-CoV-2 is known to use its spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface as a first step in the infection process. As for other coronaviruses, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 next undergoes endocytosis, but whether or not this is required for infectivity, and the precise endocytic mechanism used are unknown. Using purified spike glycoprotein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein, a common model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, we now demonstrate that following engagement with the plasma membrane, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that transfer of viral RNA to the cell cytosol occurs from the lumen of the endosomal system. Importantly, we further demonstrate that knockdown of clathrin-heavy chain, which blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reduces viral infectivity. These discoveries reveal that SARS-CoV-2 uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis to gain access into cells and suggests that this process is a key aspect of virus infectivity.","Bayati, Armin; Kumar, Rahul; Francis, Vincent; McPherson, Peter S.",J Biol Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925821000752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33476648/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925821000752?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100306,171

HAT (histone acetyltransferase) and HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors have been applied to treat neurological deficits in humans; yet, the epigenetic regulation in neurodegeneration remains elusive. Mutations of HAT cofactor TRRAP (ransformation/translation domain-associated protein) cause human neuropathies, including psychosis, intellectual disability, autism, and epilepsy, with unknown mechanism. Here we show that Trrap deletion in Purkinje neurons results in neurodegeneration of old mice. Integrated transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics reveal that TRRAP via SP1 conducts a conserved transcriptomic program. TRRAP is required for SP1 binding at the promoter proximity of target genes, especially microtubule dynamics. The ectopic expression of Stathmin3/4 ameliorates defects of TRRAP-deficient neurons, indicating that the microtubule dynamics is particularly vulnerable to the action of SP1 activity. This study unravels a network linking three well-known, but up-to-date unconnected, signaling pathways, namely TRRAP, HAT, and SP1 with microtubule dynamics, in neuroprotection.","Tapias, Alicia; Lázaro, David; Yin, Bo-Kun; Rasa, Seyed Mohammad Mahdi; Krepelova, Anna; Kelmer Sacramento, Erika; Grigaravicius, Paulius; Koch, Philipp; Kirkpatrick, Joanna; Ori, Alessandro; Neri, Francesco; Wang, Zhao-Qi",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.61531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594975/,171

Therefore, a high-throughput rapid assay to measure the total SARS-CoV-2 NA level is urgently needed for COVID-19 serodiagnosis, convalescent plasma therapy, vaccine development, and assessment. Here, we developed a nanoplasmonic immunosorbent assay (NanoPISA) platform for one-step rapid quantification of SARS-CoV-2 NAs in clinical serum samples for high-throughput evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. The NanoPISA platform enhanced by the use of nanoporous hollow gold nanoparticle coupling was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 NAs with a limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mL within 15 min. The one-step NanoPISA for SARS-CoV-2 NA detection in clinical specimens yielded good results, comparable to those obtained in the gold standard seroneutralization test and the surrogate virus neutralizing ELISA. Collectively, our findings indicate that the one-step NanoPISA may offer a rapid and high-throughput NA quantification platform for evaluating the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.","Huang, L.; Li, Y.; Luo, C.; Touil, N.; Annaz, H. e.; Cheng, Y.; Zeng, S.; Dang, T.; Liang, J.; Hu, W.; Xu, H.; Tu, J.; Shen, Y.; Liu, G.

The transmission through aerosols and direct contact with infected individuals forced the application of strict safety protocols and rearrangements in the activities of different healthcare systems around the world. Ophthalmology healthcare workers are highly exposed to viral infection and therefore adjustments were made to ensure the safety of patients and health providers by performing only urgent treatments. The suspension and delay in regular follow-up visits and the lower number of patients recorded during the lockdown period due to restrictions and patient anxiety led to severe consequences in the clinical and anatomical outcome affecting the overall prognosis. The current review aims to summarize the effect of the lockdown policies in the number and profile of patients that attended the ophthalmology clinics from different countries and analyze the effect of the pandemic in terms of vision and patient functionality. The effects of the pandemic included a reduction in the number of appointments, cancellations of non-emergency conditions and delays of surgical interventions.

We describe here three novel RNA viruses that we identified in oropharyngeal/cloacal swabs collected from wild birds. The complete genome of a novel gull metapneumovirus (GuMPV B29) was determined. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that this virus could represent a novel avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) sub-group, intermediate between AMPV-C and the subgroup of the other AMPVs. This virus was detected in an American herring (1/24, 4.2%) and great black-backed (4/26, 15.4%) gulls. A novel gull coronavirus (GuCoV B29) was detected in great black-backed (3/26, 11.5%) and American herring (2/24, 8.3%) gulls. Phylogenetic analyses of GuCoV B29 suggested that this virus could represent a novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, close to other recently identified potential novel avian coronaviral species. One GuMPV–GuCoV co-infection was detected. A novel duck calicivirus (DuCV-2 B6) was identified in mallards (2/5, 40%) and American black ducks (7/26, 26.9%). This virus, of which we identified two different types, was fully sequenced and was genetically closest to other caliciviruses identified in Anatidae, but more distant to other caliciviruses from birds in the genus Anas. These discoveries increase our knowledge about avian virus diversity and host distributions.","Canuti, Marta; Kroyer, Ashley N.

DESIGN Multicenter, retrospective cohort study. SETTING Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital, and Tongji Hosptial in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS A pooled derivation cohort of 1008 COVID-19 patients from Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital in Wuhan and an external validation cohort of 1031 patients from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality, treating discharged alive from hospital as the competing event. Fine-Gray models, using backward elimination for inclusion of predictor variables and allowing non-linear effects of continuous variables, were used to derive a prognostic model for predicting in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. Internal validation was implemented to check model overfitting using bootstrap approach. External validation to a separate hospital was implemented to evaluate the generalizability of the model. RESULTS The derivation cohort was a case-mix of mild-to-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=1008, 43.6% females, median age 55). The final model (PLANS), including five predictor variables of platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex, had an excellent predictive performance (optimism-adjusted C-index: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.87; averaged calibration slope: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.08). Internal validation showed little overfitting. External validation using an independent cohort (n=1031, 47.8% female, median age 63) demonstrated excellent predictive performance (C-index: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.89; calibration slope: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.12). The averaged predicted survival curves were close to the observed survival curves across patients with different risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS The PLANS model based on the five routinely collected demographic and clinical characteristics (platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex) showed excellent discriminative and calibration accuracy in predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. This prognostic model would assist clinicians in better triaging patients and allocating healthcare resources to reduce COVID-19 fatality.","Li, Jiong; Chen, Yuntao; Chen, Shujing; Wang, Sihua; Zhang, Dingyu; Wang, Junfeng; Postmus, Douwe; Zeng, Hesong; Qin, Guoyou; Shen, Yin; Jiang, Jinjun; Yu, Yongfu",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.20100370; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.13.20100370v1?rss=1,171

We overcame these drawbacks by adopting a fluidic-chip container in a new system, which resulted in higher sensitivity and more stable measurements. Using the new system, we conducted a pilot study on nominally healthy volunteers to find whether or not the monitored activities of leukocytes can distinguish more or less unhealthy conditions from healthy ones. At first, healthy volunteers of both genders and of various ages showed that the fluctuation magnitudes (%) of O(2)(−·) and OCl(−) were nearly similar to each other and to that of the neutrophil count fluctuation. These parameters sometimes exceeded the healthy fluctuation range. By comparing these large fluctuations with the data of an inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP), the neutrophil count fluctuation and the timings/symptoms of abnormalities found in questionnaire, we could gain information suggesting the factors causing the large fluctuations. The new system could detect bodily abnormalities earlier than CRP or self-aware symptoms.","Kazumura, Kimiko; Takeuchi, Kozo; Hatano, Yukiko; Hara, Akiko; Miwa, Toshiyuki; Hattori, Masaki; Kondo, Fusanori; Morishita, Naokazu; Tsuchiya, Hiroshi; Osawa, Toshihiko",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267248/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93887-1,171

Variety of strategies are taken into account from ground level to the state to reduce the transmission rate. For this purpose, the epidemiologists are also augmenting their contribution in structuring such models that could depict a scheme to diminish the basic reproduction number. These tactics also include the awareness campaigns initiated by the stakeholders through digital, print media and etc. Analyzing the cost and profit effectiveness of these tactics, we design an optimal control dynamical model to study the proficiency of each strategy in reducing the virulence of COVID'19. The aim is to illustrate the memory effect on the dynamics of COVID'19 with and without prevention measures through fractional calculus. Therefore, the structure of the model is in line with generalized proportional fractional derivative to assess the effects at each chronological change. Awareness about using medical mask, social distancing, frequent use of sanitizer or cleaning hand and supportive care during treatment are the strategies followed worldwide in this fight. Taking these into consideration, the optimal objective function proposed for the surveillance mitigation of COVID'19, is contemplated as the cost function. The effect analysis is supported through graphs and tabulated values. In addition, sensitivity inspection of basic reproduction number is also carried out with respect to different values of fractional index and cost function. Ultimately, social distancing and supportive care of infected are found to be significant in decreasing the basic reproduction number more rapidly.","Razzaq, Oyoon Abdul; Rehman, Daniyal Ur; Khan, Najeeb Alam; Ahmadian, Ali; Ferrara, Massimiliano",Results Phys,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2020.103715; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379720321318; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211379720321318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398241/,171

However, pairing with an appropriate adjuvant is imperative in order to elicit effective humoral and cellular immune responses. In this study, we aimed to determine an optimal adjuvant pairing with the prefusion form of influenza haemagglutinin (HA) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion (F) subunit vaccines in BALB/c mice in order to inform future subunit vaccine adjuvant selection. We tested a panel of adjuvants, including aluminum hydroxide (alhydrogel), QS21, Addavax, Addavax with QS21 (AdQS21), and Army Liposome Formulation 55 with monophosphoryl lipid A and QS21 (ALF55). We found that all adjuvants elicited robust humoral responses in comparison to placebo, with the induction of potent neutralizing antibodies observed in all adjuvanted groups against influenza and in AdQS21, alhydrogel, and ALF55 against RSV. Upon HA vaccination, we observed that none of the adjuvants were able to significantly increase the frequency of CD4(+) and CD8(+) IFN-γ(+) cells when compared to unadjuvanted antigen. The varying responses to antigens with each adjuvant highlights that those adjuvants most suited for pairing purposes can vary depending on the antigen used and/or the desired immune response. We therefore suggest that an adjuvant trial for different subunit vaccines in development would likely be necessary in preclinical studies.","Isaacs, Ariel; Li, Zheyi; Cheung, Stacey T.

Though short-term immune-related adverse events are routinely described, longer-term immune consequences and sequential immune monitoring are not as well defined. In 2006, six healthy volunteers received TGN1412, a CD28 superagonist antibody, in a first-in-man clinical trial and suffered from cytokine storm. After the initial cytokine release, antibody effect-specific immune monitoring started on Day + 10 and consisted mainly of evaluation of dendritic cell and T-cell subsets and 15 serum cytokines at 21 time-points over 2 years. All patients developed problems with concentration and memory; three patients were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate depression. Mild neutropenia and autoantibody production was observed intermittently. One patient suffered from peripheral dry gangrene, required amputations, and had persistent Raynaud’s phenomenon. Gastrointestinal irritability was noted in three patients and coincided with elevated γδT-cells. One had pruritus associated with elevated IgE levels, also found in three other asymptomatic patients. Dendritic cells, initially undetectable, rose to normal within a month. Naïve CD8(+) T-cells were maintained at high levels, whereas naïve CD4(+) and memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells started high but declined over 2 years. T-regulatory cells cycled circannually and were normal in number. Cytokine dysregulation was especially noted in one patient with systemic symptoms. Over a 2-year follow-up, cognitive deficits were observed in all patients following TGN1412 infusion. Some also had signs or symptoms of psychological, mucosal or immune dysregulation. These observations may discern immunopathology, treatment targets, and long-term monitoring strategies for other patients undergoing immunotherapy or with cytokine storm.

FRET probes have an improved toleration for single base mismatches than other probe chemistries, reducing the chances of missing highly variable RNA viruses. The assay could detect 2.5–25 DNA/RNA copies/μl (2.5 × 10(3)–2.5 × 10(4) copies/ml). Validation on 91 known positive respiratory specimens indicated similar specificity as commercial direct immunofluorescence assays (IFA) or single-round PCRs used in initial identification.

METHODS: This is a descriptive study based on data from the Hospital Information System about government expenditure on hospitalizations for clinical treatment of users diagnosed with COVID-19 and causes included in the ICD-10 chapters. We obtained the number of hospitalizations, average length of stay, lethality rate, and total expenditure considering hospital services, professional services and average expenditure per hospitalization. RESULTS: In the period evaluated, SUS registered 462,149 hospitalizations, 4.9% of them for COVID-19 treatment. Total expenditure exceeded R$ 2.2 billion, with 85% allocated to hospital services and 15% to professional services. Expenditure for treating COVID-19 was distributed differently between the country’s regions. The Southeast region had the highest number of hospitalizations, highest total amount spent, highest average length of stay in days, and highest lethality rate; the South region, in turn, recorded the highest percentage of spending on non-profit hospitals (58%) and corporate hospitals (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations for clinical treatment of coronavirus infection were more costly compared to those for treatment of acute respiratory failure and pneumonia or influenza. Our results show the disparities in hospitalization expenditure for similar procedures between the regions of Brazil, underlining the vulnerability and the need for strategies to reduce the differences in access, use, and distribution of SUS resources, ensuring equanimity, and considering the unfair inequalities between the country’s regions.","dos Santos, Hebert Luan Pereira Campos; Maciel, Fernanda Beatriz Melo; Santos, Geovani Moreno; Martins, Poliana Cardoso; Prado, Nília Maria de Brito Lima",Rev. saúde pública (Online),https://doi.org/10.11606/s1518-8787.2021055003666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406320/,171

It is advisable to sample a broad range of vertebrates and invertebrates at different temporospatial levels on a regular basis to detect possible candidate viruses at their natural source. However, virus surveillance systems can be expensive, costly in terms of finances and resources and inadequate for sampling sufficient numbers of different host species over space and time. Recent publications have presented the concept of a new virus surveillance system, coining the terms “flying biological syringes”, “xenosurveillance” and “vector-enabled metagenomics”. According to these novel and promising surveillance approaches, viral metagenomics on engorged mosquitoes might reflect the viral diversity of numerous mammals, birds and humans, combined in the mosquitoes’ blood meal during feeding on the host. In this review article, we summarize the literature on vector-enabled metagenomics (VEM) techniques and its application in disease surveillance in humans. Furthermore, we highlight the combination of VEM and “invertebrate-derived DNA” (iDNA) analysis to identify the host DNA within the mosquito midgut.","Brinkmann, Annika; Nitsche, Andreas; Kohl, Claudia",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27775568/,171
670523,Treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the COVID-19 era: A 100 days experience from the Lombardy region,2020-10-22,"Since entering the world stage in December of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has impacted every corner of the globe with over 1.48 million deaths and caused untold economic damage. Infections in humans range from asymptomatic to severe disease associated with dysregulation of the immune system leading to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs). The distinct shift in peripheral monocyte activation and infiltration of these cells into the respiratory tract in ARDs patients suggests severe COVID-19 may largely result from damage to the respiratory epithelia by improperly activated macrophages. Here, we present evidence that dysregulation of the immune response in COVID-19 begins with activation of macrophages by non-neutralizing antibodies and induction of ACE2 expression, rendering these cells susceptible to killing by SARS-CoV-2. Death of macrophages occurs independently of viral replication and leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and modulation of the susceptibility of downstream epithelial cells to SARS-CoV-2.","DeMarco, Jennifer K.; Severson, Wiliam E.; DeMarco, Daniel R.; Pogue, Gregory; Gabbard, Jon; Palmer, Kenneth E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.22.432407,171

This study aimed to investigate the resilience of the Swedish national immunisation programme for children up to the age of five years during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional, web‐based survey of regional child health offices in Sweden between 10 September and 9 October 2020. It explored the organisation of child health services during the early stages of the pandemic, focusing on routine child immunisation. RESULTS: All 21 Swedish regional child health offices responded. They stated that child immunisation had been prioritised, communication with families had been intensified and there was greater flexibility at all organisational levels of child health services. In addition, the vaccine supply was sustained and child health centres remained open. However, there were periodic staff shortages, increased numbers of health visits cancelled by parents and most parent education groups were paused. CONCLUSION: The Swedish immunisation programme was resilient during the early COVID‐19 pandemic, thanks to sustainable organisation co‐ordinated by Sweden's network of regional child health offices.","Falkenstein Hagander, Kathy; Aronsson, Bernice; Danielsson, Madelene; Lepp, Tiia; Kulane, Asli; Schollin Ask, Lina",Acta Paediatr,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15912; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973264/,171

This dataset consists of the design and manufacturability data for twenty-six such engineering design solutions spanning three categories: (1) face masks (N = 12), (2) face shields (N = 6), and (3) hands-free door openers (N = 8). The designs were collected from open-source websites such as Thingiverse, GrabCAD, and the NIH 3D Print Exchange. The manufacturability of these designs was simulated using Ultimaker Cura software and three measures were obtained: (1) build time, (2) build cost, and (3) build material. Furthermore, these simulations were performed for multiple materials and infill densities for comparison. Additionally, the manufacturing cost using injection molding was simulated using the Cost Estimation Tool in Solidworks. This dataset comprises (1) the STL files for the designs, (2) the simulated manufacturability data (for additive manufacturing and injection molding), and (3) images that depict the build orientation used in these manufacturability simulations. This dataset can facilitate the development of future innovations that leverage the capabilities of AM processes. Furthermore, this dataset can be used by designers and manufacturers to compare solutions and choose appropriate ones for manufacturing.","Prabhu, Rohan; Masia, Jordan S.; Berthel, Joseph T.; Meisel, Nicholas A.; Simpson, Timothy W.",Data Brief,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.107012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898670/,171

The reproductive number (R) is a metric to estimate the transmission of a pathogen during an outbreak. Preliminary published estimates were based on the initial outbreak in China. Whole genome sequences (WGS) analysis found mutational variations in the viral genome; however, previous comparisons failed to show a direct relationship between viral genome diversity, transmission, and the epidemic severity. COVID-19 incidences from different countries were modeled over the epidemic curve. Estimates of the instantaneous R (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval were done. WGS were used to determine the populations genomic variation and that underpinned creation of the pathogen genome identity (GENI) score, which was merged with the outbreak curve in four distinct phases. Inference of transmission time was based on a mutation rate of 2 mutations/month. R estimates revealed differences in the transmission and variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak progression for each country examined. Outside China, our R estimates observed propagating dynamics indicating that other countries were poised to move to the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had no clear relationship to the outbreak progression. Integration of incidence data with the GENI score directly predicted increases in cases as the genome variation increased that led to new variants. Integrating the outbreak curve, dynamic R, and SNP variation found a direct association between increasing cases and transmission genome evolution. By defining the epidemic curve into four stages and integrating the instantaneous country-specific R with the GENI score, we directly connected changes in individual outbreaks based on changes in the virus genome via SNPs. This resulted in the ability to forecast potential increases in cases as well as mutations that may defeat PCR screening and the infection process. By using instantaneous R estimations and WGS, outbreak dynamics were defined to be linked to viral mutations, indicating that WGS, as a surveillance tool, is required to predict shifts in each outbreak that will provide actionable decision making information. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing and modeling allows for evidence-based disease outbreak tracking with predictive therapeutically valuable insights in near real time.","Bandoy, D J Darwin R.; Weimer, Bart C.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33795722/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86265-4,171

With data analysis from Q-methodology and complementary interviews, the findings of this study showed a shared configuration among the business English teachers in three factors: strong belief in performance assessment for business English courses; belief in supportive role of ICT; and belief in assessment as an ongoing process. The three factors were further interpreted from systematic approach of assessment and the role of ICT in online teaching. This study will be of significance to help teachers improve the quality of online assessment and raise their awareness of effective use ICT in online teaching.","Wu, Peng; Wang, Yanyan",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40299-021-00604-7,171

It started as an epidemic in Wuhan, China, and then become a global pandemic. COVID-19 usually presents with respiratory symptoms, including cough and shortness of breath, accompanied by fever. However, gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, have also been reported as a less common presentation of COVID-19. Boerhaave syndrome is a transmural perforation of the esophagus that typically occurs after forceful emesis, which should be differentiated from Mallory-Weiss syndrome, a nontransmural esophageal tear. Diagnosis of Boerhaave syndrome can be difficult because of the classic symptoms, resulting in a delay in seeking medical care. Boerhaave syndrome is sporadic, with an incidence of 3.1 per 1,000,000 per year. We present an interesting case of a 53-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of significant right-sided chest pain and diffused abdominal pain after several episodes of coughing and vomiting associated with shortness of breath and fever for two weeks. The patient was found to have COVID- 19 infection. The patient then had a chest CT without contrast, and an esophagogram was performed, which was consistent with esophageal rupture. The patient had a thoracotomy and surgical repair. This was followed by endoscopy and esophageal stent placement. The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis that has drained medical resources and research capacity. Esophageal rupture is commonly due to iatrogenic causes. Transmural perforation following forceful vomiting has been termed Boerhaave syndrome. Often, it has no specific presentation, which can lead to late diagnosis, delayed treatment, and increased mortality. In this case, the early diagnosis and proper implementation of the general principles of treatment, including sepsis control, drainage, and surgical repair, led to a good outcome for the patient.","Rahman, Ali; Alqaisi, Sura; Downing, Chad",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567889/,171

685146,Experimental therapies under investigation for COVID-19,2021-03-23,"Intrinsic disorder (i.e., lack of a unique 3-D structure) is a common phenomenon, and many biologically active proteins are disordered as a whole, or contain long disordered regions. These intrinsically disordered proteins/regions constitute a significant part of all proteomes, and their functional repertoire is complementary to functions of ordered proteins. In fact, intrinsic disorder represents an important driving force for many specific functions. An illustrative example of such disorder-centric functional class is RNA-binding proteins. In this study, we present the results of comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of the abundance and roles of intrinsic disorder in 3,411 ribosomal proteins from 32 species. We show that many ribosomal proteins are intrinsically disordered or hybrid proteins that contain ordered and disordered domains. Predicted globular domains of many ribosomal proteins contain noticeable regions of intrinsic disorder. We also show that disorder in ribosomal proteins has different characteristics compared to other proteins that interact with RNA and DNA including overall abundance, evolutionary conservation, and involvement in protein–protein interactions. Furthermore, intrinsic disorder is not only abundant in the ribosomal proteins, but we demonstrate that it is absolutely necessary for their various functions.

The country saw the peak of infection between March and May of 2020. The result was a change in the practice of how we treat most surgical conditions including cancer. We continued providing service to our colorectal cancer patients at a District General Hospital. The aim of this study was to compare our provision of colorectal cancer service during the peak of the pandemic to that of the pre-COVID time in our hospital. Methods We collected data of all colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgery between 1 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 in our hospital. The comparative data were collected for similar patients during the same time frame in 2019. A detailed data set was compiled on Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, Washington) and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0 (Released 2012. IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Results The two groups were comparable in demographics including age, BMI, gender, and Charlson comorbidity index. Time from decision- to-treat to surgery, post-operative HDU/ITU stay, and overall length of stay was shorter in the COVID group than the Pre-COVID group without any significant statistical difference. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in Calvien-Dindo complications grade 1 and 2. No mortality was reported due to direct or indirect consequences of COVID-19 infection. More open procedures were performed in our department during the first wave of COVID-19 in the UK compared to Pre-COVID time.
