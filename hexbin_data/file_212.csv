577,577,577,In-Depth Analysis of the Antibody Response of Individuals Exposed to Primary Dengue Virus Infection,8.523656,8.233164,2011-06-21,"Humans who experience a primary dengue virus (DENV) infection develop antibodies that preferentially neutralize the homologous serotype responsible for infection. Affected individuals also generate cross-reactive antibodies against heterologous DENV serotypes, which are non-neutralizing. Dengue cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies can enhance infection of Fc receptor bearing cells and, potentially, exacerbate disease. The actual binding sites of human antibody on the DENV particle are not well defined. We characterized the specificity and neutralization potency of polyclonal serum antibodies and memory B-cell derived monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) from 2 individuals exposed to primary DENV infections. Most DENV-specific hMAbs were serotype cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing. Moreover, many hMAbs bound to the viral pre-membrane protein and other sites on the virus that were not preserved when the viral envelope protein was produced as a soluble, recombinant antigen (rE protein). Nonetheless, by modifying the screening procedure to detect rare antibodies that bound to rE, we were able to isolate and map human antibodies that strongly neutralized the homologous serotype of DENV. Our MAbs results indicate that, in these two individuals exposed to primary DENV infections, a small fraction of the total antibody response was responsible for virus neutralization.","de Alwis, Ruklanthi; Beltramello, Martina; Messer, William B.; Sukupolvi-Petty, Soila; Wahala, Wahala M.

1172,1172,1172,Correlation between Dengue-Specific Neutralizing Antibodies and Serum Avidity in Primary and Secondary Dengue Virus 3 Natural Infections in Humans,8.836507,8.223829,2013-06-13,"Although heterotypic secondary infection with dengue virus (DENV) is associated with severe disease, the majority of secondary infections are mild or asymptomatic. The mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection are poorly understood. In 2010, 108 DENV3-positive cases were enrolled in a pediatric hospital-based study in Managua, Nicaragua, with 61 primary and 47 secondary infections. We analyzed DENV-specific neutralization titers (NT(50)), IgM and IgG avidity, and antibody titer in serum samples collected during acute and convalescent phases and 3, 6, and 18 months post-infection. NT(50) titers peaked at convalescence and decreased thereafter. IgG avidity to DENV3 significantly increased between convalescent and 3-month time-points in primary DENV infections and between the acute and convalescent phase in secondary DENV infections. While avidity to DENV2, a likely previous infecting serotype, was initially higher than avidity to DENV3 in secondary DENV infections, the opposite relation was observed 3–18 months post-infection. We found significant correlations between IgM avidity and NT(50) in acute primary cases and between IgG avidity and NT(50) in secondary DENV infections. In summary, our findings indicate that IgM antibodies likely play a role in early control of DENV infections. IgG serum avidity to DENV, analyzed for the first time in longitudinal samples, switches from targeting mainly cross-reactive serotype(s) to the current infecting serotype over time. Finally, serum avidity correlates with neutralization capacity.","Puschnik, Andreas; Lau, Louis; Cromwell, Elizabeth A.; Balmaseda, Angel; Zompi, Simona; Harris, Eva",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,212,28
1289,1289,1289,Identification of Novel Compounds Inhibiting Chikungunya Virus-Induced Cell Death by High Throughput Screening of a Kinase Inhibitor Library,8.735015,8.25431,2013-10-31,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne arthrogenic alphavirus that causes acute febrile illness in humans accompanied by joint pains and in many cases, persistent arthralgia lasting weeks to years. The re-emergence of CHIKV has resulted in numerous outbreaks in the eastern hemisphere, and threatens to expand in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, no effective treatment is currently available. The present study reports the use of resazurin in a cell-based high-throughput assay, and an image-based high-content assay to identify and characterize inhibitors of CHIKV-infection in vitro. CHIKV is a highly cytopathic virus that rapidly kills infected cells. Thus, cell viability of HuH-7 cells infected with CHIKV in the presence of compounds was determined by measuring metabolic reduction of resazurin to identify inhibitors of CHIKV-associated cell death. A kinase inhibitor library of 4,000 compounds was screened against CHIKV infection of HuH-7 cells using the resazurin reduction assay, and the cell toxicity was also measured in non-infected cells. Seventy-two compounds showing ≥50% inhibition property against CHIKV at 10 µM were selected as primary hits. Four compounds having a benzofuran core scaffold (CND0335, CND0364, CND0366 and CND0415), one pyrrolopyridine (CND0545) and one thiazol-carboxamide (CND3514) inhibited CHIKV-associated cell death in a dose-dependent manner, with EC(50) values between 2.2 µM and 7.1 µM. Based on image analysis, these 6 hit compounds did not inhibit CHIKV replication in the host cell. However, CHIKV-infected cells manifested less prominent apoptotic blebs typical of CHIKV cytopathic effect compared with the control infection. Moreover, treatment with these compounds reduced viral titers in the medium of CHIKV-infected cells by up to 100-fold. In conclusion, this cell-based high-throughput screening assay using resazurin, combined with the image-based high content assay approach identified compounds against CHIKV having a novel antiviral activity - inhibition of virus-induced CPE - likely by targeting kinases involved in apoptosis.","Cruz, Deu John M.; Bonotto, Rafaela M.; Gomes, Rafael G.

1297,1297,1297,Ultra-Deep Sequencing of Intra-host Rabies Virus Populations during Cross-species Transmission,8.575607,8.304182,2013-11-21,"One of the hurdles to understanding the role of viral quasispecies in RNA virus cross-species transmission (CST) events is the need to analyze a densely sampled outbreak using deep sequencing in order to measure the amount of mutation occurring on a small time scale. In 2009, the California Department of Public Health reported a dramatic increase (350) in the number of gray foxes infected with a rabies virus variant for which striped skunks serve as a reservoir host in Humboldt County. To better understand the evolution of rabies, deep-sequencing was applied to 40 unpassaged rabies virus samples from the Humboldt outbreak. For each sample, approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb genome was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina platform. Average coverage was 17,448 and this allowed characterization of the rabies virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths. Phylogenetic analysis of the consensus sequence data demonstrated that samples clustered according to date (1995 vs. 2009) and geographic location (northern vs. southern). A single amino acid change in the G protein distinguished a subset of northern foxes from a haplotype present in both foxes and skunks, suggesting this mutation may have played a role in the observed increased transmission among foxes in this region. Deep-sequencing data indicated that many genetic changes associated with the CST event occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 20032010 were present at the sub-consensus level (as rare variants in the viral population) in skunk and fox samples from 1995. These results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may yield clues to ancestral genomes and identify rare variants that have the potential to be selected for if environment conditions change.","Borucki, Monica K.; Chen-Harris, Haiyin; Lao, Victoria; Vanier, Gilda; Wadford, Debra A.; Messenger, Sharon; Allen, Jonathan E.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,212,28
1544,1544,1544,A Novel MVA Vectored Chikungunya Virus Vaccine Elicits Protective Immunity in Mice,8.730844,8.053744,2014-07-24,"BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arbovirus associated with febrile illness often accompanied by rash and arthralgia that may persist for several years. Outbreaks are associated with high morbidity and create a public health challenge for countries affected. Recent outbreaks have occurred in both Europe and the Americas, suggesting CHIKV may continue to spread. Despite the sustained threat of the virus, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy against CHIKV. Therefore, it is critical to develop a vaccine that is both well tolerated and highly protective. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we describe the construction and characterization of a modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus expressing CHIKV E3 and E2 proteins (MVA-CHIK) that protected several mouse models from challenge with CHIKV. In particular, BALB/c mice were completely protected against viremia upon challenge with CHIKV after two doses of MVA-CHIK. Additionally, A129 mice (deficient in IFNα/β) were protected from viremia, footpad swelling, and mortality. While high anti-virus antibodies were elicited, low or undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies were produced in both mouse models. However, passive transfer of MVA-CHIK immune serum to naïve mice did not protect against mortality, suggesting that antibodies may not be the main effectors of protection afforded by MVA-CHIK. Furthermore, depletion of CD4(+), but not CD8(+) T-cells from vaccinated mice resulted in 100% mortality, implicating the indispensable role of CD4(+) T-cells in the protection afforded by MVA-CHIK. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results presented herein demonstrate the potential of MVA to effectively express CHIKV E3-E2 proteins and generate protective immune responses. Our findings challenge the assumption that only neutralizing antibodies are effective in providing protection against CHIKV, and provides a framework for the development of novel, more effective vaccine strategies to combat CHIKV.","Weger-Lucarelli, James; Chu, Haiyan; Aliota, Matthew T.; Partidos, Charalambos D.; Osorio, Jorge E.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,212,28
2905,2905,2905,Chemical Synthesis of the Highly Hydrophobic Antiviral Membrane‐Associated Protein IFITM3 and Modified Variants,8.589191,7.7919154,2017-09-07,"Interferon‐induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is an antiviral transmembrane protein that is thought to serve as the primary factor for inhibiting the replication of a large number of viruses, including West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus. Production of this 14.5 kDa, 133‐residue transmembrane protein, especially with essential posttranslational modifications, by recombinant expression is challenging. In this report, we document the chemical synthesis of IFTIM3 in multi‐milligram quantities (>15 mg) and the preparation of phosphorylated and fluorescent variants. The synthesis was accomplished by using KAHA ligations, which operate under acidic aqueous/organic mixtures that excel at solubilizing even the exceptionally hydrophobic C‐terminal region of IFITM3. The synthetic material is readily incorporated into model vesicles and forms the basis for using synthetic, homogenous IFITM3 and its derivatives for further studying its structure and biological mode of action.","Harmand, Thibault J.; Pattabiraman, Vijaya R.; Bode, Jeffrey W.",Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,212,1
3116,3116,3116,Development and evaluation of a novel high-throughput image-based fluorescent neutralization test for detection of Zika virus infection,8.888569,7.996546,2018-03-15,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus belonging to the genus flavivirus that comprises other important public health viruses, such as dengue (DENV) and yellow fever (YFV). In general, ZIKV infection is a self-limiting disease, however cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital brain abnormalities in newborn infants have been reported. Diagnosing ZIKV infection remains a challenge, as viral RNA detection is only applicable until a few days after the onset of symptoms. After that, serological tests must be applied, and, as expected, high cross-reactivity between ZIKV and other flavivirus serology is observed. Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is indicated to confirm positive samples for being more specific, however it is laborious intensive and time consuming, representing a major bottleneck for patient diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we developed a high-throughput image-based fluorescent neutralization test for ZIKV infection by serological detection. Using 226 human specimens, we showed that the new test presented higher throughput than traditional PRNT, maintaining the correlation between results. Furthermore, when tested with dengue virus samples, it showed 50.53% less cross reactivity than MAC-ELISA. This fluorescent neutralization test could be used for clinical diagnosis confirmation of ZIKV infection, as well as for vaccine clinical trials and seroprevalence studies.","Koishi, Andrea Cristine; Suzukawa, Andréia Akemi; Zanluca, Camila; Camacho, Daria Elena; Comach, Guillermo; Duarte dos Santos, Claudia Nunes",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,212,28
4109,4109,4109,A systematic review and evaluation of Zika virus forecasting and prediction research during a public health emergency of international concern,8.600935,8.024806,2019-10-04,"INTRODUCTION: Epidemic forecasting and prediction tools have the potential to provide actionable information in the midst of emerging epidemics. While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016–2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible, and actionable the information produced by these studies was. METHODS: To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomena related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility, and clarity by independent reviewers. RESULTS: 2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met the eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R(0) (basic reproductive number), and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barré Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%), and intervention impact (4%). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%), and demographic data (37%) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions, and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail to allow complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median of 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016–2017 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates there is substantial room for improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response it is essential to improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.","Kobres, Pei-Ying; Chretien, Jean-Paul; Johansson, Michael A.; Morgan, Jeffrey J.; Whung, Pai-Yei; Mukundan, Harshini; Del Valle, Sara Y.; Forshey, Brett M.; Quandelacy, Talia M.; Biggerstaff, Matthew; Viboud, Cecile; Pollett, Simon",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,212,30
4415,4415,4415,Reassessing therapeutic antibodies for neglected and tropical diseases,8.439332,8.205947,2020-01-30,"In the past two decades there has been a significant expansion in the number of new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are approved by regulators. The discovery of these new medicines has been driven primarily by new approaches in inflammatory diseases and oncology, especially in immuno-oncology. Other recent successes have included new antibodies for use in viral diseases, including HIV. The perception of very high costs associated with mAbs has led to the assumption that they play no role in prophylaxis for diseases of poverty. However, improvements in antibody-expression yields and manufacturing processes indicate this is a cost-effective option for providing protection from many types of infection that should be revisited. Recent technology developments also indicate that several months of protection could be achieved with a single dose. Moreover, new methods in B cell sorting now enable the systematic identification of high-quality antibodies from humanized mice, or patients.

The destruction by antibody of the infected cells through the mediation of complement is described in detail based in considerable part on the contributions of the authors. Activation of the alternative pathway by the various infected cells is of special interest. The interesting effect of the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) system involving viral antigens in cell killing is also presented. Multiple additional topics are also covered, such as the effect of antibody on the expression of viral proteins both on the surface of the cell and intracellularly. Serum antibody, produced in response to virus infections, is of major importance in preventing the spread of infection by virtue of neutralizing free virus in extracellular fluids. Virus neutralization by antibody is enhanced by complement. Antibody binding to the surface of virus-infected cells can affect virus production and release in the absence of an effector system. Immunoglobulin (IgG) antibody can mediate the destruction of virus-infected cells in conjunction with complement or cytotoxic lymphocytes. In addition, at a conceptual level there is evidence to suggest that antibody may enhance and confer specificity on basic nonspecific humoral and cell-mediated defense mechanisms.","Sissons, J.G.

This study aimed to clarify how characteristics of hikikomori are associated with ASD, including undiagnosed autism spectrum conditions (ASC), in clinical settings. METHODS: A total of 416 clinical patients were recruited through the Mood Disorder/Hikikomori Clinic at Kyushu University Hospital. A total of 103 hikikomori cases and 221 clinical controls without hikikomori conditions were extracted using a semi‐structured interview, and completed a series of self‐rated scales, including the Japanese version of the Autism‐Spectrum Quotient (AQ‐J). RESULTS: Compared to non‐hikikomori controls, hikikomori cases were more likely to have higher autistic tendency based on the AQ‐J. The cases showed more severe subjective depressive symptoms based on the self‐rated Beck Depression Inventory II, whereas no significant difference was found on interview‐based severity evaluation using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Comparison within hikikomori cases based on the AQ‐J cut‐off score revealed that hikikomori cases with high ASC were significantly more likely to have higher traits of modern‐type depression, smaller social networks, and less social support. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that hikikomori sufferers are more likely to have autistic tendency, and that hikikomori sufferers with high ASC may have much more difficulty in social communication and social interaction. In addition, those with high ASC may also have lower self‐esteem and higher complaint tendencies as aspects of modern‐type depression traits, which may relate to the occurrence of hikikomori. Thus, evaluating autistic tendencies is important for appropriate interventions in hikikomori. Further investigations should be conducted to validate our pilot findings using structured diagnostic systems of ASD.","Katsuki, Ryoko; Tateno, Masaru; Kubo, Hiroaki; Kurahara, Keita; Hayakawa, Kohei; Kuwano, Nobuki; Kanba, Shigenobu; Kato, Takahiro A.",Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,212,28

Current treatments have limited effectiveness and much remains unknown about pathogenesis. Children with MAM exhibit perturbed development of their gut microbiota. METHODS: Slum-dwelling Bangladeshi children, aged 12 to 18 months, with moderate acute malnutrition (n=124) received a microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF-2) or an existing ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF), twice daily for three months followed by a 1-month period of monitoring. We obtained weight-for-length, weight-for-age, and length-for-age Z-scores and mid-upper arm circumference at baseline and fortnightly, through four months. We compared the rate of change of these related phenotypes between baseline and three months, and between baseline and four months. We also measured levels of 4,977 proteins in plasma plus 209 bacterial taxa in fecal samples. RESULTS: 118 children completed the intervention (n=59/arm). The rate of change in weight-for-length Z-score (β-WLZ), weight-for-age Z-score, and mid upper arm circumference is consistent with a benefit of MDCF-2 on growth over the course of the study including the one-month follow-up. Receipt of MDCF-2 was linked to the magnitude of change in levels of 70 β-WLZ-positively correlated plasma proteins including mediators of bone growth, neurodevelopment and inflammation (gene set enrichment analysis [GSEA];p<0.001) and the abundances of 23 WLZ-associated bacterial taxa (GSEA;p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support for further clinical investigation of MDCF-2 as a dietary supplement for young children with MAM and provide insight into mechanisms by which this targeted manipulation of microbiota components may be linked to growth.

Here, we report a case of MRONJ in a patient treated with tocilizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody that effectively treats moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults. Case description: A 45-year-old female patient diagnosed with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who had been undergoing intravenous tocilizumab therapy for three years without history of bisphosphonate use, was referred to our department. Four weeks previously, several teeth in the maxilla and mandible were removed under local anesthesia by her dentist. Two weeks after the extractions, she felt pain in both jaws. We diagnosed wound dehiscence and delayed healing of the alveolar bone after the tooth extractions. Digital volume tomography showed persistent dry alveolar sockets. The patient underwent surgical debridement of necrotic bone, and intravenous antibiotics were administered in hospital. Five months later, wound dehiscence reoccurred in the same regions. Histopathological analysis of bone biopsies revealed a diagnosis of MRONJ. Four months later, wound dehiscence occurred in the left maxillary alveolar ridge, and local bone resection was performed under antibiotic treatment. Twenty-four months after the last surgery, wound dehiscence had healed completely without signs of recurrence. Discussion: Osteomyelitis of the jaw in patients treated with tocilizumab has not been reported often. This case confirms the potential role of this interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor in the pathogenesis of MRONJ and shows that patients who receive tocilizumab with MRONJ-like symptoms should be closely monitored. The pathomechanism of MRONJ under tocilizumab therapy remains unclear, so dental practitioners, maxillofacial surgeons, and rheumatologists should look for signs of MRONJ in patients receiving tocilizumab to prevent MRONJ onset.","Sakkas, Andreas; Heil, Sebastian; Kargus, Steffen; Rebel, Martin; Mischkowski, Robert A.; Thiele, Oliver C.",GMS Interdiscip Plast Reconstr Surg DGPW,212,28

However, the frequently emerged senescence and decrease of differentiation capabilities limited the broad applications of MSC. Several strategies such as small molecules treatment have been widely studied and used to improve the stem characteristics bypassing the senescence but the exact mechanisms for them to reduce senescence have not been fully studied. In this study, hMSCs were treated by rapamycin, oltipraz, metformin, and vitamin C for the indicated time and these cells were subjected to senescence evaluation and trilineage differentiation. Furthermore, transcriptomics and lipidomics datasets of hMSCs after drug treatment were analyzed to interpret biological pathways responsible for their anti-senescence effects. Although four drugs exhibited significant activities in promoting MSC osteogenic differentiation, metformin is the optimal drug to promote trilineage differentiation. GO terms illustrated that the anti-aging effects of drugs were mainly associated with cellular senescence, mitotic and meiosis process. Biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholines (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were inhibited whereas production of phosphatidylinositols (PIs) and saturated fatty acids (SFA)/ mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) conversion was activated. Medium free fatty acids (FFA) was increased in hMSCs with different anti-aging phenotypes. Therefore, we established a comprehensive method in assessing drug intervention based on the results of transcriptomics and lipidomics.

Poverty, caregiving as a person with a disability and being the caregiver of a child with a disability can lead to increased parenting stress. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine whether parenting stress experienced by caregivers in a household with a disabled member is greater when the disabled member is the caregiver, or the child, and how much of these respective relationships is explained by poverty. METHOD: We collected cross-sectional data using a demographic survey, the Washington Group Questions on adult disability, the 10 Questions on child disability and the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, from 465 caregivers enrolled in a non-governmental child development programme in Kenya. RESULTS: Households with a disabled member were poorer than households without a disabled member. Parenting stress of disabled caregivers was higher than parenting stress of non-disabled caregivers; however, this relationship disappeared when socio-economic status was controlled for. Caregivers of disabled children were more stressed than caregivers of non-disabled children, and this effect was not explained by differences in socio-economic status. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of developing a comprehensive understanding of the stressors facing households with a disabled member, particularly if that member is a child, so that supportive interventions can adequately cater to the needs of caregivers, and their children, in the context of poverty.","Hunt, Xanthe; Laurenzi, Christina; Skeen, Sarah; Swartz, Leslie; Sundin, Phillip; Weiss, Robert E.; Tomlinson, Mark",Afr J Disabil,212,1

METHODS: Pediatric patients (≤ 18 years) who were highest level trauma activations at two trauma centers from 2015 to 2018 were analyzed. We included patients who had admission TEGs and excluded those who did not. Patients were stratified into two groups: those who received MT (> 40 cc/kg total blood product within 6 h of admission) and those who did not. We defined TEG abnormalities based on each institution’s normative values and compared TEG abnormalities between the groups. RESULTS: Of 117 children included, 39 had MT. MT patients had higher injury severity scores (30 vs. 23, p = 0.0004), lactates levels (7.0 vs. 3.5, p < 0.001), base deficit levels ( − 12.2 vs. − 5.8, p < 0.001), and INR values (1.8 vs. 1.3, p < 0.001). MT patients had significantly shortened alpha-angles (35.9% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.023), maximum amplitude (MA) values (43.6% vs. 10.3%, p < 0.001), and significantly lower platelet counts (165 vs. 281, p < 0.001) compared to those who did not receive MT. There was no difference in the trends in R-time, LY30 (lysis or shutdown), or fibrinogen concentration between the groups. Logistic regression identified a decreased MA as a significant predictor for MT [OR 3.68 (CI 1.29–10.52)] CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric trauma patients who undergo MT are more likely to have lower alpha-angles and MA values, as well as lower platelet counts. These findings support the use of TEG to identify hemorrhaging pediatric trauma patients, who may benefit from cryoprecipitate and/or platelet transfusions. TEG provides real-time information on coagulation status, which may expedite the delivery of specific blood products during trauma resuscitation.

The authors introduce a method for simultaneous imaging, detection and quantitative evaluation of multiple viruses in single cells by using multicolor quantum dot (QD) probes and in a single staining cycle. The multicolor QD probes were fabricated via interaction between QDs conjugated to Staph. aureus protein A (SpA-QDs) and virus-specific antibodies. A cocktail of differently colored QD-SpA-MAbs probes were loaded into the same cells containing multiple viruses, and this enabled the different viruses to be fluorescently imaged and analyzed simultaneously. Specifically, influenza A viruses of type H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2, as well as human adenovirus species B type 3 (HAdV-B3) were imaged and detected in virus-infected cells or in their co-infected cells. In our perception, the method provides a flexible platform for simultaneous detection of multiple viruses in co-infected cells. Hence, it offers new opportunities for the molecular diagnosis of virus coinfection and for studies on virus-cell interactions.

Infection is usually highest in 2-week-old calves, and these calves also excrete high numbers of oocysts. These factors may give rise to variations in the sensitivity and specificity of the various diagnostic tests used to detect infection in calves of various ages. An age-stratified Bayesian analysis was carried out to determine the optimum diagnostic test to identify asymptomatic and clinical Cryptosporidium sp. infection in neonatal calves. Fecal samples collected from 82 calves at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and 4 weeks of age were subjected to the following tests: microscopic examination of smears stained with either phenol-auramine O or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-Cryptosporidium monoclonal antibody, nested-PCR, and quantitative real-time PCR. The results confirmed a high prevalence of Cryptosporidium sp. infection, as well as a high level of oocyst excretion, in 2-week-old calves. The sensitivities of all the tests varied with the age of the calves. Quantitative real-time PCR proved to be the most sensitive and specific test for detecting infection irrespective of the age of the calf. The microscopic techniques were the least sensitive and exhibited only moderate efficiency with 2-week-old calves excreting large numbers of oocysts, the majority of which were diarrheic. It was concluded that, when interpreting the results of routine tests for bovine cryptosporidiosis, cognizance should be taken of the sensitivity of the tests in relation to the age of the calves and stage of infection.","De Waele, Valerie; Berzano, Marco; Berkvens, Dirk; Speybroeck, Niko; Lowery, Colm; Mulcahy, Grace M; Murphy, Thomas M",Journal of clinical microbiology,212,1

Previous investigators have suggested that cryopreserved allografts may heighten risk of nonengraftment. To date, no study has investigated the effect of cryopreservation of CD34-selected hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+HPC) used as the sole graft source. OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate outcomes after unrelated donor or matched sibling allo-HCT with cryopreserved CD34+HPC. STUDY DESIGN This was a single center analysis of adult patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent allo-HCT with cryopreserved CD34 selected allo-HCT grafts from 1/2010 to 6/2017. All patients received ablative conditioning and antirejection prophylaxis with rabbit ATG. GCSF-mobilized leukapheresis products underwent CD34 selection using the CliniMACS Reagent System. Cells were then cryopreserved in DMSO (final concentration 7.5%) to -90°C using a controlled rate freezing system before transfer to vapor phase liquid nitrogen storage. In internal validation, this method has shown 92% mean CD34+ viability and 99.7% mean CD34+ recovery. Engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days of ANC ≥ 0.5. Platelet recovery was recorded as the first of 7 consecutive days with platelet count ≥ 20 K/mcL without transfusion. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate OS/RFS, and cumulative incidence functions were used to estimate relapse, NRM, and acute GvHD. RESULTS A total of 64 patients received a cryopreserved CD34 selected graft. Median CD34+ cell count before cryopreservation was 6.6 × 10^6/kg (range 1.4-16.1) and median CD3+ count 2.0 × 10^3/kg (range 0-21.1). All patients were engrafted, at a median of 11 days post-HCT (range 8-14). One patient had poor graft function in the setting of CMV viremia, requiring CD34 selected boost on day 57. Median time to platelet recovery was 16 days (range 13-99). Comparing cryopreserved versus fresh grafts, estimated 2-year OS was 70% (58-83%, 95% CI) vs 62% (57-67%, 95% CI) with fresh grafts (HR 0.86, 0.54-1.35 95% CI, p = 0.5). The estimated 2-year RFS was 59% (48-74%, 95% CI) versus 56% (51-61%, 95% CI; HR 1.01, 0.68-1.51 95% CI, p > 0.9). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 29% (17-41%, 95% CI) versus 23% (19-27%, 95% CI; p = 0.16), while cumulative incidence of NRM at 2 years was 17% (9-28%, 95% CI) versus 23% (19-28%, 95% CI; p = 0.24). Grade II-IV acute GvHD by day 100 cumulative incidence was 16% in cryopreserved (8-26%, 95% CI), and 16% (13-20%, 95% CI; p = 0.97) after fresh graft infusion. Moderate to severe chronic GvHD by day 365 occurred in only one recipient of a cryopreserved graft (2%). CONCLUSIONS In patients with hematologic malignancies who received cryopreserved allogeneic CD34+HPC, engraftment, GvHD, and survival outcomes were consistent with that seen in fresh allogeneic CD34+HPC grafts at our center. Our laboratory validation and clinical experience demonstrate the safety of our cryopreservation procedure for CD34 selected allografts.","Jacob, Reuben P; Flynn, Jessica; Devlin, Sean M; Maloy, Molly; Giralt, Sergio A; Maslak, Peter; O'Reilly, Richard J; Tonon, Jo-Ann; Perales, Miguel Angel; Avecilla, Scott T; Cho, Christina",Transplantation and cellular therapy,212,1

METHODS The rat intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) model (n = 10) was induced by injecting bacterial collagenase VII-S into the caudate nucleus, and the permanent ischemic stroke model (n = 10) was induced by using a 4-0 nylon suture to occlude the origin of the middle cerebral artery. APT-weighted (APTw) MRI was acquired on a 4.7T animal imager and quantified using the magnetization transfer-ratio asymmetry at 3.5 ppm from water. RESULTS There was a consistently high APTw MRI signal in hyperacute ICH during the initial 12 h after injection of collagenase compared with the contralateral brain tissue. When hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke were compared, hyperacute ICH and cerebral ischemia demonstrated opposite APTw MRI contrasts-namely, hyperintense versus hypointense compared with contralateral brain tissue, respectively. There was a stark contrast in APTw signal intensity between these two lesions. CONCLUSION APT-MRI could accurately detect hyperacute ICH and distinctly differentiate hyperacute ICH from cerebral ischemia, thus opening up the possibility of introducing to the clinic a single MRI scan for the simultaneous visualization and separation of hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes at the hyperacute stage.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Nationwide cohort of patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, a large integrated national healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS: All 4297 patients admitted to hospital from 1 March to 31 July 2020 with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and without a history of anticoagulation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was 30 day mortality. Secondary outcomes were inpatient mortality, initiating therapeutic anticoagulation (a proxy for clinical deterioration, including thromboembolic events), and bleeding that required transfusion. RESULTS: Of 4297 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, 3627 (84.4%) received prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission. More than 99% (n=3600) of treated patients received subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin. 622 deaths occurred within 30 days of hospital admission, 513 among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation. Most deaths (510/622, 82%) occurred during hospital stay. Using inverse probability of treatment weighted analyses, the cumulative incidence of mortality at 30 days was 14.3% (95% confidence interval 13.1% to 15.5%) among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation and 18.7% (15.1% to 22.9%) among those who did not. Compared with patients who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation, those who did had a 27% decreased risk for 30 day mortality (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.81). Similar associations were found for inpatient mortality and initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation. Receipt of prophylactic anticoagulation was not associated with increased risk of bleeding that required transfusion (hazard ratio 0.87, 0.71 to 1.05). Quantitative bias analysis showed that results were robust to unmeasured confounding (e-value lower 95% confidence interval 1.77 for 30 day mortality). Results persisted in several sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation compared with no anticoagulation among patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 was associated with a decreased risk of 30 day mortality and no increased risk of serious bleeding events. These findings provide strong real world evidence to support guidelines recommending the use of prophylactic anticoagulation as initial treatment for patients with covid-19 on hospital admission.","Rentsch, Christopher T; Beckman, Joshua A; Tomlinson, Laurie; Gellad, Walid F; Alcorn, Charles; Kidwai-Khan, Farah; Skanderson, Melissa; Brittain, Evan; King, Joseph T; Ho, Yuk-Lam; Eden, Svetlana; Kundu, Suman; Lann, Michael F; Greevy, Robert A; Ho, P Michael; Heidenreich, Paul A; Jacobson, Daniel A; Douglas, Ian J; Tate, Janet P; Evans, Stephen J W; Atkins, David; Justice, Amy C; Freiberg, Matthew S",BMJ,212,20

The existing research on the classification for COVID-19 cases faces the challenges of data imbalance, insufficient generalisability, the lack of comparative study, etc. To address these problems, this paper proposes a type of modified MobileNet to classify COVID-19 CXR images and a modified ResNet architecture for CT image classification. In particular, a modification method of convolutional neural networks (CNN) is designed to solve the gradient vanishing problem and improve the classification performance through dynamically combining features in different layers of a CNN. The modified MobileNet is applied to the classification of COVID-19, Tuberculosis, viral pneumonia (with the exception of COVID-19), bacterial pneumonia and normal controls using CXR images. Also, the proposed modified ResNet is used for the classification of COVID-19, non-COVID-19 infections and normal controls using CT images. The results show that the proposed methods achieve 99.6% test accuracy on the five-category CXR image dataset and 99.3% test accuracy on the CT image dataset. Six advanced CNN architectures and two specific COVID-19 detection models, i.e., COVID-Net and COVIDNet-CT are used in comparative studies. Two benchmark datasets and a CXR image dataset which combines eight different CXR image sources are employed to evaluate the performance of the above models. The results show that the proposed methods outperform the comparative models in classification accuracy, sensitivity, and precision, which demonstrate their potential in computer-aided diagnosis for healthcare applications.","Jia, Guangyu; Lam, Hak-Keung; Xu, Yujia",Comput Biol Med,212,1

An obvious caveat is that several reasons can motivate individuals to seek online information and models that are blind to people's motivations are of limited use and can even mislead. This is particularly true during extraordinary public health crisis, such as the ongoing pandemic, when fear, curiosity and many other reasons can lead individuals to search for health-related information, masking the disease-driven searches. However, health crisis can also offer an opportunity to disentangle between different drivers and learn about human behavior. Here, we focus on the two pandemics of the 21st century (2009-H1N1 flu and Covid-19) and propose a methodology to discriminate between search patterns linked to general information seeking (media driven) and search patterns possibly more associated with actual infection (disease driven). We show that by learning from such pandemic periods, with high anxiety and media hype, it is possible to select online searches and improve model performance both in pandemic and seasonal settings. Moreover, and despite the common claim that more data is always better, our results indicate that lower volume of the right data can be better than including large volumes of apparently similar data, especially in the long run. Our work provides a general framework that can be applied beyond specific events and diseases, and argues that algorithms can be improved simply by using less (better) data. This has important consequences, for example, to solve the accuracy-explainability trade-off in machine-learning.","Mesquita, Sara; Vieira, Cl'audio Haupt; Perfeito, L'ilia; Gonccalves-S'a, Joana",,212,24

METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted from January 31, 2020, to May 15, 2020. Data of 902 patients were obtained from clinical records in hospitals, primary care units, and community pharmacies. Inclusion criteria were adults with IMIDs treated with bDMARDs or tsDMARDs who started therapy 3 months prior to study commencement. Patients with poor adherence to treatments were excluded. COVID-19 was classified as ""definitive"" (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-positive), ""possible"" (characteristic symptoms and negative PCR), and ""suspected"" (characteristic symptoms but PCR not performed). RESULTS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in 70 patients (11 definitive, 19 possible, and 40 suspected). The cumulative incidence of definitive COVID-19 was 1.2%. When considering all cases, the incidence was 7.8%. Patients on biosimilars tumor necrosis factor blockers were more likely to have a diagnosis of COVID-19 (odds ratio, 2.308; p < 0.001).

Hybrid VSV-FH exhibited a multifaceted mechanism of cancer-cell killing, and improved neurotolerability over parental VSV in preclinical studies. In this study, we evaluated VSV-FH in vitro and in vivo in models of hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers. Our results indicate that high intrahepatic doses of VSV-FH did not result in any significant toxicity and were well tolerated by transgenic mice expressing the measles virus receptor CD46. Furthermore, single intratumoral treatments with VSV-FH yielded improved survival and complete tumor regressions in a proportion of mice in the Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma model, but not in mice xenografted with BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells. Our preliminary findings indicate that VSV-FH can induce potent oncolysis in hepatocellular and pancreatic cancer cell lines with concordant results in vivo in hepatocellular cancer and discordant in pancreatic cancer, without the VSV-mediated toxic effects previously observed in laboratory animals.

We aimed to (1) assess how public health restrictions impact PA, subjective well-being (SWB), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of community-dwelling elderly, and (2) investigate risk factors that lead to a decline in PA. Self-administered questionnaires assessed the changes in PA, SWB, HRQoL. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant associated risk factors for decreased PA. Of 165 participants (valid response rate, 41.3%; mean age, 78.5 ± 8.0 years), 47.3% became less active, 23.0% became more active, and 29.7% maintained PA levels. There was a significant decrease in SWB at baseline and follow-up after COVID-19 restrictions in the less active group (p < 0.01). Higher levels of moderate or strenuous exercise/sports activity at baseline (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.24), and lower mental component HRQoL scores at baseline (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99) were associated with an increased risk of decreased PA. Public health restrictions impact the PA of the elderly, especially those who had higher levels of exercise/sports activity and lower HRQoL before COVID-19.

This includes ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathies. The common pathophysiological link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cardiovascular events is represented by coagulation abnormalities and disruption of factors released by endothelial cells, which contribute in maintaining the blood vessels into an anti-thrombotic state. Thus, early alteration of the functionality of endothelial cells, which may be found soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection, seems to represent the major target of a SARS CoV-2 disease state and accounts for the systemic vascular dysfunction that leads to a detrimental effect in terms of hospitalization and death accompanying the disease. In particular, the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor located in the endothelial cell surface, either at the pulmonary and systemic level, leads to early impairment of endothelial function, which, in turn, is followed by vascular inflammation and thrombosis of peripheral blood vessels. This highlights systemic hypoxia and further aggravates the vicious circle that compromises the development of the disease, leading to irreversible tissue damage and death of people with SARS CoV-2 infection. The review aims to assess some recent advances to define the crucial role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of vascular complications accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, the molecular mechanisms associated with the interaction of SARS CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor located on the endothelial cells are highlighted to support its role in compromising endothelial cell functionality. Finally, the consequences of endothelial dysfunction in enhancing pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection are assessed in order to identify early therapeutic interventions able to reduce the impact of the disease in high-risk patients.","Maiuolo, Jessica; Mollace, Rocco; Gliozzi, Micaela; Musolino, Vincenzo; Carresi, Cristina; Paone, Sara; Scicchitano, Miriam; Macrì, Roberta; Nucera, Saverio; Bosco, Francesca; Scarano, Federica; Zito, Maria Caterina; Ruga, Stefano; Tavernese, Annamaria; Mollace, Vincenzo",Int. j. mol. sci.

METHODS We developed a modified stacked auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure. RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting, the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted that the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the forecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19, 2020. The 34 provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters. CONCLUSIONS The accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was high. We predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of April. If the data are reliable and there are no second transmissions, we can accurately forecast the transmission dynamics of the Covid-19 across the provinces/cities in China. The AI-inspired methods are a powerful tool for helping public health planning and policymaking.","Hu, Zixin; Ge, Qiyang; Li, Shudi; Jin, Li; Xiong, Momiao",,212,20

In this single center case control study, we measured the rate of MDRB acquisition in patients admitted in COVID-19 ICU and compared it with patients admitted in the same ICU for subarachnoid hemorrhage (controls) matched 1:1 on length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation. All patients were systematically and repeatedly screened for MDRB carriage. We compared the rate of MDRB acquisition in COVID-19 patients and in control using a competing risk analysis. Of note, although we tried to match COVID-19 patients with septic shock patients, we were unable due to the longer stay of COVID-19 patients. Among 72 patients admitted to the COVID-19 ICUs, 33% acquired 31 MDRB during ICU stay. The incidence density of MDRB acquisition was 30/1000 patient days. Antimicrobial therapy and exposure time were associated with higher rate of MDRB acquisition. Among the 72 SAH patients, 21% acquired MDRB, with an incidence density was 18/1000 patient days. The septic patients had more comorbidities and a greater number of previous hospitalizations than the COVID-19 patients. The incidence density of MDRB acquisition was 30/1000 patient days. The association between COVID-19 and MDRB acquisition (compared to control) risk did not reach statistical significance in the multivariable competing risk analysis (sHR 1.71 (CI 95% 0.93-3.21)). Thus, we conclude that, despite strong physical isolation, acquisition rate of MDRB in ICU patients was at least similar during the COVID-19 first wave compared to previous period.","Bogossian, Elisa G; Taccone, Fabio S; Izzi, Antonio; Yin, Nicolas; Garufi, Alessandra; Hublet, Stephane; Njimi, Hassane; Ego, Amedee; Gorham, Julie; Byl, Baudouin; Brasseur, Alexandre; Hites, Maya; Vincent, Jean-Louis; Creteur, Jacques; Grimaldi, David",,212,20

METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science from inception to June-6, 2020, limiting to the studies that reported the comparison of the effectiveness of CC in terms of CC rate, CC depth, the proportion of adequate CC rate, the proportion of adequate CC depth or proportion of adequate recoil; in study arms with or without PPE. Risk of bias was assessed by the ROB-2 and ROBINS-I tool. Quantitative data synthesis was done using the generic inverse variance method and the fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Five simulation-based studies were finally included. A Significant decrease in CC rate (SMD: -0.28, 95%CI: -0.47 to -0.10) and CC depth (SMD: -0.26, 95%CI: -0.44 to -0.07) were observed in the PPE arm as compared to the no-PPE arm. The difference in CC rate was more prominently seen in adult CPR than in paediatric CPR. Without PPE, the proportion of adequate CC rate delivered was 0.74, which reduced significantly to 0.60 after use of PPE (p - 0.035). Similarly, the proportion of adequate CC depth was significantly lesser (p - 0.001) in PPE arm (0.55), as compared to that of the no-PPE arm (0.78). CONCLUSION: The use of PPE compromises the quality of CC during CPR significantly, and newer ways to deliver chest compression has to be investigated.

Because epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) express ACE2, we wanted to identify the main factors associated with ACE2 levels and its cleavage enzyme, ADAM17 in epicardial fat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epicardial and subcutaneous fat biopsies were obtained from 43 patients who underwent open-heart surgery. From 36 patients, biopsies were used for RNA expression analysis by real time PCR of ACE1, ACE2 and ADAM17. From 8 patients, stromal vascular cells were submitted to adipogenesis or used for studying the treatment effects on gene expression levels. Soluble ACE2 was determined in supernatants by ELISA. RESULTS: Epicardial fat biopsies expressed higher levels of ACE2 (1.53 [1.49-1.61] vs. 1.51 [1.47-1.56] a.u., p<0.05) and lower ADAM17 than subcutaneous fat (1.67 [1.65-1.70] vs. 1.70 [1.66-1.74] a.u., p<0.001). Both genes were increased in epicardial fat from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (1.62 [1.50-2.28] vs. 1.52 [1.49-1.55] a.u., p=0.05 for ACE2 and 1.68 [1.66-1.78] vs. 1.66 [1.63-1.69] a.u., p<0.05 for ADAM17). Logistic regression analysis determined that T2DM was the main associated factor with epicardial ACE2 levels (p<0.01). The highest ACE2 levels were found on patients with diabetes and obesity. ACE1 and ACE2 levels were not upregulated by anti-diabetic treatment (metformin, insulin or thiazolidinedione). Its cellular levels, which were higher in epicardial than in subcutaneous stromal cells (1.61 [1.55-1.63] vs. 1 [1-1.34]), were not correlated with the soluble ACE2. CONCLUSION: Epicardial expressed higher levels of ACE2 in comparison with subcutaneous fat cells, which is enhanced by diabetes and obesity presence in patients with cardiovascular disease.

However, the actions so far taken in terms of both policy and practice by health systems in many European states have neither matched the scale of the problem nor seized the opportunities for disease prevention potentially offered by vaccination and screening. Treatments for HPV-caused cancers are also inequitably provided across the region and widespread misinformation about HPV undermines efforts to improve public health. The European Cancer Organisation's HPV Action Network has made the case for action for the elimination of all the cancers caused by HPV through gender-neutral vaccination, effective cervical cancer screening, better quality treatments, and public and professional education across Europe. The World Health Organisation's new global strategy for the elimination of cervical cancer (launched in November 2020), together with Europe's Beating Cancer Plan (February 2021), together provide a major opportunity to tackle decisively all the cancers caused by HPV. The Beating Cancer Plan, which was significantly influenced by evidence provided by the HPV Action Network, commits to supporting EU member states' efforts to extend routine vaccination of girls and boys and to creating a new EU-supported Cancer Screening Scheme to help Member States ensure that 90% of the EU population who qualify for cervical cancer screening are offered it by 2025. The goal of HPV cancer elimination is now both possible and achievable. The challenge is to ensure implementation and delivery by EU member states and more widely across the European region.","Baker, P.; Kelly, D.; Medeiros, R.; Morrissey, M.; Price, R.",Journal of Cancer Policy,212,24

In addition to the lungs, studies have reported the involvement of the stomach, intestine, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in the heart. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who died soon after developing multi-organ failure and myocardial injury due to COVID-19-associated pneumonia. A 71-year-old man who contracted COVID-19 was admitted to the hospital after presenting with fever for 7 days and developed dyspnea. Following treatment, his respiratory status worsened. Thus, he was transferred to our hospital for intensive care on day 11. Physical examination revealed fever, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and no chest pain. Invasive positive pressure ventilation was initiated for acute respiratory distress syndrome on day 14. On day 15, we observed renal, liver, and coagulation dysfunction, indicating multi-organ failure. Chest radiography did not show clear signs of an increased cardiothoracic ratio or pulmonary congestion. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of myocardial infarction, which was confirmed by elevated troponin I and creatine kinase levels. The patient's circulatory dynamics did not improve on medication, and he died on day 16. CONCLUSIONS: We report the case of a patient with severe COVID-19 who died from an exacerbation of myocardial injury. Clinicians should not only evaluate respiration but also assess the heart by performing a 12-lead ECG, echocardiogram, and myocardial injury marker examination. Together, these tools can help predict which patients will develop severe COVID-19.","Nakamura, Yuki; Shimizu, Masaru; Yamaki, Taeka; Kushimoto, Kohsuke; Yamashita, Ayahiro; Hayase, Kazuma; Yamazaki, Masaki; Hashimoto, Satoru; Ohta, Bon",J. infect. chemother,212,1

Because of their huge burden and the vulnerability imposed during a health crisis, prevention and care of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) will need to be prioritized even further. Maternal and child health are inextricably linked with NCDs and their risk factors. The intergenerational impact of poor maternal nutrition and health conditions during pregnancy, particularly NCD-related pregnancy complications, can be considered as a multiplier of the ongoing pandemic of NCDs. The economic cost of poor maternal health and NCD-related pregnancy complications is likely very high, but is not adequately researched or documented in the context of long-term population health. Interventions to address NCDs in pregnancy have beneficial effects on short-term pregnancy outcomes; but even more importantly, identifying ""at-risk"" mothers and offspring opens up the opportunity for targeted early preventive action. Preventive actions to address obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases have a common lifestyle approach-identifying any one of these problems in pregnancy provides an opportunity to address them all.

We investigated the IFNL4 rs12979860 and the PDCD1 polymorphisms in 734 HCV-positive patients, including 461 cases with liver disease of varying severity and 273 patients with lymphoproliferative disorders to determine association of these genes with patient's outcome. METHODS: Expression levels of PDCD1 mRNA encoded by haplotypes were investigated by quantitative PCR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry was used to detect PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1. RESULTS: The frequency of IFNL4 rs12979860 C/T or T/T genotypes was significantly higher in patients with HCV-related diseases than blood donors (P<0.0001). Patients expressing the IFN&#955;4 variant with one amino acid change that reduces IFN&#955;4 secretion was found increased in frequency in HCV-related diseases compared to HCC. PDCD1 mRNA levels in HCC tissue were significantly higher in cases carrying the PD-1.3 A or the PD-1.7 G allele (P=0.0025 and P=0.0167). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between PD-1.3 and IFNL4 was found in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) only (LD=0 in HCC; LD=72 in MC). PBMCs of MC patients expressed low levels of PD-L1 in CD19+IgM+ B cells and of PD-1 in CD4+ T cells suggesting the involvement of regulatory B-T cell interaction to the pathogenesis of MC. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data indicate an important contribution of IFN&#955;4 expression to the development of HCV-related HCC and an epistatic contribution of IFNL4 and PDCD1 in MC.","De Re, Valli; Tornesello, Maria Lina; De Zorzi, Mariangela; Caggiari, Laura; Pezzuto, Francesca; Leone, Patrizia; Racanelli, Vito; Lauletta, Gianfranco; Zanussi, Stefania; Repetto, Ombretta; Gragnani, Laura; Rossi, Francesca Maria; Dolcetti, Riccardo; Zignego, Anna Linda; Buonaguro, Franco M; Steffan, Agostino",Liver int,212,4

METHODS AND RESULTS: We carried out a multicentric, cross-sectional, retrospective analysis of 431 consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized between 10 March and 14 April 2020 who died or were treated with invasive mechanical ventilation. This project is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT04367129). Standard ECG was recorded at hospital admission. ECG was abnormal in 93% of the patients. Atrial fibrillation/flutter was detected in 22% of the patients. ECG signs suggesting acute right ventricular pressure overload (RVPO) were detected in 30% of the patients. In particular, 43 (10%) patients had the S1Q3T3 pattern, 38 (9%) had incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB), and 49 (11%) had complete RBBB. ECG signs of acute RVPO were not statistically different between patients with (n = 104) or without (n=327) invasive mechanical ventilation during ECG recording (36% vs. 28%, P = 0.10). Non-specific repolarization abnormalities and low QRS voltage in peripheral leads were present in 176 (41%) and 23 (5%), respectively. In four patients showing ST-segment elevation, acute myocardial infarction was confirmed with coronary angiography. No ST-T abnormalities suggestive of acute myocarditis were detected. In the subgroup of 110 patients where high-sensitivity troponin I was available, ECG features were not statistically different when stratified for above or below the 5 times upper reference limit value. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG is abnormal in almost all critically ill COVID-19 patients and shows a large spectrum of abnormalities, with signs of acute RVPO in 30% of the patients. Rapid and simple identification of these cases with ECG at hospital admission can facilitate classification of the patients and provide pathophysiological insights.","Bertini, Matteo; Ferrari, Roberto; Guardigli, Gabriele; Malagù, Michele; Vitali, Francesco; Zucchetti, Ottavio; D039,; Aniello, Emanuele; Volta, Carlo Alberto; Cimaglia, Paolo; Piovaccari, Giancarlo; Corzani, Alessandro; Galvani, Marcello; Ortolani, Paolo; Rubboli, Andrea; Tortorici, Gianfranco; Casella, Gianni; Sassone, Biagio; Navazio, Alessandro; Rossi, Luca; Aschieri, Daniela; Rapezzi, Claudio",Europace,212,24

We evaluated the feasibility, outcomes, and safety of tele-hepatology in delivering quality-care amidst the pandemic. Approach and Results: A telemedicine setup using smartphones by hepatologists was organized at our tertiary-care centre after pilot testing. Consecutive patients availing tele-hepatology services were recruited between March and July 2020. An adapted-MAST-model (Model for assessment of telemedicine) was used after validity and reliability testing, to evaluate services 7-21 days after index teleconsultation. Of 1419 registrations, 1281 (90.3%) consultations were completed. From 245 randomly surveyed patients, 210 (85.7%) responded [age (years, IQR): 46 (35-56); 32.3% females]. Seventy-percent patients belonged to the middle or lower socio-economic class whereas 61% were from rural areas. Modes of teleconsultation were audio (54.3%) or hybrid video-call (45.7%). Teleconsultation alone was deemed suitable in 88.6% patients. Diagnosis-rate and compliance-rate were 94% and 82.4%, respectively. Patient's convenience-rate, satisfaction-rate, improvement-rate, success-rate and net promoter score were 99.0%, 85.2%, 49.5%, 46.2% and 70, respectively. Physical and mental-quality of life improved in 67.1% and 82.8% patients, respectively post index-teleconsultation. Man-hours and money spent by patients were significantly lower with teleconsultation (p<0.001), however, man-hours spent by hospital per teleconsultation were higher than in physical-outpatient services (p<0.001). Dissatisfied patients were more likely to have lower diagnosis-rate, unsuitability for teleconsultation, noncompliance, poorer understanding, and uncomfortable conversation during teleconsultation. Connectivity-issues (22.9%) were the commonest barrier. Three patients, all of whom were advised emergency care during teleconsultation, succumbed to their illness. Conclusions: Tele-hepatology is a feasible and reasonably effective tool for rendering health-care services using smartphones during the COVID-19 pandemic. Systematic implementation, possible integration into routine healthcare delivery and formal cost-effectiveness of tele-hepatology services need further exploration.","Verma, Nipun; Mishra, Saurabh; Singh, Surender; Kaur, Rajwant; Kaur, Talwinder; De, Arka; Premkumar, Madhumita; Taneja, Sunil; Duseja, Ajay; Singh, Meenu; Singh, Virendra",,212,1

War-related terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and diseases. Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of war-related metaphors too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one.

However, selection into medical school is the gateway to medicine in many countries, and it is critical to use processes which are evidence-based, valid and reliable even under challenging circumstances. Our challenge was to plan and conduct a multiple-mini interview (MMI) in a dynamic and stringent safe distancing context.Methods: This paper reports a case study of how to plan, re-plan and conduct MMIs in an environment where substantially tighter safe distancing measures were introduced just before the MMI was due to be delivered.Results: We report on how to design and implement a fully remote, online MMI which ensured the safety of candidates and assessors.Discussion: We discuss the challenges of this approach and also reflect on broader issues associated with selection into medical school during a pandemic. The aim of the paper is to provide broadly generalizable guidance to other medical schools faced with the challenge of selecting future students under difficult conditions.","Cleland, Jennifer; Chu, Jowe; Lim, Samuel; Low, Jamie; Low-Beer, Naomi; Kwek, Tong Kiat",Med Teach,212,17

This study is aimed at determining the association between psychological factors, including emotional stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep pattern among BMS patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 19 patients with idiopathic BMS were enrolled along with a control group equivalent in age and sex, but without BMS. Questionnaires used were the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Demographic information was also recorded and analyzed. Results: There was a significant correlation among the two groups of BMS and non-BMS patients regarding stress, depression, and sleep disorder. The average severity of the burning score was 8.31 among the patients. Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed among mental disorders and educational level and sex, but not with age. There was also no significant correlation among the severity of the burning score with sex, education, and mental disorder. Conclusion: BMS is significantly associated with psychological symptoms. This condition requires proper treatment and support because it can represent psychological or mental issues and/or have a significant effect on daily life.","Rezazadeh, Fahimeh; Farahmand, Farzane; Hosseinpour, Hamidreza; Shahriarirad, Reza; Sabet Eghlidi, Amirhasan",Biomed Res Int,212,21

The sporting world, too, is suffering from the global effects of this disease, with the postponement or cancellation of competitions, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. As a proposal for containing the disease, social isolation was declared. Despite the importance of this measure, it was harmful for Olympic athletes, as they had to stay away from their training site and trainers, as well as their interdisciplinary teams. It is therefore important to study this harm caused, in order to minimize it. In general, it is believed that regular physical activity is associated with improved immune system functioning. The lack of training can therefore have significant consequences for the performance and health of the Olympic athlete. From the athlete's point of view, the impaired immune system, due to the reduced frequency of physical exercise, leaves them more vulnerable to contracting or developing infections or other diseases. The risk of harm due to the decreased performance of preventive works is also evident in this population. The reductions in training load and intensity can cause changes in the athlete's body composition and affect various aspects of cardiorespiratory fitness, as well as reducing strength levels and muscle potency. In relation to the athlete's mental health, two aspects are particularly challenging: isolation and uncertainty. Based on the possible harm caused by social isolation, the need is seen for a specific and joint work, in an attempt to minimize it. This work addresses the following topics: (I) context: transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, discharge criteria, isolation and post-pandemic consequences; (II) harm and proposals: nutritional, physiological, biomechanical and psychological.

Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted. From January 1 to December 23, 2019, a total of 46 patients with chronic sinus tract wounds, who met the inclusion criteria were admitted to the Wound Healing Center of Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, including 23 males and 23 females, aged 18-81 (48±21) years. On admission, computer tomography (CT) imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction was performed to examine the shapes of wound sinus tract and classify the wounds, and the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by CT imaging (hereinafter referred to as reference lengths) were recorded; the lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds were examined by hard endoscopy and soft endoscopy and measured. The wounds with and without obviously curved sinus tract were classified into curve group and straight group respectively, and the deviation rates between the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by soft endoscopy or hard endoscopy and the reference lengths (hereinafter referred to as deviation rates of lengths) in each group were calculated and compared. The differences between the deviation rates of lengths examined by soft endoscopy and hard endoscopy and the deviation rate of reference lengths (0) in each group were compared. Data were statistically analyzed with paired sample t test and Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. Results: CT imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction showed that there were 4 types of wound sinus tract, including tubular (36/46), lamellar (4/46), club-mallet (4/46), and irregular (2/46). Tubular wounds were further divided into type I (23/36), type L (4/36), and type Y (9/36). Wounds with type I tubular, lamellar, and club-mallet sinus tract were classified into linear group (31/46), while those with type Y tubular, type L tubular, and irregular sinus tract were classified into curve group (15/46). In linear group, the deviation rates of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by hard endoscopy and soft endoscopy were 0. In curve group, the deviation rate of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by soft endoscopy was 0 (0, 0.58%), which was significantly lower than 41.18% (31.68%, 48.41%) examined by hard endoscopy, Z=-3.408, P<0.01; the deviation rate of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by hard endoscopy (40±19)% was significantly higher than the deviation rate of reference lengths (t=8.343, P<0.01), while the deviation rate of the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by soft endoscopy was similar to the deviation rate of reference lengths (Z=-1.342, P>0.05). Conclusions: Compared with hard endoscopy, soft endoscopy can observe the internal characteristics of chronic sinus tract wounds in a wider range in the clinical examination of this kind of wound, especially for the exploration of curved chronic sinus tract wounds. The promotion of this method will be conducive to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic sinus tract wounds.","Tao, G L; Liu, Y K; Tang, J J; Ma, X; Huang, L F; Zhou, J Q; Wu, F Y; Yakupu, Aobuliaximu; Wang, H Q; Guan, H N; Dong, J Y; Lu, S L",Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi,212,1

One instrument employed to transmit data and constituents to specific (target) cells is extracellular vesicles (EVs). They originate from a variety of cells (endothelial, immune cells, platelets, mesenchymal stromal cells, etc.), and consequently, their surface characteristics and cargo vary according to the paternal cell. The cargo could be DNA, mRNA, microRNA, receptors, metabolites, cytoplasmic proteins, or pathological molecules, as a function of which EVs exert different effects upon endocytosis in recipient cells. Recently, EVs have become important participants in a variety of pathologies, including atherogenesis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated thrombosis. Herein, we summarize recent advances and some of our own results on the role of EVs in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, and discuss their potential to function as signaling mediators, biomarkers and therapeutic agents.

However, the characteristics and prognosis of ICC is not well-known. This study aims to reveal the relationship between liver function and prognosis of ICC. METHODS: A total of 83 ICC patients were recruited retrospectively from March 2009 to August 2020. Child-Pugh (CP) and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) scores were used to assess liver function. The extent of portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) was classified from Vp0 to Vp4. The endpoint for this analysis was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The median age was 72 (44-88) years old, 48 patients were male (57.8%), and 70 patients were classified as CP grade A (84.3%). At baseline, chronic liver disease (hepatitis B: 9.6%, hepatitis C: 15.7%, alcoholic liver disease: 9.6%, and non-alcoholic fatty liver: disease 4.8%) were diagnosed. The median OS of all ICC patients was 21.2 months. A total of 27 patients underwent surgical resection; these patients demonstrated a longer median OS compared to those who did not (50.8 months vs 5.5 months, P < 0.001). The prognosis of patients with ICC can be stratified by ALBI grade (grade 1: 54.3 months, grade 2a: 8.4 months, grade 2b: 3.9 months, and grade 3: 1.4 months; P < 0.001) and the extent of PVTT (Vp0: 54.3 months, Vp1/2: 8.4 months, Vp3/4: 3.9 months; P = 0.0039). CONCLUSION: Viral hepatitis (25.3%) was found as the background liver disease of ICC. Assessing liver function via ALBI grade is useful for stratifying prognosis of patients with ICC.

Haplotypes also provide an effective way to deal with untyped SNPs. Two major challenges arise in haplotype-based association analysis of family data. First, haplotypes may not be inferred with certainty from genotype data. Second, the trait values within a family tend to be correlated because of common genetic and environmental factors. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we present an efficient likelihood-based approach to analyzing associations of quantitative traits with haplotypes or untyped SNPs. This approach properly accounts for within-family trait correlations and can handle general pedigrees with arbitrary patterns of missing genotypes. We characterize the genetic effects on the quantitative trait by a linear regression model with random effects and develop efficient likelihood-based inference procedures. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed methods. An application to family data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program Ancillary Genetic Study is provided. A computer program is freely available. CONCLUSIONS: Results from extensive simulation studies show that the proposed methods for testing the haplotype effects on quantitative traits have correct type I error rates and are more powerful than some existing methods.","Diao, Guoqing; Lin, Dan-Yu",BMC Genet,212,26

Forecasting of admissions can help for the efficient organisation of hospital care. We aimed to forecast the number of admissions to psychiatric hospitals before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and we compared the performance of machine learning models and time series models. This would eventually allow to support timely resource allocation for optimal treatment of patients. MethodsWe used admission data from 9 psychiatric hospitals in Germany between 2017 and 2020. We compared machine learning models with time series models in weekly, monthly and yearly forecasting before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our models were trained and validated with data from the first two years and tested in prospectively sliding time-windows in the last two years. ResultsA total of 90,686 admissions were analysed. The models explained up to 90% of variance in hospital admissions in 2019 and 75% in 2020 with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The best models substantially outperformed a one-step seasonal naive forecast (seasonal mean absolute scaled error (sMASE) 2019: 0.59, 2020: 0.76). The best model in 2019 was a machine learning model (elastic net, mean absolute error (MAE): 7.25). The best model in 2020 was a time series model (exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors and trend and seasonal components, MAE: 10.44), which adjusted more quickly to the shock effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Models forecasting admissions one week in advance did not perform better than monthly and yearly models in 2019 but they did in 2020. The most important features for the machine learning models were calendrical variables. ConclusionModel performance did not vary much between different modelling approaches before the COVID-19 pandemic and established forecasts were substantially better than one-step seasonal naive forecasts. However, weekly time series models adjusted quicker to the COVID-19 related shock effects.

Given this situation, the present study examined PTG among 815 school children of 12 to 18 years age, who had lost one or both parents as a result of protracted armed conflict in Kashmir, India. In a cross-sectional study, the hypothesized relationship of core beliefs challenges, religious coping, religious commitment, sociocultural context, and some demographic variables with posttraumatic growth (PTG) were examined. Results suggest that sociocultural context, core beliefs challenges, and religious coping predicted PTG, thus affirming the role of sociocultural environment in the development of PTG among children. Practical implications and future directions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).","Shah, Habibullah; Mishra, Arvind Kumar",Am J Orthopsychiatry,212,1

Although several different mechanisms for this have been described, the pathogenesis still remains uncertain. METHODS: We present the case of a gentleman who presented 6-months following oral cavity SCC resection with a large fungating mass at his previous tracheostomy site, and also review the reported literature on this rare phenomenon. RESULTS: Four weeks after diagnosis of his recurrence he underwent a total laryngectomy, wide-local skin excision and reconstruction with a pectoralis major pedicled flap. He recovered well initially following his operation, however unfortunately contracted nosocomial SARS-Cov2 and succumbed from respiratory complications during his post-operative recovery. CONCLUSION: Stomal recurrence after temporary tracheostomy for oral cavity malignancies are very rare. Previously reported management of these can vary from surgical to palliative treatment. Methods to prevent these include delaying tracheostomy until after surgical resection, packing the pharynx during resection and adjuvant radiotherapy.","Hintze, J M; Fitzgerald, C; Lang, B; O039,; Shea, J; Barry, C; Brennan, S; Lennon, P",Oral Oncol,212,16

Exploring factors that may heighten or buffer the risk of mental health problems in this context is thus critical. Whilst compassion may be a protective factor, in contrast fears of compassion increase vulnerability to psychosocial distress and may amplify the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This study explores the magnifying effects of fears of compassion on the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress, and social safeness. METHODS: Adult participants from the general population (N = 4057) were recruited across 21 countries worldwide, and completed self-report measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, fears of compassion (for self, from others, for others), depression, anxiety, stress and social safeness. RESULTS: Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased depression, anxiety and stress. The three flows of fears of compassion predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress and lower social safeness. All fears of compassion moderated (heightened) the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on psychological distress. Only fears of compassion from others moderated the effects of likelihood of contracting COVID-19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries. CONCLUSIONS: Fears of compassion have a universal magnifying effect on the damaging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness. Compassion focused interventions and communications could be implemented to reduce resistances to compassion and promote mental wellbeing during and following the pandemic.","Matos, Marcela; McEwan, Kirsten; Kanovský, Martin; Halamová, Júlia; Steindl, Stanley R; Ferreira, Nuno; Linharelhos, Mariana; Rijo, Daniel; Asano, Kenichi; Gregório, Sónia; Márquez, Margarita G; Vilas, Sara P; Brito-Pons, Gonzalo; Lucena-Santos, Paola; da Silva Oliveira, Margareth; de Souza, Erika Leonardo; Llobenes, Lorena; Gumiy, Natali; Costa, Maria Ileana; Habib, Noor; Hakem, Reham; Khrad, Hussain; Alzahrani, Ahmad; Cheli, Simone; Petrocchi, Nicola; Tholouli, Elli; Issari, Philia; Simos, Gregoris; Lunding-Gregersen, Vibeke; Elklit, Ask; Kolts, Russell; Kelly, Allison C; Bortolon, Catherine; Delamillieure, Pascal; Paucsik, Marine; Wahl, Julia E; Zieba, Mariusz; Zatorski, Mateusz; Komendzinski, Tomasz; Zhang, Shuge; Basran, Jaskaran; Kagialis, Antonios; Kirby, James; Gilbert, Paul",Clin. psychol. psychother,212,24

AIMS: There is an urgent need to understand the risk and protective factors associated with poor mental well-being of UK HCWs working during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Shortly after the April 2020 UK COVID-19 peak 2773 HCWs completed a survey containing measures of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress, as well as questions around potential predictors such as roles, COVID-19 risk perception and workplace-related factors. Respondents were classified as high or low symptomatic on each scale and logistic regression revealed factors associated with severe psychiatric symptoms. Change in well-being from pre- to during COVID-19 was also quantified. RESULTS: Nearlya third of HCWs reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression, and the number reporting very high symptoms was more than quadruple that pre-COVID-19. Several controllable factors were associated with the most severe level of psychiatric symptoms: insufficient personal protective equipment availability, workplace preparation, training and communication, and higher workload. Being female, 'front line', previous psychiatric diagnoses, traumatic events, and being an allied HCW or manager were also significantly associated with severe psychiatric symptoms. Sharing stress, resilience and ethical support for treatment decisions were significantly associated with low psychiatric symptoms. Front-line workers showed greater worsening of mental health compared with non-front-line HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: Poor mental well-being was prevalent during the COVID-19 response, however, controllable factors associated with severe psychiatric symptoms are available to be targeted to reduce the detrimental impact of COVID-19 and other pandemics on HCW mental health.","Gilleen, J.; Santaolalla, A.; Valdearenas, L.; Salice, C.; Fuste, M.",BJPsych Open,212,20

METHODS: We analyzed data from the national health check-up system in Japan; for our analyses, we selected records of individuals who completed assessments of cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and kidney function from 2005 to 2016. We excluded participants who had CKD at baseline, defined as the presence of proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73m2. We compared two groups of CAVI measurements-the highest quartile (â§8.1) and the combined lower three quartiles (<8.1). We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess associations between these two groups and subsequent CKD events, proteinuria, eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, and rapid eGFR decline (greater than or equal to -3 mL/min /1.73m2/year). RESULTS: The mean age of the 24,297 included participants was 46.2 years, and 60% were female. Over a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, 1,435 CKD events occurred. In a multivariable analysis, the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the highest versus combined lower quartiles of CAVI measurements were 1.3 (1.1,1.5) for CKD events, 1.3 (0.96,1.62) for proteinuria, 1.4 (1.1,1.7) for eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, and the odds ratio with 95% CI was 1.3 (1.1,1.4) for rapid eGFR decline. CONCLUSION: Persons with CAVI measurements â§8.1 had a higher risk for CKD events compared to their counterparts with CAVI measurements <8.1.

Although the presence of the virus has been detected in the myocardium of infected patients, and infection of induced pluripotent cells-derived cardiomyocytes has been demonstrated, the reported expression of ACE2 in cardiac stromal cells suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may determine cardiac injury by sustaining productive infection and increasing inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed expression of ACE2 receptor in primary human cardiac stromal cells derived from cardiospheres, using proteomics and transcriptomics before exposing them to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Using conventional and high sensitivity PCR methods, we measured virus release in the cellular supernatants and monitored the intracellular viral bioprocessing. We performed high-resolution imaging to show the sites of intracellular viral production and demonstrated the presence of viral particles in the cells with electron microscopy. We finally used RT-qPCR assays to detect genes linked to innate immunity and fibrotic pathways coherently regulated in cells after exposure to the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that cardiac stromal cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and produce variable viral yields depending on the extent of cellular ACE2 receptor expression. Interestingly, these cells also evolved toward hyper-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic phenotypes independently of ACE2 levels. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection of myocardial stromal cells could be involved in cardiac injury, and explain the high number of complications observed in severe cases of COVID-19. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: In the present investigation, we provide evidence that human cardiac stromal cells, a major component of the non-contractile cellular fraction in the heart can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, in direct relationship to the extent of ACE2 receptor expression. Our work also suggests that these cells, when exposed to the virus, can evolve toward inflammatory and fibrotic phenotypes independently of ACE2. In addition to describing a novel cellular target of SARS-CoV-2 in the human heart, our study generates new hypothesis on potential mechanisms underlying cardiac complications observed in COVID-19 patients.","Amendola, Alessandra; Garoffolo, Gloria; Songia, Paola; Nardacci, Roberta; Ferrari, Silvia; Bernava, Giacomo; Canzano, Paola; Myasoedova, Veronika; Colavita, Francesca; Castilletti, Concetta; Sberna, Giuseppe; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Piacentini, Mauro; Agrifoglio, Marco; Colombo, Gualtiero I; Poggio, Paolo; Pesce, Maurizio",Cardiovasc. res,212,20

This study aims to identify, describe, and organize the currently available high-quality design evidence concerning mask use during the spread of respiratory viruses and find evidence gaps. Databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), clinical trial registry, gray literature database, and reference lists of articles were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs) in April 2020. The quality of the studies was assessed using the risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Handbook Version 5.1.0 and the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) tool. A bubble plot was designed to display information in four dimensions. Finally, twenty-one RCTs and nine SRs met our inclusion criteria. Most studies were of “Low quality” and focused on healthcare workers. Six RCTs reported adverse effects, with one implying that the cloth masks reuse may increase the infection risk. When comparing masks with usual practice, over 70% RCTs and also SRs showed that masks were “beneficial” or “probably beneficial”;however, when comparing N95 respirators with medical masks, 75% of SRs showed “no effect”, whereas 50% of RCTs showed “beneficial effect”. Overall, the current evidence provided by high-quality designs may be insufficient to deal with a second impact of the pandemic. Masks may be effective in interrupting or reducing the spread of respiratory viruses;however, the effect of an N95 respirator or cloth masks versus medical masks is unclear. Additional high-quality studies determining the impact of prolonged mask use on vulnerable populations (such as children and pregnant women), the possible adverse effects (such as skin allergies and shortness of breath) and optimal settings and exposure circumstances for populations to use masks are needed.","Li, Y.; Wei, Z.; Zhang, J.; Li, R.; Li, H.; Cao, L.; Hou, L.; Zhang, W.; Chen, N.; Guo, K.; Li, X.; Yang, K.",Annals of Translational Medicine,212,8

The study population was comprised of 552 patients. All patients were consulted and advised by telephone as regards the prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hospital and outpatient follow-ups were limited to the minimum. Preventive modification of immunosuppression was not recommended in relation to the pandemic. Three patients with multiple comorbidities (a woman aged 60, a man aged 59, and another man aged 83; 2.25 years, 5.5 years, and 7.5 years after heart transplantation, respectively) and one patient with concomitant arterial hypertension (a woman aged 48, 5.5 years after heart transplantation) presented with a symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Three of the patients were on tacrolimus immunosuppression, and both female patients were additionally on therapy with mycophenolate mofetil, which was discontinued following the diagnosis of infection. One male patient received combined therapy of cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil. The 60-year-old woman presented with gastrointestinal manifestations of the COVID-19 infection which were of moderate severity. The recovery was achieved. The 59-year-old man presented with myocardial infarction, exacerbated renal insufficiency that required hemodialysis and cardiorespiratory failure complicated by bacterial sepsis. As a result, the patient died. The 83-year-old male patient reporting fever, myalgia, fatigue, cough and dyspnea was admitted to hospital and deceased due to septic shock two days after admission. The 48-year old woman who presented with mild symptoms of the upper respiratory tract infection recovered after two weeks. Symptomatic treatment was used in all the patients. Another male patient (aged 45 years, 8 years after orthotopic heart transplant with no significant comorbidities) was an asymptomatic carrier of SARS-CoV-2 and remained under hospital care. Conclusions: Of 552 patients after orthotopic heart transplantation, two SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were reported.","Kuczaj, Agnieszka; Malyszek, Justyna; Trzcinska, Iwona; Zembala, Michal; Przybylowski, Piotr",Przegl Epidemiol,212,24

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial mediators and regulators of host immunity and the role of human cell surface TLRs in SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory pathogenesis has been demonstrated recently. However, the functional significance of the human intracellular TLRs including TLR3, 7, 8, and 9 is yet unclear. Hitherto, the involvement of these intracellular TLRs in inducing pro-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 has been reported but the identity of the interacting viral RNA molecule(s) and the corresponding TLRs have not been explored. This study hopes to rationalize the comparative binding of the major SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs to the intracellular TLRs, considering the solvent-based force-fields operational in the cytosolic aqueous microenvironment that predominantly drives these interactions. Our in silico study on the binding of all mRNAs with the intracellular TLRs depicts that the mRNA of NSP10, S2, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are possible virus-associated molecular patterns that bind to TLR3, TLR9, and TLR7, respectively, and trigger downstream cascade reactions. Intriguingly, binding of the viral mRNAs resulted in variable degrees of conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain of the TLRs ratifying the activation of the downstream inflammatory signaling cascade. Taken together, the current study is the maiden report to describe the role of TLR3, 7, and 9 in COVID-19 immunobiology and these could serve as useful targets for the conception of a therapeutic strategy against the pandemic.","Choudhury, Abhigyan; Das, Nabarun Chandra; Patra, Ritwik; Mukherjee, Suprabhat",J Med Virol,212,19

Currently, in Germany >140 000 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed. Here we report a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the pediatric dialysis unit of the University Hospital Münster (UHM). METHODS: Single-step real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs was used to diagnose the index patient and identify infected contacts. Epidemiological links were analyzed by patient interviews and medical record reviews. In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of all positive test results were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. RESULTS: Forty-eight cases were involved in this nosocomial outbreak. Nine contact cases developed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections. Two SARS-CoV-2-positive cases remained clinically asymptomatic. Eleven cases reported flulike symptoms without positive results. Ct values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Person-to-person transmission was at the heart of a hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients in the pediatric dialysis unit at UHM. Semiquantitative rRT-PCR results suggest that individuals with high viral load pose a risk to spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. Our epidemiological observation highlights the need to develop strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the hospital setting.","Schwierzeck, Vera; König, Jens Christian; Kühn, Joachim; Mellmann, Alexander; Correa-Martínez, Carlos Luis; Omran, Heymut; Konrad, Martin; Kaiser, Thomas; Kampmeier, Stefanie",Clin Infect Dis,212,16

METHODS: This was a study of a pilot pathway performed at Barts Heart Centre for the admission of patients requiring elective coronary and structural procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-June 2020). All patients on coronary and structural waiting lists were screened for procedural indications, urgency and adverse features for COVID-19 prognosis and discussed at dedicated multidisciplinary teams. Dedicated admission pathways involving preadmission isolation, additional consent, COVID-19 PCR testing and dedicated clean areas were used. RESULTS: 143 patients (101 coronary and 42 structural) underwent procedures (coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, transcatheter aortic valve intervention and MitralClip) during the study period. The average age was 68.2; 74% were male; and over 93% had one or more moderate COVID-19 risk factors. All patients were COVID-19 PCR negative on admission with (8.1%) COVID-19 antibody positive (swab negative). All procedures were performed successfully with low rates of procedural complications (9.8%). At 2-week follow-up, no patients had symptoms or confirmed COVID-19 infection with significant improvements in quality if life and symptoms. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that patients undergoing coronary and structural procedures can be safely admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with no patients contracting COVID-19 during their admission. Reassuringly, patients reflective of typical practice, that is, those at moderate or higher risk, were treated successfully.

The determination of the factors affecting transmission rate is urgent and crucial to combat COVID-19. Here we explored variation of R t between 277 regions across the globe and the associated potential socioeconomic, demographic and environmental factors. At global scale, the R t started to decrease approximately two weeks after policy interventions initiated. This lag from the date of policy interventions initiation to the date when R t started to decrease ranges from 9 to 19 days, largest in Europe and North America. We find that proportion of elderly people or life expectancy can explain 50% of variation in transmission rate across the 277 regions. The transmission rate at the point of inflection (R I ) increases by 29.4% (25.2-34.0%) for 1% uptick in the proportion of people aged above 65, indicating elderly people face ~2.5 times higher infection risk than younger people. Air temperature is negatively correlated with transmission rate, which is mainly attributed to collinearities between air temperature and demographic factors. Our model predicted that temperature sensitivity of R I is only -2.7% (-5.2 - 0%) per °C after excluding collinearities between air temperature and demographic factors. This low temperature sensitivity of R I suggests that a warm summer is unlikely to impede the spread of COVID-19 naturally.","Su, Ming; Peng, Shushi; Chen, Lili; Wang, Bin; Wang, Ying; Fan, Xiarui; Dong, Zhaomin",Geohealth,212,11

Most of the studied variables: gender, age, academic degree, household occupants, having a disease, teaching level, teaching mode, work hours, resilience, teaching anxiety and preparedness, and fear of being an asymptomatic patient (FOBAP), showed significant statistical correlation between each other (p < 0.050) and to the 6 areas of the ACSS (danger, contamination, social economical, xenophobia, traumatic stress, and compulsive checking). Our results further showed that the perceived stress and anxiety fell into the category of Absent to Mild, with only the danger section of the ACSS falling into the Moderate category.

The proposed risk and opportunity assessment model is an effective tool to identify the CSR initiative advantages and drawbacks, as well as a starting point for managing them, to maximize chances and minimize threats. Three examples of practical applications of the proposed model confirm that it can be successfully used in practice. The developed model is based on universal assumptions and criteria, so that it can be used in any country struggling with the pandemic.","Krechowicz, Maria Kiliańska Katarzyna",Sustainability,212,0

Little is known about how this tempest of neural activity restructuring impacts the stability of network states in recurrent cortical circuits. To investigate this issue, we reanalyzed data in which we recorded for 14 days via population calcium imaging the activity of the same neural populations of pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 and layer 5 of forelimb motor and pre-motor cortex in mice during the daily learning of a lever-press task. We found that motor cortex network states remained stable with respect to the critical network state during the extensive reorganization of both neural population activity and its relation to lever movement throughout learning. Specifically, layer 2/3 cortical circuits unceasingly displayed robust evidence for operating at the critical network state, a regime that maximizes information capacity and transmission, and provides a balance between network robustness and flexibility. In contrast, layer 5 circuits operated away from the critical network state for all 14 days of recording and learning. In conclusion, this result indicates that the wide-ranging malleability of synapses, neurons, and neural connectivity during learning operates within the constraint of a stable and layer-specific network state regarding dynamic criticality, and suggests that different cortical layers operate under distinct constraints because of their specialized goals.","Ma, Zhengyu; Liu, Haixin; Komiyama, Takaki; Wessel, Ralf",J. neurophysiol,212,21

This study assesses changes in health behaviours during the early stages of the pandemic and examines socio-demographic disparities associated with these changes. METHODS: We analyze data on adults age 25 and older (N = 4383) from the public-use Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1: Impacts of COVID-19 (CPSS-COVID). Multinomial regression models assess the association between demographic and socio-economic characteristics with increases or decreases in six health behaviours: alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use, junk food consumption, and TV and internet screen time. RESULTS: While findings varied across the six behaviours, overall, there was an increase in negative health behaviours: 14% of Canadian adults reported increasing their alcohol use (95% CI = 0.12, 0.15), 25% increased their junk food consumption (95% CI = 0.23, 0.27), and over 60% increased their screen time (62%, 95% CI = 0.60, 0.65 for TV and 66%, 95% CI = 0.63, 0.68 for internet). Younger and Canada-born adults were more likely to increase negative health behaviours than older and immigrant Canadians. Adults who reported financial impact of COVID-19 were more likely to increase all negative health behaviours (e.g., for increased junk food consumption, the relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.49, 2.20 relative to group reporting no impact). CONCLUSION: Our study documents the overall deterioration of health behaviours during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. To minimize long-term harm to the Canadian population's health, the results highlight the need to tailor interventions, especially for younger Canadians, and the importance of mitigating financial impacts, which are linked to negative changes in health behaviours.","Zajacova, Anna; Jehn, Anthony; Stackhouse, Matthew; Denice, Patrick; Ramos, Howard",Can J Public Health,212,20

Materials and Methods: A total of 24 previously untreated LAHNC patients were randomized into SIB (n= 11) and SEQB (n = 13) arms. The planning computed tomography data set was transferred to the treatment planning system. All the target volumes and organ at risk volumes were delineated. Single plan for SIB group and three plans (three phases) were generated for SEQB group of patients. Radiobiological and dosimetric parameters were compared. Results: The BED10(planned) value for high-risk (HR) planning target volume (PTV) was same in both groups, whereas for intermediate-risk (IR) PTV and low-risk (LR) PTV, the values were higher in SEQB arm than SIB arm. The V95 values were 100% for all the target volumes in both arms of patients. The average D100 value for gross target volume, HR PTV, and IR PTV was higher in SEQB arm than that in the SIB arm. The average D100 value for LR PTV was higher in the SIB arm compared to that of the SEQB arm. The BED10(achieved) was calculated using D100 values of target volumes. The difference of BED10(achieved) values between SEQB arm and SIB arm further increased than the BED10(planned) values for all target volumes. The maximum doses for spinal cord, spinal cord planning risk volume, and brain stem were within the tolerance dose in both groups of patients. The left and right parotid glands sparing was comparable in both groups of patients. Average integral dose was higher in the SIB group than SEQB group. The average total monitor unit per fraction was higher in the SEQB arm than that in the SIB arm. Conclusion: SIB regimen may be considered as more logical and efficient over SEQB regimen in the treatment of LAHNC with comparable radiobiological and dosimetric parameters.","Mandal, Abhijit; Choudhary, Sunil; Mani, Nilesh; Aggarwal, Sushil Kumar",J Cancer Res Ther,212,20

Autopsy-based reports describe diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), organizing pneumonia, and fibrotic change, but data on early pathologic changes and during progression of the disease are rare.

We took transbronchial biopsy (TBB) specimens at different time points and autopsy tissue samples for histopathologic and ultrastructural evaluation after the patients’ death. RESULTS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization in all TBBs. Lung histology showed reactive pneumocytes and capillary congestion in one patient who died shortly after hospital admission with detectable virus in one of two lung autopsy samples. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in two of two autopsy samples from another patient with a fulminant course and very short latency between biopsy and autopsy, showing widespread organizing DAD. In a third patient with a prolonged course, autopsy samples showed extensive fibrosis without detectable virus. CONCLUSIONS: We report the course of COVID-19 in paired biopsy specimens and autopsies, illustrating vascular, organizing, and fibrotic patterns of COVID-19–induced lung injury. Our results suggest an early spread of SARS-CoV-2 from the upper airways to the lung periphery with diminishing viral load during disease.","Gagiannis, Daniel; Umathum, Vincent Gottfried; Bloch, Wilhelm; Rother, Conn; Stahl, Marcel; Witte, Hanno Maximilian; Djudjaj, Sonja; Boor, Peter; Steinestel, Konrad",Am J Clin Pathol,212,1

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and the correlates with the occurrence of PE as well as the association between PE and the risk of mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter study on consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized at 7 Italian Hospitals. At admission, all patients underwent medical history, laboratory and echocardiographic evaluation. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 224 patients (mean age 69 ± 14, male sex 62%); PE was diagnosed in 32 cases (14%). Patients with PE were hospitalized after a longer time since symptoms onset (7 IQR 3–11 days, 3 IQR 1–6 days; p = 0.001) and showed higher D-dimers level (1819 IQR 568–5017 ng/ml vs 555 IQR 13–1530 ng/ml; p < 0.001) and higher prevalence of myocardial injury(47% vs 28%, p = 0.033). At multivariable analysis, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE; HR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.66–0.98; p = 0.046) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP; HR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.03–1.23; p = 0.008) resulted the only parameters independently associated with PE occurrence. Mortality rates (50% vs 27%; p = 0.010) and cardiogenic shock (37% vs 14%; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in PE as compared with non-PE patients. At multivariate analysis PE was significant associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: PE is relatively common complication in COVID-19 and is associated with increased mortality risk. TAPSE and sPAP resulted the only parameters independently associated with PE occurrence in COVID-19 patients.","Scudiero, Fernando; Silverio, Angelo; Di Maio, Marco; Russo, Vincenzo; Citro, Rodolfo; Personeni, Davide; Cafro, Andrea; D'Andrea, Antonello; Attena, Emilio; Pezzullo, Salvatore; Canonico, Mario Enrico; Galasso, Gennaro; Pitì, Antonino; Parodi, Guido",Thromb Res,212,30

METHODS: Prospective case series, which included patients, diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and positive autoantibodies against type I IFNs in two French intensive care units (ICUs) between October 8 and November 14, 2020. Six critically ill COVID-19 patients with no anti-IFN antibodies were used as controls. Anti-IFN autoantibodies and IFN concentrations, together with the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, were measured sequentially in serum. Viral load was determined in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Patients were followed during hospital stay. RESULTS: Three men and one woman were included. Three of the patients had four PE sessions each, while another had three PE sessions. PE decreased the concentrations of autoantibodies against type I IFN in all four patients, whereas anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels remained stable. Autoantibodies against type I IFN levels were high in tracheal aspirates of one patient and decreased after three PE sessions. By contrast, anti-IFN autoantibodies were not detected in tracheal aspirates from five control patients without detectable anti-IFN autoantibodies in serum. During PE, serum IFN-α levels slightly increased in three out of four patients, and upper respiratory tract viral load decreased in all patients. All patients were alive at day 28 of ICU admission. Two patients eventually died in the ICU, while the two survivors were discharged from the ICU at days 50 and 66. CONCLUSIONS: PE efficiently removes autoantibodies against type I IFNs, including those detected in tracheal aspirates, without affecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical benefit of PE in patients with autoantibodies against type I IFNs should be tested in a larger study.

In South Africa, the pandemic and the resultant national lockdown has highlighted the shortcomings in the protection and care of children. Children in alternative care are particularly at risk as a result of disrupted and uncoordinated service delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and impact of the pandemic and the resulting social isolation on the wellbeing and protection of children living in a residential care facility. Methods and participants: We used qualitative, participatory approaches – specifically draw-and-write methods – to engage with 32 children (average age = 13.5 years) living in a residential care facility in Gauteng. FINDINGS: Children in care demonstrated an awareness of the socio-economic difficulties facing communities in South Africa, and shared deep concerns about the safety, well-being and welfare of parents and siblings. Although they expressed frustration at the lack of contact with family members, they acknowledged the resources they had access to in a residential care facility, which enabled them to cope and which ensured their safety. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We focus our discussion on the necessity of a systemic response to child welfare, including a coordinated approach by policy makers, government departments and child welfare systems to address the structural factors at the root of inequality and inadequate, unacceptable care. This is essential not only during COVID-19 but also in pre- and post-pandemic context.","Haffejee, Sadiyya; Levine, Diane Thembekile",Child Abuse Negl,212,26

Early, targeted, comprehensive management approach can be essential. METHODS: A lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based antiviral treatment was administered to the patients with computed tomography (CT)-documented pneumonia. Medical records of patients with COVID-19, previously discharged or hospitalized for ≥ 21 days at the Seoul Medical Center from January 29 to April 15, 2020 were reviewed to analyze clinical and virological outcomes. Patients were divided into two groups (PCR-Negative conversion group vs. Non-negative conversion group and requiring oxygen group vs. Non-requiring oxygen group). RESULTS: In total, 136 patients with a mean age of 41.8 ± 18.2 years were included with median 3-day delay of hospitalization after illness. Thirteen (9.56%) were initially asymptomatic, and 5 (3.67%) were persistently asymptomatic. Eighty-five (62.5%) had CT-documented pneumonia, 94% of whom received LPV/r treatments. A total of 53 patients (38.97%) had negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results within 28 days. Eight (9.4%) out of 85 pneumonic patients received oxygen supplementation. Patients with initial lower respiratory symptoms showed significant delay in PCR negative conversion (> 28 days) (odds ratio [OR] 0.166; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.067–0.477; P < 0.001). However, antiviral treatment for pneumonic patients was significantly related with early conversion within 28 days (OR 3.049; 95% CI 1.128–8.243; P = 0.028). Increasing age increased the likelihood of oxygen supplementation requirement in the pneumonic patient group (OR 1.108; 95% CI 1.021–1.202; P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Early, pneumonia targeted LPV/r-based antiviral therapy resulted in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion of PCR within 28 days compared to symptomatic treatment.","Kim, Jongkyu; Jung, Jiwoong; Kim, Tae Ho; Kang, Naree; Choi, Hanzo; Oh, Dong Hyun; Ahn, Mi Young; Kim, Su hyun; Hahm, Chorom; Lee, Young Kyong; Park, Keunhong; Hong, Kiho; Choi, Jae-phil",BMC Infect Dis,212,33

DC-SIGNR is a C-type lectin that is frequently found on human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. LSECtin, which is a homologue of DC-SIGNR, has been demonstrated to participate in colon cancer liver metastasis. Due to the similarities in the expression pattern and structure of the two proteins, we speculated that DC-SIGNR could also be involved in this process. METHODS: Colon cancer cells were treated with the DC-SIGNR protein or control IgG, after which cell migration, invasion, and morphology were assayed. Xenograft mouse models were used to determine the role of DC-SIGNR in colon cancer liver metastasis in vivo. In addition, a human gene expression array was used to detect differential gene expression in colon cancer cells stimulated with the DC-SIGNR protein. The serum level of DC-SIGNR was examined in colon cancer patients by ELISA, and the significance of DC-SIGNR was determined. RESULTS: In our research, we investigated whether DC-SIGNR promotes colon cancer cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Knocking down mouse DC-SIGNR decreased the liver metastatic potency of colon cancer cells and increased survival time. Expressing human DC-SIGNR enhanced colon cancer liver metastasis. Furthermore, DC-SIGNR conferred metastatic capability on cancer cells by upregulating various metallothionein isoforms. To validate the above results, we also found that the serum DC-SIGNR level was statistically higher in colon cancer patients with liver metastasis compared with those without metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that DC-SIGNR may promote colon carcinoma hepatic metastasis and could serve as a promising therapeutic target for anticancer treatment.

Due to the heterogeneity of this disease, risk stratification and diagnosis remains challenging. Biochip-array technology provides an integrated high throughput method for analyzing blood plasma samples for the simultaneous measurement of multiple biomarkers for potential risk stratification. Using biochip-array method, this study aimed to quantify the inflammatory biomarkers such as interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in 109 clinically confirmed PE patients in comparison to the control group comprised of plasma samples collected from 48 healthy subjects. Cytokines IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1β, and MCP-1 demonstrated varying level of significant increase (P < 0.05) in massive-risk PE patients compared to submassive- and low-risk PE patients. The upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in PE patients observed in this study suggest that inflammation plays an important role in the overall pathophysiology of this disease. The application of biochip-array technology may provide a useful approach to evaluate these biomarkers to understand the pathogenesis and risk stratification of PE patients.","Bontekoe, Emily; Brailovsky, Yevgeniy; Hoppensteadt, Debra; Bontekoe, Jack; Siddiqui, Fakiha; Newman, Joshua; Iqbal, Omer; Reed, Trent; Fareed, Jawed; Darki, Amir",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,212,3

We explore how the timing and effectiveness of control measures in the UK, Sweden and Denmark shaped COVID-19 mortality in each country, using a counterfactual assessment: what would the impact have been, had each country adopted the others’ policies? Using a Bayesian semi-mechanistic model without prior assumptions on the mechanism or effectiveness of interventions, we estimate the time-varying reproduction number for the UK, Sweden and Denmark from daily mortality data. We use two approaches to evaluate counterfactuals which transpose the transmission profile from one country onto another, in each country’s first wave from 13th March (when stringent interventions began) until 1st July 2020. UK mortality would have approximately doubled had Swedish policy been adopted, while Swedish mortality would have more than halved had Sweden adopted UK or Danish strategies. Danish policies were most effective, although differences between the UK and Denmark were significant for one counterfactual approach only. Our analysis shows that small changes in the timing or effectiveness of interventions have disproportionately large effects on total mortality within a rapidly growing epidemic.","Mishra, Swapnil; Scott, James A.; Laydon, Daniel J.; Flaxman, Seth; Gandy, Axel; Mellan, Thomas A.; Unwin, H.

This study aimed to assess Palestinian HCWs' willingness to work and the related factors as well as to explore their ethical dilemmas during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and Methods: Quantitative (survey questionnaire) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews) data were collected. Frontline HCWs (n = 550) received an online survey link via closed institutional networks. Frequencies summarized the data, and chi-square compared variables and outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs) and multivariable analysis examined predictors for willingness to work. Fifteen HCWs (physicians, nurses, and lab and radiology technicians) were purposefully sampled and agreed to interviews to explore their thoughts, motivations, and worries. Thematic analysis focused on ethical dilemmas to enhance the breadth and the depth of the study. Results: Almost 25% of surveyed HCWs were not willing to work during the pandemic. Logistic model results showed that physicians and nurses had higher willingness to work than others (p = 0.004, Adj. OR = 3.5). Lower stress levels and longer professional experience were predictors of more willing to work (p = 0.03, Adj. OR = 2.5; p = 0.03, Adj. OR = 2.6, respectively). Interviews showed that willingness to work did not preclude HCWs from fulfilling their duties despite grueling workloads and grave fears about safety and security. HCWs felt poorly prepared, unappreciated, and frustrated by unfair work distribution. The occupation presented additional safety issues. Conclusion: Physicians and nurses were more likely to comply with a commitment to their professional ethics and the duty or obligation to work. Stress levels could be mitigated in the future with better leadership, adding supports to address mental health and psychosocial challenges to enhance HCWs' well-being and improve quality of care. The realities of the occupation added additional threats and uncertainty.","Maraqa, Beesan; Nazzal, Zaher; Zink, Therese",Front Med (Lausanne),212,1

While many infectious causes of diarrhea have been established, approximately 40% of all diarrhea cases are of unknown etiology. In an effort to identify novel viruses that may be causal agents of diarrhea, we used high throughput mass sequencing to analyze stool samples collected from patients with acute diarrhea. RESULTS: Sequences with limited similarity to known picornaviruses were detected in a stool sample collected in Australia from a child with acute diarrhea. Using a combination of mass sequencing, RT-PCR, 5' RACE and 3' RACE, a 6383 bp fragment of the viral genome was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this virus was highly divergent from, but most closely related to, members of the genus Kobuvirus. We have tentatively named this novel virus klassevirus 1. We also detected klassevirus 1 by RT-PCR in a diarrhea specimen collected from a patient in St. Louis, United States as well as in untreated sewage collected in Barcelona, Spain. CONCLUSION: Klassevirus 1 is a previously undescribed picornavirus that is globally widespread and present on at least three continents.

Ursonic acid (UNA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid extracted from certain medicinal herbs such as Ziziphus jujuba. Since the pharmacological effects and associated mechanisms of UNA are not well-known, in this work, we attempt to introduce the therapeutic potential of UNA with a comparison to ursolic acid (ULA), a well-known secondary metabolite, for beneficial effects. UNA has a keto group at the C-3 position, which may provide a critical difference for the varied biological activities between UNA and ULA. Several studies previously showed that UNA exerts pharmaceutical effects similar to, or stronger than, ULA, with UNA significantly decreasing the survival and proliferation of various types of cancer cells. UNA has potential to exert inhibitory effects in parasitic protozoa that cause several tropical diseases. UNA also exerts other potential effects, including antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant activities. Of note, a recent study highlighted the suppressive potential of UNA against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular modifications of UNA may enhance bioavailability, which is crucial for in vivo and clinical studies. In conclusion, UNA has promising potential to be developed in anticancer and antiprotozoan pharmaceuticals.

Social media use has been demonstrated to play a role in the low acceptance of vaccines. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the topics and sentiments in the public COVID-19 vaccine–related discussion on social media and discern the salient changes in topics and sentiments over time to better understand the public perceptions, concerns, and emotions that may influence the achievement of herd immunity goals. METHODS: Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, the day the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to January 31, 2021. We used R software to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained the keywords vaccination, vaccinations, vaccine, vaccines, immunization, vaccinate, and vaccinated. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 1,499,421 unique tweets from 583,499 different users. We used R to perform latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling as well as sentiment and emotion analysis using the National Research Council of Canada Emotion Lexicon. RESULTS: Topic modeling of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines yielded 16 topics, which were grouped into 5 overarching themes. Opinions about vaccination (227,840/1,499,421 tweets, 15.2%) was the most tweeted topic and remained a highly discussed topic during the majority of the period of our examination. Vaccine progress around the world became the most discussed topic around August 11, 2020, when Russia approved the world’s first COVID-19 vaccine. With the advancement of vaccine administration, the topic of instruction on getting vaccines gradually became more salient and became the most discussed topic after the first week of January 2021. Weekly mean sentiment scores showed that despite fluctuations, the sentiment was increasingly positive in general. Emotion analysis further showed that trust was the most predominant emotion, followed by anticipation, fear, sadness, etc. The trust emotion reached its peak on November 9, 2020, when Pfizer announced that its vaccine is 90% effective. CONCLUSIONS: Public COVID-19 vaccine–related discussion on Twitter was largely driven by major events about COVID-19 vaccines and mirrored the active news topics in mainstream media. The discussion also demonstrated a global perspective. The increasingly positive sentiment around COVID-19 vaccines and the dominant emotion of trust shown in the social media discussion may imply higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines compared with previous vaccines.","Lyu, Joanne Chen; Han, Eileen Le; Luli, Garving K",J Med Internet Res,212,21

The PEG IFN vs SOC arm results for the proportion of subjects with a 2-point improvement were 80.36% vs 68.18%, (P=0.037) on Day 8; 91.60% vs 92.56%, (P= 0.781) on Day 11; and, 94.12% vs 95.93%, (P=0.515) on Day 15. There was a time dependent decrease in the biomarkers in both the arms, no clinically significant changes in lab parameters, and the safety profile was similar. CONCLUSION: PEG IFN-α2b induced early viral clearance, improved the clinical status and decreased the duration of supplemental oxygen. It provides a viable treatment option and can limit the spread of virus.","L, Shashi Bhushan B; Wanve, Sunil; Koradia, Parshottam; Bhomia, Vinay; Soni, Pravin; Chakraborty, Sisir; Khobragade, Akash; Joshi, Shashank; Mendiratta, Sanjeev Kumar; Kansagra, Kevin Kumar; Parihar, Anurag; Sharma, Sunil; Patel, Jatin",Int J Infect Dis,212,2

OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between remdesivir treatment and survival and length of hospital stay among people hospitalized with COVID-19 in routine care settings. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to identify adult patients in 123 VHA hospitals who had a first hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from May 1 to October 8, 2020. Propensity score matching of patients initiating remdesivir treatment to control patients who had not initiated remdesivir treatment by the same hospital day was used to create the analytic cohort. EXPOSURES: Remdesivir treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Time to death within 30 days of remdesivir treatment initiation (or corresponding hospital day for matched control individuals) and time to hospital discharge with time to death as a competing event. Associations between remdesivir treatment and these outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression in the matched cohort. RESULTS: The initial cohort included 5898 patients admitted to 123 hospitals, 2374 (40.3%) of whom received remdesivir treatment (2238 men [94.3%]; mean [SD] age, 67.8 [12.8] years) and 3524 (59.7%) of whom never received remdesivir treatment (3302 men [93.7%]; mean [SD] age, 67.0 [14.4] years). After propensity score matching, the analysis included 1172 remdesivir recipients and 1172 controls, for a final matched cohort of 2344 individuals. Remdesivir recipients and matched controls were similar with regard to age (mean [SD], 66.6 [14.2] years vs 67.5 [14.1] years), sex (1101 men [93.9%] vs 1101 men [93.9%]), dexamethasone use (559 [47.7%] vs 559 [47.7%]), admission to the intensive care unit (242 [20.7%] vs 234 [19.1%]), and mechanical ventilation use (69 [5.9%] vs 45 [3.8%]). Standardized differences were less than 10% for all measures. Remdesivir treatment was not associated with 30-day mortality (143 remdesivir recipients [12.2%] vs 124 controls [10.6%]; log rank P = .26; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.83-1.36). Results were similar for people receiving vs not receiving dexamethasone at remdesivir initiation (dexamethasone recipients: adjusted HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.64-1.35; nonrecipients: adjusted HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.84-1.69). Remdesivir recipients had a longer median time to hospital discharge compared with matched controls (6 days [interquartile range, 4-12 days] vs 3 days [interquartile range, 1-7 days]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19, remdesivir treatment was not associated with improved survival but was associated with longer hospital stays. Routine use of remdesivir may be associated with increased use of hospital beds while not being associated with improvements in survival.","Ohl, Michael E.; Miller, Donald R.; Lund, Brian C.; Kobayashi, Takaaki; Richardson Miell, Kelly; Beck, Brice F.; Alexander, Bruce; Crothers, Kristina; Vaughan Sarrazin, Mary S.",JAMA Netw Open,212,16

Models of disease transmission through networks of contacts–between individuals or between population centres–are increasingly used for these purposes. Real-world contact networks are rich in structural features that influence infection transmission, such as tightly-knit local communities that are weakly connected to one another. In this paper, we propose a new flow-based edge-betweenness centrality method for detecting bottleneck edges that connect nodes in contact networks. In particular, we utilize convex optimization formulations based on the idea of diffusion with p-norm network flow. Using simulation models of COVID-19 transmission through real network data at both individual and county levels, we demonstrate that targeting bottleneck edges identified by the proposed method reduces the number of infected cases by up to 10% more than state-of-the-art edge-betweenness methods. Furthermore, the proposed method is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.","Yang, Shenghao; Senapati, Priyabrata; Wang, Di; Bauch, Chris T.; Fountoulakis, Kimon",PLoS Comput Biol,212,1

The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality among patients receiving haemodialysis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to explore the contributing predictors. METHODS: A cross-sectional and descriptive correlational design using Qualtrics software was performed. Data were collected using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the predictors that were associated with fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients undergoing haemodialysis who participated, 53.7% (n = 66) reported fatigue, 43.9% (n = 54) reported anxiety, 33.3% (n = 41) reported depression and 56.9% (n = 70) reported poor sleep. Fatigue, anxiety and sleep quality (P < .05) were significantly associated with being female, and whether family members or relatives were suspected or confirmed with COVID-19. Logistic regression showed that being within the age group 31–40, having a secondary education level, anxiety, depression and sleep quality were the main predictors affecting the fatigue group. CONCLUSION: Fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality are significant problems for patients receiving haemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate interventions to monitor and reduce fatigue, psychological problems and sleep quality amongst these patients are needed. This can help to strengthen preparations for responding to possible future outbreaks or pandemics of infectious diseases for patients receiving haemodialysis.","Al Naamani, Zakariya; Gormley, Kevin; Noble, Helen; Santin, Olinda; Al Maqbali, Mohammed",BMC Nephrol,212,10

To control the spread of COVID-19, the production of effective vaccines is likely to be one of the best solutions. However, vaccination hesitancy may decrease individuals’ willingness to get vaccinated. The Drivers of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale (DrVac-COVID19S) was recently developed to help healthcare professionals and researchers better understand vaccination acceptance. The present study examined whether DrVac-COVID19S is measurement invariant across different subgroups (Taiwanese vs. mainland Chinese university students; males vs. females; and health-related program majors vs. non-health-related program majors). Taiwanese (n = 761; mean age = 25.51 years; standard deviation (SD) = 6.42; 63.5% females) and mainland Chinese university students (n = 3145; mean age = 20.72 years; SD = 2.06; 50.2% females) were recruited using an online survey between 5 January and 21 February 2021. Factor structure and measurement invariance of the two DrVac-COVID19S scales (nine-item and 12-item) were tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).

Healthcare educators need to balance the relatively high cost to deliver simulation education with the potential impact on healthcare quality. It is unclear how to prioritize simulation in critical care education, especially considering interprofessional needs across adult and pediatric populations. The objective of this study was to prioritize topics for critical care educators developing simulation-based educational interventions. Methodology A modified Delphi process was used to identify and prioritize critical care topics taught using simulation. We disseminated a multi-institutional survey to understand critical care simulation topics using a three-round modified Delphi technique. An expert panel was recruited based on their expertise with simulation-based education through the Society for Simulation in Healthcare and the Society of Critical Care Medicine lists. Critical care topics originated using content derived from multiple critical care board examination contents. Additional content for a critical care simulation-based curriculum was generated. Results Consensus and prioritization were achieved in three rounds, with 52 simulation experts participating. The first Delphi round surveyed priority topics in critical care content and generated additional topics for inclusion in round two. The second Delphi round added the content with the highest-ranked items from round one to generate a set of simulation-based topic priorities. The third Delphi round asked participants to determine the importance of each priority item taught via simulation compared to other modalities for clinical education. This round yielded 106 topics over four domains categorized into (1) Diagnosis and Management of Clinical Problems, (2) Procedural Skills, (3) Teamwork and Communication Skills, and (4) General Knowledge and Knowledge of Technical Adjuncts. Conclusions The modified Delphi survey revealed a prioritized, consensus-based list of topics and domains for critical care educators to focus on when creating a simulation-based critical care curriculum.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the orthodontic team at Croydon University Hospital introduced the use of video consultations to provide continued patient care at a time when face-to-face appointments were not possible. Aim To assess patient and clinician satisfaction with the Attend Anywhere video consultations used by the orthodontic team at Croydon University Hospital. Method Two separate satisfaction questionnaires were piloted and developed: one for patients and one for clinicians. All patients scheduled for a video consultation between 15 May 2020 and 15 June 2020 were invited to complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire at the end of their consultation. Results In total, 114 patients attended video consultations in the time period assessed, of which 111 completed a satisfaction questionnaire (97.4% response rate). Fifty-six percent of patients were female with an average age of 16.5 years. Patient satisfaction was highest for the video consultations being easy to use and convenient. Over 90% of patients strongly agreed or agreed with all of the satisfaction statements and in terms of whether they would recommend using video consultations. Approximately one-third of patients preferred the video consultation to a face-to-face appointment and one-third of patients were neutral. Conclusion This study found high levels of patient satisfaction with video consultations in orthodontics.

However, constraints of this setting pose barriers for implementing treatment. For interventions to be successful, they need to take into consideration the perspectives of stakeholders. As such, the purpose of this study was to examine in-depth primary care providers’ perspective of challenges to identifying and managing eating disorders in the primary care setting. METHODS: This mixed methods study surveyed 60 Pediatric and Family Medicine providers across 6 primary care practices. Sixteen of these providers were further interviewed using a qualitative, semi-structured interview. RESULTS: Providers (n = 60, response rate of 45%) acknowledged the potential of primary care as a point of contact for early identification and treatment of pediatric eating disorders. They also expressed that this was an area of need in their practices. They identified numerous barriers to successful implementation of evidence-based treatment in this setting including scarcity of time, knowledge, and resources.

This method was developed to comply with safety measures imposed during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic to reduce the risk of viral exposure and transmission. Here, we present one example where a telesimulation naïve facilitator was trained as an in-person facilitator to enable the in-situ medical student and resident learners to participate in a pediatric emergency simulation exercise remotely guided by an off-site content expert. The case of neonatal shock was run five times during a half-day emergency department (ED) educational program with one to four participants per session. 14/15 (93%) participants completed evaluations and felt that the simulation met the case learning objectives and that connecting with the remote facilitator was useful for their learning. Feedback from the one newly trained in-person facilitator was that the tool was easy to learn how to use quickly, and the process of connecting with a remote expert was worthwhile for learners. To grab this web-based toolkit off the proverbial shelf and successfully run a telesimulation session from start to finish took approximately one hour; 20 minutes were spent in preparation the day prior and 40 minutes to set up and run the simulations the day of.

During routine dental procedures, they are exposed to aerosol and splatter. These airborne particles pose a great risk of transmitting contagious infections to health care workers and patients, especially in an era of social distancing due to COVID-19. The current study was conducted to evaluate contamination amount, duration, the distance of aerosol, and splatter produced after cavity preparation using a two-hole and four-hole handpiece. The study was performed on a dental manikin in a dental simulation laboratory at the College of Dentistry, King Faisal University Al Ahsa. The dental manikin was set to a reclined position to simulate the clinical operatory position of the patient for dental restorative procedures. Aerosol and splatter were collected on Grade 1 qualitative cotton cellulose filter paper. These were placed on adhesive tape extending from the headrest of the dental manikin in six different directions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 o’clock) for up to 60 inches and on certain positions of the operator and assistant such as the chest, head, forearms, upper leg, and inside facemask. Class V cavity preparation was done by the principal investigator at a specific time of 3 min on tooth #11 using a two-hole high-speed handpiece, then on the next day, Class V cavity preparation was performed on tooth #21 by a four-hole handpiece. High volume suction was used throughout the cavity preparation. Immediately after cavity preparation, the first filter paper disc was replaced with new ones in all positions. The second set of filter papers was removed after 30 min. Transparent grids were used to count the contamination area on the filter paper disc. No statistically significant difference was found in the mean amount of aerosol and splatter produced by both handpieces, however, a statistically significant difference was found in an amount of aerosol and splatter produced at a 12, 24, and 36 inches distance immediately after cavity preparation and 30 min after cavity preparation, regardless of the type of handpiece used. It is advisable to refrain from removing the personal protective barriers immediately after the procedure within the vicinity of the dental practice. The use of other adjuncts such as high volume suction to reduce the spread of aerosol and splatter is also recommended.","Ahmed, Muhammad Adeel; Jouhar, Rizwan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,212,1

The member genera include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, Torovirus, and Bafinivirus. The members of the family Coronaviridae are enveloped and positive stranded RNA viruses of three classes of vertebrates, which include corona- and toroviruses for mammals, coronaviruses for birds, and bafiniviruses for fishes. The nucleocapsids are helical and can be released from the virion by treatment with detergents. Where the coronavirus nucleocapsid appears to be loosely wound, those of the Torovirinae are distinctively tubular. The entire replication cycle takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the production of full-length and subgenome-sized (sg) minus-strand RNA intermediates with the viral genome serving both as mRNA for the replicase polyproteins and as a template for minus-strand synthesis. Members of the family Coronaviridae all seem to share two envelope protein species, the membrane (M) and spike (S) proteins. Similarities in size, predicted structures and presumed function(s) suggest a common ancestry, and the remote, but significant sequence similarities observed for toro-, bafini-, and (to lesser extent) coronavirus S proteins lend further support to this view.

The mqPCR panel was subsequently applied to 53 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from dogs with ME. The analytic sensitivity (i.e., limit of detection, expressed as molecules per 1 µL of recombinant vector) was 3.8 for CDV, 3.7 for Ehrlichia canis, 3.7 for Bartonella spp., 3.8 for Borrelia burgdorferi, 3.7 for Blastomyces dermatitidis, 3.7 for Cryptococcus spp., 38 for Neospora caninum, and 3.7 for Toxoplasma gondii. Among the tested CSF samples, seven (15%) were positive for the following pathogens in decreasing order of frequency: Cryptococcus spp. (3/7), Blastomyces dermatitidis (2/7), and Borrelia burgdorferi (2/7). In summary, use of an mqPCR panel with high analytic sensitivity as an initial screen for infectious agents in dogs with ME could facilitate the selection of early treatment strategies and improve outcomes.","Han, Jae-Ik; Chang, Dong-Woo; Na, Ki-Jeong",J Vet Sci,212,20

This perspective article draws on qualitative data from a longitudinal, ethnographic study of an Australian tertiary ED to illustrate the clinical and ethical challenges faced by EDs during PHEs. Interview data collected during the 2014 Ebola Virus Disease PHE of International Concern suggest that ED clinicians have a strong sense of professional responsibility, but this can be compromised by increased visibility of risk and sub‐optimal engagement from hospital managers and public health authorities. The study exposes the tension between a healthcare worker's right to protection and a duty to provide treatment. Given the narrow window of opportunity to prepare for a surge of COVID‐19 presentations, there is an immediate need to reflect and learn from previous experiences. To maintain the confidence of ED clinicians, and minimise the risk of moral injury, hospital and public health authorities must urgently develop processes to support ethical healthcare delivery and ensure adequate resourcing of EDs.","Markwell, Alexandra; Mitchell, Rob; Wright, April L; Brown, Anthony FT",Emerg Med Australas,212,21

A model of COVID-19 transmission dynamics is applied to assess the impact of antiviral treatment, testing, hospitalization, and social distancing. Under the assumption of “unlimited” resources, five control strategies involving social distancing, testing, hospitalization, and antiviral treatment are tested. Then these “optimal” policies are sought in the case of limited resources on behalf of a COVID-19 pandemic scenario. The amplitude of peak epidemics will often be minimized by executing strategies from the beginning of a pandemic, spreading the epidemics’ greatest impact over a longer time frame. Therefore, the timing and potency of control measures can reduce the pressure on the system during the top of the epidemic through the pandemic, decreasing the pressure on the healthcare infrastructure. In case of limited access to antiviral supplies, the role of testing, hospitalization, and social distancing strategies is emphasized in this study.","Hasan, Md.

When a new virus emerges, generally, little is known about it, and no vaccines or other pharmaceutical interventions are available. In the case of a person-to-person transmission virus with no vaccines or other pharmaceutical interventions, the only way to control the virus outbreak is by keeping a sustained physical distancing between the individuals. However, to adjust the level of the physical distancing accurately can be so complicated. Any level above the necessary can compromise the economic activity, and any level below can collapse the health care system. This work proposes a controller to keep the number of hospitalized individuals below a limit, and a new group-structured model to describe the COVID-19 outbreak. The proposed controller is robust to the uncertainties in the parameters of the model and keeps the number of infected individuals controlled only by adjusting the social distancing level. Numerical simulations, to show the behavior of the proposed controller and model, are done.","Dias, Samaherni; Queiroz, Kurios; Araujo, Aldayr",ISA Trans,212,12

The risk of bias of external validity quality of included studies was assessed by means of those the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The quality of the evidence for main outcomes was graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results and Conclusions: A total of 10 studies were selected. Physical activity levels were assessed by means of questionnaires (10 studies) and accelerometer (1 study). Risk of bias was regarded as low and high in six and four investigations, respectively. The quality of evidence was downgraded to low. A significant reduction of physical activity levels were observed in 9 studies. Compared to pre-lockdown values, five studies showed a reduction of light/mild physical activity (walking) between 32.5 and 365.5%, while seven studies revealed a reduction of high/vigorous physical activity between 2.9 and 52.8%. Walking, moderate, vigorous, and total physical activity levels have been reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic confinements in university students of different countries. Despite of the reductions, those who met the current minimum PA recommendations before the lockdown generally met the recommendations also during the confinements.","López-Valenciano, Alejandro; Suárez-Iglesias, David; Sanchez-Lastra, Miguel A.; Ayán, Carlos",Front Psychol,212,26

In this study, a PEDV strain named LNsy was successfully isolated in China. Phylogenetic analysis based on the whole genome revealed that PEDV LNsy belonged to the G2 subtype. For the first time, a unique four amino acids (4-aa) insertion was identified in the COE region of the spike (S) protein (residues 499–640), resulting in an extra alpha helix in the spatial structure of the COE region. To determine changes in virus-neutralization (VN) antibody reactivity of the virus, polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) against the S protein of different subtypes were used in a VN test. Both PAbs against the S protein of the G1 and G2 subtype showed reduced VN reactivity to PEDV LNsy. Further, recombination analyses revealed that PEDV LNsy was the result of recombination between PEDV GDS13 and GDS46 strains at the genomic breakpoints (nt 17,959-20,594 in the alignment) in the ORF1b gene of the genomes. Pathological examination showed gross morphological pathological changes in the gut, including significant villus atrophy and shedding of the infected piglets. These results indicated that a 4-aa insertion in the COE region of the S protein may have partly altered the profiles of VN antibodies and thus it will be important to develop vaccine candidates to resist wild virus infection and to monitor the genetic diversity of PEDV.","Ji, Zhaoyang; Shi, Da; Shi, Hongyan; Wang, Xiaobo; Chen, Jianfei; Liu, Jianbo; Ye, Dandan; Jing, Zhaoyang; Liu, Qiuge; Fan, Qianjin; Li, Mingwei; Cong, Guangyi; zhang, Jiyu; Han, Yuru; Zhang, Xin; Feng, Li",Vet Microbiol,212,29

This study presents a pioneer general model describing the most relevant physicochemical phenomena with a special effort to reduce the complicated algebra. This is performed both in the topology regime, introducing a discrete-continuous approach, and in the domain of independent variables, introducing a monodisperse moment method to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting population balance equations. The resulting simplified model consists of a large system of ordinary differential equations. A sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to some key parameters for a single pipe topology. Specific numerical techniques are employed for the integration of the model. Finally, a parametric case study for an indicative—yet realistic—sewerage piping system is performed to show how the model is applied to SARS-CoV-2 adsorption on wastewater solids in the presence of other competing species.

The variant has changes in critical sites of the spike protein with potential biological significance. Moreover, VOC-202012/01 has a mutation that inactivates the ORF8 protein, whose absence can change the clinical features of the infection. Why VOC-202012/01 is more transmissible remains unclear, but spike mutations and ORF8 inactivation stand out as candidates for research by their known phenotypic effects. Here I show that variants combining relevant spike mutations and the absence of ORF8 occurred in other SARS-CoV-2 or related viruses circulating in other host species. A truncated ORF8 (Q23stop) occurred in a SARS-CoV-2-related virus from a pangolin seized in China in 2017, also with several mutations in critical spike sites. Strikingly, I found that variants without ORF8 (E19stop) and with the N501T spike mutation circulated in farmed mink and humans from Denmark. Although with differences to VOC-202012/01, the identification of these variants highlights the danger of having reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses where more transmissible variants may occur and spill over to humans.","Pereira, Filipe",Gene,212,26

In previous work, we proposed a model that allows the provisioning of adapted interfaces based on users’ identity and their functional attributes to facilitate this task for software designers and developers. However, these identities and attributes are self-declared by the users, which may impact reliability and usability. In this work, we propose an extension of our model to resolve these deficiencies by delegating the identity and attributes’ provision to external certified entities. The European electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS) regulation established a solution to ensure the cross-border mutual recognition of Electronic Identification (eID) mechanisms among the European Member States. This research aims to provide an extension of this regulation mentioned above (eIDAS) to support functional attributes and connect our previously proposed model to this extended eIDAS network. Thanks to this proposal, web services can guarantee adapted and personalized interfaces while improving the functionalities offered without any previous configuration by users and, in a reliable way, since the functional attributes belong to the users’ official eID. As the attribute set provided by eIDAS nodes only contains citizens’ personal and legal ones, we also propose a mechanism to connect the eIDAS network to external attribute providers that could extend the eIDAS profile of users with their functional attributes. We deployed a pilot to validate the proposed model consisting of an identity provider, an eIDAS node supporting the extended reference code, and an attribute provider supporting functional attributes. We also designed and implemented a simple service that supports eID authentication and serves adapted interfaces based on the retrieved extended eIDAS profile. Finally, we developed an experience for getting feedback from a set of real users with different functional capabilities. According to the results, we concluded that the generalized adoption of the proposed solution in the European digital web services will significantly improve their accessibility in terms of ease of use and adaptability to users’ capacities.","Marco, Lourdes; Pozo, Alejandro; Huecas, Gabriel; Quemada, Juan; Alonso, Álvaro",Int J Environ Res Public Health,212,22

Transiting through CBs, snRNAs are apparently modified by scaRNPs. Indeed, Nopp140 knockdown-mediated release of scaRNPs from CBs severely compromises 2’-O-methylation of spliceosomal snRNAs, identifying CBs as the site of scaRNP catalysis. Additionally, alternative splicing patterns change indicating that these modifications in U1, U2, U5, and U12 snRNAs safeguard splicing fidelity.

Using five national samples from the UK (n = 1050 and n = 1150), Ireland (n = 700), the USA (n = 700), Spain (n = 700) and Mexico (n = 700), we examine predictors of belief in the most common statements about the virus that contain misinformation. We also investigate the prevalence of belief in COVID-19 misinformation across different countries and the role of belief in such misinformation in predicting relevant health behaviours. We find that while public belief in misinformation about COVID-19 is not particularly common, a substantial proportion views this type of misinformation as highly reliable in each country surveyed. In addition, a small group of participants find common factual information about the virus highly unreliable. We also find that increased susceptibility to misinformation negatively affects people's self-reported compliance with public health guidance about COVID-19, as well as people's willingness to get vaccinated against the virus and to recommend the vaccine to vulnerable friends and family. Across all countries surveyed, we find that higher trust in scientists and having higher numeracy skills were associated with lower susceptibility to coronavirus-related misinformation. Taken together, these results demonstrate a clear link between susceptibility to misinformation and both vaccine hesitancy and a reduced likelihood to comply with health guidance measures, and suggest that interventions which aim to improve critical thinking and trust in science may be a promising avenue for future research.","Roozenbeek, Jon; Schneider, Claudia R.; Dryhurst, Sarah; Kerr, John; Freeman, Alexandra L.

Through an in silico screen of ITIM-containing human proteins, we find that the S-located ITIM is closely related to a previously reported ITIM in the cytoplasmic tail of the human Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR), a pneumonia protective IL-6 family cytokine receptor. To infer potential functional interactions between SARS-CoV-2 infection and LIFR expression, we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of public datasets of lung tissues from healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients. We show that transcripts of LIFR and its ligand LIF are highly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible lung cells from mild and severe COVID-19 patients but not in healthy individuals. In addition, the human endogenous retroviral envelope gene (ERVW-1) encoding a fusogenic protein of the same functional class as the S protein, is induced in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible cell subpopulations in COVID-19 patients with no detectable expression in healthy individuals. We also report that pulmonary epithelial cells express transcripts of several immunoreceptors including the ITIM-containing antibody receptor FCGR2B which is detectable in healthy and severe COVID-19 cases but not in mild cases. These results suggest that molecular dysregulation of ITIM-mediated inhibitory signaling by the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may play a role in COVID-19 immunopathology.","Ngara, Mtakai; Siwo, Geoffrey Henry",bioRxiv,212,20

Co-cultivation of MHV-nonpermissive hamster BHK cells devoid of mouse Bgp with mouse DBT cells infected with MHV-A59 or JHMV induces syncytia formation on BHK cells (Bgp-independent fusion). This study shows the difference in Bgp-independent fusion activity among various MHV strains. Under a phase contrast microscopy, JHMV (cl-2, sp-4) induced the Bgp-independent syncytia on BHK cells similar to those observed on DBT cells, while such syncytia were not seen with the infection of other MHV strains (MHV-1, MHV-3, MHV-A59, MHV-S, srr7, srr11 and srr18). Tiny syncytia detectable only by immunofluorescence were produced with the latter MHV strains except for srr7 which failed to produce syncytia. MHVs except for srr7 grew in BHK cells after Bgp-independent infection. The Bgp-independent fusion by JHMV was inhibited either by anti-S1 or anti-S2 antibodies. These results showed that the JHMV spike protein had a remarkably high Bgp-independent fusion activity.","Taguchi, F.; Matsuyama, S.; Saeki, K.",Arch Virol,212,24

Many countries with low COVID-19 death rates have a common feature of eating large quantities of fermented vegetables such as cabbage and, in some continents, various spices. Fermented vegetables and spices are agonists of the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), and spices are transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 and vanillin 1 (TRPA1/V1) agonists. These mechanisms may explain many COVID-19 symptoms and severity. It appears that there is a synergy between Nrf2 and TRPA1/V1 foods that may explain the role of diet in COVID-19. One of the mechanisms of COVID-19 appears to be an oxygen species (ROS)-mediated process in synergy with TRP channels, modulated by Nrf2 pathways. Spicy foods are likely to desensitize TRP channels and act in synergy with exogenous antioxidants that activate the Nrf2 pathway.","Bousquet, Jean; Czarlewski, Wienczyslawa; Zuberbier, Torsten; Mullol, Joaquim; Blain, Hubert; Cristol, Jean-Paul; De La Torre, Rafael; Le Moing, Vincent; Pizarro Lozano, Nieves; Bedbrook, Anna; Agache, Ioana; Akdis, Cezmi A.; Canonica, G.

Using global line-list data on COVID-19 cases reported until 17th of March 2020 and global gridded weather data, we assessed the effects of air temperature and relative humidity on the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 local cases at the subnational level (first-level administrative divisions). After adjusting for surveillance capacity and time since first imported case, average temperature had a statistically significant, negative association with COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of −15°C and above. However, temperature only explained a relatively modest amount of the total variation in COVID-19 cases. The effect of relative humidity was not statistically significant. These results suggest that warmer weather may modestly reduce the rate of spread of COVID-19, but anticipation of a substantial decline in transmission due to temperature alone with onset of summer in the northern hemisphere, or in tropical regions, is not warranted by these findings.","Meyer, Anne; Sadler, Rohan; Faverjon, Céline; Cameron, Angus Robert; Bannister-Tyrrell, Melanie",Front Public Health,212,1

High antiviral potency and favorable pharmacokinetics parameters make some nucleoside analogs suitable also for the treatment of acute infections caused by other medically important RNA and DNA viruses. This review summarizes available information on antiviral research of nucleoside analogs against arthropod-borne members of the genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae, being primarily focused on description of nucleoside inhibitors of flaviviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, methyltransferase, and helicase/NTPase. Inhibitors of intracellular nucleoside synthesis and newly discovered nucleoside derivatives with high antiflavivirus potency, whose modes of action are currently not completely understood, have drawn attention. Moreover, this review highlights important challenges and complications in nucleoside analog development and suggests possible strategies to overcome these limitations.","Eyer, Luděk; Nencka, Radim; de Clercq, Erik; Seley-Radtke, Katherine; Růžek, Daniel",Antivir Chem Chemother,212,2

Using longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the efficacy of an environmental control educational intervention, we used generalized estimating equations and ordered logistic regression models to evaluate the relationship between caregiver social support (Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), and two child asthma outcomes: (a) medication adherence (Asthma Medication Ratio) and (b) asthma control. At baseline, 45.7% of the 208 children had very poorly controlled asthma. Nearly a third of caregivers (97% female) had clinically significant depressive symptoms at each data collection point. Social support was not associated with either asthma outcome nor did it moderate the relationship between depressive symptoms and child asthma outcomes. Higher caregiver depressive symptoms predicted decreased medication adherence (b=−0.003, SE 0.002). Moderate asthma at baseline (OR: 0.305, SE: 0.251), severe asthma at baseline (OR: 0.142, SE: 0.299), household income < $20,000 per year (OR: 0.505, SE: 0.333), and fall season (OR: 0.643, SE: 0.215) were associated with poorer asthma control. Attending to the social context of low-income, urban, Black children with asthma is critical to reduce asthma morbidity. Maternal depressive symptoms are modifiable and should be targeted in interventions to improve child asthma outcomes in this vulnerable population. The RCT was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01981564) in October 2013.","Margolis, Rachel H.F.; Dababnah, Sarah; Sacco, Paul; Jones-Harden, Brenda; Bollinger, Mary Elizabeth; Butz, Arlene; Bellin, Melissa H.",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,212,20
