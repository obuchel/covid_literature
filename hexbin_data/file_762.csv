29353,AVIAN IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DISEASES AND IMMUNE EVASION,2008-05-20,"In the past, viruses were considered nonliving infectious particles, little more than genetic material wrapped in a protein capsid. Today, virologists are beginning to think of viruses as living organisms that can be classified phylogenetically into defined species, much like any other living organism. The primary reasons for this shift in attitude can be partially attributed to the discovery of giant viruses, having large genomes and complex regulatory systems. Aside from that, it has become obvious that viruses lead complex lives; they evolve, speciate, and participate in the evolution of all classes of living organisms. In this chapter, we will discuss the early attempts to classify viruses, and review the biologic properties of the classes of virus that contain human pathogens.","Berman, Jules J.",Taxonomic Guide to Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149528/,762

30030,The cat with hydrothorax,2009-05-15,"Nanostructures have been widely involved in changes in the drug delivery system. Nanoparticles have unique physicochemical properties, e.g., ultrasmall size, large surface area, and the ability to target specific actions. Various nanomaterials, like Ag, ZnO, Cu/CuO, and Al(2)O(3), have antimicrobial activity. Basically, six mechanisms are involved in the production of antimicrobial activity, i.e., (1) destruction of the peptidoglycan layer, (2) release of toxic metal ions, (3) alteration of cellular pH via proton efflux pumps, (4) generation of reactive oxygen species, (5) damage of nuclear materials, and (6) loss of ATP production. Nanomedicine contributes to various pharmaceutical applications, like diagnosis and treatment of various ailments including microbial diseases. Furthermore, nanostructured antimicrobial agents are also involved in the treatment of the neuroinfections associated with neurodegenerative disorders. This chapter focuses on the nanostructure and nanomedicine of antimicrobial agents and their prospects for the possible management of infections associated with neurodegenerative disorders.","Muthuraman, Arunachalam; Kaur, Jaspreet",Nanostructures for Antimicrobial Therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152440/,762

De circulatie van bloed door het hart is essentieel voor de aanvoer van zuurstof en voedingsstoffen naar weefsel en organen en voor de afvoer van afvalstoffen. In principe bevat het intravasale systeem geen micro-organismen. Bloed is steriel. Als micro-organismen in de bloedbaan komen, worden ze snel verspreid, hetzij vrij in plasma, hetzij gehecht aan of in de bloedcellen. Binnen twee minuten bereiken ze dan een capillair systeem waarin ze kunnen achterblijven. In weefsels en organen kunnen ze soms aan specifieke cellen hechten (tropisme) en na groei specifieke infecties van die weefsels of organen veroorzaken (bijv. hepatitis B-virus in de lever, meningokokken in de meningen). Andere micro-organismen veroorzaken infecties door in het bloed of in de cellen in het bloed (bijv. plasmodiumsoorten, de oorzaak van malaria), in bloedvaten of in het hart te groeien.

30108,The anemic cat,2009-05-15,"Infectious processes of the trachea represent a distinct clinical entity with an evolving landscape owing to advances in airway management and vaccination practices. Untreated inflammatory processes of the trachea may present in the form of acute airway obstruction, potentially resulting in significant morbidity and even mortality. Therefore it is important to recognize the cardinal features of some of the common tracheal infectious processes to differentiate them from non-infectious pathology, as the latter is associated with a more indolent course. As with most other infectious processes of the airway, pathogens causing tracheal infection can be bacterial, viral or fungal in nature. Viral etiology represents the most common cause of laryngotracheal infection in a child. Bacterial infections of the trachea are responsible for more significant morbidity, including prolonged hospitalization, need for endotracheal intubation and even an occasional tracheostomy. The current chapter describes the clinical features and microbiology of tracheal infections at large, explores the utility of diagnostic tests, and provides an algorithm for management.","Isaiah, Amal; Pereira, Kevin D.; Correa, Armando G.",Infectious Diseases in Pediatric Otolaryngology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153446/,762
30121,The cat with lameness,2009-05-15,"The therapeutic options for patients with advanced pulmonary parenchymal or vascular disorders are currently limited. Lung transplantation remains one of the few viable interventions, but on account of the insufficient donor pool only a minority of these patients actually undergo the procedure each year. Following transplantation there are a number of early and late allograft complications such as primary graft dysfunction, allograft rejection, infection, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and late injury that is now classified as chronic lung allograft dysfunction. The pathologist plays an essential role in the diagnosis and classification of these myriad complications. Although the transplant procedures are performed in selected centers patients typically return to their local centers. When complications arise it is often the responsibility of the local pathologist to evaluate specimens. Therefore familiarity with the pathology of lung transplantation is important.","Berry, Gerald J.",Pathology of Transplantation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153460/,762
33649,The cat with weight loss and a good appetite,2009-05-15,"BACKGROUND: It is important for people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) to eat healthily. However, implementing dietary advice in everyday life is difficult, because eating is not a distinguishable action, but a chain of activities, embedded in social practices and influenced by previous life experiences. This research aims to understand why and how eating practices are developed over the life-course by investigating influential life experiences – turning points – and coping strategies for eating practices of people with T2DM. METHODS: The Salutogenic Model of Health guided the study’s objective, study design and analysis. Seventeen interviews were performed and analysed based on the principles of interpretative phenomenological analysis. Narrative inquiry and the creation of timelines and food boxes were used as tools to facilitate reflection on turning points and eating practices. RESULTS: Turning points for unhealthier eating were experiences that strongly disturbed the participants’ emotional stability. These experiences included psychosocial trauma, physical health disorders, job loss, and smoking cessation. Turning points for healthier eating were experiences that significantly changed participants views on life and made participants reflective about the effects of current eating practices on future health and life goals. These turning points included confrontation with ill-health, becoming a parent, psychosocial therapy, and getting married. Notably, turning points for healthier eating seemed only to happen when life was relatively stress-free. All participants experienced turning points for healthier eating, yet, not all participants succeeded in improving their diets. Two coping styles were distinguished: active and passive coping. Active coping individuals were able to act in line with their personal intentions, whereas passive coping individuals could not. Differences between active and passive coping styles seemed to be explained by differences in available resources important for adapting and maintaining a healthy diet. CONCLUSION: Disadvantaged childhood and later life adversities together with the inability to manage the mental stress explained the development unhealthier eating practices. All participants experienced turning points for healthier eating that caused eating to become a priority in their life. Yet, the fact that not all were able to eat as they intended, advocates for nutritional guidance for people with T2DM, with a greater emphasis on reflexivity, psycho-social well-being and social support.","Polhuis, C.

51489,Effect of inverse ratio ventilation on hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy,2021-04-13,"The maritime transport sector (MTS) has been impacted by the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, with significant disruptions to shipping and maritime activity along established transport routes. This paper examines the impacts of the pandemic on the MTS, at the global and African levels, and discusses what Africa’s priorities for its MTS should be in the post-pandemic era. The short-term impacts of the pandemic are identified as including a drop in the volume of trade transported by maritime shipping; disruptions due to re-routed shipments; maritime defaults and bankruptcies; and stranded seafarers. To understand the longer-term impacts, the paper analyzes the pandemic’s effect on five critical trends facing the MTS globally, viz, trade tensions, geopolitical developments, structural disruptions, regulatory pressures, and environmental incidents. In the African context, the paper highlights that with a mere 4% share of global container port traffic and a 7% and 5% share, respectively, of international maritime exports and imports (measured by tonnage), Africa’s significance to the global MTS is not huge. Hence, an impact analysis based on the global MTS trends would be premature. The paper concludes that Africa’s MTS in the post-pandemic era should focus on improving operational performance and sustainable development. Africa should also improve maritime governance to ensure that desired developmental outcomes are realized. It is argued that adopting a multi-stakeholder governance framework will be most appropriate for the continent’s MTS in the post-pandemic era. Further research is however needed to identify how a multi-stakeholder governance framework should be adapted and deployed to fit different African environments.","Oyenuga, Adekola",WMU J Marit Affairs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8022311/,762
59389,Associations between Physical Activity and Changes in Weight Across 7 Years following ROUX-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery: A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study.,2020-09-01,"Saikosaponins comprise a large group of chemical components present in the Bupleurum species that have attracted attention in the field of medicine because of their significant biological activities. Due to the high polarity, structural similarity, and the presence of several isomers of this class of components, their structural identification is extremely challenging. In this study, the mass spectrometric fragmentation pathways, UV spectral features, and chromatographic behavior of different types of saikosaponins were investigated using 24 standard substances. Saikosaponins containing carbonyl groups (C=O) in the aglycone produced fragment ions by loss of 30 Da, and in addition, type IV saikosaponins could produce [aglycone−CH(2)OH−OH−H](−) and [aglycone−H(2)O−H](−) fragment ions through neutral losses at positions C(16) and C(17). The above characteristic ions can be used to identify saikosaponins. More notably, the identification process of saikosaponins was systematically summarized, and using this method, 109 saikosaponins were identified or tentatively characterized from the saikosaponins extract of Bupleurum marginatum var. stenophyllum (BMS) using UPLC-PDA-Q/TOF-MS with both data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) modes, of which 25 were new compounds and 60 were first discovered from BMS. Further studies revealed that the saikosaponins profiles of BMS, Bupleurum chinense DC (BC), and Bupleurum marginatum Wall. ex DC (BMW) were very similar. This work is of great significance for the basic research of the Bupleurum species and provides strong technical support to solve the resource problems associated with Radix Bupleuri.","Liu, Wenxi; Cheng, Xianlong; Kang, Rong; Wang, Yadan; Guo, Xiaohan; Jing, Wenguang; Wei, Feng; Ma, Shuangcheng",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514958/,762

59995,Clinical and Patient-Centered Outcomes in Obese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes 3 Years After Randomization to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery Versus Intensive Lifestyle Management: The SLIMM-T2D Study.,2018,"BACKGROUND Nurses are considered important healthcare professionals during the management of the pandemic process due to the considerable amount of time they spend in the face-to-face nursing of infected patients. To optimise the service of healthcare workers, it is recommended that the mental health needs of the health workforce are addressed. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES This study aimed to explore the experiences and coping strategies of Turkish nurses working in pandemic units. METHODS A grounded theory design was applied. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 nurses. The data were analysed according to the constant comparative method. RESULTS The study generated a core category ('It was difficult working in the unknown, but our struggle to touch lives gave us strength'), showing that all nurses felt heroic via the satisfaction of touching patients' lives and uncertain. Four main categories emerged: being caught in the pandemic, empowerment for coping with the struggle, challenges during the coping process, and effects of the pandemic on life. CONCLUSIONS Nurses felt that their profession was sacred and valued by society, and comprehensive support had facilitated the process. Nurses had difficulty in managing their fear of infecting others and adapting to many new elements, the learning process, and a lack of understanding of their role as team members. The nurses attending to the pandemic have experienced the effects of COVID-19 on their lives, such as psychological growth, psychological symptoms, and being labelled as high-risk. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Nurses would be further empowered by government and society's support and acceptance of professionalism in nursing. The findings suggest that the resources for the psychological support of nurses in the pandemic should be increased. Regular and intensive training for nursing is necessary to promote adaptation and efficacy in crisis management.","Deliktas Demirci, Ayse; Oruc, Mine; Kabukcuoglu, Kamile",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33325080/,762
60417,Single Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy by Using a 2 mm Atraumatic Grasper without Trocar.,2011,"Maternal immune adaptation to accommodate pregnancy depends on sufficient availability of regulatory T (Treg) cells to enable embryo implantation. Toll-like receptor 4 is implicated as a key upstream driver of a controlled inflammatory response, elicited by signals in male partner seminal fluid, to initiate expansion of the maternal Treg cell pool after mating. Here, we report that mice with null mutation in Tlr4 (Tlr4-/-) exhibit impaired reproductive outcomes after allogeneic mating, with reduced pregnancy rate, elevated mid-gestation fetal loss, and fetal growth restriction, compared to Tlr4+/+ wild-type controls. To investigate the effects of TLR4 deficiency on early events of maternal immune adaptation, TLR4-regulated cytokines and immune regulatory microRNAs were measured in the uterus at 8 h post-mating by qPCR, and Treg cells in uterus-draining lymph nodes were evaluated by flow cytometry on day 3.5 post-coitum. Ptgs2 encoding prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, cytokines Csf2, Il6, Lif, and Tnf, chemokines Ccl2, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl10, and microRNAs miR-155, miR-146a, and miR-223 were induced by mating in wild-type mice, but not, or to a lesser extent, in Tlr4-/- mice. CD4+ T cells were expanded after mating in Tlr4+/+ but not Tlr4-/- mice, with failure to expand peripheral CD25+FOXP3+ NRP1- or thymic CD25+FOXP3+ NRP1+ Treg cell populations, and fewer Treg cells expressed Ki67 proliferation marker and suppressive function marker CTLA4. We conclude that TLR4 is an essential mediator of the inflammation-like response in the pre-implantation uterus that induces generation of Treg cells to support robust pregnancy tolerance and ensure optimal fetal growth and survival.","Chan, Hon Y; Moldenhauer, Lachlan M; Groome, Holly M; Schjenken, John E; Robertson, Sarah A",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95213-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400677/,762
60491,Laparoscopic Gastroileal Bypass with Single Anastomosis: Analysis of the First 1512 Patients.,2019,"Prior research has shown that narrative coherence is associated with more positive emotional responses in the face of traumatic or stressful experiences. However, most of these studies only examined narrative coherence after the stressor had already occurred. Given the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 in March 2020 in Belgium and the presence of data obtained two years before (February 2018), we could use our baseline narrative coherence data to predict emotional well-being and perceived social support in the midst of the pandemic. In a sample of emerging adults (NT1 = 278, NT2 = 198), higher baseline coherence of narratives about positive autobiographical experiences predicted relative increases in emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the relation between the coherence of positive narratives and emotional well-being was partially mediated by perceived social support. These findings suggest that narrative coherence could be an enhancement factor for adaptive emotional coping with stressful situations, in part by evoking more supportive social reactions. This study demonstrates the importance of researching cognition (narrative coherence) and emotion (well-being) to shed light on pressing societal matters such as the global COVID-19 pandemic.","Vanaken, Lauranne; Bijttebier, Patricia; Fivush, Robyn; Hermans, Dirk",Cognition & emotion,https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2021.1902283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734018/,762

60671,Timing for a Laparoscopic Myomectomy During the Menstrual Cycle.,2015,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review is based on the latest evidence to provide a good standard of care for COVID-19 parturients and protection to healthcare givers. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 by itself is not an indication for cesarean section. Different publications demonstrated the efficacy of neuraxial analgesia/anesthesia for delivery. Although SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a certain neurotropism, neuraxial block was not associated with neurological damage in COVID-19 parturients, and seems as safe and effective as in normal situations. It permits to avoid a general anesthesia in case of intrapartum cesarean section. Epidural failure is a concern: it may lead to a general anesthesia in case of emergency cesarean section. Local protocols and well-trained anesthesiologists will be helpful. COVID-19 patients require special circuits and every step (transfer to and from theatre, recovery, analgesia, and so on) should be planned in advance. For cesarean section under general anesthesia, personal protection equipment must be enhanced. Postoperative analgesia with neuraxial opioids, NSAIDs, or regional blocks are recommended. COVID-19 and pregnancy increase the risk of thrombosis, so thromboprophylaxis has to be considered and protocolized. SUMMARY Anesthetic care for delivery in COVID-19 parturients should include neuraxial blocks. Special attention should be paid on the risk of thrombosis.","Guasch, Emilia; Brogly, Nicolas; Gilsanz, Fernando",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315638/,762

61258,Laparoscopic treatment of obese patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus: a prospective study.,2012,"OBJECTIVE Baloxavir marboxil (baloxavir) is the first cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor being studied for the treatment of influenza in single oral dosing regimen. This network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated the efficacy and safety of baloxavir compared to other antivirals for influenza in otherwise healthy patients. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed on 14 November 2016 in Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and ICHUSHI to identify randomized controlled trials assessing antivirals for influenza. A NMA including 22 trials was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of baloxavir with other antivirals. RESULTS The time to alleviation of all symptoms was significantly shorter for baloxavir compared to zanamivir (difference in median time 19.96 h; 95% CrI [3.23, 39.07]). The time to cessation of viral shedding was significantly shorter for baloxavir than zanamivir and oseltamivir (47.00 h; 95% CrI [28.18, 73.86] and 56.03 h [33.74, 87.86], respectively). The mean decline in virus titer from baseline to 24 h was significantly greater for baloxavir than for the other drugs. Other differences in efficacy outcomes were not significant. No significant differences were found between baloxavir and the other antivirals for safety, except total drug-related adverse events where baloxavir demonstrated a decrease compared to oseltamivir and laninamivir. CONCLUSIONS The NMA suggests that baloxavir demonstrated better or similar efficacy results compared to other antivirals with a comparable safety profile. Baloxavir led to a significant decrease in viral titer versus zanamivir, oseltamivir and peramivir and decreased viral shedding versus zanamivir and oseltamivir.","Taieb, Vanessa; Ikeoka, Hidetoshi; Ma, Fang-Fang; Borkowska, Katarzyna; Aballéa, Samuel; Tone, Keiko; Hirotsu, Nobuo",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2019.1584505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810054/,762

61371,Ergonomic and geometric tricks of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) by using conventional laparoscopic instruments.,2012,"BACKGROUND Short-segment Barrett's esophagus (SSBE) or long-segment Barrett's esophagus (LSBE) is the consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is frequently associated with obesity. Obesity is a significant risk factor for the development of GERD symptoms, erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Morbidly obese patients who submitted to gastric bypass have an incidence of GERD as high as 50% to 100% and Barrett's esophagus reaches up to 9% of patients. METHODS In this prospective study, we evaluate the postoperative results after three different procedures--calibrated fundoplication + posterior gastropexy (CFPG), fundoplication + vagotomy + distal gastrectomy + Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy (FVDGRYGJ), and laparoscopic resectional Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRRYGBP)--among obese patients. RESULTS In patients with SSBE who submitted to CFPG, the persistence of reflux symptoms and endoscopic erosive esophagitis was observed in 15% and 20.2% of them, respectively. Patients with LSBE were submitted to FVDGRYGJ or LRRYGBP which significantly improved their symptoms and erosive esophagitis. No modifications of LESP were observed in patients who submitted to LRRYGBP before or after the operation. Acid reflux diminished after the three types of surgery were employed. Patients who submitted to LRRYGBP presented a significant reduction of BMI from 41.5 ± 4.3 to 25.7 ± 1.3 kg/m(2) after 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with LSBE, FVDGRYGJ presents very good results in terms of improving GERD and Barrett's esophagus, but the reduction of weight is limited. LRRYGBP improves GERD disease and Barrett's esophagus with proven reduction in body weight and BMI, thus becoming the procedure of choice for obese patients.","Braghetto, Italo; Korn, Owen; Csendes, Attila; Gutiérrez, Luis; Valladares, Héctor; Chacon, Max",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-011-0531-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22392129/,762

The growth modes include equiaxed crystal, columnar crystal and coexistence of both crystals. In the ZnO:Al film, equiaxed crystals improve the carrier mobility and reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Thus, the carrier mobility and thermal conductivity are tuned by the ratio of equiaxed crystals to columnar crystals. The carrier mobility is dependent on the growth-mode-related defects of oxygen vacancies, zinc interstitials and the substitutional dopant of Al.

61771,Complete endoscopic/transgastric retrieval of eroded gastric band: description of a novel technique and review of the literature.,2013,"OBJECTIVE Profilin 1 (Pfn1) is likely to be involved in atherogenesis and myocardial infarction (MI). Clinical data on this subject are very limited. The aim of this study was to search for associations between serum Pfn1 and a number of parameters in MI patients: symptom onset to PCI time (OPT), myocardial necrosis markers, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow, antiplatelet drugs, heparin administration and typical atherosclerosis risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS We included patients with type 1 MI (according to the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction) who were able to precisely determine the time of symptom onset. Exclusion criteria involved conditions potentially altering platelet function. We screened 114 patients and included 65. We assessed serum Pfn1 in three time points: on admission (Pfn1_0), 24 hours post PCI (Pfn1_24) and 48 hours post PCI (Pfn1_48) and correlated it with OPT, cardiac necrosis markers (troponin T, CK, CKMB), TIMI flow in the infarct-related artery, pre-hospital P2Y12-antagonist and heparin administration and known atherosclerosis risk factors. RESULTS Patients with a shorter OPT had higher Pfn1_0 (838.5 vs. 687.1 pg/ml, p=0.007). Patients with impaired coronary flow post PCI had lower Pfn1_24 (748.2 vs. 925.2 pg/ml, p=0.017) and Pfn1_48 (744.5 vs. 879.8, p=0.031. Pfn1_24 and Pfn1_48 were lower in patients who received a P2Y12 antagonist prior to hospital admission. Diabetic patients presented with lower Pfn1_0 concentrations.

63275,Single-incision transperitoneal laparoscopic left adrenalectomy.,2012,"BACKGROUND Transabdominal ultrasound is useful to assess inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC); however, the assessment of the rectum is challenging and a barrier for its widespread use. AIM To evaluate if transperineal ultrasound is useful for predicting endoscopic and histological findings of the rectum in UC. METHODS Fifty-three consecutive adults with UC who required colonoscopy were included and transperineal ultrasound was performed in combination with transabdominal ultrasound within a week before or after colonoscopy with rectal biopsy. Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) ≤1 was defined as endoscopic healing and Geboes score <2.1, Robarts histopathology index ≤6, and Nancy index ≤1 were defined as histological healing. Limberg score and bowel wall thickness were recorded with transperineal ultrasound. Faecal calprotectin was also measured. RESULTS Excellent correlation was confirmed between colonoscopy and transabdominal ultrasound in all segments except for the rectum. Rectal bowel wall thickness and Limberg score in transperineal ultrasound well correlated with rectal MES and histological indices. Bowel wall thickness ≤4 mm predicted endoscopic (Area under the curve [AUC] = 0.90) and histological (AUC = 0.87-0.89) healing. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, only bowel wall thickness in transperineal ultrasound was a significant independent predictor for rectal endoscopic and histologic healing (P < 0.05) and the predictability was better than faecal calprotectin. CONCLUSIONS Transperineal ultrasound predicts endoscopic and histological healing of the rectum. The combination of transperineal ultrasound with transabdominal ultrasound visualises the entire colorectum and is an ideal modality for the treat-to-target strategy.

Treatment is complex and evidence for treatment decisions may be absent. Characterising gaps in the research evidence will highlight treatment uncertainties and help prioritise research questions. We systematically identified the evidence gaps for treatment decisions in CF. METHODS We searched for systematic reviews and guidelines on treatment interventions in CF. Two researchers identified eligible reviews with arbitration from a third. Using a structured framework, we extracted and characterised evidence gaps. RESULTS There were 73 reviews and 21 guidelines that met our inclusion criteria. From these, we identified 148 evidence gaps across a range of treatment areas. We found 111 evidence gaps through systematic reviews and a further 37 from guidelines. The reason for an evidence gap could only be reliably characterised for systematic reviews. In most cases, there was more than one explanation-most commonly few or no trials (97/111 evidence gaps). Other important factors leading to evidence gaps were small sample size (49/111), inadequate duration of follow-up (38/111) or intervention (37/111) and factors relating to outcomes (35/111). Evidence gaps from both systematic reviews and guidelines fell into the following categories: Respiratory (91); Gastrointestinal (20); PhysiotherapyandExercise (16); Musculoskeletal (6); Endocrine (4); Basic defect of CF (8); Psychosocial (2); Ears, Nose and Throat (1). CONCLUSIONS We have compiled an up-to-date list of treatment uncertainties in CF and the reasons for these uncertainties.

The annual rate of major bleeds with warfarin averages about 2%. The rates of intracerebral and intracranial bleeds are significantly reduced with the use of the novel direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared with warfarin. Treatment of anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage is based on the results of case series and small trials. Resumption of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation who had an intracerebral bleed depends on the etiology and location of the bleeding and the absolute rate of stroke in the absence of anticoagulation.,"Diener, Hans-Christoph; Stanford, Sophia; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil; Christensen, Louisa; Hougaard, Kristina Dupont; Bakhai, Ameet; Veltkamp, Roland; Worthmann, Hans",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1586/14737175.2014.945435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091395/,762

63702,Vessel sealer and divider instrument temperature during laparoscopic ovariectomy in horses.,2018,"BACKGROUND Elective orthopaedic surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic requires careful case prioritisation. We aimed to produce consensus-based guidelines on the prioritisation of revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures. METHOD Twenty-three revision TKA scenarios were assigned priority (NHS England/Royal College of Surgeons scale) by the British Association for Surgery of the Knee (BASK) Revision Knee Working Group (n = 24). Consensus agreement was defined as ≥70% respondents (18/24) giving the same prioritisation. Two voting rounds were undertaken; procedures achieving <70% agreement were given their most commonly assigned priority. RESULTS 18/23 procedures achieved ≥70% agreement. Three were P1a (surgery within <24 h); DAIR for sepsis, peri-prosthetic fracture (PPF) fixation and PPF-revision TKA. Three were P1b (<72 h); debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) for a stable patient, flap coverage for an open knee, and acute extensor mechanism rupture. Eight were P2 (<4 weeks), including aseptic loosening at risk of collapse, inter-stage patients with poor functioning spacers. Five were P3 (<3 months), including second stage revision for infection, revision for instability with limited mobility. Four were P4 (can wait >3 months) e.g. aseptic loosening. CONCLUSION Sepsis and PPF surgery are the most urgent procedures. Although most procedures should be undertaken within one to three months (P2/3), these cases represent a small revision practice volume; P4 cases (e.g. aseptic loosening without risk of collapse) make up most surgeons' caseload. These recommendations are a guideline; patient co-morbidities, Covid-19 pathways, availability of support services and multi-disciplinary team discussion within the regional revision network will dictate prioritisation.","Kalson, N S; Mathews, J A; Toms, A D; Murray, J R D",The Knee,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2020.10.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307320/,762

While much research has been dedicated to understanding the genetic causes of the disease, our understanding of the mechanistic impacts of GRN deficiency has only recently begun to take shape. With no known cure or treatment available for GRN-related FTD, there is a growing need to rapidly advance genetic and/or small-molecule therapeutics for this disease. This issue is complicated by the fact that, while lysosomal dysfunction seems to be a key driver of pathology, the mechanisms linking a loss of GRN to a pathogenic state remain unclear. In our attempt to address these key issues, we have turned to the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, to model, study, and find potential therapies for GRN-deficient FTD. First, we show that the loss of the nematode GRN ortholog, pgrn-1, results in several behavioral and molecular defects, including lysosomal dysfunction and defects in autophagic flux. Our investigations implicate the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in the regulation of many of the in vivo defects associated with pgrn-1 loss. Finally, we utilized these nematodes as an in vivo tool for high-throughput drug screening and identified two small molecules with potential therapeutic applications against GRN/pgrn-1 deficiency. These compounds reverse the biochemical, cellular, and functional phenotypes of GRN deficiency. Together, our results open avenues for mechanistic and therapeutic research into the outcomes of GRN-related neurodegeneration, both genetic and molecular.","Doyle, James J; Maios, Claudia; Vrancx, Céline; Duhaime, Sarah; Chitramuthu, Babykumari; Bennett, Hugh P J; Bateman, Andrew; Parker, J Alex",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2022115118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140407/,762

We assessed serum HBV pgRNA levels in 323 CHB patients by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, assessed cytokine production and activation and inhibitory markers of NK cells by flow cytometry, and measured serum cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Among the different CHB phases, the serum HBV pgRNA level was highest in the immune tolerant (IT) and immune active (IA) phases. Regarding NK and NKdim cells, HBV pgRNA was negatively associated with frequencies, but positively associated with NKp44 and NKp46 expression (activation markers). Regarding NKbright cells, serum HBV pgRNA was positively associated with frequency and PD1 expression (inhibitory marker), but negatively associated with NKp44 and NKp46. Serum HBV pgRNA was not associated with NKp30 (activation marker) on NK cells or subsets. Lastly, serum HBV pgRNA was positively correlated with the levels of serum IL-7 and IL-12P40 (NK cell-promoting cytokines) and negatively correlated with serum prostaglandin E2 level (which negatively regulates NK cells). In conclusion, we found varied relationships between serum HBV pgRNA and NK cells and subsets, indicating that HBV pgRNA may play a complicated role in NK cell-related immunity, providing new information on HBV and host immunity.","Gu, Yurong; Huang, Zexuan; Li, Xiaoyan; Chen, Youming; Liao, Chunhong; Bi, Yanhua; Huang, Yuehua",Bioscience reports,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20210600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151357/,762

64206,Cancer incidence and mortality after gastric bypass surgery.,2009,"Because tics are the defining clinical feature of Tourette syndrome, it is conceptualized predominantly as a motor disorder. There is some evidence though suggesting that the neural basis of Tourette syndrome is related to perception-action processing and binding between perception and action. However, binding processes have not been examined in the motor domain in these patients. If it is particularly perception-action binding but not binding processes within the motor system, this would further corroborate that Tourette syndrome it is not predominantly, or solely, a motor disorder. Here, we studied N = 22 Tourette patients and N = 24 healthy controls using an established action coding paradigm derived from the Theory of Event Coding framework and concomitant EEG-recording addressing binding between a planned but postponed, and an interleaved immediate reaction with different levels of overlap of action elements. Behavioral performance during interleaved action coding was normal in Tourette syndrome. Response locked lateralized readiness potentials reflecting processes related to motor execution were larger in Tourette syndrome, but only in simple conditions. However, pre-motor processes including response preparation and configuration reflected by stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potentials were normal. This was supported by a Bayesian data analysis providing evidence for the null hypothesis. The finding that processes integrating different action-related elements prior to motor execution are normal in Tourette syndrome suggests that Tourette it is not solely a motor disorder. Considering other recent evidence, the data show that changes in ""binding"" in Tourette syndrome are specific for perception-action integration but not for action coding.","Mielke, Emily; Takacs, Adam; Kleimaker, Maximilian; Schappert, Ronja; Conte, Giulia; Onken, Rebecca; Künemund, Till; Verrel, Julius; Bäumer, Tobias; Beste, Christian; Münchau, Alexander",NeuroImage.

AIM This study examined whether use of HFNC increases near-field aerosols and if there is a relationship with flow rate. METHODS Subjects aged four weeks to 24 months were recruited. Each child received HFNC therapy at different flow rates. Three stations with particle counters were deployed to measure particle concentrations and dispersion in the room: station one within 0.5 m, station two at 2 m, and station three on the other side of the room. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and relative humidity. Far-field measurements were used to adjust the near-field measurements. FINDINGS We enrolled ten children ranging from 6-23 months (median 9 months). Elevated CO2 indicated the near-field measurements were in the breathing plane. Near-field breathing plane concentrations of aerosols with diameter 0.3 - 10 μm are elevated by the presence of the patient with no HFNC flow, relative to the room far-field, by 0.45 #/cm3. While we observed variability between subjects in their emission and dispersion of particles, we did not find an association between HFNC use, at any flowrate, and near-field particle counts. CONCLUSION This method of particle sampling is feasible in hospital settings; correcting the near-patient aerosol and CO2 levels for the room far-field may provide proxies of exposure risk to pathogens generated. In this pilot, near-patient levels of particles with a diameter between 0.3-10 μm and CO2 were not affected by the use of HFNC.","Gall, Elliott T; Laguerre, Aurélie; Noelck, Michelle; Van Meurs, Annalise; Austin, Jared A; Foster, Byron A",The Journal of hospital infection,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2021.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33864892/,762

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND Casting for infantile scoliosis has become more popular as reports have shown promising results with this technique without the morbidity and complications associated with more invasive procedures. However, without a specialized casting table, treating these patients has been limited to a few centers throughout the country often causing patients to travel large distances to receive care. METHODS Three different alternatives to commercially available casting frames are presented. Requirements, setup, and techniques are discussed. RESULTS Each surgeon has had success with each of these frames. These provide adequate support and traction while allowing enough access to the trunk to apply a well-molded cast.

This study discusses the incorporation of various polymeric dielectric layers between the tribo-material and electrode components of TENGs, which improved their electrical output performance to varying degrees. The TENG demonstrating the largest improvement (1200 V) was obtained after adding a polyimide layer. The analysis presented herein suggests that incorporating a dielectric layer with high trap energy means that more charges are held in deep traps; thus, such TENGs demonstrate the best electrical performance. Additionally, when a dielectric layer is added to the triboelectric material, the enhanced TENG output is related to the volume conductivity of the triboelectric material, but not to its electronegativity or surface structure. Finally, the optimized TENG developed in this work demonstrates energy harvesting capabilities and can function as a self-powered sensor applied in an intelligent housing system and as an emergency fall detection/alert system for the elderly and the sick.","Lv, Shasha; Zhang, Xin; Huang, Tao; Yu, Hao; Zhang, Qinghua; Zhu, Meifang",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c18243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411491/,762

In this work, two manikins labelled as 'source' and 'susceptible' were used to measure the protection provided by facemasks under various emission scenarios. The source was modified to generate polydisperse ultrafine particles, whereas the susceptible was modified to mimic a realistic breathing pattern. The facemask was challenged by both pseudo-steady and highly transient emissions generated by an expiratory process where parameters, such as separation distance between manikins, emission velocity and expiratory duration, were controlled and measured systematically. Performances of four different types of facemask fits, varying from ideal to normal wearing practice, were also investigated. Under the pseudo-steady concentration environment, facemask protection was found to be 45 per cent, while under expiratory emissions, protection varied from 33 to 100 per cent. It was also observed that the separation between the source and the manikin was the most influential parameter affecting facemask protection.","Lai, A C K; Poon, C K M; Cheung, A C T","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2011.0537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937487/,762

66034,"Patient-reported postoperative pain, body image, and cosmetic satisfaction after transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site adrenalectomy.",2017,"BACKGROUND Although laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) has been performed widely, the role of LA for complicated appendicitis remains controversial, and its role for periappendiceal abscess (PA) remains undefined. This study compared the clinical outcomes of LA and open appendectomy (OA) for PA diagnosed by radiologic investigation. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of 84 patients who underwent surgery for PA diagnosed by radiologic investigation between 2010 and 2013. Twenty-five patients underwent LA, and the remaining patients underwent OA. Patient characteristics, operative outcomes, and surgical complications were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Three patients required conversion from LA to OA (12%). There were no significant differences in the overall complication (28% versus 25.4%; P=.8), wound infection (15.3% versus 4%; P=.27), stump leakage (4% versus 1.7%; P=.51), and postoperative ileus (4% versus 8.5%; P=.66) rates between the groups. The incidence of intraabdominal abscess (IAA) was significantly higher in the LA group (20% versus 3.4%; P=.02). In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for IAA were duration of drainage (P=.04) and type of operation (P=.006). The major complications rate was 2.4% in the total cohort, and the rate was significantly higher in the LA group (8% versus 0%; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS For patients with PA, the rates of overall complications, wound infection, stump leakage, and postoperative ileus were similar for both procedures. However, LA resulted in a significantly higher incidence of IAA and major complications than OA.","Yeom, Sunchul; Kim, Min Sung; Park, Seulkee; Son, Taeil; Jung, Yoon Young; Lee, Seung Ah; Chang, Yeon Soo; Kim, Dong Hee; Han, Joon Kil",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

66087,Laparoscopic surgery for esophageal achalasia: Multiport vs single-incision approach.,2016,"BACKGROUND The Republic of Ireland is introducing new controls on alcohol marketing, starting in November 2019 with restrictions on some outdoor and cinema advertising, and a ban on public transport advertising. We examined changes in marketing awareness one year after initial implementation and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Repeat online cross-sectional surveys with adults in Ireland conducted October 2019 (n = 1,007) and October 2020 (n = 1,020). Participants self-reported past-month awareness of alcohol marketing and completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C). Current drinkers were categorised as those reporting heavy episodic drinking at least monthly and higher-risk drinkers (≥5 AUDIT-C). RESULTS In both waves, most participants recalled some marketing awareness (94.1% vs. 93.8%). For 9/13 activities measured in both waves, there were decreases in the proportion reporting any awareness and frequency of awareness, including for the newly restricted activities. For example, any awareness of public transport advertising decreased between waves (ORAdj = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.53-0.81). In both waves, higher past-month awareness was associated with at least monthly heavy episodic drinking and higher-risk consumption. CONCLUSION We recommend a precautionary interpretation. It is plausible that both Ireland's initial controls and COVID-19 restrictions contributed to decreases in awareness, but longer-term evaluation is required to determine relative contribution.","Critchlow, Nathan; Moodie, Crawford",Journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34632497/,762

Placement of the implantable cardiac-defibrillator (ICD) lead in the middle cardiac vein (MCV) can be a viable option in these patients who have an indication for biventricular (BiV) ICD. We aim to describe the case of two patients with MCV lead placement and provide a comprehensive review of patients with complex TV pathology and indications for RV lead placement. METHODS AND RESULTS We describe the cases of two patients with TV pathology unsuitable for the standard transvenous or surgical RV lead placement and undergoing BiV ICD implantation. Their characteristics, procedure, and outcomes are summarized. The BiV ICD was successfully placed with the RV lead positioned in the MCV in both patients. The procedures had no complications and were well-tolerated. On follow-up, both patients had appropriate tachytherapy with no readmissions for heart failure or worsening of cardiac function. CONCLUSION Right ventricular lead placement of BiV ICD in the MCV can be an excellent alternative in patients with significant TV pathology and poor surgical candidacy.","Maskoun, Waddah; Raad, Mohamad; Khan, Arfaat; Mando, Ramy; Homsi, Mohamed","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euaa177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830224/,762

Here, we aimed to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of hepatic resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for treating this malignancy. METHODS Between April 2004 and May 2011, we enrolled 48 patients who had poorly differentiated HCC that had been diagnosed postoperatively by pathological assessment. All the tumors had a maximum diameter of 3 cm and all patients had three or less tumors. Fifteen of these patients underwent hepatic resection (HR group) and 33 patients underwent RFA (RF group). The patient background, tumor characteristics, overall survival rate and recurrence-free survival rate were assessed in both groups. RESULTS The mean maximum tumor diameter was 2.5 and 2.0 cm in the HR and RF groups, respectively. The prothrombin activity level was 94% and 86% in the HR and RF groups, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 89.1%, 68.7% and 68.7%, respectively, in the HR group, and 59.2%, 40.9% and 32.7%, respectively, in the RF group. The 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 85.1%, 64.8% and 48.6%, respectively, in the HR group, and 29.0%, 7.2% and 7.2%, respectively, in the RF group. There was a significant difference between these groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION As hepatic resection has greater efficacy than RFA in the treatment of poorly differentiated HCC, even in cases with a small tumor size, we recommend its use for this malignancy.","Iida, Hiroya; Aihara, Tsukasa; Ikuta, Shinichi; Yamanaka, Naoki",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/hepr.12264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24164784/,762
66522,Laparoscopic extralevator abdominal perineal excision of the rectum: the best of both worlds.,2012,"Herein is described and evaluated a safe laparoscopic adnexectomy technique for retroperitoneal dissection of suspect ovarian masses including the underlying peritoneum fixed to the ovary. Adopting this technique in cases of suspect adnexal masses enables the reduction of spilling and ensures an intact specimen. Twenty-two consecutive patients with suspect adnexal masses 10 cm or smaller underwent laparoscopic adnexectomy. Patients with bilateral suspect ovarian masses that required bilateral adnexectomy were enrolled only if they were no longer of childbearing age. Laparoscopy was feasible in all patients. No tumor spillage occurred. In 5 patients (23.6%), minilaparotomy was required to extract the specimen. Mean (SD) operating time was 80 (35-160) minutes, and estimated blood loss was 50 (10-100) mL. No major intraoperative complications occurred. Median (range) postoperative stay was 1 (1-3) day. Definitive pathologic analysis revealed benign pathologic conditions in 18 patients (81.8%), an ovarian tumor with low malignant potential in 3 patients (13.7%), and ovarian cancer in 1 patient (4.5%) in whom findings at frozen-section analysis were inconclusive. Median (range) follow-up of malignant ovarian tumors and of tumors with low malignant potential was 27 (21-29) months. No recurrence or port-site metastasis developed during follow-up. The data are encouraging for adoption of this technique to avert spillage during laparoscopic management of suspect adnexal masses, especially those firmly adherent to the peritoneum. However, the procedure must be validated in a larger series of patients to standardize the technique.","Perutelli, Alessandra; Garibaldi, Silvia; Basile, Stefano; Baldacci, Chiara; Gargini, Antonio; Domenici, Lavinia; Salerno, Maria Giovanna",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2011.02.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21545961/,762

Taking a qualitative approach, we used interviews and questionnaires to focus on life stories that involve grieving. Specifically, we asked about experiences of the grief process as related to choice of music. Our results indicate that the role of music in farewell rituals is important for the grieving process in several ways. Firstly, music was associated with positive memories of the loved one and gave rise to experiences of recognition. Secondly, music facilitated active participation in the grieving process through choosing farewell music together with a relative. Thirdly, selecting music for the funeral in advance, together with their loved ones, was also experienced as hopeful, comforting and consoling before, during and after the bereavement.","Viper, Marianne; Thyrén, David; Horwitz, Eva Bojner",Omega,https://doi.org/10.1177/0030222820942391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32659171/,762
67141,Laparoscopic mesh repair for lumbar hernia after iliac crest bone harvest.,2016,"BACKGROUND Bipolar energy ligation of vessels in surgery is common. Although rare, serious failures occur. Atherosclerosis may contribute to seal failures by altering vascular compressibility and collagen content; however, no data exist. MATERIALS AND METHODS Femoral and iliac arteries of six Yucatan swine with an identified genetic locus predisposing them to atherosclerosis were denuded with a Fogarty catheter. Animals were fed a high-fat diet for 28 wk. A Yorkshire pig was used as a normal control and fed a standard diet. At 28 wk, arteries were measured for their diameters, sealed, and divided in vivo with LigaSure. The sealed artery sections were excised and subjected to burst pressure testing. Half of the seal distal to the aorta was kept intact for histology and collagen and elastin quantification. A multiple linear regression model was used to assess variables contributing to burst pressure. Covariates included were vessel diameter, degree of atherosclerosis, and collagen content. RESULTS Experimental animals were hypercholesterolemic. Atherosclerosis occurred in 90% of seals in induced animals, with severe atherosclerosis in 62% of seals. There was site-selective deposition of atherosclerotic plaques in larger diameter iliac vessels. A model including collagen and size best predicted burst pressure. Every 10-U increase in collagen resulted in 15% increase in burst pressure (95% confidence interval = 0.2%-32%, P = 0.047, R(2) = 0.36). Atherosclerosis was unrelated to burst pressure controlling for collagen and size. CONCLUSIONS Collagen and size provide the best model fit for predicting burst pressure. Quantitative research in human vasculature is warranted to better understand the influence of atherosclerosis and collagen content on seal failures.","Martin, Kimberly; Krugman, Kimberly; Latimer, Cassandra; Moore, Camille",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2013.06.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23866786/,762

Some of the biological effects of nicotine are well documented in in vitro and in vivo systems; however, nominal data are available concerning the time-dependent changes on protein and phosphorylation events in response to nicotine. Here, we profiled the proteomes of SH-SY5Y and A549 cell lines subjected to acute (15 min, 1 h and 4 h) or chronic (24 h, 48 h) nicotine exposures. We used sample multiplexing (TMTpro16) and quantified more than 9000 proteins and over 7000 phosphorylation events per cell line. Among our findings, we determined a decrease in mitochondrial protein abundance for SH-SY5Y, while we detected alterations in several immune pathways, such as the complement system, for A549 following nicotine treatment. We also explored the proposed association between smoking and SARS-CoV2. Here, we found several host proteins known to interact with viral proteins that were affected by nicotine in a time dependent manner. This dataset can be mined further to investigate the potential role of nicotine in different biological contexts. SIGNIFICANCE: Smoking is a major public health issue that is associated with several serious chronic, yet preventable diseases, including stroke, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and susceptibility to infection. Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of thousands of different compounds, among which nicotine is the main addictive compound. The biological effects of nicotine have been reported in several models, however very little data are available concerning the temporal proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes in response to nicotine.

Conjunctival swab samples were collected from both eyes of all the 59 patients and were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The range of sampling time lies widely between 1 and 50 days since symptom onset. Results Among the 32 newly admitted patients, positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swab samples were reported in 2 patients (one eye for each) without ocular discomfort, but 1 positive case had conjunctival congestion. The positive results were detected on Day 5 for 1 patient and Day 7 for the other, but repeated tests after 1 week were negative for both patients. All 27 patients who had been hospitalized for ≥2 weeks had negative test results.

CASE REPORT A 47-year-old man presented with a rapidly enlarging 6.9-cm thoracic aneurysm that was a complication of a chronic type B aortic dissection. A 2-piece, custom-made, tapered, fenestrated thoracic endoprosthesis (innominate scallop plus single carotid) was planned to seal from the innominate origin to immediately above the celiac axis after staged left carotid to subclavian bypass. Blood pressure control with rapid ventricular pacing aided deployment of the proximal, fenestrated stent-graft component with both openings accurately positioned over their respective branch vessel ostia. Attempted retrieval of the nosecone was hampered by a release failure of the single conformance tie that connects the stent-graft to its central cannula. This left the stent-graft fully deployed with the nosecone irretrievable beyond a point immediately distal to the small fenestration. A series of endovascular salvage maneuvers ensued, ranging from simple actions to manipulate and balloon dilate the graft through to more complex attempts to break the tie and lasso the nosecone using snares. Finally, attempts at antegrade retrieval of the nosecone straightened the device and released the offending tie, allowing case completion. CONCLUSION This is a rare but cautionary example of the potential pitfalls of translating endograft technology from the abdominal aorta to the hostile environment of the aortic arch. It is likely that a combination of the arch curvature and hemodynamic forces, combined with the narrowed true lumen, contributed to failure of the trigger-wire tie release mechanism. Consideration of these endovascular salvage maneuvers may benefit interventional specialists who treat such diseases of the aortic arch.","Varcoe, Ramon L; Lennox, Andrew F",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/1545-1550-20.2.242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23581771/,762

While some aspects of the biology of A. curvicauda are known, such as its reproductive biology, its sex pheromone, and host selection, there is currently no information on the species mate selection process. This paper describes the precopulatory mating behavior of A. curvicauda and elucidates how intrasexual selection affects the mate selection process. We studied the precopulatory mating behavior of dominant and subordinate males and ethograms were devised. The effect of hierarchy was studied in non-choice and choice experiments. Male's repertoire includes 15 behavioral elements, 12 precopulatory, one mating, and two postcopulatory (tandem and encounter). In non-choice experiments, dominant and subordinate males were accepted by females, but when females had the opportunity to choose among males, dominant males were significantly preferred over subordinate ones. The presence of a rival male modified the courting behavior of males and agonistic behavior among males was observed before and during mating.","Salmerón-Muñiz, Nancy Natividad; Arzuffi, René; Robledo-Quintos, Norma; Jiménez-Pérez, Alfredo",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85823-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737687/,762

Variations in accuracy between the two surgical approaches may exist. However, only few studies have tried to assess these differences. Our aim was to assess reliability and inter-rater variability of small bowel length assessment during laparoscopy in an in vivo porcine model. METHODS This is a single-institution, double-blinded, technical assessment study in a porcine in vivo model. Fourteen participants (ten senior surgeons with >1000 laparoscopic procedures and four junior surgeons) had to assess and mark lengths of small bowel in both laparoscopic and open surgical approaches. Each participant was assigned to measure and mark specific, randomized distances (range 25-197 cm) in both laparoscopic and open approaches using color-coded vessel loops. Actual participant-marked distances were compared to the assigned distances followed by Bland-Altman plots and linear regression analysis to determine accuracy and proportional error trends. Study data were further compared to available data sets from previously published studies. RESULTS Laparoscopy measurements were significantly shorter than required (difference 33.8 ± 28.7 cm, P < 0.001, 95% CI 17.8-49.7). The measuring error was proportional to the length of the measured segment (63% of the required distances, IQR 58.9-79.0%, P = 0.02). At laparotomy, mean difference and standard deviation were lower (1.5 cm ± SD 15 cm) and not statistically significant (P = 0.7). Re-analysis of previously published data sets validated the observed errors in laparoscopic bowel measurement (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Small bowel length assessment during laparoscopy is inaccurate and associated with substantial variability. There is a need to develop a standardized laparoscopic technique for measuring small bowel length which is simple, reproducible, and easy to learn.","Gazer, Benny; Rosin, Danny; Bar-Zakai, Barak; Willenz, Udi; Doron, Ofer; Gutman, Mordechai; Nevler, Avinoam",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5538-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28409379/,762

This study investigated the use of a sequential compression mechanical pump with thigh-high sleeves with compression cycles timed to venous refilling. We hypothesized that this would recruit pooled venous blood from the lower limbs, maintain the central blood volume and thus decrease the incidence of hypotension. METHODS One hundred parturients scheduled for elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia were recruited and randomly assigned to use of either a mechanical pump (Group M) or control (Group C). A standardized protocol for co-hydration and anesthesia was followed. Hypotension, defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure by >20% from baseline, was treated with 6-mg boluses of intravenous ephedrine. The incidence of hypotension was defined as the primary outcome. Median ephedrine requirement was taken as a measure of the severity of hypotension. RESULTS Hypotension occurred in 12 of 47 (25.5%) patients in Group M compared to 27 of 45 (60%) in Group C (P=0.001). The median [range] ephedrine dose was greater in Group C (12 [0-24]mg) compared to Group M (0 [0-12]mg) (P<0.001). There was no difference between groups in the time to onset of hypotension.

Biomolecular condensates-organelles that lack a membrane-provide a strategy for cellular organization without a physical barrier while allowing for the dynamic, responsive organization of the cell. It is well established that intrinsically disordered protein domains drive condensate formation via liquid-liquid phase separation; however, the role of globular protein domains on intracellular phase separation remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the overall charge of globular proteins would dictate the formation and concentration of condensates and systematically probed this hypothesis with supercharged proteins and nucleic acids in E. coli. Within this study, we demonstrated that condensates form via electrostatic interactions between engineered proteins and RNA and that these condensates are dynamic and only enrich specific nucleic acid and protein components. Herein, we propose a simple model for the phase separation based on protein charge that can be used to predict intracellular condensate formation. With these guidelines, we have paved the way to designer functional synthetic membraneless organelles with tunable control over globular protein function.","Yeong, Vivian; Werth, Emily G; Brown, Lewis M; Obermeyer, Allie C",ACS central science,https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.0c01146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33376791/,762

The aim was to explore the factors that determine the intention to opt for COVID-19 vaccine among HCP from two southern European countries. An anonymous online self-administered survey using Google Forms has been conducted between December 1st to December 15th, 2020 among the HCP in Greece and the Republic of Cyprus. A total of 2,238 HCPs participated in the study (1,220/54.5% from Republic of Cyprus and 1,018 from Greece). Overall 1,082 (48.3%) stressed their intention to get vaccinated (64.4% for Greece and 34.9% for Republic of Cyprus). The main reasons for those who intend to get the COVID-19 vaccine include self (94.2%), family (98.7%), and patients protection (95.2%) as well as mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic (95.4%). The multivariate logistic regression that was performed for the total sample revealed that the following variables were significantly associated with an increased probability to get vaccinated against COVID-19: being a physician, a member of the nursing personnel, paramedical staff, working in Greece, age, the belief that influenza vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and the rating of the overall management of COVID-19 pandemic in the country and from the public hospitals. Physicians were more likely to get vaccinated against COVID-19 than other HCP. The age was a predictor of COVID-19 uptake intention in the Republic of Cyprus. The belief that there was a successful management of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the intention to COVID-19 vaccination uptake.","Raftopoulos, Vasilios; Iordanou, Stelios; Katsapi, Angeliki; Dedoukou, Xanthi; Maltezou, Helena C",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1896907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754953/,762
69440,Mesenteric root dissection with individualized ileo-colic vessel ligation versus mesenteric pedicle stapling.,2016,"Previous studies have shown modulation of corticospinal output of the agonist muscle when a known-movement is prepared but withheld until a response signal appearance, reflecting motor preparation processes. However, modulation in the antagonist muscles has not been described, despite the fact that reaching movements require precise coordination between the activation of agonist and antagonist muscles. In this study, participants performed an instructed-delay reaction time (RT) task, with randomized elbow flexion and extension movements. The aim was to assess the time course modulation of corticospinal output in two antagonist muscles, by simultaneously quantified the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in biceps brachii and triceps brachii, and the amplitude and direction of elbow movements evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Depending on the prepared movement direction, a specific modulation of corticospinal output was observed, MEPs and TMS-evoked movements amplitude being relatively greater for extension compared to flexion. At the end of motor preparation, a decrease in MEPs amplitude was observed for both biceps brachii and triceps brachii, regardless of the prepared movement direction. In contrast, the probability of evoking movement in the flexion direction and the amplitude of TMS-evoked movement decreased at the end of preparation for flexion, but not for extension. Together, these results confirm the existence of inhibitory processes at the end of the motor preparation, probably to avoid a premature motor response. Moreover, they provide evidence of differences in the corticospinal control of elbow flexor and extensor muscles with patterns of modulation that are not necessarily reciprocal during motor preparation.","Neige, Cécilia; Massé-Alarie, Hugo; Gagné, Martin; Bouyer, Laurent J; Mercier, Catherine",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29186189/,762

Black and Latino Americans have experienced a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, reflecting persistent structural inequalities that increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 and mortality risk for those infected. We estimate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 y for 2020, for the total US population and by race and ethnicity, using four scenarios of deaths-one in which the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred and three including COVID-19 mortality projections produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Our medium estimate indicates a reduction in US life expectancy at birth of 1.13 y to 77.48 y, lower than any year since 2003. We also project a 0.87-y reduction in life expectancy at age 65 y. The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black-White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites (a phenomenon known as the Latino or Hispanic paradox), would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y.","Andrasfay, Theresa; Goldman, Noreen",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2014746118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33446511/,762
70042,Laparoscopic ovariectomy in dogs: comparison between single portal and two-portal access.,2009,"OBJECTIVES Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly transmitted through respiration and direct contact. The status of the infection in the female genital system is still unknown. The study aimed to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the vaginal fluid of women with COVID-19 infection in reproductive period. MATERIAL AND METHODS Women who were between the ages of 18-50 years and clinically confirmed to have COVID-19 infection at our hospital between 20 April-31 May 2020 were included in the study. Women who were in their menstrual cycle during the study and who had a known cervical intraepithelial lesion and/or cancer, sexually transmitted disease and history and/or symptoms of vaginitis were excluded from the study. In patients in whom no pathology was detected during the examination, a sample was taken from the vaginal fluid for PCR by using Dacron tip swab. Analysis was performed with Genesig Real-Time PCR COVID-19 kit (Primer Design, England). RESULTS Eighteen women who were in reproductive period and diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 38.16 ± 8.54. None of the patients were in their menopause period. The clinical symptoms of these women were similar to those of confirmed severe COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 was found to be negative in the samples taken from the vaginal fluid in all patients. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 virus was not detected in the vaginal fluid of the patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in reproductive period.","Uslu Yuvacı, Hilal; Aslan, Mehmet Musa; Köse, Osman; Akdemir, Nermin; Toptan, Hande; Cevrioğlu, Arif Serhan; Altındiş, Mustafa; Köroğlu, Mehmet",Ginekologia polska,https://doi.org/10.5603/gp.a2021.0018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33751509/,762
70047,Performance analysis on physical simulator of four different instrument setups in laparo-endoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery.,2014,"Sociological research has traditionally emphasized the importance of post-birth factors (i.e., social, economic, and cultural capital) in the intergenerational transmission of educational advantages, to the neglect of potentially consequential pre-birth endowments (e.g., heritable traits) that are passed from parent to child. In this study, we leverage an experiment of nurture-children who were adopted at birth into nonrelative families-in an effort to simultaneously model the effects associated with both pathways. To do so, we fit a series of simple linear regression models that relate the academic achievement of adopted children to the educational attainments of their adoptive and biological parents, using U.S. data from a recent nationwide sample of birth and adoptive families (the Early Growth and Development Study). Because our dataset includes both ""genetic"" and ""environmental"" relatives, but not ""genetic-and-environmental"" relatives, the separate contributions of each pathway can be identified, as well as possible interactions between the two. Our results show that children's early achievements are influenced not only by the attainments of their adoptive parents, but also the attainments of their birth parents-suggesting the presence of environmental and genetically mediated effects. Supplementary analyses provide little evidence of effect moderation, using both distal and proximate measures of the childhood environment to model gene-by-environment interactions. These findings are robust to a variety of parameterizations, withstand a series of auxiliary checks, and remain intact even after controlling for intrauterine exposures and other measurable variables that could compromise our design. The implications of our results for theory and research in the stratification literature, and for those interested in educational mobility, are discussed.","Halpern-Manners, Andrew; Marahrens, Helge; Neiderhiser, Jenae M; Natsuaki, Misaki N; Shaw, Daniel S; Reiss, David; Leve, Leslie D",Research in social stratification and mobility,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2020.100486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724268/,762

Famotidine is a histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist which blocks the H2 receptors in the parietal cells, decreasing gastric acid secretion. Our review aims to study all the available scientific evidence on famotidine research outcomes systematically to introspect its clinical efficacy and probable mechanisms and clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. METHODOLOGY An electronic search of PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar was performed using MeSH terms ""SARS CoV-2"" OR ""COVID-19"" AND""FAMOTIDINE"". Relevant informationwas extracted from studies reporting the efficacy of famotidine in COVID-19. RESULTS We found a total of 32 studies, out of which only 14 were relevant and were included in our review.Molecular computational studies showed that famotidine selectively acts on viral replication proteases papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). Additionally, it acts via inverse-agonism on the H2 receptors present in neutrophils and eosinophils which leads to inhibition of cytokine release. Clinical study findings have pointed toward significant improvements in COVID-19 patient-reported symptoms in non-hospitalized patients and reduction in intubation or death in critically ill patients associated with the usage of famotidine. However,in one of the studies,famotidine has failed to show any significant benefit in reducing mortality due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION Famotidine has the potential to answer the ongoing global challenge owing to its selective action on viral replication. Additionally, clinical findings in COVID-19 patients support its efficacy to reduce clinical symptoms of COVID-19.We suggest that further optimally powered randomized clinical trials should be carried out to come up with definitive conclusions.","Chenchula, Santenna; Ray, Avik; Sadasivam, Balakrishnan",Drug research,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1397-6763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33757133/,762

Therefore, a systematic review of systematic reviews that evaluated interventions designed to change the practice of health professionals when addressing diet and physical activity with their patients was conducted. MEDLINE Complete; Cochrane database of systematic reviews; PsycINFO; CINAHL Complete; Global Health; Embase; INFORMIT: Health Subset; Health System Evidence and RX for change were searched in March 2019, with no date or language limits. Identified references underwent screening, full-text analyses and data extraction in duplicate. The search identified 15 230 references. Five systematic reviews that provided a narrative syntheses of a combined 38 studies were included. Health professional participants generally reported being satisfied with the training interventions. Heterogeneity between and within included reviews, non-controlled designs of individual studies and low quality of evidence at an individual study level and review level made it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding what interventions are most effective in changing health professionals' knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, attitudes and practice. However, similar gaps in the literature were identified across included reviews. Key areas that could be addressed in future interventions including organization and system-level barriers to providing advice, health professionals' attitudes and motivation and weight stigma have been highlighted. Health professionals and patients could be more involved in the planning and development of interventions that work towards improving diet and physical activity advice and support provided in healthcare.","Yazdizadeh, Bahareh; Walker, Ruth; Skouteris, Helen; Olander, Ellinor K; Hill, Briony",Health promotion international,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaa039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32447397/,762

Therefore, adult-geriatric acute care nurse practitioner students were unable to have on-campus clinical experiences. METHOD An innovative virtual experience was developed, using synchronous platforms for lectures and a virtual patient (VP) encounter. RESULTS Eight students participated in the experience, composed of three interactive lectures and a VP encounter. Students spent an average of 24.88 minutes (range = 20.88 to 35.48) with the VP, followed by debriefing. Students who became frustrated with the technology were identified as those who did not perform the practice session within the virtual platform. CONCLUSION Faculty determined that the virtual experience was a success. They were able to evaluate students' critical thinking and clinical decision-making. Next steps include refinement of the avatar platform as well as forcing completion of a practice session prior to the actual synchronous graded activity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of hypopituitary adult patients followed in a single reference center for pituitary diseases. MetS was defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria. Patients with 18 years or older, presenting two or more anterior pituitary deficiencies associated or not with diabetes insipidus (DI), were included, while patients with hypopituitarism due to Acromegaly or Cushing's disease were excluded. RESULTS We studied 99 hypopituitary patients (52 males, mean age 50.1 ± 16.3 years, mean age at diagnosis 33.7 ± 17.6 years) who have been followed for a mean time of 15.9 ± 10.1 years. Hypothalamic-pituitary tumors and non-tumoral etiologies were observed in 53.4% and 46.6% of the cases, respectively. FSH/LH, GH, TSH, ACTH deficiency and DI was present in 99%, 98.6%, 96%, 81.8%, and 23.2%, respectively. The prevalence of MetS was 39.4% and was significantly higher in patients older than 50 years (p = 0.02), overweight/obese (p < 0.001), with hypopituitarism diagnosed in adult life (p = 0.02), who did not replace GH (p = 0.004) and in smokers (p = 0.007). In the logistic regression model, body mass index (BMI) and GH replacement were significantly associated with the presence of MetS. Reduced HDL cholesterol was the most prevalent component of MetS in hypopituitary patients. CONCLUSIONS MetS is a common finding in adult hypopituitary patients, which is mainly influenced by increased BMI and untreated GH deficiency.

We aimed to study whether the use of intra-arterial papaverine in selected cases of vasospasm was associated with improved cerebral perfusion, arterial reocclusion, or increased hemorrhagic complications. METHODS We retrospectively studied 9 consecutive patients with large artery acute occlusion, treated with stent retriever and intra-arterial papaverine. Onset to administration of intravenous recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator time, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, time to reperfusion, number of passes of the stent retriever, modified Rankin Scale score at discharge, postprocedural hemorrhage, onset to reperfusion time, papaverine dose, and thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade were recorded in all patients. RESULTS After papaverine administration, the caliber of the infused arteries and their flow was increased in all cases. In none of the treated cases a reocclusion occurred after papaverine infusion. In one of the studied patients (11%), a parenchymal bleeding occurred 36 hours postoperatively.

The study aims to assess the associations of circadian rhythm abnormalities (CRA) during the COVID-19 outbreak with mental health in Chinese undergraduates. METHODS A nationwide cross-sectional university-based survey was conducted from 4th February to 12th, 2020. Based on different geographical locations and purposive sampling approach, 19 universities from 16 provinces or municipalities in the mainland of China were selected. A total of 14,789 participants were recruited by using multistage stratified random sampling. The data of CRA were collected by self-reported questionnaires consist of four items involved rest-activity cycle, diet rhythm, wake up rhythm and sleep rhythm. The Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder were applied to evaluate the symptoms of depression and anxiety. Chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression models were used to describe the distributions and associations of CRA and mental health. RESULTS A total of 11,787 students [female: 6731(57.1%)] aged 15-26 years old (M = 20.45, SD = 1.76) were analyzed (response rate: 79.7%). The results showed the percentage of CRA were 17.5-28.7%. The prevalence of depression and anxiety were significantly higher in students with single CRA. Students who reported the coexistence of four CRA were more likely to be with the symptoms of depression (OR: 4.43, 95% CI: 3.91-5.03) and anxiety (OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 2.70-3.60). Dose-response relationships were found between multiple CRA and mental problems. CONCLUSION Circadian rhythm abnormalities are positively associated with mental health among university studies.

Development of EVE may allow us to treat very premature neonates without mechanical ventilation. Meanwhile, elevations in fetal inflammation are associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. In the present study, we analysed fetal survival, inflammation and pulmonary maturation in preterm lambs maintained on EVE therapy using a parallelised umbilical circuit system with a low priming volume. METHODS Ewes underwent surgical delivery at 115 days of gestation (term is 150 days), and fetuses were transferred to EVE therapy (EVE group; n = 5). Physiological parameters were continuously monitored; fetal blood samples were intermittently obtained to assess wellbeing and targeted to reference range values for 2 days. Age-matched animals (Control group; n = 6) were surgically delivered at 117 days of gestation. Fetal blood and tissue samples were analysed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS Fetal survival time in the EVE group was 27.0 ± 15.5 (group mean ± SD) hours. Only one fetus completed the pre-determined study period with optimal physiological parameters, while the other 4 animals demonstrated physiological deterioration or death prior to the pre-determined study end point. Significant elevations (p<0.05) in: i) inflammatory proteins in fetal plasma; ii) selected cytokine/chemokine mRNA expression levels in fetal tissues; and iii) histological inflammatory score in fetal lung, were observed in the EVE group compared to the Control group. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in surfactant protein mRNA expression level between the two groups. CONCLUSION In this study, we achieved limited fetal survival using EVE therapy. Despite this, EVE therapy only induced a modest fetal inflammatory response and did not promote lung maturation. These data provide additional insight into markers of treatment efficacy for the assessment of future studies.","Miura, Yuichiro; Saito, Masatoshi; Usuda, Haruo; Woodward, Eleanor; Rittenschober-Böhm, Judith; Kannan, Paranthaman S; Musk, Gabrielle C; Matsuda, Tadashi; Newnham, John P; Kemp, Matthew W",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473607/,762
72505,Impact of Suture Type on Erosion Rate After Laparoscopic Ventral Mesh Rectopexy: A Case-Matched Study.,2019,"Relapse to smoking is common after initial abstinence with pharmacotherapy and behavioral support and represents a major clinical challenge. Although mechanisms underlying relapse to smoking have not been elucidated, preclinical studies suggest that glutamate receptors may be involved. We sought to test a selective antagonist of the glycine coagonist site on the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, GW468816, for prevention of relapse in recently abstinent smokers. To do so, we enrolled 264 healthy female smokers in an open 8-week smoking cessation intervention with behavioral therapy and a standard dose of transdermal nicotine replacement therapy with taper and additional gum or lozenge as needed for nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Ninety-eight participants achieved 7-day point prevalence abstinence and were randomized into a 5-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, relapse-prevention trial of GW468816 (200 mg/d) and then followed for 60 days after randomization. There was no effect of treatment on abstinence rates at the end of treatment (χ² [1, n = 96] = 0.168, P = 0.838), on the rates of relapse (χ² [1, n = 98] = 0.031, P = 1.000) or lapse (χ² [1, n = 62] = 0.802, P = 0.423), or on time to relapse (χ² [1, n = 98) = 0.001, P = 0.972). No significant relationships were detected between plasma GW468816 concentrations and abstinence, time to relapse, or self-reported craving. In conclusion, despite promising preclinical data that support the use of a selective NMDA glycine site antagonist for prevention of relapse to smoking, we observed no effect of GW468816 on relapse or lapse rates, time to relapse, or craving compared to placebo.","Evins, A Eden; Pachas, Gladys; Mischoulon, David; Urbanoski, Karen; Carlini, Sara; Sousa, Jessica; Bentley, Kate; Rigotti, Nancy A; Nino-Gomez, Johanna; Loebl, Tsafrir; Janes, Amy C; Kaufman, Marc J; Fava, Maurizio",Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcp.0b013e31822bb390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21869693/,762

Although chemokine receptors have been established to play a role in recruitment of effector CD8 T cells to sites of inflammation, their contribution to determination of T-cell fate and shaping of the long-lived memory T-cell population is not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether reduced access to antigen and inflammation through alterations in expression of inflammatory and homeostatic chemokine receptors has an impact on generation of effector and memory CD8 T cells. We found that in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, colocalization of virus-specific CD8 T cells with antigen in spleen is dependent on expression of the inflammatory chemokine receptor, CXCR3. In addition, absence of CXCR3 expression on CD8 T cells leads to formation of fewer short-lived effector cells and more memory precursor cells. Furthermore, the memory CD8 T-cell population derived from CXCR3-deficient cells has fewer cells of the effector memory phenotype and exhibits a recall response of greater magnitude than that of WT cells. These data demonstrate that CD8 T-cell positioning relative to antigen and inflammatory cytokines in secondary lymphoid organs affects the balance of effector and memory T-cell formation and has both a quantitative and qualitative impact on the long-lived memory CD8 T-cell population.","Hu, Joyce K; Kagari, Takashi; Clingan, Jonathan M; Matloubian, Mehrdad",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1101881108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21518913/,762

Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and tunnel-cuffed venous catheters (tCVC) are commonly used vascular access routes and have advantages and disadvantages compared to each other. This study focuses on the effects of AVFs and tCVCs on morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. METHODS The records (between January 2015 and January 2017) of 110 patients (55 patients with AVF and 55 patients with tCVC) under hemodialysis therapy for at least 6 months were evaluated retrospectively. The data about blood tests, hospitalizations, and mortality were compared between patients with AVF and tCVC. FINDINGS Fifty-five patients (25 male, 58 ± 14 years old) were undergoing hemodialysis via AVF. Fifty-five patients (17 male, 63 ± 14 years old) were undergoing hemodialysis via tunneled CVCs. Thirty (54.5%) of the hospitalization patients had AVF and 46 (83.6%) had CVCs (p < 0.01). The only independent predictor of hospitalization was the use of tCVC as vascular access, according to multivariate regression analysis (p = 0.01). Seven (30%) of the dead patients had AVF and 16 (69.6%) had CVCs (p = 0.035). Use of tCVC appeared to be a mortality predictor in univariate regression analysis (p = 0.039). But the significance did not continue in multivariate model (p = 0.578) in which the duration of hemodialysis appeared as the only significant factor (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION Patients undergoing hemodialysis via AVF had fewer all-cause hospitalizations and mortality rate than those using tunneled CVCs.","Celik, Serhat; Gok Oguz, Ebru; Ulusal Okyay, Gulay; Selen, Tamer; Ayli, Mehmet Deniz",The International journal of artificial organs,https://doi.org/10.1177/0391398820952808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962489/,762

We discuss 'beneficial' exposomes (green/natural outdoor spaces, sun exposure, healthy diets and features of built environments) that could synergise with physical activity to prevent metabolic dysfunction, particularly that related to lifestyle diseases of obesity, type-2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Physical activity may also reduce the capacity of some adverse exposomes, specifically those with significant levels of air pollution, to contribute towards metabolic dysfunction. Other exposomes, such as those experienced during pandemics (including COVID-19), potentially limit opportunities for physical activity, and there may be unexpected combined effects of physical activity with other infections (e.g. adenovirus-36) on metabolic health. Finally, we discuss how environments could be better optimised to create exposomes that promote the health benefits of physical activity and likely future directions of this research field.","Gorman, Shelley; Larcombe, Alexander N; Christian, Hayley E",The Journal of endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1530/joe-20-0487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33650530/,762

METHODS We administered and video recorded the Spanish version of the Berg Balance Scale to 20 incomplete SCI patients. Two raters scored the videos on two different occasions at least three weeks apart. We used intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and a confidence interval (CI) of 95% to evaluate the inter-rater and intra-rater (test-retest) reliability of the BBS total scores. RESULTS ICC values for inter-rater reliability at first and second observation were 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-1.00) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.99-1.00), respectively. Intra-rater ICC for rater 1 was 1.00 (95% CI 1.00-1.00) and for rater 2 was 1.00 (95% CI 0.99-1.00). All of them were excellent.

73501,Incidence and management of bleeding complications after gastric bypass surgery in the morbidly obese.,2012,"OBJECTIVES Cerebral vasospasm is one of the leading causes of morbi-mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The aim of this article is to discuss the current status of vasospasm therapy with emphasis on endovascular treatment. METHODS A comprehensive review of the literature obtained by a PubMed search. The most relevant articles related to medical, endovascular and alternative therapies were selected for discussion. RESULTS Current accepted medical options include the oral nimodipine and 'triple-H' therapy (hypertension, hypervolemia and hemodilution). Nimodipine remains the only modality proven to reduce the incidence of infarction. Although widely used, 'triple-H' therapy has not been demonstrated to significantly change overall outcome after cerebral vasospasm. Indeed, both induced hypervolemia and hemodilution may have deleterious effects, and more recent physiologic data favor normovolemia with induced hypertension or optimization of cardiac output. Endovascular options include percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) and intra-arterial (IA) infusion of vasodilators. Multiple case reports and case series have been encountered in the literature using different drug regimens with diverse mechanisms of action. Compared with PTA, IA drug infusion has the advantages of distal penetration and a better safety profile. Its main disadvantages are the more frequent need for repeat treatments and its systemic hemodynamic repercussions. Alternative options using intraventricular/cisternal drug therapy and flow augmentation strategies have also shown possible benefits; however, their use is not yet as well established. CONCLUSION Blood pressure or cardiac output optimization should be the mainstay of hyperdynamic therapy. Endovascular treatment appears to have a positive impact on neurological outcome compared with the natural history of the disease. The role of intraventricular therapy and flow augmentation strategies in association with medical and endovascular treatment may, in the future, play a growing role in the management of patients with severe refractory vasospasm.","Dabus, Guilherme; Nogueira, Raul G",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000354755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25187783/,762

The global pandemic which began in early 2020 has created a number of challenges for the medical community to contain the rate of transmission, especially to health care workers. A minority of the infected population will progress toward severe respiratory distress ultimately requiring mechanical ventilator assistance. Although preliminary data suggest a poor prognosis for those requiring ventilation support, there is a subgroup who will eventually be weaned off. As the pandemic evolves, this cohort of infected, chronically intubated and ventilated individuals will become more prevalent and may require tracheostomy to aid in recovery. Unfortunately, tracheostomy is an aerosol-generating procedure which poses high risks to all members within the operating room, as described by previous authors. There is an urgent need to explore and develop methods to maximize the safety of tracheostomy and other aerosol-generating procedures in order to reduce intraoperative transmission. In the present article, we present a modified technique for negative pressure enclosure in patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy.","Levy, Dylan A; Boey, Howard P; Leff, Peter D","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561321991319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33530740/,762
73596,Natural Orifice Transanal Endoscopic Rectopexy: A Novel Option for Rectal Prolapse.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND To minimize the spread of Coronavirus Disease-2019, Saudi Arabia imposed a nationwide lockdown for over 6 weeks. We examined the impact of lockdown on glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes(T1D) using continuous glucose monitoring(CGM); and assessed whether changes in glycemic control differ between those who attended a telemedicine visit during lockdown versus those who did not. MATERIALS AND METHODS Flash CGM data from 101 individuals with T1D were retrospectively evaluated. Participants were categorized into two groups: Attended a telemedicine visit during lockdown(n=61) or did not attend(n=40). Changes in CGM metrics from the last 2 weeks pre-lockdown period (Feb 25 - March 9, 2020) to the last 2 weeks of complete lockdown period (April 7 - 20, 2020) were examined in the two groups. RESULTS Those who attended a telemedicine visit during the lockdown period had a significant improvement in the following CGM metrics by the end of lockdown: Average glucose(from 180 to 159 mg/dl, p<0.01), glycemic management indicator(from 7.7 to 7.2%, p=0.03), time in range(from 46 to 55%, p<0.01), and time above range(from 48 to 35%, p<0.01) without significant changes in time below range, number of daily scans or hypoglycemic events, and other indices. In contrast, there were no significant changes in any of the CGM metrics during lockdown in those who did not attend telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS A six-week lockdown did not worsen, nor improve, glycemic control in individuals with T1D who did not attend a telemedicine visit. Whereas those who attended a telemedicine visit had a significant improvement in glycemic metrics; supporting the clinical effectiveness of telemedicine in diabetes care.","Alharthi, Sahar K; Alyusuf, Ebtihal Y; Alguwaihes, Abdullah M; Alfadda, Assim; Al-Sofiani, Mohammed E",Diabetes research and clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2021.108682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33539868/,762

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European Association of Urology (EAU) recommend that women with a body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 should consider weight loss prior to consideration for incontinence surgery. This systematic review and meta-analysis will assess this recommendation to aid in the counselling of women with obesity-related urinary incontinence (UI). Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System online (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Cochrane, ClinicalTrials.gov, and SCOPUS were systematically and critically appraised for all peer reviewed manuscripts that suitably fulfilled the inclusion criteria established a priori and presented original, empirical data relevant to weight loss intervention in the management of urinary incontinence. Thirty-three studies and their outcomes were meta-analysed. Weight loss interventions were associated in a decreased prevalence in UI (OR 0.222, 95% CI [0.147, 0.336]), SUI (OR 0.354, 95% CI [0.256, 0.489]), UUI (OR 0.437, 95% CI [0.295, 0.649]) and improved quality of life (PFDI-20, SMD -0.774 (95% CI [-1.236, -0.312]). This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that weight loss interventions are effective in reducing the prevalence of obesity-related UI symptoms in women.

Five factors that are problematic are (a) a sustained systemic inflammatory response in the xenograft recipient, (b) thrombotic microangiopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation, (c) ischemia-reperfusion injury, (d) complement activation, and (e) vascular endothelial cell injury. In xenotransplantation, histones, which are positively charged proteins, are released into the extracellular space from damaged and activated cells, cause cell and tissue damage, and act as danger/damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that mediate inflammation, coagulation disorders, an immune response, and cytotoxicity. We have previously demonstrated that serum histones increase after pig-to-baboon organ transplantation and infection. Treatment of the recipient with tocilizumab (interleukin-6 receptor blockade) reduces the level of serum histones and C-reactive protein.

AIM The study presents a single-center experience and learning curve of thoracoscopic repair of esophageal atresia and tracheo-esophageal (distal) fistula. MATERIAL AND METHODS From 2012 to 2014, 10 consecutive patients with esophageal atresia and tracheo-esophageal fistula were treated thoracoscopically in our center. There were 8 girls and 2 boys. Mean gestational age was 36.5 weeks and mean weight was 2230 g. Four children had associated anomalies. The surgery was performed after stabilization of the patient between the first and fourth day after birth. Five patients required intubation before surgery for respiratory distress. Bronchoscopy was not performed before the operation. RESULTS In 8 patients, the endoscopic approach was successfully used thoracoscopically, while in 2 patients conversion to an open thoracotomy was necessary. In all patients except 1, the anastomosis was patent, with no evidence of leak. One patient demonstrated a leak, which did not resolve spontaneously, necessitating surgical repair. In long-term follow-up, 1 patient required esophageal dilatation of the anastomosis. All patients are on full oral feeding. CONCLUSIONS The endoscopic approach is the method of choice for the treatment of esophageal atresia in our center because of excellent visualization and precise atraumatic preparation even in neonates below a weight of 2000 g.","Nachulewicz, Paweł; Zaborowska, Kamila; Rogowski, Błażej; Kalińska, Anita; Nosek, Marzena; Golonka, Anna; Lesiuk, Witold; Obel, Marcin",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2015.49521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25960794/,762
74917,Impact of a bladder scan protocol on discharge efficiency within a care pathway for ambulatory inguinal herniorraphy.,2013,"Objectives The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses formidable challenges to all health care systems. Serological assays may be used for improving disease management when appropriately applied, for investigating the antibody responses mounted against SARS-CoV-2 infection and for assessing its real prevalence. Although testing the whole population is impractical, well-designed serosurveys in selected subpopulations in specific risk groups may provide valuable information. We evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers (HCW) who underwent molecular testing with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the main hospitals of the Veneto Region of Italy by measuring specific antibodies (Abs). Methods Both immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 S-antigen and N-protein were measured using a validated chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) called Maglumi™ 2000 Plus (New Industries Biomedical Engineering Co., Ltd [Snibe], Shenzhen, China). Results A total of 8,285 HCW were tested. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgM, IgG or both) were detectable in 378 cases (4.6%, 95% CI 4.1-5.0%). Seroconversion was observed in 4.4% of women vs. 5.0% of men, but this difference was not significant. Although detectable antibodies were found in all HCW who developed severe COVID-19 infection (100%), lower seropositivity was found in mild disease (83%) and the lowest prevalence (58%) was observed in asymptomatic subjects. Conclusions Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance for understanding the rate of population that has already developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The present study defined precisely the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of HCW in the Veneto Region, with its prevalence (4.6%) reflecting a relatively low circulation. Symptomatic individuals or those hospitalized for medical care were 100% antibody positive, whilst Abs were only detectable in 58% of asymptomatic carriers.","Plebani, Mario; Padoan, Andrea; Fedeli, Ugo; Schievano, Elena; Vecchiato, Elena; Lippi, Giuseppe; Lo Cascio, Giuliana; Porru, Stefano; Palù, Giorgio",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-1236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32845861/,762

Determining cause of death is critically important. Two methods are proposed to improve consistency and accuracy in the collection and analysis of decedent data in opioid-related poisoning deaths. First, an improved death certificate is needed to collect evaluative data, including: extent to which opioids were judged to 1) cause, 2) contribute to, or 3) be present in investigated deaths; extent to which opioids as a cause of death were found 1) alone, 2) combined with other prescription drugs, 3) combined with alcohol, or 4) combined with illicit drugs; the time of death; the presence or absence of a valid prescription; and the estimated quantity of opioids taken proximal to death. Patient characteristics for analysis include age, gender, race/ethnicity, geographic area (particularly whether urban or rural), body mass index, duration of opioid usage and daily average dose during the last 2 weeks of life, and histories of chronic pain/medical conditions, substance abuse, and mental illness/psychiatric diagnoses. Second, expanding the scope of opioid toxicology categories used to classify and code cause-of-death data reported by death investigators would improve identification of individual drugs and classes most often associated with overdose deaths. Formulation-specific codes should be added to facilitate consistent recording of findings by death investigators and entry into national vital statistics databases.","Webster, Lynn R; Dasgupta, Nabarun",Pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-4637.2011.01132.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21668762/,762

Thus, our goal was to review the literature on COVID and T1DM. RECENT FINDINGS We identified 21 reports focusing on COVID-19 infections among patients with preexisting T1DM (n = 7), incident T1DM presentations during the COVID-19 quarantine (n = 6), and outpatient management of T1DM during the COVID-19 quarantine (n = 8). These studies showed that patients with preexisting T1DM and COVID-19 infection often present with hyperglycemia and/or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Although the risk of in-hospital mortality may be increased, hospitalization rates among patients with T1DM mirror that of the general population. The numbers of patients presenting with incident T1DM during COVID-19 quarantine have remained stable, but cases with severe DKA may have increased. COVID-19 quarantine has also impacted outpatient T1DM management and studies examining changes in glycemic control have shown mixed results. SUMMARY COVID-19 has important implications for patients with type 1 diabetes, but additional studies with larger numbers of patients and longer term follow-up are needed to confirm the early findings highlighted in this review.","Chang, Diana J; Moin, Tannaz","Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",https://doi.org/10.1097/med.0000000000000598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33278126/,762

The aim of the present review is to offer practical guidance on the multidisciplinary approach of AIs.Areas covered:The prevalence of AI is high in the aging population (up to 5-8%); however, hormonally active or malignant conditions are rare. After the discovery of an AI, it is suggested to assess in parallel if the mass is potentially malignant and functionally active. The answer to the former question is mainly based on medical history (extra-adrenal malignancies, new-onset of signs or symptoms) and imaging (conventional radiology and/or nuclear medicine). The answer to the latter question is a complete endocrine evaluation of both cortical (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids) and medullary (catecholamines) secretion.Expert opinion:A multidisciplinary discussion is suggested for patients with adrenal disease, after the exclusion of nonfunctioning benign cortical adenoma, in order to plan a close and tailored follow-up for the suspected malignant or functioning forms. Surgery is advised for patients with malignant disease (adrenocortical cancer) or with clinically relevant secreting neoplasm (primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and pheochromocytoma).","Voltan, Giacomo; Boscaro, Marco; Armanini, Decio; Scaroni, Carla; Ceccato, Filippo",Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1080/17446651.2021.1948327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34240680/,762

75980,Single-incision laparoscopic adrenalectomy in a patient with acute hypokalemic paralysis due to primary hyperaldosteronism.,2017,"In this work we explore the viability of a multimodal sensing device that can be integrated in a wearable form factor for daily, non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. A common approach in previous research has been to rely on measuring the pulse transit time (PTT), which has been shown to be correlated with the BP. In this work, we look into the feasibility of measuring PTT using sensors separated by a small distance on one arm so that any eventual realization of the system is convenient to wear and use over long periods of time. Moreover, we investigate the combined use of two different modalities for cardiovascular measurement: the optical photoplethysmogram (PPG) as well as the bio-potential based impedance (Bio-Z) measurement. These two modalities have been previously only studied on their own or in conjunction with the electrocardiogram (ECG) for the purpose of estimating PTT. We measure the PTT from the wrist to the finger using Bio-Z and PPG sensors, and compare it to the conventional PTT measured from the ECG to PPG at the finger, in order to prove that it can be an effective replacement for existing PTT measurement strategies. Moreover, successful measurement of PTT with two different modalities of sensors at close proximity will allow designs with multiple heterogeneous sensors on a more versatile wearable sensing platform that is optimized for power and is more robust to environmental or skin contact changes. This will enable the next generation of smart watches that capture PTT and BP. Experiments were conducted in vivo with simultaneous ECG, Bio-Z and PPG sensors, and results indicate that the PTT calculated from the Bio-Z and PPG sensors placed at a close distance correlates well with the more established PTT measurement using the ECG in conjunction with PPG, with correlation coefficient as high as 0.92.","Ibrahim, Bassem; Nathan, Viswam; Jafari, Roozbeh",Conference proceedings : ...

76294,Evaluation of pain scores after single-incision and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a randomized control trial in a rural Indian population.,2014,"Although tube current modulation (TCM) is routinely implemented in modern CT scans, no existing CT simulator is capable of generating realistic images with TCM. The goal of this study was to develop such a framework to (1) facilitate patient-specific optimization of TCM parameters and (2) enable future virtual imaging trials (VITs) with more clinically realistic image quality and x-ray flux distributions. The framework was created by developing a TCM module and integrating it with an existing CT simulator (DukeSim). The developed module utilizes scanner-calibrated TCM parameters and two localizer radiographs to compute the mAs for each simulated CT projection. This simulation pipeline was validated in two parts. First, DukeSim was validated in the context of a commercial scanner with TCM (SOMATOM Force, Siemens Healthineers) by imaging a physical CT phantom (Mercury, Sun Nuclear) and its computational analogue. Second, the TCM module was validated by imaging a computational anthropomorphic phantom (ATOM, CIRS) using DukeSim with real and module-generated TCM profiles. The validation demonstrated DukeSim's realism in terms of noise magnitude, noise texture, spatial resolution, and image contrast (with average differences of 0.38%, 6.31%, 0.43%, and -9 HU, respectively). It also demonstrated the TCM module's realism in terms of projection-level mAs and resulting noise magnitude (2.86% and -2.60%, respectively). Finally, the framework was applied to a pilot VIT simulating images of three computational anthropomorphic phantoms (XCAT, with BMIs of 24.3, 28.2, and 33.0) under five different TCM settings. The optimal TCM for each phantom was characterized based on various criteria, such as minimizing mAs or maximizing image quality. ""Very Weak"" TCM minimized noise for the 24.3 BMI phantom, while ""Very Strong"" TCM minimized noise for the 33.0 BMI phantom. This illustrates the utility of the developed framework for future optimization studies of TCM parameters and, more broadly, large-scale VITs with scanner-specific TCM.","Jadick, Giavanna Luisa; Abadi, Ehsan; Harrawood, Brian P; Sharma, Shobhit; Segars, Paul W; Samei, Ehsan",Physics in medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ac2269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464942/,762

This study was designed to prospectively evaluate the changes in bone metabolism after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. METHODS We prospectively enrolled 39 men with early gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy. We excluded women to avoid the effects of menopause. We employed dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to measure bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine. DEXA was performed before and 1 and 2 years after surgery. The serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [1,25(OH)2VD], 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)VD], and estradiol were measured before surgery and every 3 months until 2 years after surgery. RESULTS DEXA revealed that BMD significantly decreased by 0.036 ± 0.033 g/cm2 12 months after gastrectomy (P < 0.001) and by 0.046 ± 0.040 g/cm2 24 months after gastrectomy (P < 0.001). The serum ALP level significantly increased by 38.31 ± 103.8 IU/L 24 months after surgery (P = 0.013). The serum 25(OH)VD level significantly decreased by 4.88 ± 6.42 ng/ml 24 months after surgery (P < 0.001), whereas the serum 1,25(OH)2VD levels were consistently in the normal range. The serum estradiol level significantly increased by 2.94 ± 7.49 pg/ml 12 months after gastrectomy (P = 0.035). A lower preoperative body mass index (BMI) significantly correlated with the reduction in BMD 12 months after surgery; the correlation coefficient was 0.37 (P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that a significant decrease in BMD was observed for up to 24 months after gastrectomy, not only 12 months.","Atsumi, Yosuke; Rino, Yasushi; Wada, Hiroo; Kitani, Yuichi; Ozawa, Yukihiro; Aoyama, Toru; Oshima, Takashi; Yukawa, Norio; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Masuda, Munetaka",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-018-0835-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29748875/,762

However, constraints imposed by the laparoscopic surgery, i.e. the operation of surgical tools in limited spaces, turn simple surgical tasks such as suturing into time-consuming and inconsistent tasks for surgeons. In this paper, we develop an autonomous laparoscopic robotic suturing system. More specific, we expand our smart tissue anastomosis robot (STAR) by developing i) a new 3D imaging endoscope, ii) a novel actuated laparoscopic suturing tool, and iii) a suture planning strategy for the autonomous suturing. We experimentally test the accuracy and consistency of our developed system and compare it to sutures performed manually by surgeons. Our test results on suture pads indicate that STAR can reach 2.9 times better consistency in suture spacing compared to manual method and also eliminate suture repositioning and adjustments. Moreover, the consistency of suture bite sizes obtained by STAR matches with those obtained by manual suturing.","Saeidi, H; Le, H N D; Opfermann, J D; Leonard, S; Kim, A; Hsieh, M H; Kang, J U; Krieger, A",IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation : ICRA : [proceedings].

77279,Transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer.,2011,"OBJECTIVES US hospitals are expected to function without external aid for up to 96 hours during a disaster; however, concern exists that there is insufficient capacity in hospitals to absorb large numbers of acute casualties. The aim of the study was to determine the potential for creation of inpatient bed surge capacity from the early discharge (reverse triage) of hospital inpatients at low risk of untoward events for up to 96 hours. METHODS In a health system with 3 capacity-constrained hospitals that are representative of US facilities (academic, teaching affiliate, community), a variety (N = 50) of inpatient units were prospectively canvassed in rotation using a blocked randomized design for 19 weeks ending in February 2006. Intensive care units (ICUs), nurseries, and pediatric units were excluded. Assuming a disaster occurred on the day of enrollment, patients who did not require any (previously defined) critical intervention for 4 days were deemed suitable for early discharge. RESULTS Of 3491 patients, 44% did not require any critical intervention and were suitable for early discharge. Accounting for additional routine patient discharges, full use of staffed and unstaffed licensed beds, gross surge capacity was estimated at 77%, 95%, and 103% for the 3 hospitals. Factoring likely continuance of nonvictim emergency admissions, net surge capacity available for disaster victims was estimated at 66%, 71%, and 81%, respectively. Reverse triage made up the majority (50%, 55%, 59%) of surge beds. Most realized capacity was available within 24 to 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS Hospital surge capacity for standard inpatient beds may be greater than previously believed. Reverse triage, if appropriately harnessed, can be a major contributor to surge capacity.","Kelen, Gabor D; McCarthy, Melissa L; Kraus, Chadd K; Ding, Ru; Hsu, Edbert B; Li, Guohua; Shahan, Judy B; Scheulen, James J; Green, Gary B",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1097/dmp.0b013e3181a5e7cd; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349868/,762

DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis. SETTING We searched MEDLINE (via Ovid SP), EMBASE (via Ovid SP), and CINAHL from inception to December 2017, along with grey literature. We included articles that described a tool to guide deprescribing of medications. PARTICIPANTS Frail older persons and older persons with limited life expectancy. MEASUREMENTS Narrative description of tools. RESULTS We identified 15 tools and organized them into three main categories: tools (n = 2) that described a model or framework for approaching deprescribing, tools (n = 9) that outlined a deprescribing approach for the entire medication list, and tools (n = 4) that provided medication-specific advice. The complexity of the tools ranged from simple lists to detailed, step-wise protocols. The development methodology varied widely, and the methods used to synthesize the tools were generally not well described. Most tools were based on expert opinion. Only four of the 15 tools have been tested in clinical practice (in very low-quality studies). CONCLUSION Tools exist to help clinicians deprescribe in frail older persons and those with limited life expectancy. These tools may assist clinicians at various stages in the deprescribing process. However, it remains to be investigated whether use of such tools in practice is likely to improve clinical outcomes or reduce inappropriate medication use.

The Safety and Efficacy of NeuroFlo Technology in Ischemic Stroke (SENTIS) trial explored the augmentation of collateral circulation to the ischemic penumbra as a novel approach to stroke treatment. The aim of this post hoc analysis was to examine the effect of age on outcomes in the SENTIS trial. METHODS Using data from the randomized controlled SENTIS trial, we explored outcomes of cerebral blood flow augmentation using the NeuroFlo™ device in patients categorized by age strata at 70 and 80 years. We evaluated outcomes of overall serious adverse event (SAE) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) rates, freedom from all-cause and stroke-related mortality, and independent functional outcome as defined by the modified Rankin Scale score (mRS ≤2). RESULTS The SENTIS as-treated cohort included 251 patients ≥70 years and 107 patients ≥80 years. Elderly SENTIS patients included a higher percentage of women and Caucasians than the younger group. Patients in the older group more frequently had vascular risk factors including hypertension, previous stroke, transient ischemic attacks and atrial fibrillation. However, baseline risk-factor profile, stroke severity, and time to randomization did not differ between the treated and nontreated elderly patients. The older patients treated with NeuroFlo had significantly higher chances for survival and for obtaining an independent functional state (mRS ≤2) compared with those who were not treated. Rates of SAEs and ICHs did not differ between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS NeuroFlo treatment is safe and results in better outcomes for elderly patients. This may be the result of recruitment and support of already existing collateral systems in these patients.","Leker, Ronen R; Molina, Carlos; Cockroft, Kevin; Liebeskind, David S; Concha, Mauricio; Shuaib, Ashfaq; De Deyn, Peter Paul; Burgin, W Scott; Gupta, Rishi; Dillon, William; Diener, Hans-Christoph",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000342668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23075518/,762

A case-control study comparing single-incision, transvaginal, and conventional laparoscopic technique for cholecystectomy.",2014,"Chronic stress is well-known to cause physiological distress that leads to body balance perturbations by altering signaling pathways in the neuroendocrine and sympathetic nervous systems. This increases allostatic load, which is the cost of physiological fluctuations that are required to cope with psychological challenges as well as changes in the physical environment. Recent studies have enriched our knowledge about the role of chronic stress in disease development, especially carcinogenesis. Stress stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), resulting in an abnormal release of hormones. These activate signaling pathways that elevate expression of downstream oncogenes. This occurs by activation of specific receptors that promote numerous cancer biological processes, including proliferation, genomic instability, angiogenesis, metastasis, immune evasion and metabolic disorders. Moreover, accumulating evidence has revealed that β-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) antagonists and downstream target inhibitors exhibit remarkable anti-tumor effects. Psychosomatic behavioral interventions (PBI) and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) also effectively relieve the impact of stress in cancer patients. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for stress in promoting malignancies.

Large-scale campaigns for evidence dissemination and promotion through targeted interventions on social media may help overcome some of these barriers. To date, most breastfeeding research on social media only focuses on content analysis, and there remains limited knowledge about the social networks of online communities (who interacts with whom), influencers in the breastfeeding space and the diffusion of evidence-based knowledge. This study, grounded in social network theory, aims to better understand the breastfeeding communication landscape on Twitter including determining the presence of a breastfeeding network, communities and key influencers. Further, we characterize influencer interactions, roles and the content being shared. The study revealed an overall breastfeeding social network of 3,798 unique individuals (users) and 3,972 tweets with commonly used hashtags (e.g., #breastfeeding and #normalizebreastfeeding). Around one third of users (n = 1,324, 34%) exchanged pornographic content (PC) that sexualized breastfeeding. The non-PC network (n = 2,474 users) formed 144 unique communities, and content flowing within the network was disproportionately influenced by 59 key influencers. However, these influencers had mostly inward-oriented interaction (% composition, E-I index: 47% professionals, -0.18; 41% interested citizens, -0.67; 12% companies, -0.18), limiting opportunities for evidence-based dissemination to the lay public.

Uridine diphosphate dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT) UGT76G1, as a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of SGs with a low heterologous expression level, hinders its application. In this study, a suitable fusion partner, Smt3, was found to enhance the soluble expression of UGT76G1 by 60%. Additionally, a novel strategy to improve the expression of Smt3-UGT76G1 was performed, which co-expressed endogenous genes prpD and malK in Escherichia coli. Notably, this is the first report of constructing an efficient E. coli expression system by regulating prpD and malK expression, which remarkably improved the expression of Smt3-UGT76G1 by 200% as a consequence. Using the high-expression strain E. coli BL21 (DE3) M/P-3-S32U produced 1.97 g/L of Smt3-UGT76G1 with a yield rate of 61.6 mg/L/h by fed-batch fermentation in a 10 L fermenter.

However, the molecular composition of B-cell endosomal trafficking pathways and their specific roles in B-cell responses have not been systematically investigated. Here, we report high-throughput identification of genes regulating B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated antigen internalization using genome-wide functional screens. We show that antigen internalization depends both on constitutive, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and on antigen-induced, clathrin-independent endocytosis mediated by endophilin A2. Although endophilin A2-mediated endocytosis is dispensable for antigen presentation, it is selectively required for metabolic support of B-cell proliferation, in part through regulation of iron uptake. Consequently, endophilin A2-deficient mice show defects in GC B-cell responses and production of high-affinity IgG. The requirement for endophilin A2 highlights a unique importance of clathrin-independent intracellular trafficking in GC B-cell clonal expansion and antibody responses.","Malinova, Dessislava; Wasim, Laabiah; Newman, Rebecca; Martínez-Riaño, Ana; Engels, Niklas; Tolar, Pavel",EMBO reports,https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202051328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323351/,762

Electronic contact thermometer repeatability and reproducibility are highly variable in febrile adults both in the axilla and oral cavity. Infrared thermometry of the skin over the superficial temporal artery is unreliable for measuring core body temperature, particularly in febrile subjects and patients in theatre. The infrared tympanic thermometers tested are acceptable for clinical practice; however, care should be exercised with the different modes of operation offered.","Mangat, Jasdip; Standley, Thomas; Prevost, Andrew; Vasconcelos, Joana; White, Paul",Physiological measurement,https://doi.org/10.1088/0967-3334/31/9/003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20651420/,762
78723,Preventive procedure for stenosis after esophagojejunostomy using a circular stapler and transorally inserted anvil (OrVil™) following laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy and total gastrectomy involving reduction of anastomotic tension.,2021-01-21,"Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis that is endemic in geographical regions of Central and South America. Cases that occur in nonendemic regions of the world are imported through migration and travel. Due to the limited number of cases in Europe, most physicians are not familiar with paracoccidioidomycosis and its close clinical and histopathological resemblance to other infectious and noninfectious disease. To increase awareness of this insidious mycosis, we conducted a systematic review to summarize the evidence on cases diagnosed and reported in Europe. We searched PubMed and Embase to identify cases of paracoccidioidomycosis diagnosed in European countries. In addition, we used Scopus for citation tracking and manually screened bibliographies of relevant articles. We conducted dual abstract and full-text screening of references yielded by our searches. To identify publications published prior to 1985, we used the previously published review by Ajello et al. Overall, we identified 83 cases of paracoccidioidomycosis diagnosed in 11 European countries, published in 68 articles. Age of patients ranged from 24 to 77 years; the majority were male. Time from leaving the endemic region and first occurrence of symptoms considerably varied. Our review illustrates the challenges of considering systemic mycosis in the differential diagnosis of people returning or immigrating to Europe from endemic areas. Travel history is important for diagnostic-workup, though it might be difficult to obtain due to possible long latency period of the disease.","Wagner, Gernot; Moertl, Deddo; Glechner, Anna; Mayr, Verena; Klerings, Irma; Zachariah, Casey; Van den Nest, Miriam; Gartlehner, Gerald; Willinger, Birgit",Journal of fungi,https://doi.org/10.3390/jof7020157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672212/,762
78735,Reproductive Outcomes Among Women of Childbearing Age with Achalasia After Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy: A Single-Center Experience.,2020-07-13,"AIM The aim of this study was to detect predisposing CV risks factors and ECGs changes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS The study population included 60 noncritically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between 16 March and 11 May 2020. Electrographic changes, evaluated from ECGs acquired at admission and at 7 days after starting COVID-19 therapy, were analysed. We also compared 45 patients without CV involvement with 15 patients with new onset of cardiac adverse events during hospitalization. RESULTS ECGs under treatment showed a lower heart rate (HR) (69.45 ± 8.06 vs 80.1 ± 25.1 beats/min, P = 0,001) and a longer QRS (102.46 ± 15.08 vs 96.75 ± 17.14, P = 0.000) and QT corrected (QTc) interval (452.15 ± 37.55 vs 419.9 ± 33.41, P = 0,000) duration than ECGs before therapy. Fifteen patients (25%) showed clinical CV involvement. Within this group, female sex, lower ejection fraction (EF), low serum haemoglobin, high Troponin I levels (TnI), low lymphocytes count, high serum IL-6 levels, or use of Tocilizumab (TCZ) were more represented. CONCLUSIONS Patients admitted for SARS-CoV2 infection and treated with anti-COVID-19 drug therapy develop ECG changes such as reduction in HR and increase in QRS duration and QTc interval. One in four patients developed CV events. Gender, EF, heamoglobin values, TnI, lymphocytes count, IL-6 and use of TCZ can be considered as predisposing factors for CV involvement.","Matteucci, Andrea; Massaro, Gianluca; Sergi, Domenico; Bonanni, Michela; Stifano, Giuseppe; Matino, Matteo; Zerillo, Bartolomeo; Rogliani, Paola; Romeo, Francesco",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512975/,762

79291,A 3-cm Single-port Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Lobectomy for Lung Cancer.,2015,"Despite its great potential in studying brain anatomy and structure, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is marred by artefacts more than any other commonly used MRI technique. In this paper we present a non-parametric framework for detecting and correcting dMRI outliers (signal loss) caused by subject motion. Signal loss (dropout) affecting a whole slice, or a large connected region of a slice, is frequently observed in diffusion weighted images, leading to a set of unusable measurements. This is caused by bulk (subject or physiological) motion during the diffusion encoding part of the imaging sequence. We suggest a method to detect slices affected by signal loss and replace them by a non-parametric prediction, in order to minimise their impact on subsequent analysis. The outlier detection and replacement, as well as correction of other dMRI distortions (susceptibility-induced distortions, eddy currents (EC) and subject motion) are performed within a single framework, allowing the use of an integrated approach for distortion correction. Highly realistic simulations have been used to evaluate the method with respect to its ability to detect outliers (types 1 and 2 errors), the impact of outliers on retrospective correction of movement and distortion and the impact on estimation of commonly used diffusion tensor metrics, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Data from a large imaging project studying older adults (the Whitehall Imaging sub-study) was used to demonstrate the utility of the method when applied to datasets with severe subject movement. The results indicate high sensitivity and specificity for detecting outliers and that their deleterious effects on FA and MD can be almost completely corrected.","Andersson, Jesper L R; Graham, Mark S; Zsoldos, Enikő; Sotiropoulos, Stamatios N",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.06.058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27393418/,762
79420,Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy for colon cancer: early experience with 31 cases.,2011,"PURPOSE To compare patient-ventilator interaction during PSV and PAV+ in patients that are difficult to wean. METHODS This was a physiologic study involving 11 patients. During three consecutive trials (PSV first trial--PSV1, followed by PAV+, followed by a second PSV trial--PSV2, with the same settings as PSV1) we evaluated mechanical and patient respiratory pattern; inspiratory effort from excursion Pdi (swing(Pdi)), and pressure-time products of the transdiaphragmatic (PTPdi) pressures. Inspiratory (delay(trinsp)) and expiratory (delay(trexp)) trigger delays, time of synchrony (time(syn)), and asynchrony index (AI) were assessed. RESULTS Compared to PAV+, during PSV trials, the mechanical inspiratory time (Ti(flow)) was significantly longer than patient inspiratory time (Ti(pat)) (p < 0.05); Ti(pat) showed a prolongation between PSV1 and PAV+, significant comparing PAV+ and PSV2 (p < 0.05). PAV+ significantly reduced delay(trexp) (p < 0.001). The portion of tidal volume (VT) delivered in phase with Ti(pat) (VT(pat)/VT(mecc)) was significantly higher during PAV+ (p < 0.01). The time of synchrony was significantly longer during PAV+ than during PSV (p < 0.001). During PSV 5 patients out of 11 showed an AI greater than 10%, whereas the AI was nil during PAV+. CONCLUSION PAV+ improves patient-ventilator interaction, significantly reducing the incidence of end-expiratory asynchrony and increasing the time of synchrony.","Costa, R; Spinazzola, G; Cipriani, F; Ferrone, G; Festa, O; Arcangeli, A; Antonelli, M; Proietti, R; Conti, G",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-011-2297-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21720909/,762
79931,Simultaneous Totally Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy and Anterior Resection for Synchronous Gastric and Colon Cancer.,2021-06-16,"AIM The aim of this study is to evaluate the extent of myocardial injury by cardiac biomarkers during prolonged targeted temperature management of 24 hours vs 48 hours after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS This randomized Scandinavian multicenter study compares the extent of myocardial injury quantified by area under the curve (AUC) of cardiac biomarkers during prolonged targeted temperature management at 33°C ± 1°C of 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively. Through a period of 2.5 years, 161 comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were randomized to targeted temperature management for 24 hours (n = 77) or 48 hours (n = 84). The AUC was calculated using both high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnTAUC) and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MBAUC) that were based upon measurements of these biomarkers every 6 hours upon admission until 96 hours after reaching target temperature. RESULTS The median hs-cTnTAUC of 33,827 ng/L/h (interquartile range [IQR] 11,366-117,690) of targeted temperature management at 24 hours did not differ significantly from that of 28,973 ng/L/h (IQR 10,656-163,655) at 48 hours. In contrast, the median CK-MBAUC of 1829 μg/L/h (IQR 800-6799) during targeted temperature management at 24 hours was significantly lower than that of 2428 μg/L/h (IQR 1163-10,906) within targeted temperature management at 48 hours, P <.05. CONCLUSION This study of comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors showed no difference between the extents of myocardial injury estimated by hs-cTnTAUC of prolonged targeted temperature management of 48 hours vs 24 hours, although the CK-MBAUC was significantly higher during 48 hours vs 24 hours. Hence, it seems unlikely that the duration of targeted temperature management has a beneficial effect on the extent of myocardial injury after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and may even have a worsening effect.","Grejs, Anders Morten; Gjedsted, Jakob; Thygesen, Kristian; Lassen, Jens Flensted; Rasmussen, Bodil Steen; Jeppesen, Anni Nørgaard; Duez, Christophe Henri Valdemar; Søreide, Eldar; Kirkegaard, Hans",The American journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2016.06.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27477668/,762
80228,A comparison of robotic single-incision and traditional single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2016,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To outline key points for perioperative ICU optimization of nutrition, airway management, blood product preparation and transfusion, antibiotic prophylaxis and transport. RECENT FINDINGS Optimization entails glycemic control for all, with specific attention to type-1 diabetic patients. Transport-related adverse events may be averted with surgery in the ICU. If moving the patient is unavoidable, transport guidelines should be followed and hemodynamic optimization, airway control, and stabilization of mechanical ventilation ensured before transport. Preinduction preparation includes assessment of the airway and high-flow oxygen to prolong apneic oxygenation. Postintubation, a protective positive ventilation strategy, should be employed. Ideal transfusion thresholds are 7 g/dl for hemodynamically stable adult patients, 8 g/dl in orthopedic/cardiac surgery/cardiovascular disease and higher in specific disease states. Antimicrobial prophylaxis within 120 min of incision prevents most surgical site infections. Antibiotic therapy depends on the antibiotics being received in the ICU, the time elapsed since ICU admission, local epidemiology and the type of surgery. Tailored antimicrobial regimens may be continued periprocedurally. If more than 70% of the nutritional requirement cannot be met enterally, parenteral nutrition should be initiated within 5-7 days of surgery or earlier if the patient is malnourished. SUMMARY ICU patients who require surgery may benefit from appropriate perioperative management.","Tankel, James; Zimmerman, Frederic; De Jong, Audrey; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Einav, Sharon",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503036/,762
80279,Successful laparoscopic extirpation of a large omental lipoblastoma in a child.,2015,"Proteoglycans (PGs) are one of the main components in the extracellular matrix of the central nervous system. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), which is composed of major PGs. Similar to keratin sulfate (KS), another GAG, CS inhibits axon regeneration. However, the influence of these GAGs on the pathogenicity of neuroimmunological diseases is unclear. Here, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice lacking CS N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-1 (CSGalNAcT1-KO), an important enzyme for CS synthesis. In our study, CSGalNAcT1-KO mice showed milder EAE symptoms than those in wild-type (WT) mice. The recall response of antigen-specific lymphocytes showed that CSGalNAcT1-KO-derived lymphocytes had a milder cell proliferation response than that in WT-derived lymphocytes. These results suggest that CS contributes toward the induction phase of EAE. We previously performed EAE experiments in GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase KO (GlcNAc6ST-KO) and C6ST1-KO mice, which had reduced KS and reduced CS-C, respectively. EAE in CSGalNAcT1-KO mice was more similar to that in GlcNAc6ST-KO mice than in C6ST1-KO mice. In conclusion, the distinct GAG sugar chains are associated with severe or mild phenotypes of EAE and are therefore potential new therapeutic targets for neuroimmunological diseases, including multiple sclerosis.","Inada, Rino; Miyamoto, Katsuichi; Tanaka, Noriko; Moriguchi, Kota; Kadomatsu, Kenji; Takeuchi, Kosei; Igarashi, Michihiro; Kusunoki, Susumu",Glycobiology,https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwaa072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839819/,762
80385,Comparison of Cosmetic Outcome Between Single-Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy and Conventional Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in Rural Indian Population: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,2015,"BACKGROUND Dilated veins are associated with increased success of peripheral intravenous cannulation, due to its improved visibility and palpability. Comparison of three strategies to achieve venodilation (tourniquet, electrical stimulation, or a combined strategy) on increase in venous size. METHODS A total of 54 volunteers participated in this cross-over observational study with healthy adults, measuring venous cross-sectional area and diameter at six different sites of the upper extremity. Measurements are performed with ultrasound after performing any dilation strategy, and compared with its non-dilated venous size. An increased cross-sectional area of 25 square millimetres was denoted as clinical relevant, which was detected with paired t testing, Wilcoxon signed rank testing or with ANOVA testing. RESULTS The cephalic vein is the greatest at all sites (t=12.43, df=39, P<0.001 for the crosssectional area), unless the largest increase in venous size was obtained in the basilic veins (t=12.11, df=39, P<0.001 for the cross-sectional area). The largest increase in venous size was obtained after electrical stimulation followed by tourniquet application at all measurement sites. Percentage-wise increased the basilic vein with 44% in cross-sectional area and 21% in diameter, which were 37% and 17% for the cross-sectional area and diameter of the cephalic vein. CONCLUSIONS In general, the largest sized veins are situated in the upper arm, of which the cephalic vein has the largest cross-sectional area and diameter. The combination of electrical stimulation followed by tourniquet application resulted in the greatest increase in venous size and is therefore considered as most effective to improve peripheral intravenous cannulation success.","van Loon, Fredericus H; Korsten, Hendrikus H; Dierick-van Daele, Angelique T; Bouwman, Arthur R",Minerva anestesiologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0375-9393.21.15291-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594876/,762
80492,A word of caution: never use tacks for mesh fixation to the diaphragm!,2018,"OBJECTIVE-To assess the knowledge and use of infection control practices (ICPs) among US veterinarians. DESIGN-Anonymous mail-out population survey. PROCEDURES-In 2005 a questionnaire was mailed to US small animal, large animal, and equine veterinarians who were randomly selected from the AVMA membership to assess precaution awareness (PA) and veterinarians' perceptions of zoonotic disease risks. Respondents were assigned a PA score (0 to 4) on the basis of their responses (higher scores representing higher stringency of ICPs); within a practice type, respondents' scores were categorized as being within the upper 25% or lower 75% of scores (high and low PA ranking, respectively). Characteristics associated with low PA rankings were assessed. RESULTS-Generally, respondents did not engage in protective behaviors or use personal protective equipment considered appropriate to protect against zoonotic disease transmission. Small animal and equine veterinarians employed in practices that had no written infection control policy were significantly more likely to have low PA ranking. Male gender was associated with low PA ranking among small animal and large animal veterinarians; equine practitioners not working in a teaching or referral hospital were more likely to have low PA ranking than equine practitioners working in such institutions. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Results indicated that most US veterinarians are not aware of appropriate personal protective equipment use and do not engage in practices that may help reduce zoonotic disease transmission. Gender differences may influence personal choices for ICPs. Provision of information and training on ICPs and establishment of written infection control policies could be effective means of improving ICPs in veterinary practices.","Wright, Jennifer G; Jung, Sherry; Holman, Robert C; Marano, Nina N; McQuiston, Jennifer H",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.232.12.1863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18598158/,762

The biological results reveal that our compounds showed excellent cytotoxicity toward three common human cancer cell lines (SW620, PC-3 and NCI-H23) with IC50 values ranging from 0.09 to 0.007 µM. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was equipotent or even up to 10-times more potent than adriamycin and up to 205-times more potent than SAHA. Among the series of N- hydroxypropenamides, compounds 10a-d were the most potent HDAC inhibitors as well as cytotoxicity toward the cell lines tested. In addition, the strong inhibitory activites toward HDAC of our compounds were observed with IC50 values of below-micromolar range. Especially, compound 4a inhibited HDAC6 with an IC50 value of 29-fold lower than that against HDAC2 isoform. Representative compounds 4a and 7a were found to significantly arrest SW620 cells at G0/G1 phase. Compounds 7a and 10a were found to strongly induce apoptosis in SW620 cells. Docking studies revealed some important features affecting the selectivity against HDAC6 isoform.

SETTING Telemark county, in the south-eastern part of Norway. DESIGN Longitudinal study with 5 years follow-up. PARTICIPANTS The Telemark study is a longitudinal study of the general working population in Telemark county, Norway, aged 16 to 50 years at baseline in 2013 (n=7952) and after 5-year follow-up. OUTCOME MEASURE Self-reported information on work ability (moderate and poor) and sick leave (short-term and long-term) was assessed at baseline, and during a 5-year follow-up. RESULTS Obesity (OR=1.64, 95% CI: 1.32 to 2.05) and smoking (OR=1.62, 95% CI: 1.35 to 1.96) were associated with long-term sick leave and, less strongly, with short-term sick leave. An unhealthy diet (OR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.43), and smoking (OR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.24 to 2.25) were associated with poor work ability and, to a smaller extent, with moderate work ability. A higher lifestyle risk score was associated with both sick leave and reduced work ability. Only few associations were found between unhealthy lifestyle factors and sick leave or reduced work ability within disease groups. CONCLUSION Lifestyle risk factors were associated with sick leave and reduced work ability. To evaluate these associations further, studies assessing the effect of lifestyle interventions on sick leave and work ability are needed.","De Bortoli, Marit Müller; Oellingrath, Inger M; Fell, Anne Kristin Moeller; Burdorf, Alex; Robroek, Suzan J W",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550269/,762

Residuals effect from surgery/anaesthesia and opioid analgesics may worsen respiration during the first nights after bariatric surgery. The aim of this observational study was to monitor respiration on the first postoperative night following elective bariatric surgery. Methods: This observational study aimed to determine the incidence and severity of hypo/apnoea in low risk obsess patients undergoing elective bariatric surgery in general anesthaesia. Patients with known or suspected sleep respiratory disturbances was not included. ESS was scored prior to surgery. Oxygen desaturation was analyzed by continuous respiratory monitoring. Mean oxygen saturation (SpO2), nadir SPo2, apnoea/hypopnea index and oxygen desaturation index was assess by standard tools. Results: 45 patients were monitored with portable polygraphy equipment (Embletta, ResMed) during the first postoperative night at the general ward following elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The prop ESS was 0-5 in 22, 6-10 in 14 and 11-16 in 6 of the patients studied (missing data 3). Mean SpO2 was 93%; 10 patients had a mean SpO2 of less than 92% and 4 of less than 90%. The lowest mean SpO2 was 87%. There were 16 patients with a nadir SpO2 of less than 85%, lowest nadir SpO2 being 63%. An Apnoea Hypo/apnoea Index (AHI) > 5 was found in 2 patients only (AHI 10 and 6), and an Oxygen Desaturation index (ODI) > 5 was found in 3 patients (24, 10 and 6, respectively). 3 patients had more prolonged (> 30 seconds) apnoea with nadir SpO2 81%, 83% and 86%. ESS score and type of surgery did not impact on respiration/oxygenation during the observation period. Conclusions: A low mean SpO2 and episodes of desaturation were not uncommon during the first postoperative night following elective bariatric surgery in patients without history of night time breathing disturbance. AHI and/or ODI of more than 5 were only rarely seen. Night-time respiration monitoring provided seemingly sparse additional information.

Here we report on the pharmacokinetics of JPC-3210 in mice and monkeys and the results of in vitro screening assays, including the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes. In mice, JPC-3210 was rapidly absorbed and had an extensive tissue distribution, with a brain tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio of about 5.4. JPC-3210 had a lengthy plasma elimination half-life of about 4.5 days in mice and 11.8 days in monkeys. JPC-3210 exhibited linear single-oral-dose pharmacokinetics across the dose range of 5 to 40 mg/kg of body weight with high oral bioavailability (∼86%) in mice. Systemic blood exposure of JPC-3210 was 16.6% higher in P. berghei-infected mice than in healthy mice. In vitro studies with mice and human hepatocytes revealed little metabolism and the high metabolic stability of JPC-3210. The abundance of human metabolites from oxidation and glucuronidation was 2.0% and 2.5%, respectively. CYP450 studies in human liver microsomes showed JPC-3210 to be an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 isozymes, suggesting the possibility of a metabolic drug-drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by these isozymes. In vitro studies showed that JPC-3210 is highly protein bound to human plasma (97%).

The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of vildagliptin vs. glimepiride in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) reduction at week 52. METHODS Patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy (HbA(1c) 6.5-8.5%) and receiving a stable dose of metformin (mean dose 1898 mg/day; mean duration of use 36 months) were randomized 1:1 to receive vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily, n = 1396) or glimepiride (titrated up to 6 mg/day; mean dose 4.5 mg/day, n = 1393). RESULTS Non-inferiority of vildagliptin was demonstrated (97.5% confidence interval 0.02%, 0.16%) with a mean (SE) change from baseline HbA(1c) (7.3% in both groups) to week 52 endpoint of -0.44% (0.02%) with vildagliptin and -0.53% (0.02%) with glimepiride. Although a similar proportion of patients reached a target HbA(1c) level of <7% with vildagliptin and glimepiride (54.1 and 55.5%, respectively), a greater proportion of patients reached this target without hypoglycaemia in the vildagliptin group (50.9 vs. 44.3%; p < 0.01). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) reductions were comparable between groups (mean [SE] -1.01 [0.06] mmol/l and -1.14 [0.06] mmol/l respectively). Vildagliptin significantly reduced body weight relative to glimepiride (mean [SE] change from baseline -0.23 [0.11] kg; between-group difference -1.79 kg; p < 0.001) and resulted in a 10-fold lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than glimepiride (1.7 vs. 16.2% of patients presenting at least one hypoglycaemic event; 39 vs. 554 hypoglycaemic events, p < 0.01). No severe hypoglycaemia occurred with vildagliptin compared with 10 episodes with glimepiride (p < 0.01), and no patient in the vildagliptin group discontinued because of hypoglycaemia compared with 11 patients in the glimepiride group. The incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and adjudicated cardiovascular events was 74.5, 7.1 and 0.9%, respectively, in patients receiving vildagliptin, and 81.1, 9.5 and 1.6%, respectively, in patients receiving glimepiride. CONCLUSIONS When metformin alone fails to maintain sufficient glycaemic control, the addition of vildagliptin provides comparable efficacy to that of glimepiride after 52 weeks and displays a favourable AE profile, with no weight gain and a significant reduction in hypoglycaemia compared with glimepiride.","Ferrannini, E; Fonseca, V; Zinman, B; Matthews, D; Ahrén, B; Byiers, S; Shao, Q; Dejager, S","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00994.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19125777/,762

In a prospective clinical trial, registrations in eight dogs neutered by laparoscopic ovariectomy (LOE) were compared with eight dogs subjected to open ovariohysterectomy (OHE). For comparisons phases were used: phase zero=steady state after induction of anaesthesia; phase one=opening of abdomen; phase two=severing of ovarian pedicles; and, phase three=abdominal closure. During LOE, mean systolic blood pressure increased by 7 mmHg (p=0.05) and 15 mmHg (p=0.01) from phase zero to phase one and two, respectively, and during OHE by 3 mmHg (ns) and 29 mmHg (p<0.0001), respectively. The increase from phase one to phase two differed between groups (p=0.03). Heart rate did not change.

81884,Feasibility and safety of intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy after laparoscopic total gastrectomy: inverted T-shaped anastomosis using linear staplers.,2013,"PURPOSE Commercially available mechanical devices for gastrointestinal anastomosis are mostly made in overseas. Japanese female surgeons have described these devices as being too large and difficult to handle. This study investigated the degree of satisfaction and problems experienced by Japanese surgeons in using various staplers for mechanical anastomosis. METHODS A questionnaire was prepared and sent via email to 5,537 members of the Japanese Society of Gastroenterological Surgery. The questionnaire included sex, age, surgical glove size, degree of satisfaction with various mechanical staplers, stress felt when using the staplers in anastomosis, and problems regarding the devices. RESULTS Valid responses were received from 241 respondents (167 males, 74 females, response rate 4.9 %). The satisfaction rate ranged from 0 to 100 %. The average glove size in males was significantly larger than that in females (median: 7.0 versus 6.0; P < 0.0001). Surgeons with glove size 6.0 or smaller felt stress more frequently than those with size 6.5 or larger (median: 40 vs. 20 %; P < 0.0001). Surgeons with glove size 6.0 and smaller experienced more difficulties during firing and releasing. CONCLUSION The satisfaction rates with currently available mechanical staplers were low. Japanese surgeons with small hands felt more stress when using the staplers. Ergonometric consideration is necessary in stapler design.","Kono, Emiko; Tomizawa, Yasuko; Matsuo, Tomoko; Nomura, Sachiyo",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-012-0303-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22914886/,762

The role that seasonal influenza vaccinations may play is generally not included in the debate. We performed an analysis investigating a possible link between the vaccination coverage rate (VCR) in the elderly (≥ 65 years of age) and COVID-19 infection risk or disease severity. Data from Europe (country-wise) and the USA (state-wise) were investigated separately. We found statistically significant positive correlations between the VCR and reported COVID-19 incidence, as well as mortality for Europe and the USA. A statistically significant positive correlation was also found between the VCR and the COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) for Europe. For the USA, the VCR/CFR correlation was not statistically significant. Our analysis indicates that receiving seasonal influenza vaccination(s) in the past might be an additional risk factor for the elderly in terms of enhanced susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and higher likelihood of a lethal outcome in case of infection. More research about this possible risk factor is urgently needed.","Consortium, Ebmphet",SSRN,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3621446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32714123/,762
82332,"A pilot prospective randomized, controlled trial comparing LigaSure™ tissue fusion technology with the ForceTriad™ energy platform to the electrosurgical pencil on rates of atrial fibrillation after pulmonary lobectomy and mediastinal lymphadenectomy.",2015,"Background Ileus is common after gastrointestinal surgery and has been identified as a research priority. Several issues have limited previous research, including a widely accepted definition and agreed outcome measure. This review is the first stage in the development of a core outcome set for the return of bowel function after gastrointestinal surgery. It aims to characterize the extent of variation in current outcome reporting. Methods A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) and the Cochrane Library was performed for 1990-2017. RCTs of adults undergoing gastrointestinal surgery, including at least one reported measure relating to return of bowel function, were eligible. Trial registries were searched across the same period for ongoing and completed (but not published) RCTs. Definitions of ileus and outcome measures describing the return of bowel function were extracted. Results Of 5670 manuscripts screened, 215 (reporting 217 RCTs) were eligible. Most RCTs involved patients undergoing colorectal surgery (161 of 217, 74·2 per cent). A total of 784 outcomes were identified across all published RCTs, comprising 73 measures (clinical: 63, 86 per cent; radiological: 6, 8 per cent; physiological: 4, 5 per cent). The most commonly reported outcome measure was 'time to first passage of flatus' (140 of 217, 64·5 per cent). The outcomes 'ileus' and 'prolonged ileus' were defined infrequently and variably. Conclusion Outcome reporting for the return of bowel function after gastrointestinal surgery is variable and not fit for purpose. An agreed core outcome set will improve the consistency, reliability and clinical value of future studies.","Chapman, S J; Thorpe, G; Vallance, A E; Harji, D P; Lee, M J; Fearnhead, N S",BJS open,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs5.102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734010/,762

METHODS A total of 60 treatment-naïve patients with macular edema who underwent intravitreal aflibercept injections (2 mg/0.05 mL) with at least one year of follow-up were analyzed in this retrospective and comparative study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the number of intravitreal aflibercept injections administered in the loading phase. The 3+PRN group comprised 27 patients, whereas the 5+PRN group comprised 33 patients. The visual and anatomical outcomes were compared between the two groups at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. RESULTS Both 3+PRN and 5+PRN, showed statistically significant improvements in the best-corrected visual acuity and central macular thicknesse throughout the study period (p<0.001 and, p<0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of changes in the best-corrected visual acuity and central macular thickness (p=0.453 and, p=0.784, respectively). The mean number of intravitreal aflibercept injections was significantly greater in the 5+PRN group (6.1 ± 0.8) than in the 3+PRN group (3.9 ± 0.8) (p<0.001). CONCLUSION The 3+PRN and 5+PRN regimens showed similar 12-month visual and anatomical outcomes following treatment with intravitreal aflibercept injections in patients with macular edema.","Cakir, Akin; Erden, Burak; Bolukbasi, Selim; Sever, Ozkan; Erkul, Sezin Ozdogan; Osmanbasoglu, Ozen Ayranci; Karaca, Gulderen; Elcioglu, Mustafa Nuri",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,https://doi.org/10.5935/0004-2749.20200078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084817/,762

83048,Safety and feasibility during the initial learning process of intracorporeal Billroth I (delta-shaped) anastomosis for laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.,2015,"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) might maximize the advantages of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) by reducing postoperative pain and improving cosmesis. However, the safety and feasibility of SILC has not yet been established. This study assesses safety, patient reported outcome measures and feasibility of SILC versus conventional LC. METHODS Literature search for RCT's comparing SILC with conventional LC in gallstone-related disease was performed in PubMed and Embase. The conventional LC was defined as two 10-mm and two 5-mm ports. Study selection was done according to predefined criteria. Two reviewers assessed the risk of bias. Pooled outcomes were calculated for adverse events, pain, cosmesis, quality of life and feasibility using fixed-effect and random-effects models. RESULTS Nine RCT's were included with total of 860 patients. No mortality was observed. More mild adverse events (RR 1.55; 95% CI 0.99-2.42) and significantly more serious adverse events (RR 3.00; 95% CI 1.05-8.58) occurred in the SILC group. Postoperative pain (MD -0.46; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.18) and cosmesis (SMD 2.38; 95% CI 1.50-3.26) showed significantly better results for the SILC group, but no differences were observed in quality of life. Operating time (MD 23.12; 95% CI 11.59-34.65) and the need for additional ports (RR 11.43; 95% CI 3.48-37.50) were significantly higher in the SILC group. No difference was observed in conversion to open cholecystectomy or hospital stay longer than 24 h. CONCLUSIONS SILC does not provide any clear advantages over conventional LC except for less postoperative pain and improved cosmesis. It is questionable whether these advantages outweigh the higher occurrence of adverse events and shortcomings in feasibility. Considering considerable heterogeneity and low methodological quality of the studies it is advisable to perform well-designed RCT's in the future to address the safety and clinical benefits of SILC.","Evers, Laura; Bouvy, Nicole; Branje, Dion; Peeters, Andrea",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5381-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28039641/,762

Several surgical techniques have been described in the literature, responding differently to nonoperative treatment. The aim of this study is to describe a modified technique of stabilizing an AC joint dislocation with the new Infinity-Lock Button System, in order to demonstrate that it is effective in optimizing outcomes and decreasing complications. METHODS this is a retrospective study of 15 patients who underwent surgical stabilization of the AC joint dislocation between 2018 and 2019, through modified surgical technique using the Infinity-Lock Button System. Active range of motion (ROM), Specific Acromio Clavicular Score (SACS) and Constant Score (CS) were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at last 18 months follow up. Patients rated their outcomes as very good, good, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory. RESULTS a total of twelve patients rated their outcome as very good and three as good; no patients were dissatisfied with surgery. The mean Constant Score increased from 38 points preoperatively to 95 postoperatively, the average SACS score decreased from 52 points preoperatively to 10 postoperatively, both significantly. No complications were detected. CONCLUSION the described technique is effective for treatment of chronic grade III AC joint dislocation, resulting in elevated satisfaction ratings and predictable outcomes.

83665,Laparoscopy-Guided Transthoracic Transdiaphragmatic Radiofrequency Ablation for Hepatic Tumors Located Beneath the Diaphragm.,2016,"Parental vaccine hesitancy is becoming an increasingly important public health concern in the United States. In March 2020, an assessment of the latest CDC National Immunization Survey data found that more than one-third of U.S. children between the ages of 19 and 35 months were not following the recommended early childhood immunization schedule. Furthermore, a 2019 national survey found that approximately 1 in 4 parents reported serious concerns towards vaccinating their children. Vaccine hesitancy is now associated with a decrease in vaccine coverage and an increase in vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks and epidemics in the United States. Many studies have focused on understanding and defining the new socio-medical term, vaccine hesitancy; few have attempted to summarize past and current health communication interventions and strategies that have been successful or unsuccessful in tackling this growing phenomenon. This systematic literature review will attempt to aid public health professionals with a catalogue of health communication interventions and strategies to ultimately address and prevent parental vaccine hesitancy in the long term. Out of 1239 search results, a total of 75 articles were included for analysis, ranging from systematic reviews, quantitative surveys, and experimental designs to ethnographic and qualitative studies. For the presentation of results, a taxonomy was used to organize communication interventions according to their intended purpose. The catalogue of interventions was further broken down into specific components and themes that were identified in the literature as essential to either the success or failure in preventing and addressing parental vaccine hesitancy towards childhood vaccines.","Olson, Olivia; Berry, Corinne; Kumar, Nirbhay",Vaccines,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33049956/,762

83987,Perioperative Complications and Outcome of Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in 20 Dogs.,2016,"BACKGROUND The MIRUS™ (TIM, Koblenz, Germany) is an electronical gas delivery system, which offers an automated MAC (minimal alveolar concentration)-driven application of isoflurane, sevoflurane, or desflurane, and can be used for sedation in the intensive care unit. We investigated its consumption of volatile anesthetics at 0.5 MAC (primary endpoint) and the corresponding costs. Secondary endpoints were the technical feasibility to reach and control the MAC automatically, the depth of sedation at 0.5 MAC, and awakening times. Mechanically ventilated and sedated patients after major surgery were enrolled. Upon arrival in the intensive care unit, patients obtained intravenous propofol sedation for at least 1 h to collect ventilation and blood gas parameters, before they were switched to inhalational sedation using MIRUS™ with isoflurane, sevoflurane, or desflurane. After a minimum of 2 h, inhalational sedation was stopped, and awakening times were recorded. A multivariate electroencephalogram and the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) were used to assess the depth of sedation. Vital signs, ventilation parameters, gas consumption, MAC, and expiratory gas concentrations were continuously recorded. RESULTS Thirty patients obtained inhalational sedation for 18:08 [14:46-21:34] [median 1st-3rd quartiles] hours. The MAC was 0.58 [0.50-0.64], resulting in a Narcotrend Index of 37.1 [30.9-42.4] and a RASS of - 3.0 [- 4.0 to (- 3.0)]. The median gas consumption was significantly lowest for isoflurane ([ml h-1]: isoflurane: 3.97 [3.61-5.70]; sevoflurane: 8.91 [6.32-13.76]; and desflurane: 25.88 [20.38-30.82]; p < 0.001). This corresponds to average costs of 0.39 € h-1 for isoflurane, 2.14 € h-1 for sevoflurane, and 7.54 € h-1 for desflurane. Awakening times (eye opening [min]: isoflurane: 9:48 [4:15-20:18]; sevoflurane: 3:45 [0:30-6:30]; desflurane: 2:00 [1:00-6:30]; p = 0.043) and time to extubation ([min]: isoflurane: 10:10 [8:00-20:30]; sevoflurane: 7:30 [4:37-14:22]; desflurane: 3:00 [3:00-6:00]; p = 0.007) were significantly shortest for desflurane. CONCLUSIONS A target-controlled, MAC-driven automated application of volatile anesthetics is technically feasible and enables an adequate depth of sedation. Gas consumption was highest for desflurane, which is also the most expensive volatile anesthetic. Although awakening times were shortest, the actual time saving of a few minutes might be negligible for most patients in the intensive care unit. Thus, using desflurane seems not rational from an economic perspective. Trial registration Clinical Trials Registry (ref.: NCT03860129).

We report clinical and angiographic results of endovascular treatment of OphA aneurysms together with the efficacy of the balloon occlusion test (BOT). METHODS From August 2005 to December 2013, 31 consecutive patients with 33 OphA aneurysms were treated in our institution. The patients were classified into two groups according to the location of the OphA within the aneurysmal sac. The BOT was performed in 28 patients using a hypercompliant balloon before endovascular coiling. Collateral circulation between the external carotid artery and the OphA was examined and visual function tests were performed before and after treatment. Patient demographics, angiographic and clinical outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Among the 28 patients who underwent the BOT, intact collateral circulation was demonstrated in 26 (92.9%) patients and complete occlusion of the OphA was obtained in three patients after coiling. Retrograde filling of the OphA with choroidoretinal blush was observed on post-procedural angiography and no specific visual symptoms were reported during the follow-up period. Complete embolization was achieved in 30 lesions (96.8%) and only five patients (16.1%) had minor recanalization. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of OphA aneurysms can be performed safely and effectively in conjunction with BOT. The BOT may give useful information to predict visual outcome in patients whose OphA is likely to be threatened by the coiling procedure and to determine the optimal treatment strategy.","Kim, Byungjun; Jeon, Pyoung; Kim, Keonha; Yang, Narae; Kim, Sungtae; Kim, Hyungjin; Byun, Hongsik; Jo, Kyung-Il",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26113563/,762

DESIGN Systematic review of systematic reviews. DATA SOURCES We systematically searched the databases PubMed and CINAHL for the period 2007-April 2017. We also performed additional searches. REVIEW METHODS Two reviewers independently selected the reviews using a stepwise procedure, assessed the methodological quality of the selected reviews, and extracted the data using a predefined extraction format. We performed descriptive synthesis. RESULTS Eleven systematic reviews were included. Several quality criteria were described referring to the importance of following the nursing process and using standardized nursing terminologies. In addition, some evidence-based instruments were described for assessing the quality of nursing documentation, such as the D-Catch. Furthermore, several requirements for formats and systems of electronic nursing documentation were found that refer to the importance of user-friendliness and development in consultation with nursing staff. CONCLUSION Aligning documentation with the nursing process, using standard terminologies, and using user-friendly formats and systems appear to be important for high-quality nursing documentation. The lack of evidence-based quality indicators presents a challenge in the pursuit of high-quality nursing documentation. IMPACT There is uncertainty in nursing practice about which criteria have to be met to achieve high-quality documentation. Aligning documentation with the nursing process, using standard terminologies, and using user-friendly formats and systems appear to be important. These findings can help nursing staff and care organizations enhance the quality of nursing documentation.","De Groot, Kim; Triemstra, Mattanja; Paans, Wolter; Francke, Anneke L",Journal of advanced nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.13919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30507044/,762
84434,"Revisional bariatric surgery for failed gastric banding in Asia: a review of choice of revisional procedure, surgical technique and postoperative complication rates.",2011,"Human Respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is the most common pathogen which causes acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in infants. Recently, virus-host interaction is a hot spot of virus related research, and it needs to be further elaborated on its host interactions during RSV infection. Here, we found that RSV infection significantly increased the expression of cypA in clinical patients, mice or epithelial cells. Therefore, we evaluated the function of cypA in RSV replication and demonstrated that virus proliferation was accelerated in cypA knockdown host cells, but restrained in cypA overexpressed host cells. Furthermore, we proved that cypA limited RSV replication depending on its PPIase activity. Moreover, we performed liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer and the results showed that cypA could interact with several viral proteins, such as RSV-N, RSV-P and RSV-M2-1. Finally, the interaction between cypA and RSV-N was certificated by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Those results provided strong evidence that cypA may play an inhibitory role in RSV replication through interacting with RSV-N via its PPIase activity.IMPORTANCERSV-N, packed the viral genome to form the ribonuceloprotein complex (RNP), which is recognized by RSV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex to initiate the viral replication and transcription, plays an indispensable role in viral biosynthesis process. CypA, binding to RSV-N, may impair this function by weakening the interaction between RSV-N and RSV-P, thus leading to decrease viral production. Our research provides a novel insight into cypA antiviral function by binding to viral capsid protein to inhibit viral replication, which may be helpful for new antiviral drug exploration.","Liang, Wenzhang; Zhang, Yue; Li, Miao; Al-Shaebi, Fadhl; Li, Jian; Zhang, Jing; Wei, Lin",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00563-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011546/,762

DESIGN A systematic review of studies published between January 2019 and October 2020 without study design or language restrictions. SETTING Data sourced from Ovid Embase Classic+Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, relevant bibliographies and the John Hopkins University COVID-19 database. PATIENTS Mothers with confirmed COVID-19 and breastmilk tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome and antibodies in breastmilk. RESULTS We included 50 articles. Twelve out of 183 women from 48 studies were positive for SARS-CoV-2 genome in their breastmilk (pooled proportion 5% (95% CI 2% to 15%; I2=48%)). Six infants (50%) of these 12 mothers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with one requiring respiratory support. Sixty-one out of 89 women from 10 studies had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in their breastmilk (pooled proportion 83% (95% CI 32% to 98%; I2=88%)). The predominant antibody detected was IgA. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 genome presence in breastmilk is uncommon and is associated with mild symptoms in infants. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be a more common finding. Considering the low proportion of SARS-CoV-2 genome detected in breastmilk and its lower virulence, mothers with COVID-19 should be supported to breastfeed.","Zhu, Faith; Zozaya, Carlos; Zhou, Qi; De Castro, Charmaine; Shah, Prakesh S",Archives of disease in childhood.

85603,Delta-shaped anastomosis in totally robotic Billroth I gastrectomy: technical aspects and short-term outcomes.,2016,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with systemic inflammation, which may dysregulate platelet function. Total Thrombus-Formation Analysis System (T-TAS) is a flow-chamber device that analyses platelet-mediated thrombus formation in capillary channels through the following parameters: (1) the area under the flow-pressure curve (AUC), (2) occlusion start time (OST), time needed to reach OST, and (3) occlusion time (OT), time needed to reach the occlusion pressure. METHODS AND FINDINGS Sixty-one COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive, subintensive, and low intensive care were prospectively enrolled according to the time of admission: group A (up to 8 days) (n = 18); group B (from 9 to 21 days) (n = 19), and group C ( > 21 days) (n = 24). T-TAS measurements were performed at enrolment and after 7 days. Median OST was similar among groups. AUC was lower in group A compared to B (p = 0.001) and C (p = 0.033). OT was longer in group A compared to B (p = 0.001) and C (p = 0.028). Platelet count (PC) was higher in group B compared to A (p = 0.024). The linear regression showed that OT and AUC were independent from PC in group A (OT: 0.149 [95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.326 to 0.624], p = 0.513 and AUC: 0.005 [95% CI: -0.008 to 0.017], p = 0,447). In contrast, in group B, PC was associated with OT (-0.019 [-0.028 to 0.008], p = 0.023) and AUC (0.749 [0.358-1.139], p = 0,015), similarly to group C. Conversely, patients with different illness severity had similar T-TAS parameters. CONCLUSION COVID-19 patients display an impaired platelet thrombus formation in the early phase of the disease compared to later stages and controls, independently from illness severity.","Ghirardello, Stefano; Lecchi, Anna; Artoni, Andrea; Panigada, Mauro; Aliberti, Stefano; Scalambrino, Erica; La Marca, Silvia; Boscarino, Marco; Gramegna, Andrea; Properzi, Paolo; Abruzzese, Chiara; Blasi, Francesco; Grasselli, Giacomo; Mosca, Fabio; Tripodi, Armando; Peyvandi, Flora",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1722919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33545735/,762

The CeNP nanogel (Ce-nGel) was fabricated by the fructose-mediated reduction of Cerium oxide solutions within the PVA matrix. The influences of different experimental limitations on PVA nanogel formations were examined. The nanogel particle sizes were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and determined to range from ∼10 to 50 nm. Additionally, glycerol was added to the Ce-nGels, and the resulting compositions (Ce-nGel-Glu) were coated on cotton fabrics to generate the wound bandaging composite. The cumulative drug release profile of the Cerium from the bandage was found to be ∼38% of the total loading after two days. Additionally, antibacterial efficacy was developed for Gam positive and negative microorganisms. Moreover, we examined in vivo healing of skin wounds formed in mouse models over 24 days. In contrast to the untreated wounds, rapid healing was perceived in the Ce-nGel-Glu-treated wound with less damage. These findings indicate that Ce-nGel-Glu-based bandaging materials could be a potential candidate for wound healing applications in the future.","Cao, Lianlian; Shao, Guojing; Ren, Fengmei; Yang, Minghua; Nie, Yan; Peng, Qian; Zhang, Peng",Drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1080/10717544.2020.1858998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594917/,762

It can be used to simultaneously quantify and visualize hemodynamics or morphology disorders. 4D flow MRI is more comprehensive and accurate than two-dimensional (2D) PC MRI and echocardiography. 4D flow MRI provides numerous hemodynamic parameters that are not limited to the basic 2D parameters, including wall shear stress (WSS), pulse wave velocity (PWV), kinetic energy, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), pressure gradient, and flow component analysis. 4D flow MRI is widely used to image many parts of the body, such as the neck, brain, and liver, and has a wide application spectrum to cardiac diseases and large vessels. This present review aims to summarize the hemodynamic parameters of 4D flow MRI technology and generalize their usefulness in clinical practice in relation to the cardiovascular system. In addition, we note the improvements that have been made to 4D flow MRI with the application of new technologies. The application of new technologies can improve the speed of 4D flow, which would benefit clinical applications.","Zhuang, Baiyan; Sirajuddin, Arlene; Zhao, Shihua; Lu, Minjie",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/qims-20-1234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34476199/,762

Sequence database searches for CGI-58 like proteins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) revealed 24 proteins with At4g24160, a member of the alpha/beta-hydrolase family of proteins being the closest homolog. At4g24160 contains three motifs that are conserved across the plant species: a GXSXG lipase motif, a HX(4)D acyltransferase motif, and V(X)(3)HGF, a probable lipid binding motif. Dendrogram analysis of yeast ICT1, CGI-58, and At4g24160 placed these three polypeptides in the same group. Here, we describe and characterize At4g24160 as, to our knowledge, the first soluble lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase in plants. A lipidomics approach revealed that At4g24160 has additional triacylglycerol lipase and phosphatidylcholine hydrolyzing enzymatic activities. These data establish At4g24160, a protein with a previously unknown function, as an enzyme that might play a pivotal role in maintaining the lipid homeostasis in plants by regulating both phospholipid and neutral lipid levels.","Ghosh, Ananda K; Chauhan, Neha; Rajakumari, Sona; Daum, Guenther; Rajasekharan, Ram",Plant physiology,https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.109.144261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19700561/,762
86790,Improved immediate postoperative pain following laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy using self-adhering mesh.,2018,"BACKGROUND A variety of alpha-blockers are used for treating lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Silodosin is a novel, more selective alpha-blocker, which is specific to the lower urinary tract and may have fewer side effects than other alpha-blockers. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of silodosin for the treatment of LUTS in men with BPH. SEARCH METHODS We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status up until 13 June 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all parallel, randomized controlled trials. We also included cross-over designs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included 19 unique studies with 4295 randomized participants across four comparisons for short-term follow-up. The mean age, prostate volume, and International Prostate Symptom Score were 66.5 years, 38.2 mL, and 19.1, respectively. Silodosin versus placeboBased on four studies with a total of 1968 randomized participants, silodosin may reduce urologic symptom scores in an appreciable number of men (mean difference (MD) -2.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.23 to -2.08; low-quality evidence). Silodosin likely does not result in a clinically important reduction in quality of life (MD -0.42, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.13; moderate-quality evidence). It may not increase rates of treatment withdrawal for any reason (relative risk (RR) 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.66; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of silodosin on cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.45; very low-quality evidence). Silodosin likely increases sexual adverse events (RR 26.07, 95% CI 12.36 to 54.97; moderate-quality evidence); this would result in 180 more sexual adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 82 more to 388 more). Silodosin versus tamsulosinBased on 13 studies with a total of 2129 randomized participants, silodosin may result in little to no difference in urologic symptom scores (MD -0.04, 95% CI -1.31 to 1.24; low-quality evidence) and quality of life (MD -0.15, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.22; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about treatment withdrawals for any reason (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.69; very low-quality evidence). Silodosin may result in little to no difference in cardiovascular adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.12; low-quality evidence). Silodosin likely increases sexual adverse events (RR 6.05, 95% CI 3.55 to 10.31; moderate-quality evidence); this would result in 141 more sexual adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 71 more to 261 more). Silodosin versus naftopidilBased on five studies with a total of 763 randomized participants, silodosin may result in little to no differences in urologic symptom scores (MD -0.85, 95% CI -2.57 to 0.87; low-quality evidence), quality of life (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.27; low-quality evidence), treatment withdrawal for any reason (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.93; low-quality evidence), and cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.56; low-quality evidence). Silodosin likely increases sexual adverse events (RR 5.93, 95% CI 2.16 to 16.29; moderate-quality evidence); this would result in 74 more sexual adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 17 more to 231 more). Silodosin versus alfuzosinBased on two studies with a total of 155 randomized participants, silodosin may or may not result in a clinically important increase in urologic symptom scores (MD 3.83, 95% CI 0.12 to 7.54; low-quality evidence). Silodosin likely results in little to no difference in quality of life (MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.74; moderate-quality evidence). We found no event of treatment withdrawal for any reason. Silodosin may not reduce cardiovascular adverse events (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.24; low-quality evidence) but likely increases sexual adverse events (RR 37.21, 95% CI 5.32 to 260.07; moderate-quality evidence); this would result in 217 more sexual adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 26 more to 1000 more). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Silodosin may reduce urologic symptom scores in an appreciable number of men compared to placebo. Quality of life and treatment withdrawals for any reason appears similar. Its efficacy appears similar to that of other alpha blockers (tamsulosin, naftopidil and alfuzosin) but the rate of sexual side effects is likely higher. Our certainty in the estimates of effect was lowered due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision.","Jung, Jae Hung; Kim, Jiye; MacDonald, Roderick; Reddy, Balaji; Kim, Myung Ha; Dahm, Philipp",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012615.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161773/,762
86906,A Single Intercostal Space Thoracoscopic Approach for Minimally Invasive Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy.,2017,"Spearheaded by the therapeutic use of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19, synthetic immunology has entered the clinical arena. CARs are recombinant receptors for antigen that engage cell surface molecules through the variable region of an antibody and signal through arrayed T cell activating and costimulatory domains. CARs allow redirection of T cell cytotoxicity against any antigen of choice, independent of MHC expression. Patient T cells engineered to express CARs specific for CD19 have yielded remarkable outcomes in subjects with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies, setting off unprecedented interest in T cell engineering and cell-based cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we present the challenges to extend the use of CAR T cells to solid tumors and other pathologies. We further highlight progress in CAR design, cell manufacturing and genome editing, which in aggregate hold the promise of generating safer and more effective genetically instructed immunity. Novel engineered cell types, including innate T cell types, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived immune cells, are on the horizon, as are applications of CAR T cells to treat autoimmunity, severe infections and senescence-associated pathologies.

87022,Needlescopic-assisted laparoendoscopic single-site adrenalectomy.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Presoaking meshes for hernia repair with antiseptics prior to implantation could decrease the adhesion of microorganisms to the material surface and reduce the risk of antibiotic resistances. In this work, we evaluate chlorhexidine and allicin (natural antiseptic not yet tested for these purposes) against vancomycin as antiseptics to be used in the pretreatment of a heavyweight polypropylene mesh using an in vitro model of bacterial contamination. METHODS Solutions of saline, vancomycin (40 µg/mL), allicin (1,000 µg/mL), chlorhexidine (2%-0.05%) and the combination allicin-chlorhexidine (900 µg/mL-0.05%) were analyzed with agar diffusion tests in the presence of 106 CFU Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923. Additionally, sterile fragments of Surgipro (1 cm2) were soaked with the solutions and cultured onto contaminated agar plates for 24/48/72 h. The antimicrobial material DualMesh Plus was utilized as positive control. At every time, the inhibition zones were measured and the bacterial adhesion to the mesh surface quantified (sonication, scanning electron microscopy). Cytotoxicity of the treatments was examined (alamarBlue) using rabbit skin fibroblasts. RESULTS The largest zones of inhibition were created by allicin-chlorhexidine. Chlorhexidine was more effective than vancomycin, and allicin lost its effectiveness after 24 h. No bacteria adhered to the surface of the DualMesh Plus or the meshes soaked with vancomycin, chlorhexidine and allicin-chlorhexidine. On the contrary, saline and allicin allowed adherence of high loads of bacteria. Vancomycin had no toxic effects on fibroblasts, while allicin and chlorhexidine exerted high toxicity. Cytotoxicity was significantly reduced with the allicin-chlorhexidine combination. CONCLUSIONS The use of antiseptics such as chlorhexidine, alone or combined with others like allicin, could represent an adequate prophylactic strategy to be used for hernia repair materials because soaking with these agents provides the mesh with similar antibacterial properties to those observed after soaking with vancomycin, similar to the effect of DualMesh Plus.","Pérez-Köhler, Bárbara; García-Moreno, Francisca; Bayon, Yves; Pascual, Gemma; Bellón, Juan Manuel",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25962163/,762

One of the emission sources of these compounds to environment is wastewater discharged from conventional wastewater treatment systems, which are not designed to cope with this type of pollution. Thus, due to the widely discussed properties of aerobic granular activated sludge in the literature - a conducted study has proven its ability to remove LMW PAHs (naphthalene (Nap), acenaphthylene (Acy), acenaphthene (Ace), fluorene (Flu), phenanthrene (Phe) and anthracene (Ant)) from wastewater by biosorption process at varying loadings of organic compounds expressed as BOD (kg/kg·d) on the activated sludge mass. The maximum biosorption of Nap was 605 µg/kgd.m., Acy equals to 134 µg/kgd.m., Ace equals to 355 µg/kgd.m. Flu equals to 104 µg/kgd.m. Phe equal to 204 µg/kgd.m. and Ant equal to 173 µg/kgd.m. The study showed that the BOD loading rate is one of the factors affecting the biosorption process of LMW PAHs. However, as the amount of adsorbed LMW PAHs increased, the condition of aerobic granular activated sludge deteriorated, which was evidenced by gradual increase in the values of technological parameters of activated sludge (SVI, HRT, SRT) and a smaller increase in activated sludge dry mass.","Ofman, Piotr; Skoczko, Iwona; Włodarczyk-Makuła, Maria",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118540/,762
87131,Preliminary application of a single-port access technique for laparoscopic ovariohysterectomy in dogs.,2015,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Striatal GABAergic neuron is known as a key regulator in adult neurogenesis. However, the specific role of striatal GABAergic neuronal activity in the promotion of neurological recovery after ischemic stroke remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetic approach to investigate these effects and mechanism. METHODS Laser stimulation was delivered via an implanted optical fiber to inhibit or activate the striatal GABAergic neurons in Gad2-Arch-GFP or Gad2-ChR2-tdTomato mice (n=80) 1 week after 60-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurological severity score, brain atrophy volume, microvessel density, and cell morphological changes were examined using immunohistochemistry. Gene expression and protein levels of related growth factors were further examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. RESULTS Inhibiting striatal GABAergic neuronal activity improved functional recovery, reduced brain atrophy volume, and prohibited cell death compared with the control (P<0.05). Microvessel density and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) expression in the inhibition group were also increased (P<0.05). In contrast, activation of striatal GABAergic neurons resulted in adverse effects compared with the control (P<0.05). Using cocultures of GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, we further demonstrated that the photoinhibition of GABAergic neuronal activity could upregulate bFGF expression in endothelial cells, depending on the presence of astrocytes. The conditioned medium from the aforementioned photoinhibited 3-cell coculture system protected cells from oxygen glucose deprivation injury. CONCLUSIONS After ischemic stroke, optogenetic inhibition of GABAergic neurons upregulated bFGF expression by endothelial cells and promoted neurobehavioral recovery, possibly orchestrated by astrocytes. Optogenetically inhibiting neuronal activity provides a novel approach to promote neurological recovery.","Jiang, Lu; Li, Wanlu; Mamtilahun, Muyassar; Song, Yaying; Ma, Yuanyuan; Qu, Meijie; Lu, Yifan; He, Xiaosong; Zheng, Jieyu; Fu, Zongjie; Zhang, Zhijun; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Wang, Yongting",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.117.019017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146880/,762
87141,Outcomes of robot-assisted versus laparoscopic repair of small-sized ventral hernias.,2017,"The gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei is a saprophyte and the cause of melioidosis. Natural infection is most commonly reported in northeast Thailand and northern Australia but also occurs in other parts of Asia, South America, and the Caribbean. Melioidosis develops after bacterial inoculation or inhalation, often in relation to occupational exposure in areas where the disease is endemic. Clinical infection has a peak incidence between the fourth and fifth decades; with diabetes mellitus, excess alcohol consumption, chronic renal failure, and chronic lung disease acting as independent risk factors. Most affected adults ( approximately 80%) in northeast Thailand, northern Australia, and Malaysia have >/=1 underlying diseases. Symptoms of melioidosis may be exhibited many years after exposure, commonly in association with an alteration in immune status. Manifestations of disease are extremely broad ranging and form a spectrum from rapidly life-threatening sepsis to chronic low-grade infection. A common clinical picture is that of sepsis associated with bacterial dissemination to distant sites, frequently causing concomitant pneumonia and liver and splenic abscesses. Infection may also occur in bone, joints, skin, soft tissue, or the prostate. The clinical symptoms of melioidosis mimic those of many other diseases; thus, differentiating between melioidosis and other acute and chronic bacterial infections, including tuberculosis, is often impossible. Confirmation of the diagnosis relies on good practices for specimen collection, laboratory culture, and isolation of B. pseudomallei. The overall mortality rate of infected persons is 50% in northeast Thailand (35% in children) and 19% in Australia.","Peacock, Sharon J; Schweizer, Herbert P; Dance, David A B; Smith, Theresa L; Gee, Jay E; Wuthiekanun, Vanaporn; DeShazer, David; Steinmetz, Ivo; Tan, Patrick; Currie, Bart J",Emerging infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1407.071501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18598617/,762
87251,Flexible versus rigid single-port peritoneoscopy: a randomized controlled trial in a live porcine model followed by initial experience in human cadavers.,2012,"BACKGROUND There is considerable evidence of widespread emotional distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. A growing number of studies have assessed posttraumatic growth related to the current pandemic; but, none have considered whether reported growth is real or illusory (i.e., characterized by avoidant or defensive coping that results in higher levels of distress). The purpose of this study was to extend this literature by assessing growth specific to the pandemic in people reporting high levels of COVID-related stress and estimating the extent of real and illusory COVID-19-related growth. METHODS Participants were 893 adults from Canada and the United States with high levels of COVID-related stress who provided complete responses on measures of posttraumatic growth, disability, and measures of general and COVID-related distress as part of a larger longitudinal survey. RESULTS Approximately 77 % of participants reported moderate to high growth in at least one respect, the most common being developing greater appreciation for healthcare workers, for the value of one's own life, for friends and family, for each day, as well as changing priorities about what is important in life and greater feelings of self-reliance. Consistent with predictions, cluster analysis identified two clusters characterized by high growth, one comprising 32 % of the sample and reflective of real growth (i.e., reporting little disability and stable symptoms across time) and the other comprising 17 % of the sample and reflective of illusory growth (i.e., reporting high disability and worsening symptoms). These clusters did not differ in terms of socially desirable response tendencies; but, the illusory growth cluster reported greater increases in alcohol use since onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSION Consistent with research regarding personal growth in response to prior pandemics and COVID-19, we found evidence to suggest moderate to high levels of COVID-related growth with respect to appreciation for healthcare workers, life, friends and family, and self-reliance. Findings from our cluster analysis support the thesis that many reports of COVID-related personal growth reflect ineffectual pandemic-related coping as opposed to true growth. These findings have important implications for developing strategies to optimize stress resilience and posttraumatic growth during chronically stressful events such as pandemics.","Asmundson, Gordon J G; Paluszek, Michelle M; Taylor, Steven",Journal of anxiety disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34004367/,762

Here, the authors propose a sulcus-centered resection strategy for this malformation, provide technical details, and assess the efficacy and safety of this technique. The main purpose of the sulcus-centered resection is to remove the folded gray matter surrounding a dysplastic sulcus, particularly that at the bottom of the sulcus. The authors also retrospectively reviewed the records of 88 consecutive patients with FCD II treated with resective surgery between January 2015 and December 2018. The demographics, clinical characteristics, electrophysiological recordings, neuroimaging studies, histopathological findings, surgical outcomes, and complications were collected. After the exclusion of diffusely distributed and gyrus-based lesions, 71 patients (30 females, 41 males) who had undergone sulcus-centered resection were included in this study. The mean (± standard deviation) age of the cohort was 17.78 ± 10.54 years (38 pediatric patients, 33 adults). Thirty-five lesions (49%) were demonstrated on MRI; 42 patients (59%) underwent stereo-EEG monitoring before resective surgery; and 37 (52%) and 34 (48%) lesions were histopathologically proven to be FCD IIa and IIb, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 3.34 ± 1.17 years, 64 patients (90%) remained seizure free, and 7 (10%) had permanent neurological deficits including motor weakness, sensory deficits, and visual field deficits. The study findings showed that in carefully selected FCD II cases, sulcus-centered resection is an effective and safe surgical strategy.","Zhao, Baotian; Zhang, Chao; Wang, Xiu; Wang, Yao; Liu, Chang; Mo, Jiajie; Zheng, Zhong; Zhang, Kai; Shao, Xiao-Qiu; Hu, Wenhan; Zhang, Jianguo",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.5.jns20751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764170/,762

As a result, the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) is planning to award the first certificates in EMS medicine in the fall of 2013. The purpose of subspecialty certification in EMS, as defined by ABEM, is to standardize physician training and qualifications for EMS practice, to improve patient safety and enhance the quality of emergency medical care provided to patients in the prehospital environment, and to facilitate integration of prehospital patient treatment into the continuum of patient care. In February 2011, ABEM established the EMS Examination Task Force to develop the Core Content of EMS Medicine (Core Content) that would be used to define the subspecialty and from which questions would be written for the examinations, to develop a blueprint for the examinations, and to develop a bank of test questions for use on the examinations. The Core Content defines the training parameters, resources, and knowledge of the treatment of prehospital patients necessary to practice EMS medicine. Additionally, it is intended to inform fellowship directors and candidates for certification of the full range of content that might appear on the examinations.

This study aims were to assess the characteristics and outcomes of adults who suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the COVID-19 pandemic treated by emergency medical service (EMS) teams. METHODS All EMS-attended OHCA adults over than 18 years in the Polish EMS registry were analyzed. The retrospective EMS database was conducted. EMS interventions performed between March 1, and April 30, 2020 were retrospectively screened. RESULTS In the study period EMS operated 527 times for OHCA cases. The average age of patients with OHCA was 67.8 years. Statistically significantly more frequently men were involved (64.3%). 298 (56.6%) of all OHCA patients had resuscitation attempted by EMS providers. Among resuscitated patients, 73.8% were cardiac etiology. 9.4% of patients had return of spontaneous circulation, 27.2% of patients were admitted to hospital with ongoing chest compression. In the case of 63.4% cardiopulmonary resuscitation was ineffective and death was determined. CONCLUSIONS The present study found that OHCA incidence rate in the Masovian population (central region of Poland) in March-April 2020 period was 12.2/100,000 adult inhabitants. Return of spontaneous circulation in EMS was observed only in 9.4% of resuscitated patients. The presence of shockable rhythms was associated with better prognosis. The prehospital mortality, even though it was high, did not differ from those reported by other studies.","Borkowska, Magdalena J; Smereka, Jacek; Safiejko, Kamil; Nadolny, Klaudiusz; Maslanka, Maciej; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Jaguszewski, Milosz J; Szarpak, Lukasz",Cardiology journal,https://doi.org/10.5603/cj.a2020.0135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140396/,762

Filovirus disease is characterized by uncontrolled virus replication and the activation of host responses that contribute to pathogenesis. Underlying these phenomena is the potent suppression of host innate antiviral responses, particularly the type I interferon response, by viral proteins, which allows high levels of viral replication. In this Review, we describe the mechanisms used by filoviruses to block host innate immunity and discuss the links between immune evasion and filovirus pathogenesis.","Messaoudi, Ilhem; Amarasinghe, Gaya K; Basler, Christopher F",Nature reviews.

88353,Does the learning curve during laparoscopic colectomy adversely affect costs?,2010,"Major insect lineages have independently acquired bacterial species, mainly from Gamma-proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes class, which could be nutritional mutualistic factories, facultative mutualists that protect against biotic and abiotic stresses, or reproductive manipulators (which alter the fertility of the host species in its benefit). Some of them are enclosed in bacteriocytes to assure their maternal transmission over generations. All of them show an increased level of genetic drift due to the small population size and the continuous population bottlenecking at each generation, processes that have shaped their genome, proteome, and morphology. Depending on the nature of the relationship, the degree of genome plasticity varies, i.e., obligate nutritional mutualistic symbionts have extremely small genomes lacking mobile elements, bacteriophages, or recombination machinery. Under these conditions, endosymbionts face high mutational pressures that may drive to extinction or symbiont replacement. How do then they survive for such long evolutionary time, and why do they show a genome stasis? In this chapter, after a brief introduction to the problem, we will focus on the genome changes suffered by these endosymbionts, and on the mutational robustness mechanisms, including the moonlighting chaperone GroEL that could explain their long prevalence from an evolutionary perspective by comparing them with free-living bacteria.","Sabater-Muñoz, Beatriz; Toft, Christina",Results and problems in cell differentiation,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51849-3_3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263869/,762

We hypothesized that the startle reflex component contained in E3 will decrease during vibration. METHODS Sixteen healthy individuals were included in the study. CSP was recorded from slightly contracted right thenar muscles after painful index finger stimulation, before, during, and immediately after vibration. The values of the percentage change of E3 relative to pre-stimulus baseline (E3%) were compared before, during, and after vibration for each individual. RESULTS There was a reduction in E3% during vibration and the values returned to normal immediately after vibration (153.1 ± 43.5%, 115.2 ± 30.2%, 154.9 ± 68.2%, respectively; p = 0.030). DISCUSSION E3 is reduced during vibration in healthy individuals, presumably due to suppression of a reflex component, which is superimposed upon the known resynchronization of motoneurons.","Gündüz, Ayşegül; Ayas, Selahattin; Kofler, Markus; Aydın, Şenay; Kızıltan, Meral Erdemir",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04557-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648049/,762

In spite of effective yearly vaccinations to protect individuals against influenza-related health complications, especially with certain chronic co-morbid illnesses, persistent racial/ethnic disparities exist in influenza immunization. African Americans continue to experience low vaccination uptake, stemming, at least in part, from years of bias in and mistrust of orthodox medicine, safety concerns, and environmental barriers to vaccine access. The novel respiratory coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, causes COVID-19, leading to a pandemic that in the U.S. has exerted severe physical, psychological, and economic tolls on the African Americans and other disadvantaged communities. These two respiratory-borne virus' cause disparate effects in the black community, unmasking persistent disparities in healthcare. Unfortunately, suboptimal influenza immunization acceptance exacerbates flu-related adverse health outcomes, similar to difficulties from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In consideration of the impending influenza-COVID-19 ""twindemic"", robust educational campaigns, policy initiatives, and novel approaches to influenza immunization must be considered for the African American community to build trust in the health benefits of the influenza vaccination and, ultimately, to trust in the health benefits of potential SARS-CoV2 vaccines, when available for the general public.","Ferdinand, Keith C; Nedunchezhian, Saihariharan; Reddy, Tina K",Journal of the National Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2020.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33276969/,762

Here we describe the new multiparameter RespiFinder assay, which is based on the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technology. This assay detects 15 respiratory viruses in one reaction. The MLPA reaction is preceded by a preamplification step which ensures the detection of both RNA and DNA viruses with the same specificity and sensitivity as individual monoplex real-time reverse transcription-PCRs. The RespiFinder assay was validated with 144 clinical samples, and the results of the assay were compared to those of cell culture and a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-specific immunochromatography assay (ICA). Compared to the cell culture results, the RespiFinder assay showed specificities and sensitivities of 98.2% and 100%, respectively, for adenovirus; 96.4% and 100%, respectively, for human metapneumovirus; 98.2% and 100%, respectively, for influenza A virus (InfA); 99.1% and 100%, respectively, for parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV-1); 99.1% and 80%, respectively, for PIV-3; 90.1% and 100%, respectively, for rhinovirus; and 94.6% and 100%, respectively, for RSV. Compared to the results of the RSV-specific ICA, the RespiFinder assay gave a specificity and a sensitivity of 82.4% and 80%, respectively. PIV-2, PIV-4, influenza B virus, InfA H5N1, and coronavirus 229E were not detected in the clinical specimens tested. The use of the RespiFinder assay resulted in an increase in the diagnostic yield compared to that obtained by cell culture (diagnostic yields, 60% and 35.5%, respectively).

89709,White muscle disease leads to deaths in housed bullocks in Northern Ireland.,2019,"It has been suggested that monitoring during total intravenous anaesthesia should include aspects of brain function. The current study used a manually adjusted target-controlled infusion of propofol for anaesthesia, guided to a bispectral index range of 55-60. Intra-operative responsiveness, as assessed by the isolated forearm technique, was compared with whether the bispectral index predicted/identified a patient's appropriate hand movements in responses to commands. Twenty-two women underwent major gynaecological surgery with total intravenous anaesthesia, propofol, remifentanil and atracurium. Sixteen women responded, on 80 occasions, with appropriate hand movements to commands during surgery, of which the bispectral index detected 47 (sensitivity 59%). The bispectral index suggested consciousness 220 times in the absence of movement responses (specificity 85%). The positive predictive value of a bispectral index response was 18%. While two women had vague recall about squeezing fingers, none had recall of surgery. For patients who responded more than once during surgery the bispectral index value associated with a response was not constant. Although there was no difference in the median (IQR [range]) effect site propofol concentration between intra-operative responses (2.0 (1.5-2.3 [1.2-4.0]) μg.ml(-1)) and eye opening after surgery (2.1 (1.7-2.8 [1.5-3.9]) μg.ml(-1)), the median (IQR [range]) bispectral index value at eye opening after surgery was significantly higher than that associated with responses during surgery: 75 (70-78 [51-93]) vs 61 (52-67 [37-80]) respectively, (p < 0.001). The manual control of propofol intravenous anaesthesia to target a bispectral index range of 55-60 may result in an unacceptable number of patients who are conscious during surgery (albeit without recall).","Russell, I F",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.12177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23521699/,762
89766,Evaluation of a laparoscopically assisted ovariectomy technique in cats.,2018,"Water stable isotopes have been widely used as natural tracers to investigate soil-plant-atmosphere interactions. Recent developments in induction module cavity ring-down spectroscopy (IM-CRDS) have made it possible to rapidly complete isotope analyses, and to combust co-extracted organic compounds at the same time. However, the agreement between IM-CRDS and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analyses has generally been poor and was primarily attributable to spectral interference of IM-CRDS. Here we evaluated the impacts of organic contamination on the isotope ratios using IM-CRDS with two different methods. No spectral interference was observed for solid samples measured directly by IM-CRDS, whereas clear organic contamination occurred in isotope analyses for pre-extracted plant stem and leaf samples. Our results demonstrate that IM-CRDS can fully combust co-extracted organic compounds by in-line oxidation in the direct measurement of solid samples, although this may not guarantee that the IM-CRDS can obtain better isotopic data than IRMS. It may be risky to evaluate the performance of IM-CRDS by measuring pre-extracted water samples because cryogenic vacuum distillation is likely to introduce extra organic compounds, which may not be fully removed during subsequent IM-CRDS measurement. In addition, spectral variables are useful for post-processing corrections.","Cui, Jiangpeng; Lide, Tian; Yu, Wusheng",Isotopes in environmental and health studies,https://doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2021.1883010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594914/,762

Currently, methods to assess physician competency for the interpretation of esophageal HRM do not exist. The aim of this study was to use formal techniques to (i) develop an HRM interpretation exam, and (ii) establish minimum competence benchmarks for HRM interpretation skills at the trainee, physician interpreter, and master level. METHODS A total of 29 physicians from 8 academic centers participated in the study: 9 content experts separated into 2 study groups-expert test-takers (n=7) and judges (n=2), and 20 HRM inexperienced trainees (""trainee test-taker""; n=20). We designed the HRM interpretation exam based on expert consensus. Expert and trainee test-takers (n=27) completed the exam. According to the modified Angoff method, the judges reviewed the test-taker performance and established minimum competency cut scores for HRM interpretation skills. KEY RESULTS The HRM interpretation exam consists of 22 HRM cases with 8 HRM interpretation skills per case: identification of pressure inversion point, hiatal hernia >3 cm, integrated relaxation pressure, distal contractile integral, distal latency, peristaltic integrity, pressurization pattern, and diagnosis. Based on the modified Angoff method, minimum cut scores for HRM interpretation skills at the trainee, physician interpreter, and master level ranged from 65-80%, 85-90% (with the exception of peristaltic integrity), and 90-95%, respectively.

Compared with the common type, there was significant difference in the white blood cell and lymphocyte counts in the severe type (P<0.01); the infection indicators, such as hypersensitivity C-reactive protein and serum ferritin, were significantly increased, with significant difference (all P<0.01); but the procalcitonin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was not significantly different (both P>0.05). Chest CT mainly showed patchy shadows and interstitial changes. According to imaging examination, 4 patients (25%) showed unilateral pneumonia and 12 patients (75%) showed bilateral pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS The patients have the clinical symptoms of COVID-19, but gastrointestinal symptoms (such as diarrhea) are more common, and the changes of white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, hypersensitivity C-reactive protein, ferritin are more obvious in severe patients.The positivity of fecal nucleic acid suggests the possibility of digestive tract transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and fecal nucleic acid testing can be used as a routine testing method in clinical practice.","Zhou, Yan; Xiao, Zhiquan; Chen, Dong; Guan, Jing; Zhou, Zhiguo; Zhang, Huirong; Zhou, Huanfa",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

DATA SOURCES Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Register of Clinical Trials, PEDro and SPORTDiscus from inception to March 2018, and accompanying reference lists. Peer-reviewed randomized clinical trials of non-surgical interventions for adults with rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy were included. DATA EXTRACTION The same 2 reviewers independently evaluated eligibility, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias of the included randomized clinical trials. A system to resolve any disagreements was established a priori. Short-term, medium-term and long-term outcomes for pain, shoulder function and calcific morphology related to rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy were extracted. Due to diversity in outcome measures a meta-analyses was not conducted. DATA SYNTHESIS Of the 2,085 articles identified, 18 met the inclusion criteria, all of which had high risk of bias. Five non-surgical interventions were identified (extracorporeal shockwave therapy, ultrasound-guided percutaneous intervention, pulsed ultrasound, acetic acid iontophoresis, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation). CONCLUSION There was moderate evidence for high-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy over low-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy for pain and function between 3 and 6 months, and over placebo for function in the first 6 months. There was moderate evidence for ultrasound-guided percutaneous intervention over medium/high-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy for reduced pain and calcific morphology over a 1-year period.

90650,Case-mix study of single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) vs. conventional laparoscopic surgery in colonic cancer resections.,2013,"OBJECTIVE From the beginning of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) pandemic in the world, much efforts have been accomplished to explain a precise clinical feature for the disease and to find the best therapeutic approach for the patients. Although coagulation abnormalities have found in novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) patients, still little is known about the association between the disease and changes in coagulation parameters. Our purpose is to evaluate the differences between the coagulation parameters between COVID-19 patients and healthy counterparts. PATIENTS AND METHODS 63 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were admitted to the present study. We evaluated coagulation value in these patients and in 40 healthy individuals. RESULTS We found that although there was no significant difference between PT and PTT values in patients and healthy counterparts, the fibrinogen values in patients were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the values of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer in all COVID-19 cases were considerably higher than those in control people (p < 0.05). Of note, FDP and D-dimer in patients with regular COVID-19 infection were lower than patients with severe forms. CONCLUSIONS It seems that the conduction of routine blood coagulation test could be a beneficial supplementary approach for early diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, our study shed more light on the therapeutic value of anti-coagulant-based treatment for COVID-19 patients, especially for those with severe type of the disease.","Sayyadi, M; Khosravi, M; Ghaznavi-Rad, E",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202101_24423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33506943/,762

Policies recommend mental health services provide preventive care for such risk behaviours. Provision of such care has not previously been synthesised. This review assessed the provision of preventive care for modifiable chronic disease risk behaviours by mental health services. Four databases were searched from 2006 to 2017. Eligible studies were observational quantitative study designs conducted in mental health services, where preventive care was provided to clients for tobacco smoking, harmful alcohol consumption, inadequate nutrition, or inadequate physical activity. Two reviewers independently screened studies, conducted data extraction and critical appraisal. Results were pooled as proportions of clients receiving or clinicians providing preventive care using random effects meta-analyses, by risk behaviour and preventive care element (ask/assess, advise, assist, arrange). Subgroup analyses were conducted by mental health service type (inpatient, outpatient, other/multiple). Narrative synthesis was used where meta-analysis was not possible. Thirty-eight studies were included with 26 amenable to meta-analyses. Analyses revealed that rates of assessment were highest for smoking (78%, 95% confidence interval [CI]:59%-96%) and lowest for nutrition (17%, 95% CI:1%-35%); with variable rates of care provision for all behaviours, care elements, and across service types, with substantial heterogeneity across analyses. Findings indicated suboptimal and variable provision of preventive care for modifiable chronic disease risk behaviours in mental health services, but should be considered with caution due to the very low quality of cumulative evidence.

91407,Off-clamp tumor excision using soft coagulation in laparoscopic and robotic partial nephrectomy.,2020-01-06,"Denervation-mediated skeletal muscle atrophy results from the loss of electric stimulation and leads to protein degradation, which is critically regulated by the well-confirmed transcriptional co-activator peroxisome proliferator co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1α). No adequate treatments of muscle wasting are available. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a naturally occurring antioxidant component with multiple functions including mitochondrial modulation, demonstrates the ability to protect against muscle dysfunction. However, it remains unclear whether PQQ enhances PGC-1α activation and resists skeletal muscle atrophy in mice subjected to a denervation operation. This work investigates the expression of PGC-1α and mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle of denervated mice administered PQQ. The C57BL6/J mouse was subjected to a hindlimb sciatic axotomy. A PQQ-containing ALZET® osmotic pump (equivalent to 4.5 mg/day/kg b.w.) was implanted subcutaneously into the right lower abdomen of the mouse. In the time course study, the mouse was sacrificed and the gastrocnemius muscle was prepared for further myopathological staining, energy metabolism analysis, western blotting, and real-time quantitative PCR studies. We observed that PQQ administration abolished the denervation-induced decrease in muscle mass and reduced mitochondrial activities, as evidenced by the reduced fiber size and the decreased expression of cytochrome c oxidase and NADH-tetrazolium reductase. Bioenergetic analysis demonstrated that PQQ reprogrammed the denervation-induced increase in the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and led to an increase in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a measurement of the glycolytic metabolism. The protein levels of PGC-1α and the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes were also increased by treatment with PQQ. Furthermore, PQQ administration highly enhanced the expression of oxidative fibers and maintained the type II glycolytic fibers. This pre-clinical in vivo study suggests that PQQ may provide a potent therapeutic benefit for the treatment of denervation-induced atrophy by activating PGC-1α and maintaining the mitochondrial ETC complex in skeletal muscles.","Kuo, Yung-Ting; Shih, Ping-Hsiao; Kao, Shu-Huei; Yeh, Geng-Chang; Lee, Horng-Mo",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26646764/,762
91656,Laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy with transanal specimen extraction: a bridge to NOTES?,2009,"Protein folding is a complex, error-prone process that often results in an irreparable protein by-product. These by-products can be recognized by cellular quality control machineries and targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation. The folding of proteins in the secretory pathway adds another layer to the protein folding ""problem,"" as the endoplasmic reticulum maintains a unique chemical environment within the cell. In fact, a growing number of diseases are attributed to defects in secretory protein folding, and many of these by-products are targeted for a process known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Since its discovery, research on the mechanisms underlying the ERAD pathway has provided new insights into how ERAD contributes to human health during both normal and diseases states. Links between ERAD and disease are evidenced from the loss of protein function as a result of degradation, chronic cellular stress when ERAD fails to keep up with misfolded protein production, and the ability of some pathogens to coopt the ERAD pathway. The growing number of ERAD substrates has also illuminated the differences in the machineries used to recognize and degrade a vast array of potential clients for this pathway. Despite all that is known about ERAD, many questions remain, and new paradigms will likely emerge. Clearly, the key to successful disease treatment lies within defining the molecular details of the ERAD pathway and in understanding how this conserved pathway selects and degrades an innumerable cast of substrates.","Guerriero, Christopher J; Brodsky, Jeffrey L",Physiological reviews,https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00027.2011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22535891/,762

In light of the current discussion on the role of ablative therapy, the aim of this study is to compare patients who undergo hepatic resection to those treated with radiofrequency ablation. METHODS The procedures have been conducted in two institutes following the same methodologies. Ninety-six patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, single or multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a diameter less than or equal to 3 cm, have been included in this retrospective study: 52 patients have been treated by surgical resection and 44 by radiofrequency ablation. Patient characteristics, survival and disease-free survival have all been analysed. RESULTS Disease-free survival was longer in the resection group in comparison to the radiofrequency group with a median disease-free time of 48 versus 34 months, respectively (P = 0.04, hazard ratio = 1.5, 95 % confidence interval = 0.9-2.5). In the resection group, median survival was 54 months with a survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 years of 100, 98 and 46.2 %. In the radiofrequency group, median survival was 40 months with 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rate of 95.5, 68.2 and 36.4 %. CONCLUSION The current study shows that for small HCC in the presence of compensated cirrhosis, surgical resection gives better results than radiofrequency, both in terms of overall survival, as well as disease-free survival. Further evidence is required to clarify the role of ablative therapy as a curative treatment and whether it can replace surgery.","Desiderio, Jacopo; Trastulli, Stefano; Pasquale, Rosario; Cavaliere, Davide; Cirocchi, Roberto; Boselli, Carlo; Noya, Giuseppe; Parisi, Amilcare",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-012-1029-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23224564/,762

The current study takes a person-oriented approach to identify the unique response patterns that underlie three risk perception components (likelihood, severity, and protection efficacy) of COVID-19, with information sources as precursors and economic confidence as outcomes. METHODS A total of 1,074 Chinese citizens participated in a national online survey in early February 2020. RESULTS A latent profile analysis showed that participants exhibited one of three classes: Risk Neutrals (49.9%; moderate in all components), Risk Deniers (14.3%; low likelihood, low severity, and high protection efficacy), or Risk Exaggerators (35.8%; high likelihood, high severity, and low protection efficacy). Subsequent analyses showed that reliance on unofficial sources (gossip and news spread among friends; WeChat) positively correlated with membership in the Risk Exaggerators class. In turn, belonging in the Risk Exaggerators class correlated with the lowest short-term (but not long-term) economic confidence. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that exploring the heterogeneity of the public risk perception might help the government to design differentiated risk communication strategies during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Yang, Zhixu; Xin, Ziqiang",Applied psychology.

METHODS Stool samples constituting the study material were collected between March and June 2011 from rectums of calves at 22 centers in the villages and farms of the Kars Province. Calves were divided into 2 groups: 3-90 days old (up to 3 months old) and 91-180 days old (older than 3 months). The study material comprised 313 stool samples (146 diarrheal samples and 167 healthy samples). Each of the samples was first examined using mAF staining; of these samples, 222 were examined using the C. parvum ELISA kit (Bio-X Diagnostics), whereas 91 were examined using the Cryptosporidium commercial ELISA kit (Diagnostic Automation, Inc., USA) for the presence of Cryptosporidium copro-antigens. RESULTS The incidence of the presence of Cryptosporidium among the calves was 3.8% (12/313) with mAF staining and 5.1% (16/313) with ELISA. All the samples in which the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts was determined using mAF staining were determined to be positive using ELISA. Cryptosporidium was found to be present in 5.5% (8/146) and 7.5% (11/146) of diarrheal calves, 2.4% (4/167) and 3.0% (5/167) of healthy calves, 4.0% (10/253) and 5.5% (14/253) of calves aged up to 3 months, and 3.3% (2/60) (via both tests) of calves aged 3-6 months. C. parvum was present in 5.9% (13/222) of the calves; it was found at a higher concentration in calves aged up to 3 months (6.2%; 12/194) than in those aged 3-6 months (3.6%; 1/28). Of the C. parvum-positive cases, 9 cases were found to have diarrhea, whereas 4 were observed to be healthy. C. parvum copro antigens were observed at the highest level (7.4%; 8/108) in diarrheal calves aged up to 3 months. At the species level, the rate of incidence of Cryptosporidium copro-antigens in calves examined using ELISA for determining Cryptosporidium factors was found to be 3.3% (3/91), and the same rate was found 3.4% (2/59) in calves aged up to 3 months and 3.1% (1/32) in those aged 3-6 months. CONCLUSION The prevalence of Cryptosporidium infections among the calves was observed to decrease in recent years.","Gündüz, Neslihan; Arslan, Mükremin Özkan",Turkiye parazitolojii dergisi,https://doi.org/10.5152/tpd.2017.4833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28483727/,762
93528,Linear or circular: Anastomotic ulcer after gastric bypass surgery.,2021-06-18,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an important emerging pathogen that was first described in 2012. While the cell surface receptor for MERS-CoV has been identified as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the mouse DPP4 homologue does not allow virus entry into cells. Therefore, development of mouse models of MERS-CoV has been hampered by the fact that MERS-CoV does not replicate in commonly available mouse strains. We have previously described a mouse model in which mDPP4 was replaced with hDPP4 such that hDPP4 is expressed under the endogenous mDPP4 promoter. In this study, we used this mouse model to analyze the host response to MERS-CoV infection using immunological assays and transcriptome analysis. Depletion of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, or macrophages has no effect on MERS-CoV replication in the lungs of infected mice. However, we found that depletion of CD8+ T cells protects and depletion of macrophages exacerbates MERS-CoV-induced pathology and clinical symptoms of disease. Overall, we demonstrate an important role for the inflammatory response in regulating MERS-CoV pathogenesis in vivo IMPORTANCE: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus that emerged from zoonotic sources in 2012. Human infections are still occurring throughout Saudi Arabia at a 38% case fatality rate, with the potential for worldwide spread via air travel. In this work, we identify the host response to the virus and identify inflammatory pathways and cell populations that are critical for protection from severe lung disease. By understanding the immune response to MERS-CoV we can develop targeted therapies to inhibit pathogenesis in the future.","Coleman, Christopher M; Sisk, Jeanne M; Halasz, Gabor; Zhong, Jixin; Beck, Sarah E; Matthews, Krystal L; Venkataraman, Thiagarajan; Rajagopalan, Sanjay; Kyratsous, Christos A; Frieman, Matthew B",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01825-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27795435/,762

93769,No-incision (NOTES) versus single-incision (single-port) surgery for access to sites of peritoneal carcinomatosis: a back-to-back animal study.,2012,"One of the main protective measures against COVID-19's spread is the use of face masks. It is therefore of the utmost importance for face masks to be high functioning in terms of their filtration ability and comfort. Notwithstanding the prevalence of the commercial polypropylene face masks, its effectiveness is under contention, leaving vast room for improvement. During the pandemic, the use of at least one mask per day for each individual results in a massive number of masks that need to be safely disposed of. Fabricating biodegradable filters of high efficiency not only can protect individuals and save the environment but also can be sewed on reusable/washable cloth masks to reduce expenses. Wearing surgical masks for long periods of time, especially in hot regions, causes discomfort by irritating sensitive facial skin and warmed inhaled air. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of novel electrospun composites layers as face mask filters for protection against pathogens and tiny particulates. The combinatorial filter layers are made by integrating TiO2 nanotubes as fillers into chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) polymeric electrospun nanofibers as the outer layer. The other two filler-free layers, chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) and silk/poly(vinyl alcohol) as the middle and inner composite layers, respectively, were used for controlled protection, contamination prevention, and comfort for prolonged usage. The ASTM standards evaluation tests were adopted to evaluate the efficacy of the assembled filter, revealing high filtration efficiency compared to that of commercial surgical masks. The TiO2/Cs/PVA outer layer significantly reduced Staphylococcus aureus bacteria by 44.8% compared to the control, revealing the dual effect of TiO2 and chitosan toward the infectious bacterial colonies. Additionally, molecular dynamics calculations were used to assess the mechanical properties of the filter layers.","Abbas, Walaa A; Shaheen, Basamat S; Ghanem, Loujain G; Badawy, Ibrahim M; Abodouh, Mohamed M; Abdou, Shrouk M; Zada, Suher; Allam, Nageh K",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c00926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101479/,762

This has ensured that bronchoscopy offers therapeutic and interventional options. AREAS COVERED We provide a review of recent advances and clinical challenges in pediatric bronchoscopy. This includes single -use bronchoscopes, endobronchial ultrasound and cryoprobe. Bronchoscopy in persistent preschool wheezing and asthma is included. The indications for interventional bronchoscopy have amplified and included balloon dilatation, endoscopic intubation, the use of airway stents, whole lung lavage, closing of fistulas and air leak, as well as an update on removal of foreign bodies. Others include the use of laser and microdebrider in airway surgery. Experience with bronchoscope during the COVID-19 pandemic has been included in this review. PubMed was searched for articles on paediatric bronchoscopy, including rigid bronchoscopy as well as interventional bronchoscopy with a focus on reviewing literature in the past 5 years. EXPERT OPINION As the proficiency of paediatric interventional pulmonologists continues to grow more interventions are being performed. There is a scarcity of published evidence in this field. Courses for paediatric interventional bronchoscopy needs to be developed.

This study assessed the feasibility, outcomes, and risk factors for conversion to thoracotomy of thoracoscopic lobectomy in children. METHODS From 2005 to 2011, thoracoscopic lobectomy was tried in 50 consecutive pediatric patients. The median age was 3.2 years and the median body weight was 16 kg. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) (78%) and pulmonary sequestration (18%) were the most common diagnoses. Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonography was made in 34% of patients (17 of 50), and a previous history of pneumonia was present in 46% (23 of 50). The most commonly used single-lung ventilation modality was endobronchial blocking by balloon catheter through a single-lumen endotracheal tube. The use of a stapler was minimized, with endoscopic clipping devices and energy-based cutting instruments used instead. RESULTS Thoracoscopic lobectomy without conversion was accomplished in 82% of patients (41 of 50). There was no in-hospital mortality and 1 major morbidity (2%) with postoperative bleeding. Comparison with a group from an earlier period (∼2009) and a group from a later period (2010-2011) determined that thoracotomy conversion rates, mean operation times, and mean hospital days were 27% and 8%, 190±85 and 133±40 minutes, and 11.0±6.7 and 5.2±2.2 days, respectively. In univariate analysis, lower body weight (p=0.010), operations in the earlier period (p=0.040), single-lung ventilation failure (p=0.004), and a previous history of pneumonia (p<0.001) were related to conversion to thoracotomy. Multivariate analysis revealed a previous history of pneumonia to be the only independent risk factor for conversion to thoracotomy (p=0.0179). CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic lobectomy in small children is a safe and effective treatment modality.

DESIGN Randomized clinical study (Canadian Task Force Classification I). SETTING Single-center study in a university hospital. PATIENTS This study enrolled 44 women who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. INTERVENTIONS In accord with to the randomization, the uterine wall defects were closed either with a continuous suture with intracorporeal knots (group V) or a unidirectional knotless barbed suture (group L). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The time required to suture the uterine wall defect was significantly lower in group L (11.5 ± 4.1 minutes) than in group V (17.4 ± 3.8 minutes; p <.001). However, no significant difference was observed in the operative time between the 2 study groups. The intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in group L than in group V (p =.004). The degree of surgical difficulty was significantly lower in group L (3.7 ± 1.1) than in group V (6.1 ± 2.1; p <.001). CONCLUSION The unidirectional knotless barbed suture may facilitate the suture of uterine wall defects during laparoscopic myomectomy. When compared with continuous suture and intracorporeal knots, the barbed suture reduces the time required to suture the uterine wall defect and the intraoperative blood loss.","Alessandri, Franco; Remorgida, Valentino; Venturini, Pier Luigi; Ferrero, Simone",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2010.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20674510/,762

There is no available MRI-compatible device to position and transport patients during this procedure. We report on the design of such a device here. METHODS AND DEVICE The device was constructed from 1.0″ polyvinylchloride tubing and poly-methyl methacrylate (Plexiglass(®)) platform. The device has a stable, rigid base on which platform is secure. An adjustable and removable superstructure is secured to this base to suspend legs for lithotomy position. RESULTS MRI-LAARP has been performed on 6 patients. The device has performed well and meets requirements set forth in development including construction with MRI-compatible materials, size fitting in the MRI bore, ability to hold patient in lithotomy position, ability to position and support MRI flex coils, and providing stability while transporting to a separate OR with needle in position. CONCLUSIONS This device provides a stable structure to position and transport a patient with a needle in a tenuous position without dislodgement allowing this procedure, and potentially other procedures, to be done in hospitals without MROR capability.","Thomas, Tina; Teitelbaum, Daniel H; Vellody, Ranjith; Spremo, Dragan; Elkins, Samual; Ladouceur, Robert; Nagy, David; Jarboe, Marcus D",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-015-3838-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26602208/,762
96927,Simplified Minimally Invasive Surgical Approach for Prophylactic Laparoscopic Gastropexy in 21 Cases.,2019,"BACKGROUND Peritoneal metastases (PM) from ovarian, gastric, appendiceal, or colorectal origin can be treated via cytoreductive surgery with or without the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for selected patients. Unfortunately, not all patients are candidates for aggressive surgical debulking. For these patients, pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy (PIPAC) has emerged as an alternative method for intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy administration. This report presents the design and implementation of the first phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PIPAC in the United States. METHODS This is an ongoing prospective phase 1 clinical trial of PIPAC for patients who have histologically confirmed ovarian, uterine, gastric, appendiceal, or colorectal cancer with PM and have progressed to at least one evidence-based chemotherapeutic regimen. The trial has two clinical arms. The patients in arm 1 have gynecologic and gastric malignancies treated with IP cisplatin and doxorubicin, and the arm 2 patients have colorectal and appendiceal malignancies treated with intravenous fluorouracil and leucovorin followed by IP oxaliplatin. All the patients are monitored for dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events. RESULTS Practical and technical considerations for the phase 1 PIPAC trial are presented. These considerations include patient selection, operating room setup, and technical details for successful aerosolized chemotherapy delivery. The phase 1 study results will be reported separately at completion of the trial. CONCLUSIONS The PIPAC treatment is a feasible, minimally invasive approach that permits IP delivery of chemotherapy. Once completed, the ongoing phase 1 trial will help to provide safety and initial efficacy data.","Raoof, Mustafa; Malhotra, Gautam; Kohut, Adrian; O'Leary, Michael; Frankel, Paul; Tran, Thuy; Fakih, Marwan; Chao, Joseph; Lim, Dean; Woo, Yanghee; Paz, Isaac B; Lew, Michael; Cristea, Mihaela C; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Lorna; Fong, Yuman; Blakely, Andrew; Whelan, Richard; Reymond, Marc A; Merchea, Amit; Dellinger, Thanh H",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-021-10505-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387765/,762

Whether regarding the viral genome, incubation periods, method of transmission, symptoms, dangerous behaviors, age groups at risk, all information was valuable, all data was shared as soon as possible. AREAS COVERED Considering that the most severely impacted group of patients are already suffering from other conditions, accessing the impact that metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), obesity, and diabetes has on patients by sharing information between different healthcare facilities is of vital importance. However, the value behind open information sharing would remain significant even without a viral outbreak and should there be a more efficient infrastructure in place, the global exchange of data can become more practical and less arduous. EXPERT OPINION Since the sharing of data by individual researchers is often motivated by personal benefits, this observed international collaboration is conditional at best, and the widespread misinformation during this pandemic could be an indication of a certain lack of consensus within the scientific community itself.","Rios, Rafael S; Zheng, Kenneth I; Zheng, Ming-Hua",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474124.2020.1815533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842793/,762

The metal complexes were investigated for their stability in aqueous solution, with the interpretation supported by density functional theory calculations, and reactivity to biomolecules. In vitro cytotoxicity studies suggested that the nature of both the metal center and the lipophilicity of the ligand determine the biological properties of this class of compounds. The Ir III complex 5d bearing a benzimidazole-derived ligand was the most cytotoxic with an IC 50 value of 10 µM against the NCI-H460 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. Cell uptake and distribution studies using X-ray fluorescence microscopy revealed localization of 5d in the cytoplasm of cancer cells.","Tong, Kelvin; Hanif, Muhammad; Movassaghi, Sanam; Sullivan, Matthew P; Lovett, James; Hummitzsch, Katja; Soehnel, Tilo; Jamieson, Stephen; Bhargava, Suresh; Harris, Hugh; Hartinger, Christian",ChemMedChem,https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.202100311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196118/,762

AIMS To examine the experience of mental health, QoL, wellbeing and loneliness and use of social media among people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia. METHODS A cross-country comparative survey of people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia. Relevant statistical analyses were used to examine differences between the countries and to explore associations between demographic, mental health and psychosocial variables and use of social media. RESULTS There were 3810 respondents from four countries, of which 50 - 74% showed a high level of emotional distress. The Norwegian population reported significantly better mental health, QoL and wellbeing and lower levels of loneliness compared to the other countries. High-frequent use of social media after the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with poorer mental- and psychosocial health.

Herein, we profiled retrospectively the epidemiological characteristics (clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment, and clinical outcomes) of 64 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Regional Hospital Center (RHC) of Errachidia, in Morocco. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and laboratory Findings of Covid-19 patients in Errachidia Province, Morocco. METHODS This is a retrospective single-center study included all COVID-19 confirmed patients (died or discharged) hospitalized in the Regional Center of Errachidia, Morocco between March 20, 2020 and May 23, 2020. Patients were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcomes of patients were extracted manually from patient's medical records. RESULTS In a total of 64 patients with COVID-19, 60.9 % of patients were men, with a mean age of 41.5 years (SD 18.62). At the admission, most patients were asymptomatic 38 (59.4%), and 58 (90.6%) were clinically classified as being at benign state. Chronic illnesses were the most comorbidities observed including diabetes with 8 cases (12.5%), hypertension 3 cases (4.7%), and hyperlipidemia 1 patient (1.6%). The main symptoms were cough 15 (23.4%), fever 10 (15.6), diarrhea 8 (12.5%), headache 5 (7.8%), and sore throat 5 (7.8%). Only 7 patients (10.9%) had lung lesions and lymphopenia was present in only 7 patients (11.1%). The median duration of viral shedding was 14.5 days (9-22). Concerning deceased cases, they were elderly subjects aged 69.75 years and they have presented dyspnea, breathing problems, and respiratory distress as specific symptoms. In addition, an increase of the medians of serum AST, CRP, and glucose levels was noticed in this group. During hospitalization, they presented acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and they were transferred to intensive care before they died. CONCLUSION This study revealed that covid-19 infection often appeared in a benign form in the studied population (90.6% in this study). This finding may incriminate the implication of some protective parameters such as genetic, nutritional or other factors in Moroccan population.","Akdad, Mourad; Algharrass, Youness; Talha, Hafid; Babakhouya, Abdelaadim; Ajebli, Mohammed; Ech-Cherrate, Ahlam; Eddouks, Mohamed",Reviews on recent clinical trials,https://doi.org/10.2174/1574887116666210114161633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33459245/,762
97904,Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery appendectomy.,2010,"Throughout their life cycle, Babesia parasites alternate between a mammalian host, where they cause babesiosis, and the tick vector. Transition between hosts results in distinct environmental signals that influence patterns of gene expression, consistent with the morphological and functional changes operating in the parasites during their life stages. In addition,comparing differential patterns of gene expression among mammalian and tick parasite stages can provide clues for developing improved methods of control. Hereby, we upgraded the genome assembly of Babesia bovis, a bovine hemoparasite, closing a 139 kbp gap, and used RNA-Seq datasets derived from mammalian blood and tick kinete stages to update the genome annotation. Of the originally annotated genes, 1254 required structural changes , and 326 new genes were identified, leading to a different predicted proteome compared to the original annotation. Next, the RNA-Seq data was used to identify B. bovis genes that were differentially expressed in the vertebrate and arthropod hosts. In blood stages, 28% of the genes were upregulated up to 300 fold, whereas 26% of the genes in kinetes, a tick stage, were upregulated up to >19,000 fold. We thus discovered differentially expressed genes that may play key biological roles and serve as suitable targets for the development of vaccines to control bovine babesiosis.","Ueti, Massaro W; Johnson, Wendell C; Kappmeyer, Lowell S; Herndon, David R; Mousel, Michelle R; Reif, Kathryn E; Taus, Naomi S; Ifeonu, Olukemi O; Silva, Joana C; Suarez, Carlos E; Brayton, Kelly A",International journal for parasitology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2020.08.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069745/,762

However, big cultural and geographical differences exist regarding alcohol use. Objectives To determine whether or not there was a difference in hazardous drinking between Belgian and South African university students and to establish the risk factors that contribute to hazardous drinking in university students (calculated using the AUDIT-C) from a developing country (South Africa) and a developed country (Belgium). Methods An online survey assessing hazardous drinking among university students in South Africa (University of KwaZulu-Natal, UKZN) and Belgium (University of Antwerp, UoA) was conducted, using the shortened version of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT-C). Risk factors in males and females for hazardous drinking were explored using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results In total, 499 students were included in the study (250 UoA and 249 UKZN students). A significant higher amount of male (94.8%) as well as female (92.4%) UoA students drank alcohol in the last year compared to the male (66.2%) and female (67.8%) UKZN students (p<0.001). Additionally, a significant higher amount of UoA students were hazardous drinkers, compared to the UKZN students (p<0.001). Multivaiate analysis showed that male UoA students were almost 6 times more likely to be hazardous drinkers than male UKZN students (OR=5.611, p=0.005).

This narrative review is designed to examine the potential psychoneuroendocrine pathogenic mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 elicits psychiatric sequelae, as well as to posit potential pharmacologic strategies to address and reverse these pathologies. Following a brief overview of neurological and psychological sequelae from previous viral pandemics, we address mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 could enter or otherwise elicit changes in the CNS. We then examine the hypothesis that COVID-19-induced psychiatric disorders result from challenges to the neuroendocrine system, in particular the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis and monoamine synthesis, physiological mechanisms that are only further enhanced by the pandemic-induced social environment of fear, isolation, and socioeconomic pressure.

CASE DESCRIPTION D.G., a 62-year-old man, came to our attention for a transient episode of left weakness and hypoesthesia. The electrocardiogram revealed a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. CT angiography showed right ICAO; computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies with perfusion imaging revealed a severe hemispheric hypoperfusion. Full anticoagulation therapy was started, and antihypertensive therapy was reduced to help collateral circulation. Some weeks later, the patient was readmitted to the stroke unit for 2 episodes of left-hand weakness. Cerebral angiography confirmed right ICAO from the proximal tract to the siphon. After some days, the patient suffered a femoral hemorrhagic lesion, with active bleeding, and was treated with surgical intervention. On the following day, the patient presented with left hemiplegia with hemianesthesia (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score = 14). The patient was treated in the emergency department with a complex endovascular treatment with complete recanalization of ICAO by positioning 3 stents through the intravenous infusion of abciximab. After intensive rehabilitation, at the 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations, the patient regained autonomy. CONCLUSION In literature, treatment of chronic ICAO is not indicated. Endovascular recanalization may be beneficial to patients with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion due to ICAO, when all conservative medical therapies have failed.","Bigliardi, Guido; Dell'Acqua, Maria Luisa; Vallone, Stefano; Barbi, Filippo; Pentore, Roberta; Picchetto, Livio; Carpeggiani, Paolo; Nichelli, Paolo; Zini, Andrea",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2016.04.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27241576/,762

Studies suggest that PCR may detect virus nucleic acid (NA) that persists in the respiratory tract. METHODS We analyzed virologic data from children having frequent upper respiratory infections (URI), who were followed up in a longitudinal study. Nasopharyngeal secretions were collected at URI onset and when acute otitis media was diagnosed; virus studies were performed using conventional diagnostics and PCR. Repeated presence of adenovirus by PCR was further studied by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS Of 581 URI episodes in 76 children, 510 viruses were detected. Of the viruses detected by PCR, 15% were those detected previously; repeated positives occurred most frequently with adenovirus. Sequencing results were available in 13 children with repeated adenovirus detection; the following 4 patterns of infection were identified (16 instances): (1) adenovirus of the same serotype and strain detected continuously (n = 8 instances), (2) adenovirus of different serotypes detected during sequential URI episodes (n = 3), (3) adenovirus of the same serotype but different strains detected during sequential URI episodes (n = 3), and (4) adenovirus of the same serotype and strain detected intermittently (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS Among children with frequent URIs, repeated positive PCR results for adenovirus NA may represent a new serotype/strain, or persistence of viral NA. Results must be interpreted with caution; clinical correlation and presence of other viruses are important. Further longitudinal studies of children during and after infection are required for better understanding of the clinical significance of positive PCR tests for adenovirus NA in the respiratory tract.","Kalu, Stella U; Loeffelholz, Michael; Beck, Eric; Patel, Janak A; Revai, Krystal; Fan, Jiang; Henrickson, Kelly J; Chonmaitree, Tasnee",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3181d743c8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20308936/,762

Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings.","Pearce, Joshua M",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.22942.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411358/,762

99697,Safety of Mini/One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (MGB/OAGB)-Reply to Musella et al.,2018,"Since the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, known as ""welfare reform,"" in 1996, US social policy has increasingly stratified immigrants by legality, extending eligibility exclusions, benefit limitations, and administrative burdens not only to undocumented immigrants but also to lawful permanent residents and US citizens in immigrant families. This stratification is a form of structural discrimination, which is a social determinant of health. Children in immigrant families, most of whom are US citizens, have not been able to fully realize the benefits from social safety-net programs-including the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act stimulus payments. Policy deliberations over pandemic recovery, the equity focus of the Biden administration, and proposals to address child poverty provide an opportunity to reexamine immigrant exclusions, restrictions, and administrative burdens in public programs. We discuss immigrant stratification by legal status in social policy and review how it affects citizen children in mixed-status families in three safety-net programs: the Earned Income Tax Credit, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and Child Care and Development Block Grant. We provide eight policy recommendations to restore equity to the social safety net for children in immigrant families.","Acevedo-Garcia, Dolores; Joshi, Pamela K; Ruskin, Emily; Walters, Abigail N; Sofer, Nomi",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228532/,762

100175,Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair using only 5-mm ports.,2018,"Aims Evidence is lacking regarding acute anticoagulation management in patients after intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) with implanted mechanical heart valves (MHVs). Our objective was to investigate anticoagulation reversal and resumption strategies by evaluating incidences of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, thereby defining an optimal time-window when to restart therapeutic anticoagulation (TA) in patients with MHV and ICH. Methods and results We pooled individual patient-data (n = 2504) from a nationwide multicentre cohort-study (RETRACE, conducted at 22 German centres) and eventually identified MHV-patients (n = 137) with anticoagulation-associated ICH for outcome analyses. The primary outcome consisted of major haemorrhagic complications analysed during hospital stay according to treatment exposure (restarted TA vs. no-TA). Secondary outcomes comprised thromboembolic complications, the composite outcome (haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications), timing of TA, and mortality. Adjusted analyses involved propensity-score matching and multivariable cox-regressions to identify optimal timing of TA. In 66/137 (48%) of patients TA was restarted, being associated with increased haemorrhagic (TA = 17/66 (26%) vs. no-TA = 4/71 (6%); P < 0.01) and a trend to decreased thromboembolic complications (TA = 1/66 (2%) vs. no-TA = 7/71 (10%); P = 0.06). Controlling treatment crossovers provided an incidence rate-ratio [hazard ratio (HR) 10.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67-35.70; P < 0.01] in disadvantage of TA for haemorrhagic complications. Analyses of TA-timing displayed significant harm until Day 13 after ICH (HR 7.06, 95% CI 2.33-21.37; P < 0.01). The hazard for the composite-balancing both complications, was increased for restarted TA until Day 6 (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.10-5.70; P = 0.03). Conclusion Restarting TA within less than 2 weeks after ICH in patients with MHV was associated with increased haemorrhagic complications. Optimal weighing-between least risks for thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications-provided an earliest starting point of TA at Day 6, reserved only for patients at high thromboembolic risk.","Kuramatsu, Joji B; Sembill, Jochen A; Gerner, Stefan T; Sprügel, Maximilian I; Hagen, Manuel; Roeder, Sebastian S; Endres, Matthias; Haeusler, Karl Georg; Sobesky, Jan; Schurig, Johannes; Zweynert, Sarah; Bauer, Miriam; Vajkoczy, Peter; Ringleb, Peter A; Purrucker, Jan; Rizos, Timolaos; Volkmann, Jens; Müllges, Wolfgang; Kraft, Peter; Schubert, Anna-Lena; Erbguth, Frank; Nueckel, Martin; Schellinger, Peter D; Glahn, Jörg; Knappe, Ulrich J; Fink, Gereon R; Dohmen, Christian; Stetefeld, Henning; Fisse, Anna Lena; Minnerup, Jens; Hagemann, Georg; Rakers, Florian; Reichmann, Heinz; Schneider, Hauke; Wöpking, Sigrid; Ludolph, Albert Christian; Stösser, Sebastian; Neugebauer, Hermann; Röther, Joachim; Michels, Peter; Schwarz, Michael; Reimann, Gernot; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Schwert, Henning; Claßen, Joseph; Michalski, Dominik; Grau, Armin; Palm, Frederick; Urbanek, Christian; Wöhrle, Johannes C; Alshammari, Fahid; Horn, Markus; Bahner, Dirk; Witte, Otto W; Günther, Albrecht; Hamann, Gerhard F; Lücking, Hannes; Dörfler, Arnd; Achenbach, Stephan; Schwab, Stefan; Huttner, Hagen B",European heart journal,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529259/,762
100277,Preintervention Clinical Determinants and Measured β-Cell Function As Predictors of Type 2 Diabetes Remission After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery.,2021-08-15,"P-type H+ ATPases mediate active H+ efflux from plant cells. They generate a proton motive force across the plasma membrane providing the free energy to drive the transport of other solutes, partly by coupling to H+ influx. Wegner & Shabala (2020; New Phytol. 225:37-47) recently suggested that passive H+ influx can exceed pump-driven efflux due to 'active buffering', i.e. cytosolic H+ scavenging and apoplastic H+ generation by metabolism ('biochemical pH clamp'). Charge balance is provided by K+ efflux or anion influx. Here, this hypothesis is extended to net H+ efflux: Even though H+ pumping is faster than backflow via symporters and antiporters, a progressive increase in the transmembrane pH gradient is avoided. Cytosolic H+ release is associated with bicarbonate formation from CO2 . Bicarbonate serves as substrate for the PEPcase catalyzing the reaction from phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate subsequently reduced to malate. Organic anions like malate and citrate are released across the plasma membrane and are (partly) protonated in the apoplast, thus limiting pump-induced acidification. Moreover, a 'biophysical pH clamp' is introduced, i.e. adjustment of apoplastic/cytosolic pH involving net H+ fluxes across the plasma membrane, while the gradient between compartments is maintained. Both clamps aren't mutually exclusive but are likely to coexist.","Wegner, Lars H; Li, Xuewen; Zhang, Jie; Yu, Min; Shabala, Sergey; Hao, Zhifeng",The New phytologist,https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423280/,762

101413,"True single-port appendectomy: first experience with the ""puppeteer technique"".",2009,"INTRODUCTION Up to 10% of adolescents report self-harm in the previous year. Non-fatal repetition is common (18% in 1 year), death from any cause shows a fourfold and suicide a 10-fold excess. Despite the scale of the problem, there is insufficient evidence for effective interventions for self-harm. Those who self-harm do so for a variety of different reasons. Different treatments may be more effective for subgroups of adolescents; however, little is known about which subgroups are appropriate for further study. This protocol outlines a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) to identify subgroups of adolescents for which therapeutic interventions for self-harm show some evidence of benefit. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic literature search was conducted in August 2019 (including Cochrane Library, Embase, trial registers and other databases). An update search is planned. Study selection will identify randomised controlled trials examining interventions to reduce self-harm in adolescents who have self-harmed and presented to services. Identified research teams will be invited to contribute data and form a collaborative group. Two-stage IPD-MA will be used to evaluate effectiveness of different therapeutic interventions compared with any active or non-active control on repetition of self-harm, general psychopathology, depression, suicidal ideation, quality of life and death. Subgroup analyses will identify adolescent subgroups in whom different therapeutic interventions may be more effective. Meta-regression will explore moderating study and intervention effects. Sensitivity analyses will incorporate aggregate data from studies lacking IPD and test the robustness of results to methods for handling missing data, within-study clustering, non-adherence and study quality. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is provided by the University of Leeds, Faculty of Medicine and Health Ethics Committee (18-098). Outcomes will inform research recommendations and will be disseminated internationally through the collaborative group, a service user advisory group, open-access peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations.

Twelve intact male purpose-bred research dogs, weighing less than 15 kg, were positioned in dorsal recumbency, and a 3-portal technique was used. Bilateral dissection was performed with vessel-sealing devices while tilting the surgical table by up to 30° towards the contralateral side of the target medial iliac lymph node (MILN) without changing the surgeon's position. Using a ventral laparoscopic approach, bilateral MILNs were identified and excised in all dogs. The mean times for unilateral and bilateral MILN dissections were 9.7 ± 3.8 and 21.0 ± 6.0 min, respectively. The mean times for the right and left MILN dissections were 10.8 ± 4.3 and 9.8 ± 2.5 min, respectively. The mean total surgery time was 43.7 ± 7.7 min. In total, 26 MILNs were dissected. Several complications, including mild to moderate capillary hemorrhage from perinodal fat and vessels (controlled laparoscopically), mild spleen trauma caused by the first trocar insertion and capsular damage of MILNs, were observed. However, there were no other major complications. All MILN samples were evaluated and deemed suitable for histopathologic diagnosis. Laparoscopic excision of MILNs is a useful method of excisional biopsy for histopathologic diagnosis. Using this ventral laparoscopic approach with the 3-portal technique, bilateral MILN dissection suitable for obtaining histopathologic samples could be achieved in a short time in dogs weighing less than 15 kg.","Lim, Hyunjoo; Kim, Jina; Li, Li; Lee, Aeri; Jeong, Junemoe; Ko, Jonghyeok; Lee, Sungin; Kweon, Oh-Kyeong; Kim, Wan Hee",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.16-0627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28781294/,762

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the diagnostic value of ssDNA. In patients with resectable HCC, ssDNA and α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were measured during follow-up and compared with HCC recurrence detected by imaging. Results The median ssDNA levels were higher in HCC than in healthy individuals, cirrhosis, and chronic hepatitis (median, 23.20 vs. 9.36, 9.64, and 9.76 ng/μL, respectively, P < 0.001). ssDNA levels in HCC were higher than those in cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis (both P < 0.001); there were no differences in ssDNA levels between healthy controls and patients with cirrhosis (P = 0.15) or chronic liver disease (P = 0.39). The area under the curve of ssDNA for HCC diagnosis was 0.909 (95% CI: 0.879-0.933). The ssDNA levels decreased by 3.19-fold (P < 0.001) after HCC radical resection. In six patients, the ssDNA levels increased about 3-6 months before a recurrence was detected by AFP and imaging. Conclusions ssDNA might be a noninvasive indicator for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. ssDNA could eventually be complementary to AFP levels and imaging, but confirmatory studies are necessary.","Zhao, Qi; Xu, Yiqiu; Yuan, Dandan; Yang, Junjun; Wang, Ying; Shen, Guorong; Huang, Xuewen",Disease markers,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9958909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394775/,762

We report donor participation and reaction rates before and after implementing multiple measures at Canadian Blood Services. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We introduced a structured program of 500 mL of water and a salty snack pre-donation and applied muscle tension (AMT) during donation. Donors were not deferred for out of range blood pressure (BP); however, BP was measured in first time donors. Time on the donation chair post-donation was decreased from 5 to 2 min for repeat donors. We assessed participation rates using our quarterly survey of 10,000 recent donors. We extracted vasovagal reactions with loss of consciousness (LOC) from our operational database and compared pre-implementation (Oct 12,018-March 31,2019) and post-implementation (Oct 12,019-March 31,2020) periods. RESULTS Survey response rates varied from 11% to 16%. The percentage of donors who drank the water and ate the salty snack increased from 58% to 82% and 44% to 70% over 4 quarters; those performing AMT increased from 24% to 41%. Reactions decreased from 19.07 per 10,000 (744 reactions in 390,123 donations) to 14.04 per 10,000 (537 in 382,382 donations) (p < .0001). No first-time donors with high BP (n = 684) but 5 with low BP (n = 718) had reactions, CI were very large. CONCLUSIONS Achieving optimal participation was challenging. After implementation of a donor wellness initiative based on best practice, rates of vasovagal reactions with LOC decreased by 25%.

102688,Weight-adapted surgical approach for laparoendoscopic single-site surgery in pediatric patients using low-cost reusable instrumentation: a prospective analysis.,2013,"Background: The pathophysiology of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has not yet been fully understood and HFpEF is often misdiagnosed. Remodeling and fibrosis stimulated by inflammation appear to be main factors for the progression of HFpEF. In contrast to patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, medical treatment in HFpEF is limited to relieving HF symptoms. Since mortality in HFpEF patients remains unacceptably high with a 5-year survival rate of only 30%, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Exercise seems to be a valid option. However, the optimal training regime still has to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the effects of a high-intensity interval (HIT) training vs. a moderate continuous training (MCT) on exercise capacity and disease-specific mechanisms in a cohort of patients with HFpEF. Methods: The proposed study will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting including 86 patients with stable HFpEF. Patients will undergo measurements of exercise capacity, disease-specific blood biomarkers, cardiac and arterial vessel structure and function, total hemoglobin mass, metabolic requirements, habitual physical activity, and quality of life (QoL) at baseline and follow-up. After the baseline visit, patients will be randomized to the intervention or control group. The intervention group (n = 43) will attend a supervised 12-week HIT on a bicycle ergometer combined with strength training. The control group (n = 43) will receive an isocaloric supervised MCT combined with strength training. After 12 weeks, study measurements will be repeated in all patients to quantify the effects of the intervention. In addition, telephone interviews will be performed at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years after the last visit to assess clinical outcomes and QoL. Discussion: We anticipate clinically significant changes in exercise capacity, expressed as VO2peak, as well as in disease-specific mechanisms following HIT compared to MCT. Moreover, the study is expected to add important knowledge on the pathophysiology of HFpEF and the clinical benefits of a training intervention as a novel treatment strategy in HFpEF patients, which may help to improve both QoL and functional status in affected patients.

With data obtained from the Taiwan registry, the factors associated with mTICI 3 recanalization and clinical outcomes in EVT are investigated. METHODS From January 2014 to September 2016, 108 patients who underwent EVT for AIS due to LVO in 11 medical centers throughout Taiwan were included. Complete recanalization is defined as achieving modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) grade 3. Good clinical outcomes are defined by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) 0-2 at 3 months after EVT. Clinical and imaging parameters for predicting mTICI 3 recanalization and good clinical outcomes are analyzed. RESULTS Of the 108 patients who received EVT, 54 (50%) patients had mTICI 3 recanalization. Having received aspiration only and the use of IV-tPA are shown to be significant predictors for mTICI 3 recanalization with odds ratios of 2.61 and 2.53 respectively. Forty-six (42.6%) patients experienced good 3-month clinical outcomes (mRS 0-2). Pretreatment collateral statuses, NIHSS scores, time lapses between symptoms to needle, and the occurrence of hemorrhage at 24 h are all significant predictors for good outcomes with odds ratios of 2.88, 0.91, 0.99, and 0.31 respectively.

SETTINGS This study was conducted by a specialized Colorectal Multidisciplinary Team at a tertiary teaching hospital. PATIENTS Seventy patients underwent surgery for middle or low rectal cancer between 2002 and 2008 without neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. We compared the preoperative staging with the pathological staging to determine the preoperative accuracy of endorectal ultrasound and MRI when using a modified Wong's classification vs the standard TN classification. INTERVENTIONS A modified version of Wong's classification was used for preoperative and pathological staging. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measured was the accuracy in the preoperative T staging. RESULTS The overall accuracy of endorectal ultrasound and MRI in assessing T staging was 68.6% and 72.9% (uT1/2, 90%; uT3, 58.3%; and uT4, 100% and rT1/2, 88%; rT3, 63.4%; and rT4, 75%). By using the proposed modified Wong's classification, the overall accuracy of endorectal ultrasound and MRI improved to 82.9% and 90%. LIMITATIONS The interobserver variability in radiological assessment was not evaluated. CONCLUSION With use of the modified Wong's classification proposed in this study, the overall accuracy of preoperative imaging in assessing T staging of rectal cancer is substantially improved, especially when endorectal ultrasound and MRI stage match, enhancing the selection of patients for neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy.","Muñoz, Elena; Granero-Castro, Pablo; Frasson, Matteo; Escartin, Jorge; Esclapez, Pedro; Campos, Salvador; Flor-Lorente, Blas; Garcia-Granero, Eduardo",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0b013e3182a69a3b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24201386/,762

METHODS Between June 2005 and April 2012, 252 patients underwent incisional hernia repair. Of these, 126 underwent laparoscopic and 126 open repair. The median follow-up was 38.7 months. RESULTS Baseline characteristics [age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, comorbidities, hernia size, and follow-up] did not differ significantly. Mean operative time was similar (72 vs. 83 min). Laparoscopic repair was associated with less postoperative pain, less postoperative complications (3.9% vs. 13.4%, P=0.012), and shorter hospital stay (3.5 vs. 4.3, P=0.002). Recurrence occurred in 6 patients of group 1 and in 7 patients of group 2 (4.7% vs. 5.5%, P=not significant). CONCLUSIONS In this study, the trend in favor of laparoscopic treatment for incisional hernias is remarkable. Fewer postoperative complications and shorter hospital stay with similar operative time may balance the higher costs associated with the technique.","Stipa, Francesco; Giaccaglia, Valentina; Burza, Antonio; Santini, Ettore; Bascone, Bruno; Picchio, Marcello","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31828e3c33; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23917600/,762

Many are prone to depression, anxiety and loneliness, and extra isolation leaves them vulnerable to compromised mental health. In this study, trained volunteers providing befriending for residents with symptoms of depression, anxiety and loneliness switched to remote befriending during COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to gauge volunteer perceptions of the switch. Methods: A qualitative phenomenological approach was used to understand how switching to remote befriending impacted on volunteers and residents. A convenience sample of 18 participants responded to questions either in individual or group interviews. Results: Volunteers adapted their befriending visits, switching from face to face visits to remote options. The format was decided collaboratively. Hearing impairments hindered phone calls. Residents sometimes felt uncomfortable with digital technology but on the whole, the change to remote ""visiting"" was accepted. Conclusions: Further research is being conducted to gauge mental health outcomes for residents. Most volunteers and residents accepted the switch to remote befriending as better than no contact. Clinical implications: Volunteers can provide valuable support for residents living with social isolation during COVID-19. The format for social support needs to be decided collaboratively between volunteer and resident.","Fearn, Marcia; Harper, Robin; Major, Georgia; Bhar, Sunil; Bryant, Christina; Dow, Briony; Dunt, David; Mnatzaganian, George; O'Connor, Daniel; Ratcliffe, Julie; Samuel, Sarah; Bagnall, Anne Marie; Doyle, Colleen",Clinical gerontologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2020.1868646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403935/,762

Our objective was to evaluate mental health symptoms and identify associated determinants among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS We used nationally representative data of 10,760 US adults from the COVID-19 Impact Survey. We defined cancer survivors as adults with a self-reported diagnosis of cancer (n = 854, 7.6%). We estimated associations of mental health symptoms among cancer survivors using multinomial logistic regression. We estimated determinants of reporting at least one mental health symptom 3-7 times in the 7 days before survey administration among cancer survivors using multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS Cancer survivors were more likely to report feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.90); depressed (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.09); lonely (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.91); and hopeless (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.06) 3-7 days per week in the last 7 days when compared with adults without cancer. Among cancer survivors, adults of age 30-44 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.95), females (aPR, 1.55, 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.13), adults without a high school degree (aPR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.04), and adults with limited social interaction (aPR, 1.40, 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.95) were more likely to report at least one mental health-related symptom in the last 7 days (3-7 days/week). CONCLUSION Cancer survivors are reporting mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly young adults, adults without a high school degree, women, and survivors with limited social support.","Islam, Jessica Yasmine; Vidot, Denise C; Camacho-Rivera, Marlene",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.00752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33492984/,762
103525,Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery for partial nephrectomy without ischemia using a microwave tissue coagulator.,2013,"BACKGROUND Current European Guideline for resuscitation recommends a centrally positioned umbilical venous catheter as the best option for administering necessary drugs. Especially in preterm infants, a frequently used alternative is the peripheral venous catheter. METHODS Two randomized controlled studies were conducted at the Division of Neonatology, Medical University of Graz. During neonatal resuscitation, a standardized protocol was filled out by an uninvolved observer including time points after birth of all attempts of venous puncture, time point of successful venous puncture, and total number of needed attempts. Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) were measured using pulse oximetry at the right hand/wrist. In each neonate, either NIRO 200NX (Hamamatsu, Japan) or INVOS 5100C (Covidien-Medtronic, USA) were used to measure cerebral tissue oxygenation index (cTOI) and cerebral regional oxygen saturation (crSO2), respectively. SpO2, HR, and cTOI/crSO2 during and 1 min before and after successful venous punctures were analyzed. RESULTS 70 protocols were reviewed. Data of 61 preterm neonates were analyzed. Mean gestational age was 31.5 ± 2.2 weeks, and the mean birth weight was 1,527 ± 541 g. In median, it needed one attempt [interquartile range (IQR) 1-2] to establish a peripheral venous catheter. In median, intravenous (IV) catheterization was successfully established 5 (IQR 4-9) min after birth. SpO2 and cTOI/crSO2 rose significantly following the percentiles during the first 10 min after the birth. HR did not change significantly. CONCLUSION Peripheral IV catheterization during postnatal stabilization of preterm infants is feasible and successful in most of the cases at first attempt.","Baik-Schneditz, Nariae; Pichler, Gerhard; Schwaberger, Bernhard; Mileder, Lukas; Avian, Alexander; Urlesberger, Berndt",Frontiers in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2017.00171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28848726/,762

We hypothesised that antenatal phthalate exposure may influence subsequent boy's growth and body composition through childhood and adolescence. Among 1399 singleton males from the Raine Study, 410 had maternal serum and at least one height, BMI or DEXA outcome available after birth and up to 20 years of age. Maternal serum collected at 18 and 34 weeks' gestation was pooled, and analyzed for concentrations of 32 metabolites of 15 phthalate diesters. Their serum concentrations were categorized into undetectable/detectable levels or tertiles. Linear mixed models were used to determine associations between maternal serum phthalate levels and longitudinal height and body mass index (BMI) z-scores in boys from birth to 20 years of age (n=250 and n=295 respectively). Linear regression was used to determine associations between maternal phthalate levels and deviation from mid-parental height (n=177) and DEXA scan outcomes (n=191) at the 20 year follow-up. Weak positive associations of participants height z-score increase were detected with exposure to some phthalate metabolites in particular to the lower molecular weight phthalate metabolites. Less consistent findings, by mixed model analyses, were detected for BMI and body composition, by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), with some positive associations of phthalate metabolites with BMI and some negative associations with DEXA fat tissue measures, although no consistent findings were evident. In conclusion, we derived some associations of childhood growth with prenatal phthalate exposure, particularly with respect to the lower molecular weight phthalate metabolites.","Berman, Ye'elah E; Doherty, Dorota A; Main, Katharina M; Frederiksen, Hanne; Keelan, Jeffrey A; Newnham, John P; Hart, Roger J",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069699/,762
103670,The laparoscopic modified Sugarbaker technique is safe and has a low recurrence rate: a multicenter cohort study.,2013,"BACKGROUND Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection correlates with MM features. This study aimed to identify MM prognostic biomarkers with potential association with COVID-19. METHODS Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in five MM data sets (GSE47552, GSE16558, GSE13591, GSE6477, and GSE39754) with the same expression trends were screened out. Functional enrichment analysis and the protein-protein interaction network were performed for all DEGs. Prognosis-associated DEGs were screened using the stepwise Cox regression analysis in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) MMRF-CoMMpass cohort and the GSE24080 data set. Prognosis-associated DEGs associated with COVID-19 infection in the GSE164805 data set were also identified. RESULTS A total of 98 DEGs with the same expression trends in five data sets were identified, and 83 DEGs were included in the protein-protein interaction network. Cox regression analysis identified 16 DEGs were associated with MM prognosis in the TCGA cohort, and only the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6C (COX6C) gene (HR = 1.717, 95% CI 1.231-2.428, p = .002) and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) gene (HR = 0.882, 95% CI 0.798-0.975, p = .014) were independent factors related to MM prognosis in the GSE24080 data set. Both of them were downregulated in patients with mild COVID-19 infection compared with controls but were upregulated in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with patients with mild illness. CONCLUSIONS The NOD2 and COX6C genes might be used as prognostic biomarkers in MM. The two genes might be associated with the development of COVID-19 infection.","Wang, Fei; Liu, Ran; Yang, Jie; Chen, Baoan",International journal of laboratory hematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34623759/,762

Although there is a large number of PCR sensor systems available for this purpose, there is still a lack of portable digital PCR (dPCR) heating systems. Here, we first demonstrated a portable plasmonic heating-based dPCR system. The device has total dimensions of 9.7 × 5.6 × 4.1 cm and a total power consumption of 4.5 W, allowing for up to 25 dPCR experiments to be conducted on a single charge of a 20 000 mAh external battery. The dPCR system has a maximum heating rate of 10.7 °C s-1 and maximum cooling rate of 8 °C s-1.

Infection with an expanding list of respiratory viruses is an important cause of acute wheezing in infancy, and viruses are detected in most exacerbations of asthma throughout childhood. Furthermore, infants who develop severe viral respiratory infections are more likely to have asthma later in childhood. There has been progress in understanding the pathogenesis of viral respiratory illnesses, and this has led to new insights into how these processes might differ in asthma. Several host factors, including respiratory allergy and virus-induced interferon responses, modify the risk of virus-induced wheezing. In the absence of effective antiviral therapies, treatment of virus-induced wheezing and exacerbations of asthma can be challenging, and studies evaluating current treatment strategies are reviewed. Understanding the host-pathogen interactions that determine the severity of respiratory illnesses and long-term sequelae is likely to be of great help in identifying at-risk individuals, and in designing new and more effective treatments.","Gern, James E",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e318168b718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18820588/,762

Clinicians should make an effort to update their knowledge on mechanisms of action, indications and adverse events of these novel therapies. Most of them have immunosuppressive effects and, therefore, vaccination is indicated. AREAS COVERED vaccination of patients under mAbs therapies. EXPERT OPINION Recommendations on vaccination are still based on expert recommendations and have not been updated in recent years. Specific recommendations for each mAb have not been addressed in the current literature. The aim of this comprehensive review was to collect all the therapeutic mAbs approved up to January 1, 2020 and, based on previous recommendations and the pharmaceutical characteristics of each drug, to propose an updated guide with recommendations on vaccination. Influenza, sequential pneumococcal and Hepatitis B vaccination in patients with negative serology were the only consistent recommendations. Hepatitis A vaccination was proposed for mAbs with special hepatotoxic characteristics. Other vaccines are reviewed and discussed. Several non-immunosuppressive mAbs were detected and, therefore, vaccinations not recommended. We hope that this review can serve as a starting point for compiling updated vaccination recommendations and collecting all the therapeutic mAbs approved up to 2020.","Rivera-Izquierdo, Maria; Valero-Ubierna, Maria Del Carmen; Nieto-Gómez, Pelavo; Martínez-Bellón,; Fernández-Martínez, N F; Barranco-Quintana, J L",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2020.1800462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702246/,762

METHODS Twenty-four artificial molar teeth with a band-shaped isthmus were allocated to three groups (n = 8) for obturation, according to the filling technique: single-cone (SC), continuous wave of condensation (CWC) or lateral condensation (LC). Obturation was performed with gutta-percha (GP) cones and iRoot SP (Innovative Bioceramix, Vancouver, Canada). Post-filling micro-CT scanning was performed. The percentage of filling materials and void volumes were calculated in the isthmus areas and data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS The mean percentage of void volumes and corresponding filling percentages in the isthmus areas after obturation in the SC groups was 22.98 % ± 1.19 %, 77.02 % ± 1.19 %; in the CWC groups 10.46 % ± 2.28 %, 89.54 % ± 2.28 %; and in the LC groups was 13.14 % ± 1.85 %, 86.86 % ± 1.85 %, respectively.

This systematic literature review aimed to gain insight into public perceptions and behavioral responses to the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, with a focus on trends over time and regional differences. We screened 5498 articles and identified 70 eligible studies from PubMed, Embase, and PsychINFO. Public misconceptions were apparent regarding modes of transmission and preventive measures. Perceptions and behaviors evolved during the pandemic. In most countries, perceived vulnerability increased, but perceived severity, anxiety, self-efficacy, and vaccination intention decreased. Improved hygienic practices and social distancing were practiced most commonly. However, vaccination acceptance remained low. Marked regional differences were noted. To prevent misconceptions, it is important that health authorities provide up-to-date information about the virus and possible preventive measures during future outbreaks. Health authorities should continuously monitor public perceptions and misconceptions. Because public perceptions and behaviors varied between countries during the pandemic, risk communication should be tailored to the specific circumstances of each country. Finally, the use of health behavior theories in studies of public perceptions and behaviors during outbreaks would greatly facilitate the development of effective public health interventions that counter the effect of an outbreak.","Bults, Marloes; Beaujean, Desirée J M A; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Voeten, Hélène A C M",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2014.160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25882127/,762

Our research questions: (1) Are scores of the box trainer interchangeable with the virtual equivalent of the exercise; (2) does training on the box affect performance on the VR simulator and vice versa; and (3) which system is preferred? METHODS Experienced laparoscopists and medical interns were randomly assigned to one of two groups (V or B). They performed eight repetitions of the peg transfer task (4 on each simulator system) following a crossover study design. Group B started on the box trainer and group V started on the VR simulator. Opinion of participants was evaluated by a questionnaire. RESULTS A significant correlation was found between time to complete the task on the box and the VR simulator. The comparison of the performances per system showed that group B (N = 14) performed the peg transfer task on the VR simulator in significantly less time than group V (N = 14; p = 0.014). Overall, the box was preferred over the VR simulator. CONCLUSIONS Although performances on the box trainer and VR simulator were correlated, they were not interchangeable. The results also imply that assessment on the VR simulator after pretraining on the box is acceptable, whereas VR simulator training alone might not suffice to pass an assessment on a box trainer. More research is needed to validate the use of the VR simulator as a FLS and PLUS assessment instrument.","Brinkman, Willem M; Tjiam, Irene M; Buzink, Sonja N",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-2930-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23549769/,762

RESULTS Despite some anxiety during lockdown, for those who were retired, working at home or receiving wage subsidies, the experience was very enjoyable. Whether living alone or in households, anxieties were largely ameliorated by a sense of support from family, fellow citizens and government. In contrast, essential workers, those who lost employment and informal carers did not feel sufficient community support to alleviate their anxiety.

Obesity may affect vancomycin pharmacokinetics and is increasingly common among children. OBJECTIVE We aimed to determine if children with overweight or obesity have increased vancomycin trough concentrations with total body weight (TBW) dosing compared with children with normal weight. DATA SOURCES We conducted a search of Medline and Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations from 1952 (the year vancomycin was discovered) to November 2017. STUDY SELECTION Search terms included vancomycin, body weight, and body composition terms and were limited to children. Studies were reviewed and screened by ≥2 reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION The primary outcome was vancomycin level. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers. We performed quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. RESULTS We identified 271 records. After abstract and full-text screening, we identified 7 studies for full review. Six of the 7 studies used a matched case-control design, although there was significant variation in study methodology. Four of the 7 studies were included in a meta-analysis, which revealed a small but significant difference in vancomycin trough levels between children with normal weight and children with overweight or obesity when dosed by using TBW (N = 521; mean difference 2.2 U [95% confidence interval: 1.0-3.4]).

More studies evaluating dosing strategies in children with obesity are warranted because using TBW to dose vancomycin may lead to higher vancomycin concentrations and potential toxicity.","Khare, Manaswitha; Azim, Aniqa; Kneese, Garrett; Haag, Meredith; Weinstein, Kelsey; Rhee, Kyung E; Foster, Byron Alexander",Hospital pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2019-0287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213528/,762
106650,Newly Developed Laparoscopic Needle Holder That Facilitates Knot Tying Makes Vaginal Cuff Suturing Easy in Single-Port Laparoscopic Hysterectomy.,2017,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions within health care, both directly as a result of the infectious disease outbreak, and indirectly because of public health measures to mitigate against transmission. This disruption has caused rapid dynamic fluctuations in demand, capacity, and even contextual aspects of health care. Therefore, the traditional face-to-face patient-physician care model has had to be re-examined in many countries, with digital technology and new models of care being rapidly deployed to meet the various challenges of the pandemic. This Viewpoint highlights new models in ophthalmology that have adapted to incorporate digital health solutions such as telehealth, artificial intelligence decision support for triaging and clinical care, and home monitoring. These models can be operationalised for different clinical applications based on the technology, clinical need, demand from patients, and manpower availability, ranging from out-of-hospital models including the hub-and-spoke pre-hospital model, to front-line models such as the inflow funnel model and monitoring models such as the so-called lighthouse model for provider-led monitoring. Lessons learnt from operationalising these models for ophthalmology in the context of COVID-19 are discussed, along with their relevance for other specialty domains.","Gunasekeran, Dinesh V; Tham, Yih-Chung; Ting, Daniel S W; Tan, Gavin S W; Wong, Tien Y",The Lancet.

A prolapsed stoma which cannot be reduced or complicated with strangulation needs surgical correction. This case report describes a minimal access correction of a prolapsed gangrenous distal limb of ileostomy. Presentation of Case. A 67-year-old male patient was diagnosed with a lower rectal carcinoma, staged T3N1M0. Following neoadjuvant chemoradiation, he underwent a laparoscopic anterior resection with a defunctioning loop ileostomy. One month later, he presented with prolapse of the distal limb of the ileostomy. The limb was gangrenous and the gangrenous part was removed by using a linear GI stapler, and the loop ileostomy was converted to end-loop ileostomy. Discussion. It is a simple and technically feasible method for treating a prolapsed loop of the stoma. It is less invasive and has minimal postoperative complications. This technique reduces the duration of the hospital stay of the patient. Conclusion Stapled assisted correction of prolapsed stoma avoids unnecessary laparotomy and aids in expedite recovery after surgery. It is beneficial for a surgeon to be familiar with the minimal access correction for stoma prolapse.","Shelton, John; Rajendra, Sittampalam",Case reports in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8873388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204567/,762

However, little information on the hematologic changes associated with this infectious disease in pigeons has been published. The aim of this investigation was to compare the hematologic parameters of domestic pigeons (Columba livia var. domestica) naturally infected with M avium subsp. avium (MAA) with clinically healthy pigeons. Blood samples were collected from 12 pigeons with suspected mycobacteriosis and 12 clinically healthy pigeons. All the birds with suspect infections were necropsied, and affected organs were cultured and examined on histopathology for mycobacteriosis. Total leukocyte and erythrocyte counts were performed on each blood sample with the Natt and Herrick method using a Neubauer hemocytometer. White blood cell (WBC) differential counts were performed on Giemsa-stained blood smears. Packed cell volumes (PCVs) were measured using the microhematocrit technique. Hemoglobin concentrations were measured with a spectrophotometer using the cyanomethemoglubin method. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations (MCHCs), and mean cell volumes (MCVs) were calculated manually. All of the infected birds had typical histopathologic findings of avian mycobacteriosis, which were confirmed using microbiologic and molecular methods to detect MAA. The hematologic data from the two groups were compared. The total WBC, heterophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts were significantly higher, and the PCV, HGB, MCH, and MCHC values were significantly lower in the infected birds compared with the clinically healthy pigeons.","Parvandar Asadollahi, Kaveh; Mayahi, Mansour; Rocky, Alireza; Khajeh, Gholam Hossein; Mosavari, Nader",Veterinary clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1111/vcp.12968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046936/,762

This study aimed to compare 30-day postoperative morbidity and length of hospital stay among elderly patients after appendectomy. METHODS Appendicitis patients older than 65 years were extracted from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) database. Demographics and rates of complications for patients undergoing open and laparoscopic appendectomies were compared. Uni- and multivariate analyses adjusted for differences between groups compared the end points of major and minor complications as well as the days of hospital stay after initial surgery. RESULTS A total of 3,335 patients underwent appendectomy, with 2,235 patients (67%) receiving a laparoscopic procedure. The open appendectomy patients were significantly older and more likely to have various preoperative comorbidities (p<0.05). No difference in median operative time between the two techniques was found. Both required 51 min (p=0.11). The open cases had higher rates of both major and minor postoperative complications than the laparoscopic cases (p<0.0001), both overall and before discharge. Multivariate analysis showed no association between operative approach and major complications, and a reduced risk of minor complications with laparoscopy. Length of surgical stay was longer for the open group than for the laparoscopically treated group (median, 4 days vs 2 days; p<0.05). After adjustment, laparoscopy still was significantly associated with a shorter hospital stay than open appendectomy (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe procedure for elderly patients. During the 30-day postoperative period, no correlation with major complications was found, and the findings showed a beneficial association with regard to minor complications. After adjustment for perioperative factors, laparoscopy is associated with a shorter hospital stay than open appendectomy.","Kim, Michael J; Fleming, Fergal J; Gunzler, Douglas D; Messing, Susan; Salloum, Rabih M; Monson, John R T",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1467-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21298549/,762

Study focuses to explore the clinical relevancy of Coagulation assays; prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (FIB), D-dimer and international normalised ratio (INR) and their response to palliative chemotherapy in advanced stage NSCLC. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted between 2013 and 2019 in Jiangsu Cancer hospital, Nanjing, PR. China. Medical records of 5445 patients were succinctly reviewed and classified accordingly to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 216 advanced NSCLC patients who used a first line chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy regimen were enrolled in this study under ethical approval (JSCH-2020C-009). Blood samples were collected from these patients to measure the response levels of these coagulation parameters at time of admission to hospital and at the beginning of 4 cycles of Palliative therapy. We find the clinical value of all these coagulation parameters by using SPSS 24. Univariate Cox regression and Multivariate Cox regression models were used to identify the factors that were associated with progression free survival (PFS) and the response to palliative chemotherapy. RESULTS In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for overall median (95%CI) survival of high pre-treatment coagulation parameters showed shorter PFS compared to normal pre-treatment except TT and their overall median (95%CI) follow up was 3.3(3.12-3.47). Coagulation parameters have showed clinical relevance as a potential independent prognostic factor of PFS in the Univariate Cox regression. In multivariable model, Age (≥ 60 years vs. <60 years), cancer differentiation (Unknown vs. Poor), PT (High vs. Normal) range, FIB (High vs. Normal) range, and D-dimer (High vs. Normal) range, (p = 0.025, p = 0.045, p = 0.029, p = 0.049, and p = 0.011 respectively) were associated as a prognostic factor of PFS in NSCLC. Patients on 3-drugs regimen found to have better PFS compared to the ones taking the 2-drugs treatment regimen (p= 0.043). CONCLUSION The high range of PT, FIB, and D-dimers was associated with poor prognosis of advanced-stage NSCLC. Our findings also confirmed that patients on 3-drugs regimen showed longer PFS compared to 2-drugs regimen.","Abbas, Muhammad; Kassim, Said Abasse; Wang, Zhong-Chang; Shi, Meiqi; Hu, Yiqiao; Zhu, Hai-Liang",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726491/,762
108454,Does advancement in stapling technology with triple-row and enhanced staple configurations confer additional safety? A matched comparison of 340 stapled ileocolic anastomoses.,2018,"BACKGROUND Parastomal hernia (PH) is a frequent complication of colorectal surgery, which incidence reaches 55% of all stoma formation. Currently, there is no definitive strategy for its repair. This study was designed to assess the outcome in patients who underwent laparoscopic PH repair using a slit mesh/keyhole technique. METHODS We undertook a retrospective case review of all patients who underwent laparoscopic PH repair with a designed slit mesh/keyhole between 2005 and 2010. Three ports were placed opposite the stoma site, and careful adhesiolysis and hernia content reduction were performed. The parastomal fascial defect was measured and covered with a designated mesh. Fixation of the mesh was achieved with concentric tacks and transcutaneous Prolene suture. Recurrence was diagnosed after examination of patients by two surgeons or by imaging demonstrating an indolent hernia. RESULTS Twenty-nine laparoscopic PH mesh repairs were performed with an average age of 63.5 (range 42-81, median 64) years to treat paracolostomy hernia in 18 of 29 cases (62.1%), para-ileostomy hernia in 10 of 29 cases (34.5%), and for an ileal conduit site hernia in 1 of 29 cases (3.4%). The average operative time was 179 (range, 80-300; median, 180) min. Two operations (6.9%) were converted to an open approach. Early postoperative complications were documented in four patients (13.8%), including one elderly patient with severe comorbidities who died from postoperative sepsis (mortality rate, 3.4%). Only one late complication was recorded (3.4%). The average hospital stay was 4.7 (range, 1-19; median, 3) days. Average follow-up time was 28 (range, 12-53; median, 30) months. Recurrence of the hernia was found in 13 of 28 patients (46.4%). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic slit mesh/keyhole repair is feasible, although it is a complex surgery reflected by extended operative time. The high recurrence rate suggests that technical improvement of the method is essential.","Mizrahi, H; Bhattacharya, P; Parker, M C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1866-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21858569/,762

108720,Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients with Mirizzi syndrome.,2018,"9-O-Acetylation is a common natural modification on sialic acids (Sias) that terminate many vertebrate glycan chains. This ester group has striking effects on many biological phenomena, including microbe-host interactions, complement action, regulation of immune responses, sialidase action, cellular apoptosis, and tumor immunology. Despite such findings, 9-O-acetyl sialoglycoconjugates have remained largely understudied, primarily because of marked lability of the 9-O-acetyl group to even small pH variations and/or the action of mammalian or microbial esterases. Our current studies involving 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans on glycan microarrays revealed that even the most careful precautions cannot ensure complete stability of the 9-O-acetyl group. We now demonstrate a simple chemical biology solution to many of these problems by substituting the oxygen atom in the ester with a nitrogen atom, resulting in sialic acids with a chemically and biologically stable 9-N-acetyl group. We present an efficient one-pot multienzyme method to synthesize a sialoglycan containing 9-acetamido-9-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac9NAc) and compare it to the one with naturally occurring 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2). Conformational resemblance of the two molecules was confirmed by computational molecular dynamics simulations. Microarray studies showed that the Neu5Ac9NAc-sialoglycan is a ligand for viruses naturally recognizing Neu5,9Ac2, with a similar affinity but with much improved stability in handling and study. Feeding of Neu5Ac9NAc or Neu5,9Ac2 to mammalian cells resulted in comparable incorporation and surface expression as well as binding to 9-O-acetyl-Sia-specific viruses. However, cells fed with Neu5Ac9NAc remained resistant to viral esterases and showed a slower turnover. This simple approach opens numerous research opportunities that have heretofore proved intractable.","Khedri, Zahra; Xiao, An; Yu, Hai; Landig, Corinna Susanne; Li, Wanqing; Diaz, Sandra; Wasik, Brian R; Parrish, Colin R; Wang, Lee-Ping; Varki, Ajit; Chen, Xi",ACS chemical biology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.6b00928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27936566/,762
108809,A clinical study of the LiVac laparoscopic liver retractor system.,2016,"PURPOSE In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, already limited services and resources for families of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in China became even more scarce. This qualitative case study highlights one online parent education and training (PET) program developed during the pandemic to offer home-intervention strategies to parents of children with ASD in mainland China. This exploratory study sought to examine the emic perspectives of the trainers and parents who participated in the 12-week intensive training program while considering the cultural context in China and the transnational, remote nature of the program. METHODS The primary data focused on the experiences of the trainers and parents within PET program's structure and strategies, which were adapted from the Training of Trainers model, and were collected from semi-structured, in-depth individual and focus group interviews conducted virtually with trainers (n = 4). Supplemental data sources included training session materials and feedback forms collected from parents (n = 294) at the midpoint and end of the program. After the collected data were sorted and condensed, a thematic analysis was performed using the data analysis spiral to further organize and code the data, and the codes were finally collapsed into themes. FINDINGS Three overarching themes were identified: (1) training as modeling with resources, (2) dilemmas in cultural contexts and expectations, and (3) cultivating parent support networks. CONCLUSION The online PET program became a hub of support networks and learning spaces for parents of children with ASD in different regions in China during the pandemic. Through the interactive virtual training sessions, parents were supported by continuous feedback on their home intervention and coached to cultivate support networks among themselves despite tensions arising from cultural differences and to implement effective intervention strategies that were individualized and authenticated to their specific familial needs.","McDevitt, Seung Eun",Research in developmental disabilities,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465589/,762

Incubation of the GA08 strain of IBV at 56 degrees C and passage in embryonated eggs was used as a method to fast track the attenuation process. The virus was incubated in a 56 degrees C water bath and aliquots were removed every 5 min for up to 1 h, and then each aliquot was inoculated into 10-day-old embryonated eggs. Virus with the longest incubation time that produced lesions in the embryos was harvested, again incubated at 56 degrees C as described and passaged in embryonated eggs. Attenuation of the virus, designated GA08/GA08HSp16/08, was verified in 1-day-old specific pathogen free chicks. A 10x dose of the vaccine was found to be safe for 2-week-old broiler chicks of commercial origin. The efficacy of the heat-treated attenuated virus was determined by vaccinating broiler chicks of commercial origin at 1 and 14 days of age intraocularly/intranasally. Vaccinated birds that were challenged with 10(4.5) median embryo infectious doses of pathogenic GA08 virus/bird at 28 days of age were protected from the disease, and challenge virus was only detected in the trachea of one of 21 birds by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction at 5 days post challenge. The attenuation process took 10 weeks to complete, which is a substantially shorter time than required to attenuate infectious bronchitis virus by serial passage in embryonated eggs without heat treatment (38 weeks or more).","Jackwood, Mark W; Hilt, Deborah A; Sellers, Holly S; Williams, Susan M; Lasher, Hiram N",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079451003801516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20544430/,762

METHODS A cross-sectional study design was used. Isometric arm strength (wrist flexion, wrist extension with flexed and extended fingers, elbow flexion/extension) was assessed in 72 children (mean age = 9.3 [SD = 1.9] years) with USCP, and isometric grip/pinch strength was assessed in 86 children (mean age = 9.3 [SD = 1.8] years) with USCP. Arm/grip/pinch strength was assessed in 120 children (mean age = 9.5 [SD = 1.7] years) with TD. Arm strength was measured with a hand-held dynamometer, and grip/pinch strength was measured with a calibrated, modified (digitized) grip dynamometer and a pinch meter. The nonaffected UE of children with USCP was compared with the preferred UE of children with TD, because both sides represent the preferred UE. The affected UE was compared with the nonpreferred UE of children with TD, as both sides represent the nonpreferred UE. RESULTS In all measurements except for grip strength of the preferred UE, children with USCP were weaker than children with TD. CONCLUSIONS In children with USCP, muscle strength weakness exists in both UEs. IMPACT When unimanual or bimanual ability limitations are present in children with unilateral cerebral palsy, investigation of the muscle strength of the nonaffected UE should be part of the assessment.","Dekkers, Koen J F M; Rameckers, Eugene A A; Smeets, Rob J E M; Gordon, Andrew M; Speth, Lucianne A W M; Ferre, Claudio L; Janssen-Potten, Yvonne J M",Physical therapy,https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzaa155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860701/,762

Methods Seven data bases were searched. Research criteria included cohort and case-control studies, carried out worldwide and published before September 9, 2020, that compared the serum antibody levels of hospitalized COVID-19 cases that RP after discharge to those that did NRP. Results There is some evidence that immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody levels in RP cases were lower compared with NRP cases. The hypothesis of incomplete clearance aligns with these findings. The possibility of false negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR test results during viral clearance is also plausible, as concentration of the viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in nasopharyngeal and fecal swabs fluctuate below the limits of RT-PCR detection during virus clearance. The probability of reinfection was less likely to be the cause of retesting positive because of the low risk of exposure where cases observed a 14 day-quarantine after discharge. Conclusion More studies are needed to better explain the immune response of recovered COVID-19 cases retesting positive after discharge.","Atchessi, Nicole; Striha, Megan; Edjoc, Rojiemiahd; Abalos, Christine; Lien, Amanda; Waddell, Lisa; Gabrani-Juma, Imran; Thompson, Emily; Dawson, Thomas",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v47i04a03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035665/,762
109443,Surgical outcomes according to the type of monopolar electrocautery device used in laparoscopic surgery for right colon cancer: a comparison of endo-hook versus endo-shears.,2019,"PURPOSE During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a large unmet need for follow-up services, particularly for chronic diseases such as epilepsy. Alternative methods to reach these people have become necessary. We assessed the feasibility, satisfaction, and effectiveness of video teleconsultation using mobile phones for managing persons with epilepsy (PWEs) on follow-up at a tertiary care center in the southern part of India. PATIENTS AND METHODS We included PWEs aged 18 years and over who have been evaluated in person within the past six months, with details available in electronic health records (EHRs), and advised regular follow-up after getting telephonic consent. We excluded those requiring emergency care and those seeking teleconsultation for new symptoms. Participants were sent a message in English and in the local language about the possibility of a video teleconsultation. If willing, they were informed about the date, time, and technical requirements such as smartphones, browsing facilities, etc. Feasibility and effectiveness were assessed. Satisfaction/acceptability was assessed using Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS From June 2020 to October 2020, we selected 336 PWEs after screening 1100 records, and we tried video teleconsultation in 141 (41.8%) PWEs. We achieved successful video connections in 95 (28.2%) and audio consultations in 46 (13.6%). The median duration for calling the participants, making successful connections, and consultation was 8 (5-14) min. The majority required two (47.4%) or three (32.6%) attempts. Sixty-five PWEs (68.4%) used caretaker's mobile phones. We gave prescriptions to all, and 18 received new drugs. Out of 95 PWEs, 90% either 'agreed' or 'strongly agreed' on 12 out of 14 telemedicine satisfaction questions. CONCLUSION Although we need to make video teleconsultation more feasible, our synchronous mobile video teleconsultation model is an effective and acceptable method to follow up PWEs. This real-time model has the advantage that it does not require any mobile application to be downloaded and installed. Further studies are needed to evaluate methods to improve the reach of these services particularly to vulnerable groups of the population.","Nair, Pradeep Pankajakshan; Aghoram, Rajeswari; Thomas, Bitty; Bharadwaj, Balaji; Chinnakali, Palanivel",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33677363/,762
109520,Arthroscopic removal of osteochondral fragments in the dorsal pouch of the proximal intertarsal joint in 29 horses.,2018,"Increased levels of urinary oxalate also known as hyperoxaluria, increase the likelihood of kidney stone formation through enhanced calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystallization. The management of lithiatic renal pathology requires investigations at the initial macromolecular stages. Hence, the current study was designed to unravel the protein make-up of human kidney stones and its impact on renal cells' altered proteome, induced as the consequence of CaOx injury. CaOx kidney stones were collected from patients; stones were pooled for entire cohort, followed by protein extraction. Immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and flow-cytometric analysis revealed the promising antilithiatic activity of kidney stone matrix proteins. The iTRAQ analysis of renal cells showed up-regulation of 12 proteins and down-regulation of 41 proteins due to CaOx insult, however, this differential expression was normalized in the presence of kidney stone matrix proteins. Protein network analysis revealed involvement of up-regulated proteins in apoptosis, calcium-binding, inflammatory and stress response pathways. Moreover, seven novel antilithiatic proteins were identified from human kidney stones' matrix: Tenascin-X-isoform2, CCDC-144A, LIM domain kinase-1, Serine/Arginine receptor matrix protein-2, mitochondrial peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase, volume-regulated anion channel subunit-LRRC8A and BMPR2. In silico analysis concluded that these proteins exert antilithiatic potential through crystal binding, thereby inhibiting the crystal-cell interaction, a pre-requisite to initiate inflammatory response. Thus, the outcomes of this study provide insights into the molecular events of CaOx induced renal toxicity and subsequent progression into nephrolithiasis.","Narula, Shifa; Tandon, Simran; Kumar, Dhruv; Varshney, Swati; Adlakha, Khushboo; Sengupta, Shantanu; Singh, Shrawan Kumar; Tandon, Chanderdeep",Life sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991878/,762

This paper aims to synthesize the state of knowledge on work-related illnesses, injuries, and risks experienced by Thai healthcare workers. We found that Thai healthcare personnel, like others worldwide, are at risk for injury related to needle sticks and sharp instruments; infectious diseases due to biological hazards exposure such as airborne pathogens and patient secretions; muscle pain due to workload and long duration of work; and psychological disorders related to stressful working conditions. Because detailed surveillance data are limited for the Thai healthcare workforce, we recommend that additional surveillance data on Thai healthcare workers' health outcomes be collected. Future research efforts should also focus on evidence-based interventions in order to develop methods to prevent and treat occupational health injuries and illnesses acquired in the workplace for Thai healthcare sector workers.","Tipayamongkholgul, Mathuros; Luksamijarulkul, Pipat; Mawn, Barbara; Kongtip, Pornpimol; Woskie, Susan",New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS,https://doi.org/10.1177/1048291116633871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26956017/,762

Here, the paper developed a new type of microfluidic chip for nucleic acid detection where stretching acts as the driving force. The sample entered the chip by applying capillary force. The strain valve was opened under the action of tensile force, and the spring pump generated the power to drive the fluid to flow to the detection chamber in a specific direction. The detection of COVID-19 was realized on the chip. The RT-LAMP amplification system was adopted to observe the liquid color in the detection chamber to decide whether the sample tested positive or negative qualitatively.

DESIGN Single-centre, retrospective, observational study. PATIENTS COVID-19 patients undergoing rehabilitation (24 April to 24 May 2020). METHODS All COVID-19 inpatients undergoing rehabilitation in the general ward were assessed. Data were collected on age, sex, physical ability, rehabilitation modality (remote/direct), need for intubation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, degree of pneumonia, oxygen therapy from the start of rehabilitation, D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels, and rehabilitation-related complications. Activities of daily living were measured using the Barthel Index. RESULTS Out of a total of 43 patients, 14 were initially provided with remote rehabilitation and 29 with direct rehabilitation. Four patients were switched from direct to remote rehabilitation during the study, thus at the end of the study there were 18 in the remote rehabilitation group and 25 in the direct rehabilitation group. Patients in remote rehabilitation were significantly younger than those in direct rehabilitation. Of 12 patients who required intubation, 3 were given remote rehabilitation. One extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivor underwent direct rehabilitation. All patients on remote rehabilitation were discharged home or to a hotel. Twelve out of 29 patients were transferred to a rehabilitation hospital due to delayed recovery of activities of daily living. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION Effective and safe remote rehabilitation was performed in 41.9% of COVID-19 patients in this study, which resulted in improved rehabilitation in COVID-19 zones.","Sakai, Tomoko; Hoshino, Chisato; Yamaguchi, Reiko; Hirao, Masa; Nakahara, Rui; Okawa, Atsushi",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.2340/16501977-2731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32871014/,762
111182,High incidence of symptomatic incisional hernia after midline extraction in laparoscopic colon resection.,2012,"BACKGROUND In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused an acute risk of deterioration and dying for many, and an urgent need to start advance care planning. AIM To explore how general practitioners (GPs) experienced discussing values, goals and preferences with patients during COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING Qualitative research in general practice. METHODS Semi-structured interviews for which Dutch GPs were recruited via purposive sampling. Content analysis was used. RESULTS Fifteen GPs were interviewed. Six themes were identified: (i) urge of advance care planning, (ii) the GP's perceived role in it, (iii) preparations for it, (iv) (proactively) discussing it, (v) essentials for good communication and (vi) advance care planning in the (near) future. Calls for proactively discussing advance care planning in the media and in COVID-guidelines caused awareness of it's importance. GPs envisaged an important role for themselves in initiating it, especially with patients at risk to deteriorate or die from COVID-19. Timing advance care planning appeared difficult but crucial. The recommended digital way of communication was considered problematic due to missing nonverbal communication and difficulties in involving relatives. It was noted that admission to the ICU, which was hardly discussed before the COVID-19 pandemic, should remain a topic during advance care planning. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic brought advance care planning into a new light, GPs were more experienced with discussing it and patients were more aware of their frailty. Because of the nearing 'grey wave', advance care planning should remain top priority. Therefore, it should be central in GP and post-academic training.","Dujardin, Janneke; Schuurmans, Jaap; Westerduin, Dieke; Wichmann, Anne B; Engels, Yvonne",Palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/02692163211016979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041987/,762

Screening disparities continue to exist among ethnic minorities, particularly for African Americans. We herein review the barriers of colorectal cancer screening in this population. RECENT FINDINGS At its foundation are patient barriers, which are further compounded by physician-related barriers and the idiosyncrasies of the healthcare system. Interventions to address the barriers include patient outreach, provider education, and healthcare legislation addressing financial barriers. Recent research has focused on factors predicting intentions to undergo colorectal cancer screening. Underlying all of the barriers is the systemic racism that affects and influences the healthcare system as much as all other institutions and contributes to inequities in the delivery of effective cancer prevention efforts. Perpetual disparities in CRC screening within the African American community are due to multifactorial barriers from the individual patient to provider and healthcare system and societal influences. An awareness of the behavioral and systemic factors that affect African Americans must underpin efforts to reach full equity in delivering CRC screening to this often medically underserved segment of our society.","White, Pascale M; Itzkowitz, Steven H",Current gastroenterology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11894-020-00776-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647903/,762

Studies of emerging diseases under outbreak conditions have focused on the complete spectrum of pathogens, transmissibility, shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity, epidemiological causes, and interventions to control emergence. During the initial stages of an outbreak, laboratory response capacity focuses on expansion of efficient diagnostic tools for rapid case detection, contact tracing, putting epidemiological findings into sources, mode of transmission, and identification of susceptible groups and reservoirs. It is important for public health diagnostic laboratories to have a fundamental knowledge of viral shedding, antibody response kinetics, assay validation, interpretation, and uncertainties of test results. This study reviewed currently published data from available literature on SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared this with data on viral shedding and antibody response kinetics of other human coronaviruses. Also described are current challenges and comments on some biases and significant data gaps that have limited laboratory preparedness to SARS-CoV-2. Consistent documentation of progress and data gaps from standardized reporting of methods utilized, sampling date, details of test results by specimen type, risk assessments, and symptoms can all be used strategically and provide incentives to governments and their partners to prioritize the development, detection, and response to outbreaks.","Biswas, Subrata; Ghosh, Piyali; Chakraborty, Debjit; Chatterjee, Ananya; Dutta, Shanta; Saha, Malay Kumar",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2020.0147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264056/,762

Liquid infiltration of the preperitoneal space can help facilitate dissection and avoid inadvertent injuries. We describe a novel technique for TAPP inguinal hernia repair using liquid-injection for preperitoneal [corrected] dissection and report our initial experience. METHODS TAPP inguinal hernia repair using a liquid-injection technique during preperitoneal dissection was performed by a single surgical resident without prior TAPP repair experience from July 2013 to January 2014. After trocar placement, 60 mL of 0.3 % lidocaine with 1:300,000 dilution of epinephrine was injected percutaneously using a blunt needle under laparoscopic visualization into the preperitoneal space to assist with the dissection and parietalization of the vas deferens, spermatic vessels, and epigastric vessels. The initial peritoneal incision is performed at the lateral side of the inguinal canal, followed by blunt dissection of the preperitoneal space. RESULTS Eleven patients (median age: 69; 8 male) with a total of 12 inguinal hernias underwent a TAPP repair using a liquid-injection preperitoneal dissection technique. Ten patients had unilateral hernias (4 indirect, 6 direct), and one patient had bilateral direct hernias. The median operative time, median injection time, and median dissection time were 116, 3.5, and 42 min, respectively. Estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL for all cases. No intraoperative injuries, conversions to open repair, or 30-day postoperative complications occurred. There were no hernia recurrences after a median follow-up of 143 days. CONCLUSION Our preliminary experience suggests that liquid-injection to assist preperitoneal dissection during TAPP inguinal hernia repair appears to be safe and feasible. This novel method facilitates the dissection of spermatic cord structures, and can be used to minimize trauma to surrounding structures, especially when performed by trainees with limited operative experience.","Mizota, Tomoko; Watanabe, Yusuke; Madani, Amin; Takemoto, Norihiro; Yamada, Hidehisa; Poudel, Saseem; Miyasaka, Yuji; Kurashima, Yo",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3703-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015524/,762

113205,Pure transvaginal laparoscopic appendectomy.,2012,"UNLABELLED The nucleolar subcompartment of the nucleus is increasingly recognized as an important target of RNA viruses. Here we document for the first time the ability of dengue virus (DENV) polymerase, nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), to accumulate within the nucleolus of infected cells and to target green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the nucleolus of live transfected cells. Intriguingly, NS5 exchange between the nucleus and nucleolus is dynamically modulated by extracellular pH, responding rapidly and reversibly to pH change, in contrast to GFP alone or other nucleolar and non-nucleolar targeted protein controls. The minimal pH-sensitive nucleolar targeting region (pHNTR), sufficient to target GFP to the nucleolus in a pH-sensitive fashion, was mapped to NS5 residues 1 to 244, with mutation of key hydrophobic residues, Leu-165, Leu-167, and Val-168, abolishing pHNTR function in NS5-transfected cells, and severely attenuating DENV growth in infected cells. This is the first report of a viral protein whose nucleolar targeting ability is rapidly modulated by extracellular stimuli, suggesting that DENV has the ability to detect and respond dynamically to the extracellular environment. IMPORTANCE Infections by dengue virus (DENV) threaten 40% of the world's population yet there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapeutic to treat infections. Understanding the molecular details that govern effective viral replication is key for the development of novel antiviral strategies. Here, we describe for the first time dynamic trafficking of DENV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) to the subnuclear compartment, the nucleolus. We demonstrate that NS5's targeting to the nucleolus occurs in response to acidic pH, identify the key amino acid residues within NS5 that are responsible, and demonstrate that their mutation severely impairs production of infectious DENV. Overall, this study identifies a unique subcellular trafficking event and suggests that DENV is able to detect and respond dynamically to environmental changes.","Fraser, Johanna E; Rawlinson, Stephen M; Heaton, Steven M; Jans, David A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02727-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27076639/,762

113395,Comparison of outcomes of single-incision and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystitis requiring percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage.,2019-12-09,"BACKGROUND As life expectancy increases, the number of octogenarians requiring primary and revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is increasing. Recently, primary TKA has become a common treatment option in octogenarians. However, surgeons may still be hesitant about performing revision TKA on octogenarians because of concern about risk and cost benefit. The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes, postoperative complications, and mid-term lifetime survival in octogenarians after primary and revision TKA. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 231 primary TKAs and 41 revision TKAs performed on octogenarians between 2000 and 2016. The mean age of patients undergoing primary TKA was 81.9 years and that of patients undergoing revision TKA was 82.3 years (p = 0.310). The age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index was higher in revision TKA (4.4 vs. 4.8, p = 0.003). The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and range of motion (ROM) were evaluated. The incidence of postoperative complications (TKA-related, specific or systemic) and lifetime survival rate (endpoint death determined by telephone or mail communication with patient or family) were investigated. RESULTS The WOMAC and ROM improved significantly after primary and revision TKA, although postoperative results were worse in the revision group (33.1 vs. 47.2; 128.9° vs. 113.6°; p < 0.001, respectively). There were no cases of aseptic or septic component failure in either group. One case of periprosthetic fracture was observed in the revision group (0% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.151), and three cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) (one case of DVT and two cases of PTE) were observed in the primary group (1.3% vs. 0%, p = 1.000). The most common systemic complication in both groups was delirium (7.4% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.131). There were no differences between the two groups in the other systemic complication rates. The 5-year and 10-year lifetime survival rates were 87.2% and 62.9%, respectively, in primary TKA and 82.1% and 42.2%, respectively, in revision TKA (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS Both primary and revision TKA are viable options for octogenarians, based on the satisfactory clinical outcomes, TKA-related complication rates, and mid-term lifetime survival. Delirium needs to be managed appropriately as the most common systemic complication in both primary and revision TKA in octogenarians.

113621,"Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for treatment of unilateral adrenocortical carcinomas: technique, complications, and results in seven dogs.",2008,"Objectives Tube thoracostomy (TT) is a common yet potentially life-saving trauma procedure. After successful placement however, securing a TT through suturing is a skillset that requires practice, risking that the TT may become dislodged during prehospital transport. The purpose of this study was to examine if the iTClamp was a simpler technique with equivalent effectiveness for securing TTs. Materials and methods In a cadaver model, a 1.5 inch incision was utilized along the upper border of the rib below the 5th intercostal space at the anterior axillary line. TTs (sizes 28Fr, 32Fr, 36Fr and 40Fr) were inserted and secured with both suturing and iTClamp techniques according to the preset randomization. TT were then functionally tested for positive and negative pressure as well as the force required to remove the TT (pull test-up to 5 lbs). Time to secure the TT was also recorded. Results When sutured is placed by a trained surgeon, the sutures and iTClamp were functionally equivalent for holding a positive and negative pressure. Mean pull force for both sutures and iTClamp exceeded the 5 lb threshold; there was no significant difference between the groups. Securing the TT with the iTClamp was significantly faster (p < 0.0001) with the iTClamp having a mean application time of 37.0 ± 22.8 s and using a suture had a man application time of 96.3 ± 29.0 s. Conclusion The iTClamp was effective in securing TTs. The main benefit to the iTClamp is that minimal skill is required to adequately secure a TT to ensure that it does not become dislodged during transport to a trauma center.","Mckee, Jessica; Mckee, Ian; Bouclin, Melanie; Ball, Chad G; McBeth, Paul; Roberts, Derek J; Atkinson, Ian; Filips, Dennis; Kirkpatrick, Andrew W",Turkish journal of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjem.2018.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29942877/,762

Objective To characterize the association of planned in-person school attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic with factors, including family socioeconomic characteristics, and parent attitudes and beliefs about their child's school attendance. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional survey study. Data were collected from June 2, 2020, to June 5, 2020, weighted to reflect population norms, and analyzed using ordered probit regression. A sample of US parents (of children ages 5-17 years) were recruited using a nonprobability survey panel with stratification by socioeconomic characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was parent-reported plan to send their child to school or keep their child home, conditional on their school opening for in-person instruction. Additional measures assessed family socioeconomic characteristics, medical vulnerability, worry about COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome, confidence in their child's school, and homeschooling difficulties. Results The sample of 730 parents was balanced by parent sex (53% women) with successful oversampling for Black (28%; n = 201) and Hispanic (27%; n = 200) participants. In estimates weighted to US population norms, 31% (95% CI, 27% to 34%) of participants indicated they would probably or definitely keep their child home this fall, and 49% indicated that they would probably or definitely send their child to school this fall. Factors associated with planning to keep children home included lower income (38% with incomes <$50 000 vs 21% with incomes $100 000-$150 000 per year; difference, 17%; 95% CI, 9% to 26%), being unemployed (40% unemployed vs 26% employed; difference, 14%; 95% CI, 5% to 25%), and having a flexible job (33% with flexible jobs vs 19% with inflexible jobs; difference, 14%; 95% CI, 5% to 30%). Planning to keep children home was also associated with fear of COVID-19 (B = 0.19; P < .001), fear of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (B = 0.12; P = .04), confidence in schools (B = -0.22; P < .001), and challenges of homeschooling (B = -0.12; P = .01). Race and ethnicity were not significantly associated with plans to keep children home. Conclusions and Relevance In this survey study, many parents planned to keep children home in fall 2020. Schools need to act soon to address parental concerns and provide options for what will be available for them should they opt to keep their child home. Structural barriers, such as lack of workplace flexibility and potential school-level inequities in implementation of preventive measures, must be acknowledged and addressed where possible.","Kroshus, Emily; Hawrilenko, Matt; Tandon, Pooja S; Christakis, Dimitri A",JAMA pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.3864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797152/,762

A new mixed vitamin E-Tocovid that mainly contains tocotrienols other than tocopherol, attenuated the progression of white matter lesions by oral in humans. However, the effect of Tocovid on ischemic stroke has not been examined. In the present study, we assessed the therapeutic effects of Tocovid pretreatment on transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS After pretreatment with Tocovid (200 mg/kg/d) or vehicle for 1 month, 60-minute tMCAO was performed, and these mice were examined at 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days after reperfusion. We histologically assessed the effects of Tocovid pretreatment on the expressive changes of oxidative stress markers, cleaved caspase-3, and LC3-II after tMCAO in mice. RESULTS We observed that Tocovid pretreatment significantly improved the rotarod time, reduced infarct volume, decreased the number of 4-HNE, nitrotyrosine, and 8-OhdG positive cells, inhibited advanced glycation end products biomarkers RAGE, CMA, and CML expressions, and increased Nrf2 and MRP1 levels with GSSG/GSH ratio decrease. Furthermore, Tocovid pretreatment greatly decreased cleaved caspase-3 and LC3-II expressions after tMCAO. CONCLUSIONS The present study obviously demonstrated that Tocovid pretreatment showed neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress and at least in part by antiapoptotic/autophagic cell death in ischemic mice brain.","Shang, Jingwei; Yan, Hongjing; Jiao, Yang; Ohta, Yasuyuki; Liu, Xia; Li, Xianghong; Morihara, Ryuta; Nakano, Yumiko; Fukui, Yusuke; Shi, Xiaowen; Huang, Yong; Feng, Tian; Takemoto, Mami; Sato, Kota; Hishikawa, Nozomi; Yamashita, Toru; Abe, Koji",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2018.03.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29793801/,762
114311,Is ileostomy always necessary following rectal resection for deep infiltrating endometriosis?,2015,"BACKGROUND Core outcome sets (COS) are being developed in many clinical areas to increase the quality and comparability of clinical trial results as well as to ensure their relevance for patients. A COS represents an agreed standardized set of outcomes that describes the minimum that should be consistently reported in all clinical trials of a defined area. It comprises a core domain set (defining what core outcomes should be measured) and a core measurement set (defining measurement/assessment instruments for each core domain). For pressure ulcer prevention trials a COS is lacking. The great heterogeneity of reported outcomes in this field indicates the need for a COS. METHODS/DESIGN The first part of this project aims to develop a core domain set by following established methods, which incorporates four steps: (1) definition of the scope, (2) conducting a scoping review, (3) organizing facilitated workshops with service users, (4) performing Delphi surveys and establishing consensus in a face-to-face meeting with different stakeholders. DISCUSSION After achieving consensus on the core domain set, further work will be undertaken to determine a corresponding core measurement set. This will lead to better pressure ulcer prevention research in the future. There are a number of methodological challenges in the field of COS development. To meet these challenges and to ensure a high-quality COS, the OUTPUTS project affiliates to current standards and works in close collaboration with international experts and with existing international service user groups.

Diagnosis by RT-PCR has been employed as the standard method to confirm viral infection. Sample pooling testing can optimize the resources by reducing the workload and reagents shortage, and be useful in laboratories and countries with limited resources. This study aims to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 detection by sample pooling testing in comparison with individual sample testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS We created 210 pools out of 245 samples, varying from 4 to 10 samples per pool, each containing a positive sample. We conducted detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp/E target sites. RESULTS Pooling of three samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection might be an efficient strategy to perform without losing RT-PCR sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS Considering the positivity rate in Dominican Republic and that larger sample pools have higher probabilities of obtaining false negative results, the optimal sample size to perform a pooling strategy shall be three samples.","Ramírez, Monica Tejeda; Rosario, Camila Del; Contreras, Elisa; Cabrera, Jhasmel; Degaudenzi, Alejandro Vallejo; Ramírez, Robert Paulino",Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eimc.2021.07.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334859/,762

The contamination occurs by inhalation of conidia present in the air, and the first encounter of this fungus in the human host is most likely with the bronchial epithelial cells. Although alveolar macrophages have been widely studied in the Aspergillus-lung interaction, increasing evidence suggests that bronchial epithelium plays a key role in responding to the fungus. This review focuses on the innate immune response of the bronchial epithelial cells against A. fumigatus, the predominant pathogenic species.

The present study provides the parameter estimates of the unknown parameters that critically determine the epidemic process derived from the SIR model and prediction of the future transition of the infectious proportion including the size and timing of the epidemic peak with the prediction intervals that naturally accounts for the uncertainty. Even though the epidemic appears to be settling down during this intervention period, the prediction results under various scenarios using the data up to May 18 reveal that the temporary reduction in the infection rate would still result in a delayed the epidemic peak unless the long-term reproduction number is controlled.","Kobayashi, Genya; Sugasawa, Shonosuke; Tamae, Hiromasa; Ozu, Takayuki",Bioscience trends,https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.03133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32461511/,762

Anticipating a need for such therapies during the pandemic, our center created a targeted protocol for ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients that allows us to provide this life-saving therapy to our sickest patients without overburdening already stretched resources or excessively exposing healthcare staff to infection risk. METHODS As a major regional referral program, we used the framework of our well-established ECMO service-line to outline specific team structures, modified patient eligibility criteria, cannulation strategies, and management protocols for the COVID-19 ECMO program. RESULTS During the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts, 6 patients were placed on VV ECMO for refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. The median (interquartile range) age was 47 years (43-53) with most patients being male (83%) and obese (67%). All cannulations were performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit in patients who had undergone a trial of rescue therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome including lung protective ventilation, paralysis, prone positioning, and inhaled nitric oxide. At the time of this report, 83% (5/6) of the patients are still alive with 1 death on ECMO, attributed to hemorrhagic stroke. 67% of patients (4/6) have been successfully decannulated, including 2 that have been successfully extubated and one who was discharged from the hospital. The median duration of VV ECMO therapy for patients who have been decannulated is 12 days (4-18 days). CONCLUSIONS This is 1 the first case series describing VV ECMO outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Our initial data suggest that VV ECMO can be successfully utilized in appropriately selected COVID-19 patients with advanced respiratory failure.","Osho, Asishana A; Moonsamy, Philicia; Hibbert, Kathryn A; Shelton, Kenneth T; Trahanas, John M; Attia, Rizwan Q; Bloom, Jordan P; Onwugbufor, Michael T; D'Alessandro, David A; Villavicencio, Mauricio A; Sundt, Thoralf M; Crowley, Jerome C; Raz, Yuval; Funamoto, Masaki",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32452947/,762
115349,An advanced RFID-based system to localize gastric and colon cancers during laparoscopic surgery.,2020-01-13,"BACKGROUND There are several medical devices used in Colombia for diabetes management, most of which have an associated telemedicine platform to access the data. In this work, we present the results of a pilot study evaluating the use of the Tidepool telemedicine platform for providing remote diabetes health services in Colombia across multiple devices. METHOD Individuals with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes using multiple diabetes devices were recruited to evaluate the user experience with Tidepool over three months. Two endocrinologists used the Tidepool software to maintain a weekly communication with participants reviewing the devices data remotely. Demographic, clinical, psychological and usability data were collected at several stages of the study. RESULTS Six participants, from ten at the baseline (five MDI and five CSII), completed this pilot study. Three different diabetes devices were employed by the participants: a glucose meter (Abbot), an intermittently-scanned glucose monitor (Abbot), and an insulin pump (Medtronic). A score of 81.3 in the system usability scale revealed that overall, most participants found the system easy to use, especially the web interface. The system also compared highly favourably against the proprietary platforms. The ability to upload and share data and communicate remotely with the clinicians was raised consistently by participants. Clinicians cited the lockdown imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic as a valuable test for this platform. Inability to upload data from mobile devices was identified as one of the main limitations. CONCLUSION Tidepool has the potential to be used as a tool to facilitate remote diabetes care in Colombia. Users, both participants and clinicians, agreed to recommend the use of platforms like Tidepool to achieve better disease management and communication with the health care team. Some improvements were identified to enhance the user experience.","León-Vargas, Fabian; Martin, Clare; Garcia-Jaramillo, Maira; Aldea, Arantza; Leal, Yenny; Herrero, Pau; Reyes, Angie; Henao, Diana; Gomez, Ana María",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118493/,762
115434,Does experience with laparoscopic colorectal surgery influence intraoperative outcomes?,2009,"Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a serious condition that entails a high risk of lower limb amputation. Despite revascularization being the gold-standard therapy, a considerable number of CLI patients are not suited for either surgical or endovascular revascularization. Angiogenic therapies are emerging as an option for these patients but are currently still under investigation. Before application in humans, those therapies must be tested in animal models and its mechanisms must be clearly understood. An animal model of hindlimb ischemia (HLI) has been developed by the ligation and excision of the distal external iliac and femoral arteries and veins in mice. A comprehensive panel of tests was assembled to assess the effects of ischemia and putative angiogenic therapies at functional, histologic and molecular levels. Laser Doppler was used for the flow measurement and functional assessment of perfusion. Tissue response was evaluated by the analysis of capillary density after staining with the anti-CD31 antibody on histological sections of gastrocnemius muscle and by measurement of collateral vessel density after diaphonization. Expression of angiogenic genes was quantified by RT-PCR targeting selected angiogenic factors exclusively in endothelial cells (ECs) after laser capture microdissection from mice gastrocnemius muscles. These methods were sensitive in identifying differences between ischemic and non-ischemic limbs and between treated and non-treated limbs. This protocol provides a reproducible model of CLI and a framework for testing angiogenic therapies.","Ministro, Augusto; de Oliveira, Paula; Nunes, Raquel J; Dos Santos Rocha, André; Ferreira, Tiago; Goyri-O'Neill, J; Rosa Santos, Susana Constantino",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/59582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233022/,762

STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo study. SAMPLE POPULATION LigaSure Small Jaw handsets (n = 6) and LigaSure Impact handsets (n = 6). METHODS Handsets underwent simulated splenectomy/cleaning/resterilization cycles until failure, defined as leaking vascular seal or blade retraction failure. Functional testing included assessment of vascular seal integrity, handset activation/tissue release, and cutting blade wear/retraction. Vascular seal failure was defined as a leak occurring at <300 mm Hg. Cycles to failure were recorded. Sealed vessels were evaluated by histology at first handset use and failure. RESULTS Vascular seals created with the Small Jaw handset failed at a mean (95% CI) of 17.2 cycles (9.6-24.8) and a minimum of 10 cycles. Vascular seals created with the Impact failed at a mean of 20 cycles (18.4-21.6) and a minimum of 17 cycles. The majority of seal failures (73%; 95% CI 39%-94%) immediate leaked during vessel filling. The rate of vascular seal failure increased after the initial failure. Failure was associated with histologic disparities in tissue apposition. CONCLUSION Repeated use and resterilization resulted in failure of the vascular seal due to inadequate tissue apposition after a minimum of 10 cycles. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Surgeons reusing and resterilizing LigaSure handsets (ForceTriad platform) should consider discarding handsets after 9 cycles for the Small Jaw and after 16 cycles for the Impact. Handsets should be immediately discarded after any intraoperative identification of vascular seal failure.","Kuvaldina, Alexandra; Hayes, Galina; Sumner, Julia; Behling-Kelly, Erica",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30180278/,762

Due to a decrease in the number of unclaimed bodies and rather few donations, there is an insufficient number of cadavers for anatomical studies in Iran. This study was carried out to evaluate medical students' awareness and willingness regarding body donation in Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to focus on the cultural acceptability and personal willingness to donate one's body after death. Students from the university's anatomy classes (n = 331) participated in this study. Seventy-seven percent of the students expressed their agreement toward the idea of utilizing body donation services, though only 25.4% of participants were willing to donate their own bodies. None of the demographic factors were associated with cultural acceptability or personal willingness towards body donation. These findings indicated that besides ""payment"", other factors were associated with students' willingness to become donors. All factors of awareness except ""previous awareness of organization"" were associated with cultural acceptability. In this study, students suggested that encouraging people to register for body donation using mass media (25.6%) and teaching students to respect cadavers in the dissection environment (24.8%) were the best solutions for addressing the lack of cadavers. These findings indicated that a lack of awareness about body donation might be the main factor responsible for unwillingness towards body donation; therefore, improving the public's awareness and addressing the willingness of students regarding body donation may help overcome the current lack of donated cadavers.

Thirty-two patients with hepatic hemangiomas were treated with RF ablation and blood samples of the patients were collected at different time points. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to evaluate the expression of caspase-1, gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-1β and IL-18 in hepatic hemangioma and subablated hemangioma tissue. In vitro experiments, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with sub-ablative hyperthermia with or without the addition of caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CMK in the medium. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IL-18, IL-1β, caspase-1 and GSDMD were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, real-time PCR and Western blot methods. An elevation of general SIR parameters (CRP and WBC), pyroptosis-related inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18) and LDH were observed 1-day post-RF ablation and their peak values were significantly correlated with ablated volume (p < .001) and ablation time (p < .001). Moreover, levels of pyroptosis-related inflammatory cytokines correlated well with general SIR parameters, respectively (p < .001). Immunohistochemical analysis showed the increased expression of caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-18 and IL-1β in the endothelial cells of subablated hemangioma. In vitro experiments showed that subablative hyperthermia induced the caspase-1-associated endothelial pyroptosis and Ac-YVAD-CMK attenuated pyroptosis. In conclusion, SIR in patients treated by RF ablation for hepatic hemangiomas was significantly associated with the ablated volume and ablation time and endothelial pyroptosis may involve in the occurrence of SIR following RF ablation of hepatic hemangiomas.","Wang, Shaohong; Yang, Mengmeng; Yang, Xu; Xu, Li; Ke, Shan; Ding, Xuemei; Sun, Wenbing; Gao, Jun",Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,https://doi.org/10.1080/00365513.2019.1689428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31710248/,762

Despite tremendous efforts having been made to improve the methodology for constructing flavivirus cDNAs, the cause of toxicity of flavivirus cDNAs in bacteria remains unknown. Here we performed mutational analysis studies to identify Escherichia coli promoter (ECP) sequences within nucleotides (nt) 1 to 3000 of the dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genomes. Eight and four active ECPs were demonstrated within nt 1 to 3000 of the DENV2 and JEV genomes, respectively, using fusion constructs containing DENV2 or JEV segments and empty vector reporter gene Renilla luciferase. Full-length DENV2 and JEV cDNAs were obtained by inserting mutations reducing their ECP activity in bacteria without altering amino acid sequences. A severe cytopathic effect occurred when BHK21 cells were transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNAs from either a DENV2 cDNA clone with multiple silent mutations within the prM-E-NS1 region of dengue genome or a JEV cDNA clone with an A-to-C mutation at nt 90 of the JEV genome. The virions derived from the DENV2 or JEV cDNA clone exhibited infectivities similar to those of their parental viruses in C6/36 and BHK21 cells. A cis-acting element essential for virus replication was revealed by introducing silent mutations into the central portion (nt 160 to 243) of the core gene of DENV2 infectious cDNA or a subgenomic DENV2 replicon clone. This novel strategy of constructing DENV2 and JEV infectious clones could be applied to other flaviviruses or pathogenic RNA viruses to facilitate research in virology, viral pathogenesis, and vaccine development.","Pu, Szu-Yuan; Wu, Ren-Huang; Yang, Chi-Chen; Jao, Tzu-Ming; Tsai, Ming-Han; Wang, Jing-Chyi; Lin, Hui-Mei; Chao, Yu-Sheng; Yueh, Andrew",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01986-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21228244/,762

This study examined a large pool of factors that are potentially associated with suicide risk from the comprehensive electronic medical record (EMR) and to derive a predictive model for 1-6 month risk. METHODS 7,399 patients undergoing suicide risk assessment were followed up for 180 days. The dataset was divided into a derivation and validation cohorts of 4,911 and 2,488 respectively. Clinicians used an 18-point checklist of known risk factors to divide patients into low, medium, or high risk. Their predictive ability was compared with a risk stratification model derived from the EMR data. The model was based on the continuation-ratio ordinal regression method coupled with lasso (which stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). RESULTS In the year prior to suicide assessment, 66.8% of patients attended the emergency department (ED) and 41.8% had at least one hospital admission. Administrative and demographic data, along with information on prior self-harm episodes, as well as mental and physical health diagnoses were predictive of high-risk suicidal behaviour. Clinicians using the 18-point checklist were relatively poor in predicting patients at high-risk in 3 months (AUC 0.58, 95% CIs: 0.50 - 0.66). The model derived EMR was superior (AUC 0.79, 95% CIs: 0.72 - 0.84). At specificity of 0.72 (95% CIs: 0.70-0.73) the EMR model had sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CIs: 0.56-0.83). CONCLUSION Predictive models applied to data from the EMR could improve risk stratification of patients presenting with potential suicidal behaviour. The predictive factors include known risks for suicide, but also other information relating to general health and health service utilisation.","Tran, Truyen; Luo, Wei; Phung, Dinh; Harvey, Richard; Berk, Michael; Kennedy, Richard Lee; Venkatesh, Svetha",BMC psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-244x-14-76; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628849/,762
115860,Adverse effects of polyvinylidene fluoride-coated polypropylene mesh used for laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay repair of incisional hernia.,2010,"Fully integrated uric acid (UA) and glucose biosensors were fabricated on polydimethylsiloxane/polyimide platform by facile one step laser scribed technique. The laser scribed graphene (LSG) on the thin polyimide film was functionalized using pyrenebutanoic acid, succinimide ester (PBSE) to improve the electrochemical activity of the biosensors. The LSG was further decorated with platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) to promote the electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of UA. Glucose oxidase was immobilized on the PtNPs modified surface for selective detection of glucose. The fabricated biosensors were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical methods (cyclic voltammetry and amperometry measurements). Outstanding electrocatalytic activities toward oxidation of UA and glucose were demonstrated. A wide detection range of 5 µM to 480 µM UA with a high sensitivity of 156.56 µA/mMcm2 and a calculated detection limit (LOD) of 0.018 μM (S/N = 3) were achieved for the UA biosensor. The glucose biosensor exhibited a detection range of 5 µM to 3200 µM with a sensitivity of 12.64 µA/mMcm2 and an LOD of 2.57 µM (S/N = 3). These integrated biosensors offer great promise for potential applications in wearable UA and glucose sensing due to their good sensitivity, selectivity, and stability properties.","Faruk Hossain, Md; Slaughter, Gymama",Bioelectrochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioelechem.2021.107870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118555/,762
115861,How reliable is laparoscopic colorectal surgery compared with laparotomy for octogenarians?,2011,"The present study investigated the parameters of nocturnal sleep that mediate the relationship between morningness-eveningness preference and the sleep architecture of naps in university students. This study had a cross-sectional, descriptive correlational design. The sleep architecture of 52 students invited to take an afternoon nap in the laboratory was recorded. The morningness-eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) was used to evaluate morningness-eveningness preference. An actigraph was used to collect students' nighttime sleep data in the week preceding the study. Polysomnography was used to measure the sleep architecture of the participants' naps. After adjustments for potential factors, although the MEQ did not directly correlate with the percentage of sleep stages in naps, the effects of the MEQ on the percentage of Stage 1 sleep, slow-wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep; sleep duration; and sleep efficiency of naps were mediated by the total sleep time in the preceding week. This preliminary study suggests that nap quality was affected by morningness-eveningness preference through the mediation of total nocturnal sleep time. Therefore, future studies should be carefully designed to consider nighttime sleep patterns when analyzing the effects of chronotypes on daytime sleep.","Lee, Tzu-Yin; Chang, Pi-Chen; Tseng, Ing-Jy; Chung, Min-Huey",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29040275/,762

116155,Single-port access in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2009,"BACKGROUND Up to now the totally extraperitoneal (TEP) technique is limited to the treatment of inguinal hernias. Applying this anatomical repair concept to the treatment of other abdominal wall hernias, we developed an endoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach (TEA) to treat primary midline ventral hernias, including umbilical and epigastric hernias, in which for mesh placement, an anatomical space is developed between the peritoneum and the posterior rectus sheath in the ventral part of the abdominal wall (preperitoneal space). METHODS Between September 2017 and December 2019 according to the selection criterions, 28 consecutive primary midline ventral hernias were repaired using TEA. After extensive endoscopic development of the midline extraperitoneal plane, which was started in the suprasymphysic area, and reduction of the hernia sac, the hernia defect was closed and a large mesh was placed in the preperitoneal position to enforce the anterior abdominal wall. RESULTS All operations were successfully performed without conversion to open surgery. The mean operation time was 103.3 min (range 85-145 min). Patient-reported postoperative pain was qualitatively mild with a mean pain visual analogue scale score of 1.9 on postoperative day 1. The average hospital stay was 1.9 days (range 1-3 days). Three patients developed minor complications and were treated with no long-term adverse effects. Readmissions within 30 days or hernia recurrences were not observed with a mean follow-up period of 18 months (range 10-27 months). CONCLUSION In selected cases, TEA is a safe and feasible minimally invasive alternative in treating primary ventral hernias. This technique preserves the anatomical and physiological structure of the abdominal wall and may significantly reduce trauma and postoperative complications. Additionally, anti-adhesion-coated meshes and fixation tackers are not required, thus being cost-effective. Further studies are necessary to proof the true clinical efficacy in comparison to well-known alternative techniques.","Li, Binggen; Qin, Changfu; Bittner, Reinhard",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07575-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342218/,762

METHODS Prevalence rates were calculated using data from six studies providing comparable estimates from 2002, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2016 for children aged 6-10-years living in the Portuguese Midlands (n=7192; 50.2% girls). Height and weight were objectively measured; children and family characteristics were collected by standard questionnaires. A logistic regression was used to test the association between variables. RESULTS Between 2002 and 2016, there was a decrease in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, which reached a statistical significance for girls. The prevalence of overweight, including obesity, was high (low-SEP=30.5%; high-SEP=20.5%) and a widening of socioeconomic inequalities was found. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children had more than 2 times the odds of having obesity than children from higher-SEP, even after adjusting for sex, physical activity and screen-time. CONCLUSION While a decrease in overall rates of overweight and obesity was observed from 2002 to 2016, the social inequalities have been widened which suggest the need for public efforts to promote healthy weight at a population level, especially in lower socioeconomic classes.","Rodrigues, D; Muc, M; Machado-Rodrigues, A M; Padez, C",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33290583/,762

Learning experience design (LED) is the study of how electronic user interfaces impact learner outcomes. We sought to summarize the evidence for LED principles to inform creation of EM educational resources. Methods We performed scripted searches of MeSH terms, PubMed keywords, and hand tracings. Inclusion criteria were controlled studies using light-emitting diode or liquid crystal display monitors with Latin-based languages. Cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors were excluded because of the user experience confounders. Results Thirty-two articles met inclusion criteria. Overall, 14-point size significantly improved legibility compared to smaller font sizes. Similarly, Verdana and Arial typefaces significantly improved legibility compared to Times New Roman typeface. Verdana also significantly decreased subjective mental workload and visibility difficulty ratings and required the least eye movement of any typefaces tested. Positive polarity (dark text on light background) significantly improved reading outcomes across many measurements over negative polarity. There was higher character identification accuracy with higher luminance. Text effects (e.g., italics), interword and interletter spacing, and page presentation are among variables with mixed or minimal evidence. Conclusion Learning experience design principles significantly impacted reading and learning outcomes in laboratory settings. No studies evaluated classroom outcomes. Recommendations for electronic learning environments are 14-point font with Verdana or Arial typeface with positive polarity (dark letters on light background). We recommend increasing screen brightness slightly. EM educators may significantly improve the speed and accuracy of learning written material by espousing evidence-based LED principles.","Pan, Joann; Sheu, Jessica; Massimo, Lauren; Scott, Kevin R; Phillips, Andrew W",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898909/,762

116566,Initial experience with laparoscopic hepatic resection at a comprehensive cancer center.,2012,"BACKGROUND Intrathecal morphine decreases postoperative pain in standard cardiac surgery. Its safety and effectiveness have not been adequately evaluated in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. The authors hypothesized that intrathecal morphine would decrease postoperative morphine consumption after minimally invasive cardiac surgery. METHODS In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial, patients undergoing robotic totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass received either intrathecal morphine (5 mcg/kg) or intrathecal saline before surgery. The primary outcome was postoperative morphine equivalent consumption in the first 24 h after surgery; secondary outcomes included pain scores, side effects, and patient satisfaction. Pain was assessed via visual analog scale at 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after intensive care unit arrival. Opioid-related side effects (nausea/vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, respiratory depression) were assessed daily. Patient satisfaction was evaluated with the Revised American Pain Society Outcome Questionnaire. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients were randomized to receive intrathecal morphine (n = 37) or intrathecal placebo (n = 42), with 70 analyzed (morphine 33, placebo 37). Intrathecal morphine patients required significantly less median (25th to 75th percentile) morphine equivalents compared to placebo during first postoperative 24 h (28 [16 to 46] mg vs. 59 [41 to 79] mg; difference, -28 [95% CI, -40 to -18]; P < 0.001) and second postoperative 24 h (0 [0 to 2] mg vs. 5 [0 to 6] mg; difference, -3.3 [95% CI, -5 to 0]; P < 0.001), exhibited significantly lower visual analog scale pain scores at rest and cough at all postoperative timepoints (overall treatment effect, -4.1 [95% CI, -4.9 to -3.3] and -4.7 [95% CI, -5.5 to -3.9], respectively; P < 0.001), and percent time in severe pain (10 [0 to 40] vs. 40 [20 to 70]; P = 0.003) during the postoperative period. Mild nausea was more common in the intrathecal morphine group (36% vs. 8%; P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS When given before induction of anesthesia for totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass, intrathecal morphine decreases use of postoperative opioids and produces significant postoperative analgesia for 48 h.

While fiction may cultivate our expectations about the probable paths of the pandemic, it also invites us to participate in the creative process of imagining alternative futures. This essay examines how two recent novels, Ling Ma's Severance (2018) and Karen Thomson Walker's The Dreamers (2019), offer feminist refigurations of the genre Priscilla Wald has termed ""the outbreak narrative."" Shifting emphasis from the epidemiological quest plot that has tended to dominate this genre, both novels focus on everyday cultures and ethics of care, illustrating how patriarchal systems produce and perpetuate conditions of vulnerability. In particular, pregnancy plots in both novels work to interrogate cultures of paternalism, raising key ethical questions about limitations and violations of the bodily autonomy. Illuminating, in spectacular and speculative fashion, how conditions of inequality and precarity are radically revealed and intensified by a public health crisis, novels like Severance and The Dreamers are essential tools for teaching about-and living through-the crisis of our pandemic present.","Waples, Emily",Perspectives in biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1353/pbm.2021.0009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746134/,762
117255,A systematic review of performance assessment tools for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2016,"Introduction While there is substantial evidence for the benefits of exercise-based rehabilitation in the prevention and management of non-communicable disease (NCD) in high-resource settings, it is not evident that these programmes can be effectively implemented in a low-resource setting (LRS). Correspondingly, it is unclear if similar benefits can be obtained. The objective of this scoping review was to summarise existing studies evaluating exercise-based rehabilitation, rehabilitation intervention characteristics and outcomes conducted in an LRS for patients with one (or more) of the major NCDs. Methods The following databases were searched from inception until October 2018: PubMed/Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and trial registries. Studies on exercise-based rehabilitation for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer or chronic respiratory disease conducted in an LRS were included. Data were extracted with respect to study design (eg, type, patient sample, context), rehabilitation characteristics (eg, delivery model, programme adaptations) and included outcome measures. Results The search yielded 5930 unique citations of which 60 unique studies were included. Study populations included patients with cardiovascular disease (48.3%), diabetes (28.3%), respiratory disease (21.7%) and cancer (1.7%). Adaptations included transition to predominant patient-driven home-based rehabilitation, training of non-conventional health workers, integration of rehabilitation in community health centres, or triage based on contextual or patient factors. Uptake of adapted rehabilitation models was 54%, retention 78% and adherence 89%. The majority of the outcome measures included were related to body function (65.7%). Conclusions The scope of evidence suggests that adapted exercise-based rehabilitation programmes can be implemented in LRS. However, this scope of evidence originated largely from lower middle-income, urban settings and has mostly been conducted in an academic context which may hamper extrapolation of evidence to other LRS. Cost-benefits, impact on activity limitations and participation restrictions, and subsequent mortality and morbidity are grossly understudied.","Heine, Martin; Lupton-Smith, Alison; Pakosh, Maureen; Grace, Sherry L; Derman, Wayne; Hanekom, Susan D",BMJ global health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798993/,762

117586,Concomitant bariatric and ventral/incisional hernia surgery in morbidly obese patients.,2014,"Radiolabeled peptides targeted against receptors on the cell surface have been shown to be remarkably specific and effective in the diagnosis and therapy of malignant disease. Much of the early work in this field took place outside the United States, but in recent years the research effort within the United States has accelerated. Most of the initial studies in the United States focused on somatostatin receptor ligands. (111)In-pentetreotide was approved in 1994 and has been used extensively in the diagnosis and management of a wide variety of neuroendocrine tumors, particularly carcinoid. This work was extended to (99m)Tc-labeled analogs, and the most successful, (99m)Tc-depreotide, was approved in 1999. This agent was found to be accurate in the diagnosis of lung cancer, but it was not particularly successful because it was supplanted by (18)F-FDG imaging with positron tomography. More recently, studies with (68)Ga-labeled somatostatin analogs were initiated in the United States. This effort was delayed relative to that in other parts of the world because of difficulty in obtaining the necessary generators and regulatory uncertainty, both of which are less of a problem currently. Several ligands are being developed to image melanoma through targeting of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor. Other ligands are being developed to use the arginine-glycine-aspartate oligopeptide to target angiogenesis and to use bombesin analogs to target the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor for the diagnosis and potential therapy of prostate cancer. Peptide dimers that target 2 receptors simultaneously are also being constructed, potentially increasing the selectivity of the approach significantly. Radiopeptide therapy has been explored with these ligands, initially with high-dose (111)In-pentetreotide. This step has been followed by U.S. participation in several trials with (90)Y-, (177)Lu-, and (188)Re-labeled analogs. Some of these agents are now available clinically outside the United States, and it is important to design and conduct the appropriate trials so that this therapy can be offered within the United States.","Graham, Michael M; Menda, Yusuf","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.110.085746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22144556/,762

SARS-CoV-2 is excreted in the oral cavity and can be spread via aerosols. Therefore, there is an increased risk of its spread during aerosol-producing treatments in dental care clinics. Due to the risk of infection of dental care workers and patients, and based on the evidence currently available, additional infection control measures for all patients are strongly recommended when providing emergency dental care in this phase of the pandemic.

Generally, the inner barrel and syringe of PFS are coated with silicone oil (SO) for lubrication. Multiple studies have focused on the fact that the SO adsorbs denatured antibody molecules, and induces antibody aggregation. Aggregated antibodies are recognized as a potential risk for evoking immunogenic responses in patients. The characteristics of the aggregated antibody-SO complexes, including their concentration, population, shape, three-dimensional (3D) image, and Fcγ Receptors (FcγRs) activation have been obscurely acknowledged so far. In the present work, we prepared aggregated antibody-SO complexes by agitation and analyzed using multifaceted techniques such as flow imaging, confocal fluorescence microscopy, and cell-based assays for FcγRs activation. The results emphasized that the SO accelerates the increase in sub-visible particles and antibody aggregation. The confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed the high-resolution 3D images of aggregated antibody-SO complexes. The FcγRs reporter cell assay clarified that the pre-mixed and agitated Ab + SO have higher FcγRs activation capability compared to the agitated Ab. Overall, this study advances the view that SO has an effect to increase the risk of agitation-induced aggregated antibody particles.","Kiyoshi, Masato; Tada, Minoru; Shibata, Hiroko; Aoyama, Michihiko; Ishii-Watabe, Akiko",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2020.10.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069712/,762

Many radiolabeled probes utilize the tight and specific association between the arginine-glycine-aspartatic acid (RGD) peptide and integrin αv β3 , but one main obstacle for any clinical application of these probes is the laborious multistep radiosynthesis of (18)F. In this study, the dimeric RGD peptide, E-[c(RGDfK)]2, was conjugated with NODAGA and radiolabeled with (18)F in a simple one-pot process with a radiolabeling yield of 20%, the whole process lasting only 45 min. NODAGA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 labeled with (18)F at a specific activity of 1.8 MBq nmol(-1) and a radiochemical purity of 100% could be achieved. The logP value of (18)F-labeled NODAGA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 was -4.26 ± 0.02. In biodistribution studies, (18)F-NODAGA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 cleared rapidly from the blood with 0.03 ± 0.01 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID g(-1)) in the blood at 2 h p.i., mainly via the kidneys, and showed good in vivo stability. Tumor uptake of (18)F-NODAGA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 (3.44 ± 0.20 %ID g(-1), 2 h p.i.) was significantly lower than that of reference compounds (68) Ga-labeled NODAGA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 (6.26 ± 0.76 %ID g(-1) ; p <0.001) and (111) In-labeled NODAGA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 (4.99 ± 0.64 %ID g(-1) ; p < 0.01). Co-injection of an excess of unlabeled NODAGA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 along with (18)F-NODAGA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 resulted in significantly reduced radioactivity concentrations in the tumor (0.85 ± 0.13 %ID g(-1)).

118458,A Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate the Impact of Instrument and Laparoscope Length on Performance and Learning Curve in Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery.,2015,"One of the challenges facing by world nowadays is the generation of new pathogens that cause public health issues. Coronavirus (CoV) is one of the severe pathogens that possess the RNA (ribonucleic acid) envelop, and extensively infect humans, birds, and other mammals. The novel strain ""SARS-CoV-2"" (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) causes deadly infection all over the world and presents a pandemic situation nowadays. The SARS-CoV-2 has 40 different strains that create a worrying situation for health authorities. The virus develops serious pneumonia in infected persons and causes severe damage to the lungs. There is no vaccine available for this virus up to present. To cure this type of infections by making vaccines and antiviral drugs is still a major challenge for researchers. Nanotechnology covering a multidisciplinary field may find the solution to this lethal infection. The interaction of nanomaterials and microorganisms is considered as a potential treatment method because the nanomaterials owe unique physicochemical properties. The aim of this review is to present an overview of previous and recent studies of nanomaterials against coronaviruses and to provide possible new strategies for upcoming research using the nanotechnology platform.","Muhammad, Wali; Zhai, Zihe; Gao, Changyou",Macromolecular bioscience,https://doi.org/10.1002/mabi.202000196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32783352/,762

Twenty healthy participants were instrumented with fw and surface (s) EMG electrodes at the biceps brachii bilaterally. Participants held a weight statically with one arm and with the other arm either repeated the same task following a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) or repeated dynamic elbow flexion/extension contractions. Each task was repeated for 30 s every five minutes over two hours. EMG amplitude was smoothed and normalized to time = 0. Stable median power frequency of the s-EMG ruled out the confounding influence of fatigue. Repeated-measures ANCOVAs determined the effect of electrode type and time (covariate) on EMG amplitude and the confounding impact of task type. During the isometric protocol, fw-EMG amplitude reduced over time (p = 0.002), while s-EMG amplitude (p = 0.895) and MPF (p > 0.05) did not change. Fw-EMG amplitude attenuated faster during the dynamic than the isometric protocol (p = 0.008) and there was evidence that the MVC preceding the isometric protocol impacted the rate of decline (p = 0.001). We conclude that systematic signal attenuation of fw-EMG occurs over time and is more pronounced during dynamic tasks.","Reeves, Joanna; McLean, Linda",Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelekin.2021.102566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34139549/,762

ER stress is a common consequence in coronavirus-infected cells. However, how the virus-induced ER stress influences coronavirus replication and pathogenesis remains controversial. Here, we demonstrated that infection with the alphacoronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) induced ER stress and triggered the unfolded protein response (UPR) in vitro and in vivo, and ER stress negatively regulated TGEV replication in vitro Although TGEV infection activated all three UPR pathways (activating transcription factor 6 [ATF6], inositol-requiring enzyme 1 [IRE1], and protein kinase R-like ER kinase [PERK]), the virus-triggered UPR suppressed TGEV replication in both swine testicular (ST) and IPEC-J2 cells primarily through activation of the PERK-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) axis, as shown by functional studies with overexpression, small interfering RNA (siRNA), or specific chemical inhibitors. Moreover, we demonstrated that PERK-eIF2α axis-mediated inhibition of TGEV replication occurs through phosphorylated eIF2α-induced overall attenuation of protein translation. In addition to direct inhibition of viral production, the PERK-eIF2α pathway activated NF-κB and then facilitated type I IFN production, resulting in TGEV suppression. Taken together, our results suggest that the TGEV-triggered PERK-eIF2α pathway negatively regulates TGEV replication and represents a vital aspect of host innate responses to invading pathogens.IMPORTANCE The induction of ER stress is a common outcome in cells infected with coronaviruses. The UPR initiated by ER stress is actively involved in viral replication and modulates the host innate responses to the invading viruses, but these underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We show here that infection with the alphacoronavirus TGEV elicited ER stress in vitro and in vivo, and the UPR PERK-eIF2α branch was predominantly responsible for the suppression of TGEV replication by ER stress. Furthermore, the PERK-eIF2α axis inhibited TGEV replication through direct inhibition of viral proteins due to global translation inhibition and type I IFN induction. These findings highlight a critical role of the UPR PERK-eIF2α pathway in modulating host innate immunity and coronavirus replication.","Xue, Mei; Fu, Fang; Ma, Yanlong; Zhang, Xin; Li, Liang; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00431-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29769338/,762

Can stenosis of the hilar hepatic duct affect postoperative outcome?,2017,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has widely spread worldwide and caused a pandemic. Chest CT has been found to play an important role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. However, quantitatively assessing temporal changes of COVID-19 pneumonia over time using CT has still not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to perform a longitudinal study to quantitatively assess temporal changes of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods This retrospective and multi-center study included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection from 16 hospitals between January 19 and March 27, 2020. Mass was used as an approach to quantitatively measure dynamic changes of pulmonary involvement in patients with COVID-19. Artificial intelligence (AI) was employed as image segmentation and analysis tool for calculating the mass of pulmonary involvement. Results A total of 581 confirmed patients with 1,309 chest CT examinations were included in this study. The median age was 46 years (IQR, 35-55; range, 4-87 years), and 311 (53.5%) patients were male. The mass of pulmonary involvement peaked on day 10 after the onset of initial symptoms. Furthermore, the mass of pulmonary involvement of older patients (>45 years) was significantly severer (P<0.001) and peaked later (day 11 vs. day 8) than that of younger patients (≤45 years). In addition, there were no significant differences in the peak time (day 10 vs. day 10) and median mass (P=0.679) of pulmonary involvement between male and female. Conclusions Pulmonary involvement peaked on day 10 after the onset of initial symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Further, pulmonary involvement of older patients was severer and peaked later than that of younger patients. These findings suggest that AI-based quantitative mass evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia hold great potential for monitoring the disease progression.","Wang, Chao; Huang, Peiyu; Wang, Lihua; Shen, Zhujing; Lin, Bin; Wang, Qiyuan; Zhao, Tongtong; Zheng, Hanpeng; Ji, Wenbin; Gao, Yuantong; Xia, Junli; Cheng, Jianmin; Ma, Jianbing; Liu, Jun; Liu, Yongqiang; Su, Miaoguang; Ruan, Guixiang; Shu, Jiner; Ren, Dawei; Zhao, Zhenhua; Yao, Weigen; Yang, Yunjun; Liu, Bo; Zhang, Minming",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-4004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953735/,762

Given the importance of communication to the public in public health emergency preparedness, it is critical to examine the extent to which this field of study has received attention from the scientific community. We conducted a systematic literature review to describe current research in the area of communication to the public in public health emergency preparedness, focusing on the association between sociodemographic and behavioral factors and communication as well as preparedness outcomes. Articles were searched in PubMed and Embase and reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. A total of 131 articles were included for final review. Fifty-three percent of the articles were empirical, of which 74% were population-based studies, and 26% used information environment analysis techniques. None had an experimental study design. Population-based studies were rarely supported by theoretical models and mostly relied on a cross-sectional study design. Consistent results were reported on the association between population socioeconomic factors and public health emergency preparedness communication and preparedness outcomes. Our findings show the need for empirical research to determine what type of communication messages can be effective in achieving preparedness outcomes across various population groups. They suggest that a real-time analysis of the information environment is valuable in knowing what is being communicated to the public and could be used for course correction of public health messages during a crisis.","Savoia, Elena; Lin, Leesa; Viswanath, Kasisomayajula","Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",https://doi.org/10.1089/bsp.2013.0038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24041193/,762

In the Philippines, microfinance's widespread presence is seen as instrumental in achieving the objectives of Healthy Philippines 2022, particularly in reducing poverty-driven healthcare costs. However, little is known on how microfinance can reduce the cost of healthcare services and treatment. Also, few studies that consider the practice of integrated microfinance and health programs in the Philippines have been seen. Secondary data was used to explore the structure and function of microfinance and health initiatives and their influence in mitigating healthcare costs. A review criterion was developed to examine the data using the three key elements identified in Ruducha and Jadhav's framework: organisational arrangement, health products and health outcomes. Findings revealed that most health initiatives are delivered through partnerships and collaboration, could favour a reduction in healthcare costs and protection from out-of-pocket health expenditure. They are designed to operate in three structures-subsidised or outreach, microinsurance and health loans, and patronage refunds.

This non-invasive device analyses ECG signals and determines the analgesia nociception index (ANI), allowing for quantitative assessment of the analgesia/nociception balance in anesthetized patients. Ketamine, an analgesic adjuvant with sympathomimetic properties, has been shown to improve perioperative pain management. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether low-dose ketamine, due to its intrinsic effect on the sino-atrial node, affects HRV and, therefore, interferes with ANI measurements. This pilot study included 20 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomies. Anesthesia and analgesia were maintained with sevoflurane and fentanyl respectively, in a standardized manner. Five minutes after intubation, 0.5 μg kg(-1) of intravenous (i.v.) ketamine was administered. ANI, bispectral index (BIS), heart rate and blood pressure were recorded from the induction of anesthesia until 5 min after skin incision. There was not any significant decrease in mean (±SD) ANI values after intubation (2.11±20.11, p=0.35) or i.v. ketamine administration (1.31±15.26, p=0.28). The mean (±SD) reduction in ANI values after skin incision was statistically significant (13.65±15.44, p=0.01), which is consistent with increased nociception. A single i.v. bolus of 0.5 μg kg(-1) ketamine did not influence the ANI values of 20 women under standardized general anesthesia conditions and absent noxious stimulation.

Because of its economic value, the biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin has received considerable attention. Glycyrrhizin is most likely derived from the triterpene beta-amyrin, an initial product of the cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene. The subsequent steps in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis are believed to involve a series of oxidative reactions at the C-11 and C-30 positions, followed by glycosyl transfers to the C-3 hydroxyl group; however, no genes encoding relevant oxidases or glycosyltransferases have been identified. Here we report the successful identification of CYP88D6, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) gene, as a glycyrrhizin-biosynthetic gene, by transcript profiling-based selection from a collection of licorice expressed sequence tags (ESTs). CYP88D6 was characterized by in vitro enzymatic activity assays and shown to catalyze the sequential two-step oxidation of beta-amyrin at C-11 to produce 11-oxo-beta-amyrin, a possible biosynthetic intermediate between beta-amyrin and glycyrrhizin. CYP88D6 coexpressed with beta-amyrin synthase in yeast also catalyzed in vivo oxidation of beta-amyrin to 11-oxo-beta-amyrin. CYP88D6 expression was detected in the roots and stolons by RT-PCR; however, no amplification was observed in the leaves or stems, which is consistent with the accumulation pattern of glycyrrhizin in planta. These results suggest a role for CYP88D6 as a beta-amyrin 11-oxidase in the glycyrrhizin pathway.","Seki, Hikaru; Ohyama, Kiyoshi; Sawai, Satoru; Mizutani, Masaharu; Ohnishi, Toshiyuki; Sudo, Hiroshi; Akashi, Tomoyoshi; Aoki, Toshio; Saito, Kazuki; Muranaka, Toshiya",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0803876105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18779566/,762
121665,Single-incision laparoscopic surgery used to perform transanal endoscopic microsurgery (SILSTEM) for T1 rectal cancer under spinal anesthesia: report of a case.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Incisional and ventral hernias are common surgical indications. Their management is associated with significant complications and recurrences in open surgery (15-25%). Since laparoscopy has become a standard in bariatric surgery, there has been a natural trend to treat obese patients with parietal wall defects laparoscopically. The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and the results of the laparoscopic management of parietal wall defects in patients with a BMI >35. MATERIALS AND METHODS A series of 79 patients were included. Data were acquired prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. The surgical procedure was standardized: 3 ports, mesh type (Parietex™ Composite mesh, Covidien, France), fixation with non-absorbable transfascial sutures, and tackers. Complications were evaluated. RESULTS Out of 79 patients (29 men, 50 women), 43 had umbilical and 36 had ventral hernias. Mean age was 52.4 years, and mean BMI was 40.83 kg/m(2). Mean postoperative hospital stay was 2 days. Postoperative pain evaluated by visual analog scale was 2.86. No intraoperative complications or deaths occurred. Seven postoperative complications occurred (8.86%): two parietal wall hematomas treated by radiological embolization, two significant cases of postoperative pain, one postoperative obstruction, one spontaneously resolved respiratory failure, and one early (day 1) parietal wall defect with immediate reoperation. Postoperative seroma rate was 26.58% (21 patients, all of whom were treated conservatively). Postoperative follow-up was 18.10 months (1-84 months), and recurrence rate was 3.8% (3 patients). DISCUSSION This study confirms the feasibility and safety of the laparoscopic approach for ventral hernias in morbidly obese patients. Recurrence rates (3.8%) appeared lower than the ones observed in the literature (15-25%). Postoperative hemorrhage and port-site hernia are specific complications of this approach. Postoperative hospital stay is low (2 days) as compared to open surgery. Laparoscopic management of parietal wall defects should be considered a standard option in morbidly obese patients.","Marx, L; Raharimanantsoa, M; Mandala, S; D'Urso, A; Vix, M; Mutter, D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3607-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007972/,762

In this study, we investigated fecal viral shedding of FeLV and its role in viral pathogenesis with the goal to improve infection control. FeLV RNA and DNA levels were determined in rectal swabs of experimentally infected cats by real-time PCR, and the results were correlated with proviral and viral loads in whole blood and plasma, respectively, and plasma p27 levels. All antigenemic cats shed FeLV RNA and DNA in feces. To determine whether the viral RNA detected was infectious, virus isolation from feces was also performed. Infectious virus was isolated from feces of antigenemic cats, and these results perfectly correlated with the isolation of virus from plasma. Naïve cats exposed to these feces seroconverted, showing that infection through feces took place, but remained negative for the presence of FeLV provirus and p27 in blood, an outcome so far not described. Some of the organs collected after euthanasia were provirus positive at low copy numbers. From these results it is concluded that fecal shedding of FeLV plays a role in transmission, but it is probably of secondary importance in viral pathogenesis. Nevertheless, sharing of litter pans by susceptible and viremic cats could increase the environmental infectious pressure and appropriate measures should be taken to avoid unnecessary viral exposure.","Gomes-Keller, M A; Gönczi, E; Grenacher, B; Tandon, R; Hofman-Lehmann, R; Lutz, H",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.08.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18842363/,762

Due to the limited detection facilities and medical resources, especially in developing countries, a large number of suspected cases can only receive common clinical diagnosis rather than more effective detections like Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests or CT scans. This motivates us to develop a quick screening method on suspected patients via common clinical diagnosis results. However, the diagnostic items of different patients may vary greatly and there is a huge variation in the dimension of the diagnosis data among different suspected patients, which makes it hard to process these indefinite dimension data via classical classification algorithms. To resolve this problem, we propose an Indefiniteness Elimination Network (IE-Net) to eliminate the influence of the varied dimensions and make predictions about the COVID-19 cases. The IENet is in an encoder-decoder framework fashion and an indefiniteness elimination operation is proposed to transfer the indefinite dimension feature into a fixed dimension feature. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on the public available COVID-19 Clinical Spectrum dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed indefiniteness elimination operation greatly improves the classification performance and the IE-Net achieves 94.80% accuracy and 92.79% recall for distinguishing COVID-19 cases from nonCOVID-19 cases with only common clinical diagnose data. We further compared our methods with 3 classical classification algorithms: random forest, gradient boosting and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Compared with traditional classification methods, the proposed IE-Net can bring at least 9.40% accuracy gains and 12.17% recall gains. To explore the specificity of each clinical test item, we further analyzed the possible relationship between each clinical test item and COVID-19. In general, we proposed a novel image complementary method for COVID-19 screening and will be of great help for areas where effective detections are not available.","Guo, Guangyu; Liu, Zhuoyan; Zhao, Shijie; Guo, Lei; Liu, Tianming",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2021.3060035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600327/,762
122065,A cost comparison of laparoscopic and open colon surgery in a publicly funded academic institution.,2014,"The convergence of humans, animals and our shared environment results in a dynamic in which the health of each group is inextricably linked. Taking into account the fact that the majority of emerging pathogens (e.g. highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) are zoonotic diseases, Egypt has established a national One Health coordination mechanism. The primary purpose of this mechanism is to provide a comprehensive, strategic approach to concurrent and future health challenges that are facing public and animal heath, including environmental impacts. In this way, the public health, animal health and environment sectors can improve disease mitigation measures, develop stronger and more stable public and animal health services, promote effective national communication strategies and improve One Health collaboration among all relevant sectors. In Egypt, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) currently assist in hosting the country's Four-Way Linking Task Force with the participation of the convening Ministries (Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Environment, and Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation [MOALR] - through the General Organisation for Veterinary Services and the MOALR's laboratories). In the context of the Emerging Pandemic Threats 2 Program, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), FAO plans to assist Egypt in establishing a robust, multidisciplinary and multisectoral One Health system. This system is based on the solid foundation of the Four-Way Linking Platform, which combines information from four functional streams - epidemiology, laboratories, and animal and human health. Egypt's platform will involve all sectors concerned with HPAI control and combine all stakeholders in an integrated, holistic approach to improve the detection of, response to and control of any threats at the human- animal-environment interface in Egypt.","Allal, L; Mahrous, H; Saad, A; Refaei, S; Attia, M; Mahrous, I; Fahim, M; Elfadaly, S; Abdelnabi, A",Revue scientifique et technique,https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.38.1.2958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564724/,762

122285,"Laparoscopic versus hybrid approach for treatment of incisional ventral hernia: a prospective randomised multicentre study, 1-year results.",2019,"BACKGROUND AIMS Successful hepatocyte isolation is critical for continued development of cellular transplantation. However, most tissue available for research is from diseased liver, and the results of hepatocyte isolation from such tissue are inferior compared with normal tissue. Liberase and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have been shown separately to improve viability of isolated hepatocytes. This study aims to determine the effect of Liberase and NAC in combination on human hepatocyte isolation from normal and diseased liver tissues. METHODS Hepatocytes were isolated from 30 liver specimens through the use of a standard collagenase digestion technique (original protocol) and another 30 with the addition of NAC and standard collagenase substituted by Liberase (new protocol). Viability and success, defined as maintenance of cell adhesion and morphology for 48 hours, were assessed. Metabolic function was assessed by means of albumin and urea synthesis. RESULTS Baseline factors were similar for both groups. The delay to tissue processing was slightly shorter in the new protocol group (median, 2 versus 4 hours; P = 0.007). The success rate improved from 12 of 30 (40.0%) to 21 of 30 (70.0%) with the use of the new protocol (P = 0.037), and median viable cell yield increased from 7.3 × 10(4) to 28.3 × 10(4) cells/g tissue (P = 0.003). After adjusting for delay, success rate (P = 0.014) and viable cell yield/g tissue (P = 0.001) remained significantly improved. Albumin and urea synthesis were similar or superior in the new protocol group. CONCLUSIONS NAC and Liberase improve the success of hepatocyte isolation, with a significantly higher yield of viable cells. The use of these agents may improve the availability of hepatocytes for transplantation and laboratory research.","Bartlett, David C; Hodson, James; Bhogal, Ricky H; Youster, Janine; Newsome, Phil N",Cytotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2014.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642019/,762

METHODS Files of 155 patients visiting the fever clinics at our hospital and affiliated hospitals from January 20th to February 9th, 2020 were searched. Among them, 140 cases (including 82 males and 58 females) were included as suspected COVID-19 cases based on clinical and epidemiological history; the CT image features of 70 cases with suggestive findings on CT, confirmed by positive nucleic acid test were analyzed and evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of CT in diagnosing COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with epidemiological history. RESULTS Of the 70 patients, 84.3% showed bilateral lung involvement on CT; 27 cases (38.6%) showed ground-glass opacity (GGO), which was mostly distributed in the subpleural area (55.7%), and this sign was mainly observed in early COVID-19 patients. In addition, 41 cases (58.6%) manifested GGO combined with focal consolidation opacity, 2 (2.8%) had flake-like consolidation opacity, with involvements of the periphery of lung field and the central zone (44.3%), and this sign was mostly observed in severe or critical patients. Concomitant signs such as pleural effusion and mediastinal lymph node enlargement were rare. Among patients with epidemiological history, the sensitivity of CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was 89.7% (70/78), and the specificity was 88.7% (55/62). CONCLUSION CT shows high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing COVID-19. CT is an important examination method in evaluation of suspected cases and assessment of disease severity.","Luo, Ning; Zhang, Han; Zhou, Yang; Kong, ZiXuan; Sun, WeiHang; Huang, Nan; Zhang, AoDan",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.5152/dir.2020.20144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32490829/,762

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Comprehensive literature searches in Medline-PubMed, Embase and SCOPUS databases. Original studies published between 2009 and 2019 with a cross-sectional design were included. The quality of the studies was assessed with Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Protocol registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews with reference number: CRD42019137990. Results: Out of the 1,310 potential studies found, 25 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were of high quality. High levels of heterogeneity were found in the studies included. In the general population, the prevalence of long-term opioid use was 2.3% (95% CI: 1.5-3.6%), the prevalence of short-term opioid use was 8.1% (95% CI: 5.6-11.6%), and among people with chronic low back pain it was 5.8% (95% CI: 0.5-45.5%). The prevalence of opioid use among patients from the health records or medical surveys was 41% (95% CI: 23.3-61.3%). Finally, in patients with musculoskeletal pain, the prevalence was 20.5% (95% CI: 12.9-30.9%) and in patients with fibromyalgia, 24.5% (95% CI: 22.9-26.2%). A higher prevalence of opioid use was observed among men, younger people, patients receiving prescriptions of different types of drugs, smokers and patients without insurance or with noncommercial insurance. In addition, non-white and Asian patients were less likely to receive opioids than non-Hispanic white patients. Conclusions: The prevalence of opioid use among patients with CNCP was higher in subjects with short or occasional use compared to those with long-term use. Men, younger people, more chronic pain conditions, and patients without insurance or with noncommercial insurance were most related to opioid use. However, non-white and Asian patients, and those treated by a physician trained in complementary medicine were less likely to use opioids.","De Sola, Helena; Dueñas, María; Salazar, Alejandro; Ortega-Jiménez, Patricia; Failde, Inmaculada",Frontiers in pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.564412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33364942/,762

MetS is a complex disease that includes endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, ectopic obesity, and dyslipidaemia, and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, there are no systematic analyses, or well-conducted meta-analyses to evaluate the relationship between epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and (MetS). The aim of this study is to examine this association of EAT with MetS in different ages and sex. METHODS The update systematic review, and meta-analysis will be conducted using published studies that will be identified from electronic databases (ie, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Studies that firstly, examined the association between EAT and MetS, secondly, focus on cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies, thirdly, were conducted among in adults aged between 40 and 70 years, fourth, provided sufficient data for calculating ORs or relative risk with a 95% CI, fifth, were published as original articles written in English or other languages, and sixth, have been published until January year 2018 will be included. Study selection, data collection, quality assessment, and statistical syntheses will be conducted based on discussions among investigators. RESULTS Ethics approval was not required for this study because it was based on published studies. The results and findings of this study will be submitted and published in a scientific peer-reviewed journal. This study will provide a high quality synthesis on the association of EAT and MetS.

However, no mixed methods systematic review was conducted on bereavement interventions following the loss of a parent focusing on the time since death in regard to the prevention of grief complications. OBJECTIVE The overall purpose of the review is to provide a rigorous synthesis of early intervention after parental death in childhood. Specifically, the aims are twofold: (1) to determine the rationales, contents, timeframes, and outcomes of early bereavement care interventions for children and/or their parents and (2) to assess the quality of current early intervention studies. METHODS Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods intervention studies that start intervention with parentally bereaved children (and/or their parents) up to 6 months postloss will be included in the review. The search strategy was based on the Population, Interventions, Comparator, Outcomes, and Study Designs (PICOS) approach, and it was devised together with a university librarian. The literature searches will be carried out in the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), PsycINFO, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool will be used to appraise the quality of eligible studies. All data will be narratively synthetized following the Guidance on the Conduct of Narrative Synthesis in Systematic Reviews. RESULTS The systematic review is ongoing and the data search has started. The review is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. Findings will be submitted to leading journals for publication. CONCLUSIONS In accordance with the current diagnostic criteria for prolonged grief as well as the users' perspectives literature, this systematic review outlines a possible sensitive period for early intervention following the death of a parent.

123349,A case of simultaneous transvaginal NOTES gastrectomy and vaginal hysterectomy in a patient with gastric submucosal tumor and uterine prolapse.,2012,"BACKGROUND Hepatitis E virus, typically genotypes 1 and 2, is a major cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality in South Asia. Although case fatality risk among pregnant women can reach as high as 25%, a lack of population-level disease burden data has been cited as a primary factor in key global policy recommendations against the routine use of licensed hepatitis E vaccines, one of the only effective tools available for preventing disease and death. METHODS We tested serum from a nationally-representative serosurvey in Bangladesh for anti-HEV IgG. We estimated the proportion of the population with evidence of historical HEV infection and used Bayesian geostatistical models to generate high-resolution national maps of seropositivity. We examined variability in seropositivity by individual-level, household-level, and community-level risk factors using spatial logistic regression. RESULTS We tested serum samples from 2924 individuals from 70 communities representing all divisions of Bangladesh and estimated a national seroprevalence of hepatitis E of 20% (95% CI 17-24%). Seropositivity increased with age and male sex (Odds Ratio: 2.2 male vs. female, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.8-2.8). Community-level seroprevalence ranged from 0-78% with the seroprevalence in urban areas being higher, including Dhaka, the capital, with 3.0-fold (95% Credible Interval 2.3-3.7) higher seroprevalence than the rest of the country. CONCLUSION Hepatitis E infections are common throughout Bangladesh. Strengthening clinical surveillance for hepatitis E, especially in urban areas may help generate additional evidence needed to appropriately target interventions like vaccines to the populations most likely to benefit.","Azman, Andrew S; Paul, Kishor Kumar; Bhuiyan, Taufiqur Rahman; Koyuncu, Aybüke; Salje, Henrik; Qadri, Firdausi; Gurley, Emily S",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34549775/,762

However, patients with other diseases, also requiring rehabilitation evaluations and treatments, continued to need care. Our Rehabilitation Unit managed to maintain contact with patients through alternative communication methods even during the lockdown period and in a situation of staff shortage. If face-to-face evaluations and treatments were necessary, preventive measures were followed to avoid hospital-associated contagion. Rehabilitation beds were cleared in order to leave them to the acute wards and consultations for the acute care patients were carried out using personal protective equipment. In the future, the lessons from our experience could contribute towards drawing a plan of measures applicable in similar situations and some of these actions could become part of the rehabilitative practice.","Maccarone, Maria Chiara; Masiero, Stefano",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1097/phm.0000000000001707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33496441/,762

It is crucial to detect the progression of Covid-19 in patients as early as possible. Fibrinogen to albumin ratio (FAR) has been used as a new inflammatory marker. We aimed to find out whether the use of the FAR as a predictor of mortality in Covid-19 patients provides clinical benefit. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from 590 patients with Covid-19 from 15/03/2020 to 15/01/2021 in medicine wards and intensive care units (ICU) were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data and other laboratory markers were collected from the electronic medical records. Relationship between FAR was investigated between patients in the survivor/non-survivor patients. FINDINGS The mean FAR levels in patients who were non survivor was 24.44±30.3 (n:272 and 11.29±6.29 (n:275) (p:0.000) in patients survivor COVID-19 infection. In ROC curve for FAR, the threshold FAR that may pose a risk for mortality was determined as 13.84 ((AUC: 0.808(0.771-0.844)); 74.9% Sensitivity, 74.6% Specificity; p:0.000 )).

We aimed to 1) differentiate the burden caused by the pandemic vs. the tumor and 2) establish topics items relevant for brain tumor patients (BTPs) and caregivers. METHODS Patients and caregivers were prospectively assessed from April 2020 - July 2020 by a 10-item comprising interview over the phone, including qualitative and quantitative questions. They were quantitatively evaluated i.a. by the Distress Thermometer (DT, score 1-10). The qualitative questions were analyzed using structured content analysis: The interview questions defined the main categories. Subcategories were derived by an inductive approach assessing the frequency of patients' and caregivers' answers. RESULTS A total of 69 patients and 20 caregivers were interviewed; n= 36 were female (49%), mean age was 53 years (range 32-81). Patients' disease-related DT scores were higher than the COVID-19-related DT scores: the median of the disease-related DT score was 7 (range 2-10) vs. median of COVID-19-related distress: 5.0 (range 2-7). Caregivers perceived a higher burden due to the disease (DT median disease: 8; range 2-10 vs. DT pandemic: 3, range 0-10). A total of 5 main and 21 subcategories were elaborated, most frequently mentioned were ""restrictions in public and private affairs"" (28%), ""changes in the psychological well-being"" (23%), ""limited social interaction by contact restriction"" (25%). Subcategories relevant for caregivers were similar to those of BTPs. CONCLUSION A considerable proportion of patients and caregivers still perceived the brain tumor disease as more burdensome than the pandemic. We established main and subcategories of interview items possibly of great relevance to patients during these difficult times, which could be implemented in the content-related adaption of the psychosocial assessment.

123920,Single-site versus conventional laparoscopic appendectomy: comparison of short-term operative outcomes.,2011,"Lipid mediators play active roles in each stage of inflammation under physiological and pathologic conditions. We have investigated the cellular source and functions of several prostanoids in the immune inflammatory responses using follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-like cells. In this study, we report a novel finding on the role of 15(S)- hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE). Our observation of 15(S)-HETE uptake by FDC-like cells prompted to hypothesize that 15(S)-HETE might have a regulatory role in the other branch of eicosanoid production. The effects of 15(S)-HETE on COX-2 expression and prostaglandin (PG) production were analyzed by immunoblotting and specific enzyme immunoassays. The addition of 15(S)-HETE resulted in elevated levels of COX-2 expression and PG production. The enhanced PG production was not due to growth stimulation of FDC-like cells since 15(S)-HETE did not modulate FDC-like cell proliferation by the culture period of PG measurement. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) seems to mediate the augmenting activity as the antagonist GW9662 dose-dependently prevented 15(S)-HETE from increasing PG production. In addition, PPARγ protein expression was readily detected in FDC-like cells. These effects of 15(S)-HETE were displayed in the combined addition with IL-1β. Based on these results, we suggest that 15(S)-HETE is an inflammatory costimulator of FDC acting in a paracrine fashion.","Kim, Jini; Choe, Jongseon",Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2020.106487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007445/,762

Some literatures reported same or better peri-operative outcomes with the robotic procedure. The aim of this study is to compare our experience in robot-assisted LRYGB (RA-LRYGB) with LRYGB in terms of peri-operative outcomes. METHODS From January 1, 2012 to April 30, 2014, a total of 270 patients underwent LRYGB by one surgeon at a single institution. Of these, 64 cases were done robotically. A retrospective review was performed for these patients, noting the outcomes and complications of the procedure. RESULTS The 64 RA-LRYGB patients had a mean age of 45.9 ± 10.0 years (range, 23-67) and a mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) of 48.4 ± 7.9 kg/m(2) (range, 33.8-76.4). The 207 LRYGB patients had a mean age of 45.0 ± 10.7 years (range, 21-67) and a mean preoperative BMI of 48.4 ± 8.1 kg/m(2) (range, 34.0-80.4). These two groups were clinically comparable. Mean length of hospital stay was 3.0 ± 4.1 days (range, 1-19) in RA-LRYGB patients, significantly longer than 1.6 ± 1.7 days (range, 1-17) in LRYGB patients (p < 0.01). Thirty-day readmission rate was 9.3% (n = 6) in the RA-LRYGB group and 6.8% (n = 14) in the LRYGB group. Higher leak rate was noticed in RA-LRYGB patients at 7.8% (n = 5), compared to 0.5% (n = 1) in LRYGB patients (p < 0.01).

METHOD this was a qualitative study based on Alfred Schütz' social phenomenology, with 15 older adults with physical disability from Cuiabá, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Open-ended questionnaires were administered to the participants in 2017. The units of meaning that emerged were organized into thematic categories. RESULTS physical decline, associated with the permanence of environmental and social barriers intensified the vulnerabilities of older adults. Gaps in health services are mitigated by informal social support networks and access to work was a form of social inclusion. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS vulnerabilities in the old age of persons with physical disabilities did not reside only in the body dimension, but also the physical and social environment, countering healthcare models based on the logic of reverting their dysfunctional body.","Martins, José Alves; Watanabe, Helena Akemi Wada; Braga, Vanessa Augusta Souza; Jesus, Maria Cristina Pinto de; Merighi, Miriam Aparecida Barbosa",Revista brasileira de enfermagem,https://doi.org/10.1590/0034-7167-2019-0175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667414/,762

In April 2013, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution in acetate (0.2% CHG-acetate) was introduced as skin disinfectant for extremely preterm infants in our neonatal intensive care units. We aimed to compare the incidence of skin lesions and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) among extremely preterm infants when using 0.5% CHG-70% alc and 0.2% CHG-acetate. DESIGN Retrospective pre-post comparison cohort study. PATIENTS All electronic patient records of extremely preterm infants born between January 2011-March 2013 ('0.5% CHG-70% alc' cohort) and April 2013-October 2015 ('0.2% CHG-acetate' cohort) were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The incidence of skin lesions and CLABSI. Skin lesions were defined as the presence of erythema, blisters, excoriation, oedema or induration. CLABSI was defined according to the definition of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS The incidence of skin lesions was 22% (95% CI 11% to 37%) in the '0.5% CHG-70% alc' cohort (n=41) and 5% (95% CI 1% to 15%; p=0.02) in the '0.2% CHG-acetate' cohort (n=41). The incidence of CLABSI was the same in both groups (28%; 95% CI 14% to 46% in '0.5% CHG-70% alc' vs 27%; 95% CI 14% to 44% in '0.2% CHG-acetate'; p=0.98). CONCLUSIONS Using 0.2% CHG-acetate as skin disinfectant in extremely preterm infants resulted in statistically significant reduction of skin lesions, without increasing the risk of CLABSI as compared with 0.5% CHG-70% alc.","Janssen, Lisanne M A; Tostmann, Alma; Hopman, Joost; Liem, Kian D",Archives of disease in childhood.

An alternative to microbes and plants is to remove the complexity of cellular systems by employing enzymatic biosynthesis. Here we design and implement a new cell-free system for cannabinoid production with the following features: (1) only low-cost inputs are needed; (2) only 12 enzymes are employed; (3) the system does not require oxygen and (4) we use a nonnatural enzyme system to reduce ATP requirements that is generally applicable to malonyl-CoA-dependent pathways such as polyketide biosynthesis. The system produces ~0.5 g l-1 cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) or cannabigerovarinic acid (CBGVA) from low-cost inputs, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than yeast-based production. Cell-free systems such as this may provide a new route to reliable cannabinoid production.","Valliere, Meaghan A; Korman, Tyler P; Arbing, Mark A; Bowie, James U",Nature chemical biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-020-0631-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839605/,762

MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2009 to 2016, data were prospectively collected for patients who underwent ch-EVAR using long PGs. Data included patient demographics and aortic anatomy, technical success, patency and reintervention rate. RESULTS A total of 29 long PGs were placed in 18 patients (males 16, average age 71 years). Nine (50%) suffered from thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 4 (22%) from juxtarenal aortic aneurysms and 3 (17%) from suprarenal aortic aneurysms and 2 (11%) were treated for abdominal aortic aneurysms that required revascularization of a pelvic kidney. Twenty (70%) of the PGs were 100 mm in length, and 9 (30%) were 150 mm. Long PGs were successfully placed in 16 (89%) patients. Two patients (11%) expired in the perioperative period. Mean period of follow-up was 12 months (range 1-43 months). Sac size decreased in size or remained unchanged in 13 patients (72%). Three patients with sac enlargement underwent successful endovascular treatment the type 1A gutter endoleaks. None required reintervention of the PGs. Three patients expired, none from aneurysm-related deaths. CONCLUSION The use of long PGs is a feasible technique and provides a durable repair of complex aortic aneurysms in midterm follow-up. Despite the length of the PGs, gutter endoleaks are encountered only in a minority of the cases and can be treated minimally invasive techniques.","Silverberg, Daniel; Rimon, Uri; Raskin, Daniel; Halak, Moshe",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-017-1851-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29181602/,762

This systematic review assesses the current evidence of primary prophylactic treatment of depression in patients after acute coronary syndrome. The study protocol was prospectively registered at PROSPERO (registration number CRD42015025587). A systematic review were conducted and reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and Cochran Library was searched. Two independent reviewers screened the records. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials on adult patients with acute coronary syndrome treated prophylactically with an antidepressant intervention of any kind. A validated assessment tool should measure depression and depressive symptoms. Languages were limited to articles written in English. Six articles were included. Four studies utilized different components of case and disease management, health coaching, or relaxational audiotapes as intervention compared with usual care or with no formal program of rehabilitation. None of the studies showed any significant prophylactic effect against depression. One study with a program of health education and counselling and another study with a pharmacological antidepressant showed significant prophylactic effect on depression and depressive symptoms. All six included studies were associated with high risk of bias. There is not strong evidence of the effects of any type of routine antidepressant prophylaxis in patients following acute coronary syndrome.

In this study, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) were compared as alternatives to follow in vivo bone healing in a rat calvarial defect model. SPECT/computed tomography (CT) following administration of 99m technetium-labelled hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (99m Tc-HDP) and PET/CT data with 18 F-fluoride were acquired up to 10 weeks after surgery. New bone formation was then confirmed by histology. Computed tomography scans allowed visualization of untreated bone defect healing; however, no information was gathered in presence of the ceramic. Positron emission tomography provided superior data compared with SPECT. The 18 F-fluoride uptake increased significantly up to 4 weeks after surgery, declining thereafter until the last time-point. In vivo performances of porous versus dense ceramic scaffolds were also evaluated by PET, with a significantly higher uptake registered within the porous scaffolds. In conclusion, PET is a valuable tool for qualitative/quantitative follow-up of bone healing around radiopaque bone substitutes in vivo.

DESIGN Cross-sectional, observational study. SETTING Two long-term care facilities: a 140-bed veterans' home and a 44-bed state home for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. SUBJECTS Sixty-one adult residents of two long-term care facilities (aged 70.1 ± 16.2 years) were included in this analysis. Spasticity was identified in 43% of subjects (Modified Ashworth Scale rating mode = 2). Contributing diagnoses included traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, birth trauma, stroke, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. MAIN MEASURES Movement disorders neurologists conducted in-person examinations to determine whether spasticity was present (reference standard) and also evaluated subjects with spasticity using the Modified Ashworth Scale. Telehealth screening examinations, facilitated by a bedside nurse, were conducted remotely by two teleneurologists using a three-question screening tool. Telehealth screening determinations of spasticity were compared to the reference standard determination to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristics. Teleneurologist agreement was evaluated using Cohen's kappa. RESULTS Teleneurologist 1 had a specificity of 89% and sensitivity of 65% to identify the likely presence of spasticity (n = 61; AUC = 0.770). Teleneurologist 2 showed 100% specificity and 82% sensitivity (n = 16; AUC = 0.909). There was almost perfect agreement between the two examiners at 94% (kappa = 0.875, 95% CI: 0.640-1.000). CONCLUSION Telehealth may provide a useful, efficient method of identifying residents of long-term care facilities that likely need referral for spasticity evaluation.","Harper, Kelly A; Butler, Emily C; Hacker, Mallory L; Naik, Aaditi; Eoff, Bryan R; Phibbs, Fenna T; Isaacs, David A; Gallion, Stephen J; Thomas, Esmeralda P; Scott, Jim L; Ploucher, Shelby; Meystedt, Jacqueline C; McLeod, Megan E; Charles, Philip David",Clinical rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269215520963845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33040604/,762

This article aims to determine the prognostic biomarker of ceRNA for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis. Methods The expression and clinical significance of LINC00973 in NSCLC tissues were analyzed via the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), lnCAR, and clinical samples in Taihe Hospital. The biological functions and signaling pathways involved in target genes of ceRNA network were analyzed via Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Survival analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used for prognostic-related mRNA. Results Expression of LINC00973 was increased in NSCLC tissues. High expression of LINC00973 was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. There were 15 miRNA and 238 differential mRNA in the INC00973-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network, involving cell migration, endothelial cell proliferation, tumor growth factor (TGF)-β, cellular senescence, phosphatidylinositol 3-hydroxy kinase (PI3K)-Akt, Hippo, Rap1, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cell cycle signaling pathway, etc. The expression levels of RTKN2, NFIX, PTX3, BMP2 and LOXL2 were independent risk factors for the poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. Conclusions LINC00973-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network might be the basis for determining pivotal post-translational regulatory mechanisms in the progression of NSCLC. BMP2, LOXL2, NFIX, PTX3 and RTKN2 might be valuable prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets.","Guo, Qiang; Li, Dan; Luo, Xiangyu; Yuan, Ye; Li, Tian; Liu, Huasong; Wang, Xinju",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.684807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394080/,762

From February 21, 2020, to March 23, 2020, 20 patients with a fracture and a diagnosis of COVID-19 were hospitalized. Demographic data, COVID-19 symptoms, laboratory and radiographic examinations, and treatment methods were recorded. At 1-month follow-up, patients were assessed with the SF-36 score. This case series includes 20 patients (16 women and 4 men), with an average age of 82.35 years (range 59-95). Eleven patients (55%) had a femur fracture. Fourteen patients (70%) had 3 or more comorbidities or previous pathologies. Three patients with severe comorbidities died during the hospitalization. Thirteen patients (65%) had fever, 18 patients (90%) asthenia, and 17 patients (85%) dyspnea. All patients (100%) were given antibiotic therapy, whereas 16 patients (80%) underwent hydroxychloroquine therapy and 8 (40%) were treated with corticosteroids. Eighteen patients (90%) underwent antithromboembolic prophylaxis. Eighteen patients (90%) had lymphopenia. All 20 patients (100%) required noninvasive mechanical ventilation. High D-dimer and polymerase chain reaction values were found in all patients (100%), whereas lactate dehydrogenase was increased in 18 patients (90%). Patients with fractures, especially in the lower limbs, frequently require hospitalization, making these patients more subjected to the risk of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 infection therefore does not seem to influence the fracture pattern in the elderly population but can lead to health deterioration with increased mortality. The typical symptoms of COVID-19 disease have not changed when associated with a fracture or trauma. Laboratory data are in line with what is reported in recent studies, whereas a more invasive assisted ventilation is associated with a poor prognosis. Finally, analyzing the data obtained from the SF-36 score, significantly lower values emerged when compared with those reported in the literature. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:: Prognostic Level IV.

126096,Pepsin detection in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux before and after fundoplication.,2011,"OBJECTIVE To assess the direct costs of three surgical approaches in uterine cancer and the cost-effectiveness of incorporating robot-assisted surgery. METHODS A cost system that allocates the actual cost of resources used to treat each patient, as opposed to borrowing cost data from a billing system, was used to determine direct costs for patients who underwent surgery for uterine cancer from 2009 to 2010. These costs included all aspects of surgical care up to 6 months after discharge. Total amortized direct costs included the capital cost of three dual-console robotic platforms with 5 years of service contracts. Nonamortized costs were also calculated (excluded capital costs). Modeling was performed to estimate the mean cost of surgical care for patients presenting with endometrial cancer from 2007 to 2010. RESULTS Of 436 cases (132 laparoscopic, 262 robotic, 42 laparotomy), total mean amortized direct costs per case were $20,489 (laparoscopy), $23,646 (robot), and $24,642 (laparotomy) (P<.05 [robot compared with laparoscopy]; P=.6 [robot compared with laparotomy]). Total nonamortized costs per case were $20,289, $20,467, and $24,433, respectively (P=.9 [robot compared with laparoscopy]; P=.03 [robot compared with laparotomy]). The planned surgical approach in 2007 was laparoscopy, 68%; robot, 8%; and laparotomy, 24% compared with 26%, 64%, and 9%, respectively, in 2010 (P<.001). The modeled mean amortized direct costs per case were $21,738 in 2007 and $22,678 in 2010 (+$940). Nonamortized costs were $21,298 in 2007 and $20,573 in 2010 (-$725). CONCLUSION Laparoscopy is least expensive when including capital acquisition costs. Laparoscopy and robotic surgery are comparable if upfront costs are excluded. There is cost neutralization with the robot when it helps decrease laparotomy rates.","Leitao, Mario M; Bartashnik, Aleksandra; Wagner, Isaac; Lee, Stephen J; Caroline, Ari; Hoskins, William J; Thaler, Howard T; Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R; Sonoda, Yukio; Brown, Carol L; Jewell, Elizabeth L; Barakat, Richard R; Gardner, Ginger J",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000000223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785856/,762

To inform strategic planning by enabling effective resource allocation to manage the consequences of communicable disease outbreaks, it is useful to be able to rank and prioritise pathogens. This paper reports on a literature review which identifies and evaluates the range of methods used for risk ranking. Searches were performed across biomedical and grey literature databases, supplemented by reference harvesting and citation tracking. Studies were selected using transparent inclusion criteria and underwent quality appraisal using a bespoke checklist based on the AGREE II criteria. Seventeen studies were included in the review, covering five methodologies. A narrative analysis of the selected studies suggests that no single methodology was superior. However, many of the methods shared common components, around which a 'best-practice' framework was formulated.

126261,Selective approach for upper rectal cancer treatment: total mesorectal excision and preoperative chemoradiation are seldom necessary.,2015,"PURPOSE To review complications related to percutaneous renal tumor ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Prospectively collected data related to renal radiofrequency (RF) ablation and cryoablation procedures performed from May 2000 through November 2010 were reviewed. This included 573 renal ablation procedures performed in 533 patients to treat 633 tumors. A total of 254 RF ablation and 311 cryoablation procedures were performed; eight patients underwent simultaneous RF ablation and cryoablation. The mean age of patients at the time of the procedure was 70 years (range, 24-93 y), and 382 of 573 procedures (67%) were performed in male patients. Complications were recorded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification scheme. Duration of hospitalization was also documented. RESULTS Of the 573 procedures, 63 produced complications (11.0% overall complication rate). There were 66 reported complications, of which 38 (6.6% of total procedures) were Clavien-Dindo grade II-IV major complications; there were no deaths. Major complication rates did not differ statistically (P = .15) between cryoablation (7.7%; 24 of 311) and RF ablation (4.7%; 12 of 254). Of the complications related to cryoablation, bleeding and hematuria were most common. Bleeding during cryoablation was associated with advanced age, increased tumor size, increased number of cryoprobes, and central position (P < .05). Of those treated with RF ablation, nerve and urothelial injury were most common. Mean hospitalization duration was 1 day for RF ablation and cryoablation.

126590,Evaluation of a new energy device for parenchymal transection in laparoscopic liver resection.,2018,"Acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is associated with significant morbidity in the form of acute limb-threatening compromise from phlegmasia cerulea dolens, development of the postthrombotic syndrome (PTS), and even death secondary to pulmonary embolism. Initial therapy for DVT is anticoagulation, which inhibits thrombus propagation but lacks the thrombolytic properties to facilitate active thrombus removal. The existing thrombus burden can cause increased venous hypertension from occlusion as well as damage to venous valves by initiating an inflammatory response, which can ultimately result in PTS in up to half of patients on anticoagulation. The manifestations of PTS include leg pain, swelling, lifestyle-limiting venous claudication, skin hyperpigmentation, venous varicosities, and, in rare cases, venous stasis ulcers. Furthermore, patients with iliocaval DVT and large, free-floating thrombus are at an increased risk for pulmonary embolism despite adequate anticoagulation. Early attempts at thrombus removal with surgical thrombectomy or systemic thrombolysis or both demonstrated reductions in the incidence of PTS but were of limited utility owing to their invasiveness and increased risk of bleeding complications. New minimally invasive endovascular therapies, such as pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis, have been proposed, which focus on rapid thrombus removal while decreasing the rate of bleeding complications associated with systemic therapy. This article provides an overview of the current pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis protocol utilized at the Mount Sinai Hospital for acute iliocaval DVT.","Amin, Vinit B; Lookstein, Robert A",Techniques in vascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.tvir.2014.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24840964/,762

The guideline was prepared following the Standard Operational Procedure for a European Stroke Organisation guideline document and according to GRADE methodology. As a basic principle, we defined use of oral anticoagulation pragmatically: oral anticoagulation use is assumed by positive medical history unless relevant anticoagulant activity is regarded unlikely by medical history or has been ruled out by laboratory testing. Overall, we strongly recommend using prothrombin complex over no treatment and fresh-frozen plasma in patients on VKA plus vitamin K. We further strongly recommend using idarucizumab in patients on dabigatran and make a recommendation for andexanet alfa in patients on rivaroxaban and apixaban over no treatment. We make a weak recommendation on using high-dose prothrombin complex concentrate (50 IU/kg) for all patients taking edoxaban and for patients on rivaroxaban or apixaban in case andexanet alfa is not available. We recommend against using tranexamic acid and rFVIIa, outside of trials. The presented treatment recommendations aim to normalise coagulation, there is no or only indirect data on effects on functional outcome or mortality, and only little data from randomised controlled trials.","Christensen, Hanne; Cordonnier, Charlotte; Kõrv, Janika; Lal, Avtar; Ovesen, Christian; Purrucker, Jan C; Toni, Danilo; Steiner, Thorsten",European stroke journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987319849763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31903428/,762

METHODS A cross-sectional was study performed at 4 emergency departments of Puerto Rico's metropolitan area, between June 2014 and May 2015. We included children younger than 24 months, with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis, who were born and living in Puerto Rico at the time of recruitment. A physician-administered questionnaire inquiring about the patient's medical, family, and social history and a bronchiolitis severity assessment were performed. Daily weather conditions were monitored, and aeroallergens were collected with an air sample and precision weather station within the metropolitan area to evaluate environmental factors. RESULTS We included 600 patients for 12 months. More than 50% of the recruited patients had a previous episode of bronchiolitis, of which 40% had been hospitalized. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 18.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2-36.5), male sex (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), history of asthma (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 3.6-22), allergic rhinitis (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8-7.4), and smoke exposure by a caretaker (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4) were predictors of bronchiolitis episodes. Bronchiolitis episodes were associated with higher severity score (P = 0.040), increased number of atopic factors (P < 0.001), and higher number of hospitalizations (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study identifies Puerto Rican children who may present a severe clinical course of disease without traditional risk factors. Atopy-related factors are associated with frequency and severity of bronchiolitis. Puerto Rican children present risk factors related to atopy earlier in life, some of which may be modified to prevent the subsequent development of asthma.","Rivera-Sepúlveda, Andrea; García-Rivera, Enid; Castro, Mario; Soto, Fernando",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000002130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530834/,762
126990,Randomized Trial of Immediate Postoperative Pain Following Single-incision Versus Traditional Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.,2015,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an intractable disease with an extremely poor prognosis. Our clinical protocol for MPM of subablative radiotherapy (RT) followed by radical surgery achieved better survival compared to other multimodal treatments, but local relapse and metastasis remain a problem. This subablative RT elicits an antitumoral immune response that is limited by the immunosuppressive microenvironment generated by regulatory T (Treg) cells. The antitumor effect of immunotherapy to simultaneously modulate the immune activation and the immune suppression after subablative RT has not been investigated in MPM. Herein, we demonstrated a rationale to combine interleukin-15 (IL-15) superagonist (IL-15SA) and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein (GITR) agonist (DTA-1) with subablative RT in mesothelioma. IL-15SA boosted the systemic expansion of specific antitumoral memory CD8+ T cells that were induced by RT in mice. Their effect, however, was limited by the up-regulation and activation of Treg cells in the radiated tumor microenvironment. Hence, selective depletion of intratumoral Treg cells through DTA-1 enhanced the benefit of subablative RT in combination with IL-15SA. The addition of surgical resection of the radiated tumor in combination with IL-15SA and DTA-1 maximized the benefit of RT and was accompanied by a reproducible abscopal response in a concomitant tumor model. These data support the development of clinical trials in MPM to test such treatment options for patients with locally advanced or metastatic tumors.","Murakami, Junichi; Wu, Licun; Kohno, Mikihiro; Chan, Mei-Lin; Zhao, Yidan; Yun, Zhihong; Cho, B C John; de Perrot, Marc",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abd9882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853932/,762

Here, we describe PD-L1 expression by EBV+ DLBCL, NOS in order to evaluate its possible contribution to the pathogenesis of this tumor. The study included 57 cases of EBV+ DLBCL, NOS. The median patient age was 69 years and 95% (n = 54) were aged > 45. Extranodal lesions were present in 39 (69%) at initial diagnosis. PD-L1 expression (mAb SP142-positive staining) was present in more than 5% of tumor cells in only six cases (11%), in clear contrast to the 77% reported in cases aged under 45 years. Among the PD-L1+ cases, three were nodal lesions. All six PD-L1+ cases progressed in the 3 years after diagnosis and four of the six patients died of the disease within 2 years. PD-L1+ cases had significantly shorter PFS (P = 0.002) and relatively short OS (P = 0.26), compared with PD-L1- cases. EBV+ DLBCL, NOS in the elderly infrequently expressed PD-L1 and had poor prognosis. PD-L1 expression in EBV+ DLBCL, NOS of the elderly sheds light on the pathogenetic role of immune senescence.","Takahara, Taishi; Satou, Akira; Ishikawa, Eri; Kohno, Kei; Kato, Seiichi; Suzuki, Yuka; Takahashi, Emiko; Ohashi, Akiko; Asano, Naoko; Tsuzuki, Toyonori; Nakamura, Shigeo",Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00428-020-02901-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803453/,762
127578,Prospective evaluation of peritoneal fluid contamination following transabdominal vs. transanal specimen extraction in laparoscopic left-sided colorectal resections.,2012,"Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Therefore, management of aGVHD is important for successful transplantation. Mucosal damage and alteration of the gut microbiota after allo-HSCT are key factors in the development of aGVHD. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the ability of prebiotics, which can alleviate mucosal damage and manipulate the gut microbiota, to mitigate posttransplantation complications, including aGVHD. Resistant starch (RS) and a commercially available prebiotics mixture, GFO, were administered to allo-HSCT recipients from pretransplantation conditioning to day 28 after allo-HSCT. Prebiotic intake mitigated mucosal injury and reduced the incidence of all aGVHD grades combined and of aGVHD grades 2 to 4. The cumulative incidence of skin aGVHD was markedly decreased by prebiotics intake. Furthermore, the gut microbial diversity was well maintained and butyrate-producing bacterial population were preserved by prebiotics intake. In addition, the posttransplantation fecal butyrate concentration was maintained or increased more frequently in the prebiotics group. These observations indicate that prebiotic intake may be an effective strategy for preventing aGVHD in allo-HSCT, thereby improving treatment outcomes and the clinical utility of stem cell transplantation approaches.

Pre-operative echocardiogram assessment demonstrated preserved tendinous cords of the mitral leaflets, a mitral valve annulus measuring 3.2 cm with end systolic coaptation of 0.3 cm, impaired left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 35% and significant ventricular dilatation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed delayed enhancement in the anterolateral, septal and lateral walls and confirmed the impairment of the left ventricle and a large aneurysmal deformation. On-table transoesophageal echo showed that the distance between the two papillary muscles was over 4 cm. We performed coronary artery bypass grafting combined with a Dor Procedure and papillary muscle approximation using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular graft as a sling, without the insertion of a mitral annuloplasty ring. Postoperative echo and cardiac MRI showed improved left ventricular systolic function and reduced left ventricle volume associated with mild mitral regurgitation. We conclude that papillary muscles approximation as a method of mitral valve repair is a very effective procedure for functional ischaemic mitral regurgitation.","Karapanagiotidis, G T; Zakkar, M; Gukop, P; Sarsam, M A I",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659114521265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24469553/,762

METHODS All members of the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians were invited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey using a 20-item questionnaire to collect information on practice preparedness for the COVID-19 outbreak through an email followed by a reminder SMS message between 31 January 2020 and 3 February 2020. RESULTS Of 1589 family doctors invited, 491 (31%) participated in the survey, including 242 (49%) from private sector. In all, 98% surveyed doctors continued to provide clinical services during the survey period, but reduced clinic service demands were observed in 45% private practices and 24% public clinics. Almost all wore masks during consultation and washed hands between or before patient contact. Significantly more private than public doctors (80% vs 26%, P<0.001) experienced difficulties in stocking personal protective equipment (PPE); more public doctors used guidelines to manage suspected patients. The main concern of the respondents was PPE shortage. Respondents appealed for effective public health interventions including border control, quarantine measures, designated clinic setup, and public education. CONCLUSION Family doctors from public and private sectors demonstrated preparedness to serve the community from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak with heightened infection control measures and use of guidelines. However, there is a need for support from local health authorities to secure PPE supply and institute public health interventions.","Yu, E Y T; Leung, W L H; Wong, S Y S; Liu, K S N; Wan, E Y F",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj208606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475841/,762

Nevertheless, pathways of HONO formation remain to be explored. This study unveiled an important CO2-catalysis mechanism of HONO formation, using Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy samplings. In the mechanism, HCO3- formed from CO2 hydrolysis reacts with NO2 dimers to produce HONO at water surfaces, and simultaneously, itself reconverts back to CO2 via intermediates OC(O)ONO- and HOC(O)ONO. A flow system experiment was performed to confirm the new mechanism, which indicated that HONO concentrations with CO2 injections were increased by 29.4-68.5%. The new mechanism can be extended to other humid surfaces. Therefore, this study unveiled a previously overlooked vital role of CO2 that catalyzes formation of HONO and affects atmospheric oxidizing capacity.","Xia, Deming; Zhang, Xinran; Chen, Jingwen; Tong, Shengrui; Xie, Hong-Bin; Wang, Zhongyu; Xu, Tong; Ge, Maofa; Allen, David T",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c02706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323471/,762

But its role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unclear. In this study, frequencies of total and multiple subsets of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients and discharged individuals were analyzed using a multicolor flow cytometry assay. Plasma concentration of IL-10 was measured using a microsphere-based immunoassay kit. Comparing to healthy controls, the frequencies of total lymphocytes and T cells decreased significantly in both acutely infected COVID-19 patients and discharged individuals. The frequencies of total lymphocytes correlated negatively with the frequencies of CD3- CD56+ NK cells. The frequencies of regulatory CD8+ CD25+ T cells correlated with CD4+ /CD8+ T cell ratios positively, while the frequencies of regulatory CD4+ CD25+ CD127- T cells correlated negatively with CD4+ /CD8+ T cell ratios. Ratios of CD4+ /CD8+ T cells increased significantly in patients beyond age of 45 years. And accordingly, the frequencies of regulatory CD8+ CD25+ T cells were also found significantly increased in these patients. Collectively, the results suggest that regulatory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, the data indicate that NK cells might contribute to the COVID-19 associated lymphopenia.","Gao, Menglu; Liu, Yili; Guo, Mingquan; Wang, Qianying; Wang, Yan; Fan, Jian; Shen, Yinzhong; Hou, Junjie; Wan, Yanmin; Zhu, Zhaoqin",Journal of leukocyte biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.5cova0720-421rr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930458/,762

This study aimed to see whether epidural analgesia (EA) has superior clinical outcomes compared with non-epidural alternatives (N-EA) in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy. Methods A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. On 28 August 2018, relevant literature databases were searched. Primary outcomes were pain scores. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure of initial analgesia, complications, duration of hospital stay and mortality. Results Three RCTs and eight cohort studies (25 089 patients) were included. N-EA treatments studied were: intravenous morphine, continuous wound infiltration, bilateral paravertebral thoracic catheters and intrathecal morphine. Patients receiving EA had a marginally lower pain score on days 0-3 after surgery than those receiving intravenous morphine (mean difference (MD) -0·50, 95 per cent c.i. -0·80 to -0·21; P < 0·001) and similar pain scores to patients who had continuous wound infiltration. Treatment failure occurred in 28·5 per cent of patients receiving EA, mainly for haemodynamic instability or inadequate pain control. EA was associated with fewer complications (odds ratio (OR) 0·69, 95 per cent c.i. 0·06 to 0·79; P < 0·001), shorter duration of hospital stay (MD -2·69 (95 per cent c.i. -2·76 to -2·62) days; P < 0·001) and lower mortality (OR 0·69, 0·51 to 0 93; P = 0·02) compared with intravenous morphine. Conclusion EA provides marginally lower pain scores in the first postoperative days than intravenous morphine, and appears to be associated with fewer complications, shorter duration of hospital stay and less mortality.","Groen, J V; Khawar, A A J; Bauer, P A; Bonsing, B A; Martini, C H; Mungroop, T H; Vahrmeijer, A L; Vuijk, J; Dahan, A; Mieog, J S D",BJS open,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs5.50171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592509/,762

The interrelation with age and the presence of chronic non-communicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking) seems to go further than what would be explained by the prevalence and distribution of both. The drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are in many cases the backbone for the management of these diseases, it has been known for a long time that these drugs significantly increase the expression of receptors for angiotensin conversion enzyme type 2 in the lung tissue. This fact, together with the knowledge that the route of entry of the virus into the cell is precisely the ACE-2 receptor, initiated a hypothesis, based on very low-quality evidence, which quickly became generalized in the media, that the use of these drugs could be negative and that they should be interrupted immediately. The response of practically all Scientific Societies was almost immediate, with the precise indication that treatment with these drugs should not be discontinued, since the evidence of their usefulness is based on very solid and high-quality evidence. Simultaneously, a different hypothesis also appeared, also based on very preliminary evidence, that these drugs are not only harmful but also beneficial, however these medicaments are not yet accepted as agents for the prevention or treatment of this disease or its complications.

Given that SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, surgical societies have recommended that procedures with a high risk of aerosolization be avoided or delayed. However, some high-risk procedures, such as those related to head and neck malignancies, cannot always be delayed. Care must be taken during aerosol-generating procedures to minimize viral transmission as much as possible. Preoperative testing for COVID-19, limited operating room personnel, adequate personal protective equipment, and surgical technique are factors to consider for high-risk procedures. Methods: This article presents the case of an awake tracheotomy performed for a transglottic mass causing airway obstruction. Results: With detailed planning and specific techniques, the amount of aerosolization was reduced, and the procedure was performed as safely as possible.

129413,Understanding intestinal glucose transporter expression in obese compared to non-obese subjects.,2018,"The number of early gastric cancer (EGC) cases has been increasing because of improved diagnostic procedures. Applications of function-preserving gastric cancer surgery may therefore also be increasing because of its low incidence of lymph node metastasis, excellent survival rates, and the possibility of less-invasive procedures such as laparoscopic gastrectomy being used in combination. Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) with radical lymph node dissection is one such function-preserving procedure that has been applied for EGC, with the indications, limitations, and survival benefits of PPG already reported in several retrospective studies. Laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy has also been applied for EGC of the upper third of the stomach, although this procedure can be associated with the 2 major problems of reflux esophagitis and carcinoma arising in the gastric stump. In the patient with EGC in the upper third of the stomach, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy with a preserved very small stomach may provide a better quality of life for the patients and fewer postoperative complications. Finally, the laparoscopy endoscopy cooperative surgery procedure combines endoscopic submucosal dissection with laparoscopic gastric wall resection, which prevents excessive resection and deformation of the stomach after surgery and was recently applied for EGC cases without possibility of lymph node metastasis. Function-preserving laparoscopic gastrectomy is recommended for the treatment of EGC if the indication followed by accurate diagnosis is strictly confirmed. Preservation of remnant stomach sometimes causes severe postoperative dysfunctions such as delayed gastric retention in PPG, esophageal reflux in PG, and gastric stump carcinoma in the remnant stomach.

A SILS port was placed in the left lower quadrant at the intended colostomy site. A 5-mm trocar was inserted at the umbilicus at the subsequent drain site. Via a standard laparoscopic medial-to-lateral approach, the inferior mesenteric artery and vein were ligated and total mesorectal excision was performed. Via a perineal approach, the specimen was retrieved from the perineal wound, and a sigmoid colostomy was created at the site of the SILS port. Ten consecutive patients with lower rectal cancer at clinical stage T3 or lower underwent the procedure at our institution. The procedure was completed successfully in all patients, without any intraoperative problems and all postoperative outcomes were satisfactory. Thus, dual-port laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection can be performed safely and feasibly in selected patients.","Ishikawa, Takahisa; Homma, Shigenori; Shibasaki, Susumu; Yoshida, Tadashi; Minagawa, Nozomi; Kawamura, Hideki; Takahashi, Norihiko; Taketomi, Akinobu",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-015-1224-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220049/,762
129968,Multicenter experience with nonischemic multiport laparoscopic and laparoendoscopic single-site partial nephrectomy utilizing bipolar radiofrequency ablation coagulator.,2011,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 provided the impetus for unprecedented adoption of telemedicine. This study aimed to understand video visit adoption by plastic surgery providers; and patient and surgeon perceptions about its efficacy, value, accessibility, and long-term viability. A secondary aim was to develop the proposed 'Triage Tool for Video Visits in Plastic Surgery' to help determine visit video eligibility. METHODS This mixed-methods evaluation assessed provider-level scheduling data from the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Stanford Health Care to quantify telemedicine adoption and semi-structured phone interviews with patients (n = 20) and surgeons (n = 10) to explore stakeholder perspectives on video visits. RESULTS During the 13-week period after the local stay-at-home orders due to coronavirus disease 2019, 21.4% of preoperative visits and 45.5% of postoperative visits were performed via video. Video visits were considered acceptable by patients and surgeons in plastic surgery in terms of quality of care but were limited by the inability to perform a physical examination. Interviewed clinicians reported that long-term viability needs to be centered around technology (eg, connection, video quality, etc) and physical examinations. Our findings informed a proposed triage tool to determine the appropriateness of video visits for individual patients that incorporates visit type, anesthesia, case, surgeon's role, and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION Video technology has the potential to facilitate and improve preoperative and postoperative patient care in plastic surgery but the following components are needed: patient education on taking high-quality photos; standardized clinical guidelines for conducting video visits; and an algorithm-assisted triage tool to support scheduling.","Brown-Johnson, Cati G; Spargo, Tavish; Kling, Samantha M R; Saliba-Gustafsson, Erika A; Lestoquoy, Anna Sophia; Garvert, Donn W; Vilendrer, Stacie; Winget, Marcy; Asch, Steven M; Maggio, Paul; Nazerali, Rahim S",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2021.03.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33941389/,762

Systemic oncological treatments (SOT) have been widely used over more conservative approaches, such as supportive care. Nevertheless, its effectiveness in this scenario is not sufficiently clear. This paper provides an overview of systematic reviews that assessed the effectiveness of SOT compared with the best supportive care (BSC) or placebo in patients with advanced esophageal or gastric cancers in an end-of-life context. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, and PROSPERO for eligible systematic reviews (SRs) published from 2008 onwards. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), functional status, and toxicity. Two authors assessed eligibility and extracted data independently. We evaluated the methodological quality of included SRs using the AMSTAR-2 tool and the overlap of primary studies (corrected covered area, CCA). Also, we performed a de novo meta-analysis with data reported for each primary study when it was possible. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS We identified 16 SRs (19 included trials) for inclusion within this overview. Most reviews had a critically low methodological quality, and there was a very high overlap of primary studies. It is uncertain whether SOT improves OS and PFS over more conservative approaches due to the very low certainty of evidence. CONCLUSIONS The evidence is very uncertain about the effectiveness of SOT for advanced esophageal or gastric cancers. High-quality SRs and further randomized clinical trials that include a thorough assessment of patient-centered outcomes are needed.

Hair loss patients can experience negative psychological effects and are likely to turn to social networking platforms for support and treatment information. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the type and quality of Facebook hair loss treatment information that can be accessed by hair loss patients. METHODS In August 2020, we searched Google for publicly accessible Facebook hair loss treatment content using the terms hair loss, alopecia, hair loss treatment, hair restoration, and hair transplant. We retrieved 133 Facebook pages and ranked them based on the number of visitors who received regular content updates. Content posted on the Top 5 most popular pages was analyzed based on type (advertising vs informational) and information quality (unsupported or supported by medical evidence). RESULTS Most Facebook hair loss pages advertised products or hair restoration clinics, or were aimed at fundraising for alopecia organizations. There was high interest in natural hair loss treatments and follicular unit excision (FUE) procedures, consistent with global online search trends. Some products advertised as ""natural"" contained minoxidil. ""Before & after"" images of FUE procedures were popular with users. Only 3-13% of hair loss treatment posts were supported by medical evidence and user engagement with this content was low. CONCLUSIONS There is high user interest in hair loss treatment content on Facebook.

130829,Initial application of reduced port surgery using the single port access technique for laparoscopic canine ovariectomy.,2012,"BACKGROUND Excellent results have been reported with mini-gastric bypass. We adopted and modified the one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) concept. Herein is our approach, results, and long-term follow-up (FU). METHODS Initial 1200 patients submitted to laparoscopic OAGB between 2002 and 2008 were analyzed after a 6-12-year FU. Mean age was 43 years (12-74) and body mass index (BMI) 46 kg/m2 (33-86). There were 697 (58 %) without previous or simultaneous abdominal operations, 273 (23 %) with previous, 203 (17 %) with simultaneous, and 27 (2 %) performed as revisions. RESULTS Mean operating time (min) was as follows: (a) primary procedure, 86 (45-180); (b) with other operations, 112 (95-230); and (c) revisions, 180 (130-240). Intraoperative complications led to 4 (0.3 %) conversions. Complications prompted operations in 16 (1.3 %) and were solved conservatively in 12 (1 %). Long-term complications occurred in 12 (1 %). There were 2 (0.16 %) deaths. Thirty-day and late readmission rates were 0.8 and 1 %. Cumulative FU was 87 and 70 % at 6 and 12 years. The highest mean percent excess weight loss was 88 % (at 2 years), then 77 and 70 %, 6 and 12 years postoperatively. Mean BMI (kg/m2) decreased from 46 to 26.6 and was 28.5 and 29.9 at those time frames. Remission or improvement of comorbidities was achieved in most patients. The quality of life index was satisfactory in all parameters from 6 months onwards. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic OAGB is safe and effective. It reduces difficulty, operating time, and early and late complications of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Long-term weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, and degree of satisfaction are similar to results obtained with more aggressive and complex techniques. It is currently a robust and powerful alternative in bariatric surgery.","Carbajo, Miguel A; Luque-de-León, Enrique; Jiménez, José M; Ortiz-de-Solórzano, Javier; Pérez-Miranda, Manuel; Castro-Alija, María J",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2428-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27783366/,762
130870,Single-incision laparoscopic splenectomy for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: report of a case.,2011,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common gastrointestinal disorder in premature neonates. This disease is characterized by massive epithelial necrosis, gut barrier dysfunction and improper mucosal defense development. Studies have shown that probiotic administration can decrease NEC incidence and mortality. The proposed mechanisms of probiotics for the prevention of NEC are: promotion of intestinal development; improved barrier function through decreased apoptosis and improved mucin production; decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8, and TNFα, and modulation of microbiota dysbiosis in preterm infants. However, reported sepsis in the immunocompromised preterm host has deterred routine prophylactic administration of probiotics in the neonatal intensive care unit. We hypothesize that maternal administration of probiotics to pregnant mouse dams can recapitulate the beneficial effects observed in neonates fed with probiotics directly. We exposed pregnant mice to the probiotics and monitored the changes in the developing intestines of the offspring. Pregnant mice were fed daily with the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis (LB) from embryonic day15 to 2-week-old postnatally. Intraperitoneal administration of IL-1β in the pups was used to model proinflammatory insults. Sera were collected at 2 weeks of age and evaluated for inflammatory cytokines by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay and gut permeability by Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran tracer assay. Ileal tissues were collected for the evaluation of apoptosis and proliferation of the intestinal epithelium; as well as mucin and tight junction integrity at mucosal surface by immunofluorescent staining. We find that maternal LB exposure facilitated intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, prevented loss of mucin and preserved the intestinal integrity and barrier function and decreased serum levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in the preweaned offsprings. in LB exposed pups. We demonstrate that maternal probiotic supplementation promotes gut maturation in developing offspring. This is potentially a safe alternative therapy to induce intestinal maturation and prevent prematurity-associated neonatal disorders.","Yu, Yueyue; Lu, Jing; Oliphant, Kaitlyn; Gupta, Nikhilesh; Claud, Katerina; Lu, Lei",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764797/,762

131200,Hartmann's procedure and laparoscopic reversal versus primary anastomosis and ileostomy closure for left colonic perforation.,2015,"Contaminated suture material plays an important role in the physiopathology of surgical site infections. Recently, suture material has been developed characterized by barbs projecting from a monofilament base. Claimed advantages for barbed sutures are a shortened wound closure time and reduced maximum wound tension. It has also been suggested that these sutures would be advantageous microbiologically. The aim of this study was to test the microbiological characteristics of the barbed Quill in comparison to the monofilament Ethilon II and the braided sutures Vicryl and triclosan-coated Vicryl Plus. In our study, sutures were cultivated on color-change agar with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the halo size was measured. In a second study arm with longer cultivation bacterial growth was followed by antibiotic treatment. Ethilon II and Quill showed good comparable results, whereas large halos were found around Vicryl. Vicryl Plus results depended on triclosan sensitivity. After longer bacterial cultivation and antibiotic treatment, halos were up to 3.6 times smaller on Quill than on Vicryl (p < 0.001), but 1.4 times larger than on Ethilon II (p < 0.001) regarding S. aureus. Confocal microscopy analysis showed bacterial colonization between the braided filaments on Vicryl and beneath the barbs on Quill. From a microbiological perspective, barbed sutures can be recommended in aseptic surgery, but should only be used carefully in septic surgery. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

This work aimed to study the immobilising process of gallic acid in the antibacterial activity of L. innocua and its toxicological properties in vivo using Caenorhabditis elegans. The experiment was based on obtaining the minimum bactericidal concentration for free and immobilised gallic acid by comparing lethality, locomotion behaviour, chemotaxis and thermal stress resistance on C.elegans at those concentrations. The results showed a lowering minimum bactericidal concentration and modifications to nematode responses. Increased lethality and velocity of movements was observed. Immobilisation increased the repellent effect of gallic acid with a negative chemotaxis index. Thermal stress resistance was also affected, with higher mortality for immobilised gallic acid compared to bare particles and free gallic acid. Thus despite evidencing a generalised increase in the toxicity of gallic acid in vivo, lowering the minimum bactericidal concentration allowed a bacterial reduction of 99% with less than one third of mortality for the nematodes exposed to free gallic acid.","Verdú, Samuel; Ruiz-Rico, María; Perez, Alberto J; Barat, José M; Talens, Pau; Grau, Raúl",Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2020.103492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941999/,762
132294,Durability of Cardiometabolic Outcomes Among Adolescents After Sleeve Gastrectomy: First Study with 9-Year Follow-up.,2021-04-10,"In 2020, due to the Nightingale year and COVID-19 crisis, nursing is in the public eye more than ever. Nurses often are being seen as compassionate helpers. The public image of nursing, however, also consists of stereotypes such as nursing being a 'doing' profession and care being a 'female' characteristic. Next to that, nursing is associated with images from the past, such as 'the lady with the lamp'. Therefore, in the public eye at least, the nursing identity seems a simple and straightforward enough construct, but nothing less is true. Looking at what a professional identity consists of, historic and social developments influence a group identity as a construct. In addition, individual, professional and contemporary societal moralities, including stereotypes, play its role. Nurses themselves reinforce stereotypes in order to fit into what is expected, even when they believe professional behaviour encompasses other features. They may do so individually as well as in a group context. But nursing actually seems to be better off when viewed upon as a diverse, autonomous profession. Moral values such as compassion motivate nurses to enter the profession. Research shows that if such values are addressed in daily practice, nursing could perhaps be saved from nurses leaving the profession because of feeling unfulfilled. Another aspect concerns the huge nursing body of knowledge. If seen as the ground on which nursing behaviour is standing, it would contribute to a different image of nursing than simplified stereotypes, which do not acknowledge the complex nature of the profession. This paper challenges the idea that the nursing identity is unchangeable and the notion that 'a nurse will always be a nurse'. By doing so, the paper contributes to a debate on the supposed 'true' nature of the nursing identity and opens a discussion on the need for it to change.","van der Cingel, Margreet; Brouwer, Jasperina",Nursing philosophy : an international journal for healthcare professionals,https://doi.org/10.1111/nup.12343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450124/,762

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of internally calibrated conebeam CT pixel value measurements that can enable the determination of active fenestral otosclerosis (otospongiosis). MATERIALS AND METHODS This study included 37 ears in 22 patients with a clinical diagnosis of otospongiosis in those ears and 35 ears in 22 control patients without the diagnosis. Temporal bone conebeam CT was performed. ROIs were set anterior to the oval window, in the lateral semicircular canal bone island, and in a nearby aerated space. Mean conebeam CT pixel values in these regions determined the relative attenuation ratio of the area anterior to the oval window normalized to normal otic capsule bone and air. RESULTS The relative attenuation ratio for cases of otospongiosis was significantly lower than that for controls (P < .001). Based on receiver operating characteristic analysis, the optimal cutoff relative attenuation ratio was 0.876, which had an accuracy of 97.2% for the diagnosis of otospongiosis. CONCLUSIONS Internally calibrated pixel value ratios in temporal bone conebeam CT can feasibly help diagnose active/spongiotic-phase fenestral otosclerosis in an objective manner.","Deng, F; Touska, P; Reinshagen, K L; Curtin, H D; Juliano, A F",AJNR.

OBJECTIVES To investigate the association of maternal urinary bisphenol concentrations during pregnancy with maternal, newborn and early childhood thyroid function. METHODS This study was embedded in Generation R, a prospective, population-based birth cohort (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). Maternal urine samples were analyzed for eight bisphenols at early (<18), mid (18-25) and late (>25 weeks) pregnancy. Maternal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and total thyroxine (TT4) were measured in early pregnancy and child TSH and FT4 were measured in cord blood and childhood. RESULTS The final study population comprised 1,267 mothers, 853 newborns and 882 children. Of the eight bisphenols measured, only bisphenol A (BPA) was detected in >50% of samples at all three time-points and bisphenol S (BPS) at the first time-point. There was no association of BPA or the bisphenol molar sum with maternal thyroid function. Higher BPS concentrations were associated with a higher maternal TT4 (β [95% CI] per 1 (natural-log) unit increase: 0.97 [0.03 to 1.91]) but there was no association with TSH or FT4. Furthermore, higher BPS was associated with an attenuation of the association between maternal FT4 and TSH (Pinteraction = 0.001). There was no association of early or mid-pregnancy BPA or early pregnancy BPS with cord blood or childhood TSH and FT4. A higher late pregnancy maternal BPA exposure was associated with a higher TSH in female newborns (Pinteraction = 0.06) and a higher FT4 during childhood in males (Pinteraction = 0.08).

Furthermore, the potential developmental toxicity of exposure to bisphenols during pregnancy could affect the thyroid system in the offspring in a sex-specific manner.","Derakhshan, Arash; Philips, Elise M; Ghassabian, Akhgar; Santos, Susana; Asimakopoulos, Alexandros G; Kannan, Kurunthachalam; Kortenkamp, Andreas; Jaddoe, Vincent W V; Trasande, Leonardo; Peeters, Robin P; Korevaar, Tim I M",Environment international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.106160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068853/,762
132550,Recommended timing for surveillance ultrasonography to diagnose portal splenic vein thrombosis after laparoscopic splenectomy.,2010,"BACKGROUND Supervised machine learning (ML) is being featured in the health care literature with study results frequently reported using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, or F1 score. Although each metric provides a different perspective on the performance, they remain to be overall measures for the whole sample, discounting the uniqueness of each case or patient. Intuitively, we know that all cases are not equal, but the present evaluative approaches do not take case difficulty into account. OBJECTIVE A more case-based, comprehensive approach is warranted to assess supervised ML outcomes and forms the rationale for this study. This study aims to demonstrate how the item response theory (IRT) can be used to stratify the data based on how difficult each case is to classify, independent of the outcome measure of interest (eg, accuracy). This stratification allows the evaluation of ML classifiers to take the form of a distribution rather than a single scalar value. METHODS Two large, public intensive care unit data sets, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and electronic intensive care unit, were used to showcase this method in predicting mortality. For each data set, a balanced sample (n=8078 and n=21,940, respectively) and an imbalanced sample (n=12,117 and n=32,910, respectively) were drawn. A 2-parameter logistic model was used to provide scores for each case. Several ML algorithms were used in the demonstration to classify cases based on their health-related features: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, naive Bayes, and a neural network. Generalized linear mixed model analyses were used to assess the effects of case difficulty strata, ML algorithm, and the interaction between them in predicting accuracy. RESULTS The results showed significant effects (P<.001) for case difficulty strata, ML algorithm, and their interaction in predicting accuracy and illustrated that all classifiers performed better with easier-to-classify cases and that overall the neural network performed best. Significant interactions suggest that cases that fall in the most arduous strata should be handled by logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, or neural network but not by naive Bayes or K-nearest neighbors. Conventional metrics for ML classification have been reported for methodological comparison. CONCLUSIONS This demonstration shows that using the IRT is a viable method for understanding the data that are provided to ML algorithms, independent of outcome measures, and highlights how well classifiers differentiate cases of varying difficulty. This method explains which features are indicative of healthy states and why. It enables end users to tailor the classifier that is appropriate to the difficulty level of the patient for personalized medicine.","Kline, Adrienne; Kline, Theresa; Shakeri Hossein Abad, Zahra; Lee, Joon",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/20268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975523/,762

Cases were patients who underwent stroke alert imaging with confirmed acute stroke on imaging between March 16 and April 5, 2020, at 6 hospitals across New York City. Control subjects were those who underwent stroke alertimaging during the same timeframe without imaging evidence of acute infarction. Data pertaining to diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, patient demographics, and risk factors were collected. A univariate analysis was performed to assess the covariate effect of risk factors and COVID-19 status on stroke imaging with positive findings. RESULTS The mean age for cases and controls was 65.5 ± 15.3 years and 68.8 ± 13.2 years, respectively. Of patients with acute ischemic stroke, 46.3% had COVID-19 infection compared with 18.3% of controls (P = .001). After adjusting for age, sex, and risk factors, COVID-19 infection had a significant independent association with acute ischemic stroke compared with control subjects (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.7-8.9; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that COVID-19 infection is significantly associated with imaging confirmation of acute ischemic stroke, and patients with COVID-19 should undergo more aggressive monitoring for stroke.","Belani, P; Schefflein, J; Kihira, S; Rigney, B; Delman, B N; Mahmoudi, K; Mocco, J; Majidi, S; Yeckley, J; Aggarwal, A; Lefton, D; Doshi, A H",AJNR.

132898,Retroperitoneal Laparoscopic Radical Nephrectomy for Large (>7 cm) Solid Renal Tumors: Comparison of Perioperative Outcomes with the Transperitoneal Approach.,2017,"OBJECTIVES Proponents of a single-payer or public option health care system often cite the lower administrative expenses in public Medicare compared with those in private Medicare, claiming that this difference represents efficiency. We check the validity of this comparison in terms of accuracy and definitions and suggest expanding its scope to include expanded financial data of the 2 Medicare systems. STUDY DESIGN Using annual Medicare Boards of Trustees and National Health Expenditure Accounts data from CMS and health insurers' financial statement data, we compare the level and percentage of the administrative expenses of the Medicare systems and show incompatible and not reconcilable definitions of administrative expenses. We expand our analysis to income, benefits, gains and losses, and loss ratios of the programs. METHODS Our methodology is a careful comparison of categories of expenses between public and private insurers using official data sources. The comparison is both qualitative and quantitative. RESULTS We validate the low administrative expenses of Medicare parts A, B, and D (1.35% of benefits in 2018) compared with Medicare Part C (10.86% of benefits without loss adjustment expenses [LAE] and 14.84% with LAE for 2018). Expanding the focus, the income and benefits per beneficiary grew faster and larger in Medicare parts A, B, and D than in Medicare Part C-a reversal of earlier trends. The public Medicare program suffered losses in 11 years during 2002-2018, whereas private insurers' Medicare remained solvent with about an 85% loss ratio. CONCLUSIONS Comparisons of the systems in the United States would benefit from expanding the focus beyond incomparable administrative expenses. For the current period of coronavirus disease 2019, if the trends continue, public Medicare may suffer greater deficits relative to the private Medicare Part C.","Baranoff, Dalit; Baranoff, Etti G; Sager, Thomas W; Shi, Bo",The American journal of managed care,https://doi.org/10.37765/ajmc.2021.88621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33877779/,762
132941,Comparison of Short-term and Long-term Clinical Outcomes Between Laparoscopic and Open Total Gastrectomy for Patients With Gastric Cancer.,2016,"BACKGROUND During esophagojejunostomy using a circular stapler after laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy, placement of the anvil head via the transabdominal approach proved difficult. The authors report on a method modified for laparoscopy-assisted, esophagojejunostomy performed by placing the pretilted anvil head via the transoral approach. METHODS Between November 2007 and December 2008, esophagojejunostomy was performed using the transoral, pretilted anvil head in 27 patients after laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy. The anesthesiologist introduced the anvil while observing its passage through the pharynx. During the anastomosis, we kept the jejunum fixed in position with a silicone band Lig-A-Loops, thereby preventing the intestine from slipping off the shaft of the stapler. RESULTS Esophagojejunal anastomosis using the transoral anvil head was achieved successfully in 26 patients; for 1 patient, passage of the anvil head was difficult owing to esophageal stenosis. No other complications, such as hypopharyngeal perforation and/or esophageal mucosal injury, occurred during passage. No postoperative complications occurred, except for 1 patient who developed anastomotic stenosis, in whom mild relief was achieved using a bougie. CONCLUSION Esophagojejunostomy using the transoral pretilted anvil head is a simple and safe technique.","Sakuramoto, Shinichi; Kikuchi, Shiro; Futawatari, Nobue; Moriya, Hiromitsu; Katada, Natsuya; Yamashita, Keishi; Watanabe, Masahiko",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2009.06.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733877/,762
133037,Laparoscopic mechanical fixation devices: does firing angle matter?,2013,"OBJECTIVE Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) is a form of high-frequency ventilation that can be superimposed on spontaneous breathing or conventional ventilation. Drawbacks include difficulties achieving adequate airway humidification and an inability to monitor delivered volumes and pressures, which may vary with patient characteristics. The objectives of this study were to assess various humidification set-ups, to measure intrapulmonary pressures and volumes resulting from IPV superimposed on a conventional driving ventilator (DV) and to test several ventilators regarding their ability to accept added IPV. DESIGN Bench study in a test-lung set-up was used to measure humidification and the effects of adding IPV to a DV under various conditions of compliance, resistance, plateau and positive end-expiratory pressures. Then, five ventilators were tested in combination with IPV. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Adequate humidification required a heated humidifier on the inspiratory line downstream of the IPV device. IPV increased end-inspiratory intrapulmonary pressures up to 10 cmH(2)O, increased delivered volumes up to 237 ml and generated intrinsic PEEP from 1.7 to 4.3 cmH(2)O when no PEEP was set on the DV. Intrinsic PEEP was lower or absent when PEEP was set on the DV. With most tested ventilators, IPV prevented reliable flow monitoring. Autotriggering and missing cycles were common and the PEEP effect varied across DVs. CONCLUSION Achieving adequate humidification with IPV requires a specific set-up. Superimposing IPV on standard ventilation can increase intrapulmonary pressures and tidal volumes importantly and interfere with the triggering sensors of the ventilator. These factors must be taken into account before clinical use.","Dellamonica, Jean; Louis, Bruno; Lyazidi, Aissam; Vargas, Frédéric; Brochard, Laurent",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-008-1190-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18592212/,762

A randomized controlled trial with tissue adhesive (n-hexyl-α-cyanoacrylate).,2014,"Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells maintain the immune tolerance and prevent inflammatory responses in the periphery. However, the presence of Treg cells in the CNS under steady state has not been studied. Here, for the first time, we show a substantial TCRαβ (+) CD4(+) Foxp3(+) T-cell population (cerebral Treg cells) in the rat cerebrum, constituting more than 15% of the cerebral CD4(+) T-cell compartment. Cerebral Treg cells showed an activated/memory phenotype and expressed many Treg-cell signature genes at higher levels than peripheral Treg cells. Consistent with their activated/memory phenotype, cerebral Treg cells robustly restrained the LPS-induced inflammatory responses of brain microglia/macrophages, suggesting a role in maintaining the cerebral homeostasis by inhibiting the neuroinflammation. In addition, brain astrocytes were the helper cells that sustained Foxp3 expression in Treg cells through IL-2/STAT5 signaling, showing that the interaction between astrocytes and Treg cells contributes to the maintenance of Treg-cell identity in the brain. Taken together, our work represents the first study to characterize the phenotypic and functional features of Treg cells in the rat cerebrum. Our data have provided a novel insight for the contribution of Treg cells to the immunosurveillance and immunomodulation in the cerebrum under steady state.","Xie, Luokun; Choudhury, Gourav Roy; Winters, Ali; Yang, Shao-Hua; Jin, Kunlin",European journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201444823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329858/,762
133495,Unilateral and bilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy in 157 mares: a retrospective multicenter study.,2011,"BACKGROUND This study reports the short- and long-term results for a prospective rectal cancer management program using laparoscopic radical transanal abdominal transanal proctosigmoidectomy with coloanal anastomosis (TATA) after neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS A prospective database included 102 rectal cancer patients treated with laparoscopic TATA from 1998 to 2008. Patients with distant metastasis at presentation, patients with a tumor more than 3 cm from the anorectal ring, and patients not undergoing neoadjuvant therapy were excluded, leaving 79 patients (54 men and 25 women) with a mean age of 59.2 years (range, 22-85 years) for this study. 13 patients completed neoadjuvant therapy before the original evaluation, and they are excluded from the report of initial clinical assessment. Before treatment, 50 patients were staged as T3 and 16 patients as T2. The mean level in the rectum superior to the anorectal ring was 1.2 cm (range, -0.5 to 3 cm). In terms of fixity, 31 of the tumors were mobile, 27 were tethered, and 8 showed early fixation. Ulceration was absent in 8 cases, minimal in 12 cases, superficial in 7 cases, moderate in 22 cases, and deep in 17 cases. The mean pretreatment tumor size tumor was 4.8 cm (range, 1.5-12 cm). The median external beam radiation was 5,400 cGy (range, 3,000-8,040 cGy), and 77 patients underwent chemotherapy. RESULTS The mean follow-up period was 34.2 months (range, 1.9-113.9 months). There were no perioperative mortalities. The conversion rate was 2.5%, and the mean largest incision length was 4.3 cm (range, 1.2-21 cm). For 84% of the patients, the incision was less than 6.0 cm, and 46% of the patients had no abdominal incision for delivery of the specimen. The mean estimated blood loss was 367 ml (range, 75-2,200 ml). All the patients had a temporary diverting stoma. The major morbidity rate was 11%, and the minor morbidity rate was 19%. The major complications included four full-thickness rectal prolapses with repair, one ischemic neorectum with successful reanastomosis, two bowel obstructions, and two failed anastomoses requiring stoma. The ypT stages included 22 complete responses, 12 cases of ypT1, 22 cases of ypT2, 23 cases of ypT3; 65 cases of ypN0, and 14 cases of ypN + (T3 = 7, T2 = 4, T1 = 3). The local recurrence rate was 2.5% (2/79), and the distant metastases rate was 10.1% (8/79). The KM5YAS rate was 97%. Overall, 90% of the patients lived without a stoma. Neorectal loss was due to positive margins or recurrence and was followed by abdominoperineal resection in three cases and ischemia in two cases. The condition of two patients was not reversed due to comorbidities, and one patient had a stoma secondary to bowel obstruction. CONCLUSION The study results indicate excellent local recurrence (2.7%) and 5-year survival rates without the need for permanent colostomy in patients with cancers in the distal one-third of the rectum. Laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) with the TATA approach is safe and can be performed laparoscopically. Multi-institutional studies are required to establish the reproducibility of this promising approach.","Marks, J; Mizrahi, B; Dalane, S; Nweze, I; Marks, G",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1028-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20414681/,762
133898,Effect of laparoscopic liver resection versus the open technique on hepatocyte regenerating activity in the rat.,2019-11-18,"The diagnosis of incidental small renal masses (SRM) has increased during the past two decades secondary to the increased use of various abdominal imaging modalities. In the past decade there has been a shift from radical nephrectomy to nephron sparing surgery techniques where partial nephrectomy has become the standard of care. Thermal ablation (TA) modalities such as freezing or heating delivered percutaneously for the treatment of small renal masses (SRM) is now offered in many Institutions as a treatment option. Clinical guidelines have indicated that TA is appropriate for select patients that are medically high risk or elderly. In our institution and in select centers, TA is discussed and often offered for all patients with SRM as equivalent treatment without respect to age or co-morbidities. As provider experience improves and long-term outcome studies become available, TA is becoming increasingly accepted as a potential new standard of care for solid SRM. This review will highlight the role of image guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) techniques and their application focusing on the different imaging modalities for RFA application which, most commonly, include percutaneous (Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and computerized tomographic (CT).

134125,Feasibility of single-port retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy in dogs.,2018,"BACKGROUND Platelet transfusions are used to prevent and treat bleeding in patients who are thrombocytopenic. Despite improvements in donor screening and laboratory testing, a small risk of viral, bacterial or protozoal contamination of platelets remains. There is also an ongoing risk from newly emerging blood transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) for which laboratory tests may not be available at the time of initial outbreak.One solution to reduce further the risk of TTIs from platelet transfusion is photochemical pathogen reduction, a process by which pathogens are either inactivated or significantly depleted in number, thereby reducing the chance of transmission. This process might offer additional benefits, including platelet shelf-life extension, and negate the requirement for gamma-irradiation of platelets. Although current pathogen-reduction technologies have been proven significantly to reduce pathogen load in platelet concentrates, a number of published clinical studies have raised concerns about the effectiveness of pathogen-reduced platelets for post-transfusion platelet recovery and the prevention of bleeding when compared with standard platelets. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of pathogen-reduced platelets for the prevention of bleeding in patients requiring platelet transfusions. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to 18 February 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 18 February 2013), CINAHL (1982 to 18 February 2013) and the Transfusion Evidence Library (1980 to 18 February 2013). We also searched several international and ongoing trial databases and citation-tracked relevant reference lists. We requested information on possible unpublished trials from known investigators in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the transfusion of pathogen-reduced platelets with standard platelets. We did not identify any RCTs which compared the transfusion of one type of pathogen-reduced platelets with another. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One author screened all references, excluding duplicates and those clearly irrelevant. Two authors then screened the remaining references, confirmed eligibility, extracted data and analysed trial quality independently. We requested and obtained a significant amount of missing data from trial authors. We performed meta-analyses where appropriate using the fixed-effect model for risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and used the I² statistic to explore heterogeneity, employing the random-effects model when I² was greater than 30%. MAIN RESULTS We included 10 trials comparing pathogen-reduced platelets with standard platelets. Nine trials assessed Intercept® pathogen-reduced platelets and one trial Mirasol® pathogen-reduced platelets. Two were randomised cross-over trials and the remaining eight were parallel-group RCTs. In total, 1422 participants were available for analysis across the 10 trials, of which 675 participants received Intercept® and 56 Mirasol® platelet transfusions. Four trials assessed the response to a single study platelet transfusion (all Intercept®) and six to multiple study transfusions (Intercept® (N = 5), Mirasol® (N = 1)) compared with standard platelets.We found the trials to be generally at low risk of bias but heterogeneous regarding the nature of the interventions (platelet preparation), protocols for platelet transfusion, definitions of outcomes, methods of outcome assessment and duration of follow-up.Our primary outcomes were mortality, 'any bleeding', 'clinically significant bleeding' and 'severe bleeding', and were grouped by duration of follow-up: short (up to 48 hours), medium (48 hours to seven days) or long (more than seven days). Meta-analysis of data from five trials of multiple platelet transfusions reporting 'any bleeding' over a long follow-up period found an increase in bleeding in those receiving pathogen-reduced platelets compared with standard platelets using the fixed-effect model (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15, I² = 59%); however, this meta-analysis showed no difference between treatment arms when using the random-effects model (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.38).There was no evidence of a difference between treatment arms in the number of patients with 'clinically significant bleeding' (reported by four out of the same five trials) or 'severe bleeding' (reported by all five trials) (respectively, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21, I² = 2%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.12, I² = 51%). We also found no evidence of a difference between treatment arms for all-cause mortality, acute transfusion reactions, adverse events, serious adverse events and red cell transfusion requirements in the trials which reported on these outcomes. No bacterial transfusion-transmitted infections occurred in the six trials that reported this outcome.Although the definition of platelet refractoriness differed between trials, the relative risk of this event was 2.74 higher following pathogen-reduced platelet transfusion (RR 2.74, 95% CI 1.84 to 4.07, I² = 0%). Participants required 7% more platelet transfusions following pathogen-reduced platelet transfusion when compared with standard platelet transfusion (MD 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.11, I² = 21%), although the interval between platelet transfusions was only shown to be significantly shorter following multiple Intercept® pathogen-reduced platelet transfusion when compared with standard platelet transfusion (MD -0.51, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.37, I² = 0%). In trials of multiple pathogen-reduced platelets, our analyses showed the one- and 24-hour count and corrected count increments to be significantly inferior to standard platelets. However, one-hour increments were similar in trials of single platelet transfusions, although the 24-hour count and corrected count increments were again significantly lower. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence of a difference in mortality, 'clinically significant' or 'severe bleeding', transfusion reactions or adverse events between pathogen-reduced and standard platelets. For a range of laboratory outcomes the results indicated evidence of some benefits for standard platelets over pathogen-reduced platelets. These conclusions are based on data from 1422 patients included in 10 trials. Results from ongoing or new trials are required to determine if there are clinically important differences in bleeding risk between pathogen-reduced platelet transfusions and standard platelet transfusions. Given the variability in trial design, bleeding assessment and quality of outcome reporting, it is recommended that future trials apply standardised approaches to outcome assessment and follow-up, including safety reporting.","Butler, Caroline; Doree, Carolyn; Estcourt, Lise J; Trivella, Marialena; Hopewell, Sally; Brunskill, Susan J; Stanworth, Simon; Murphy, Michael F",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd009072.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23543569/,762

Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are the most affected cells in HGPS individuals, although the reason for such vulnerability remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a microfluidic chip formed by HGPS-SMCs generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to study their vulnerability to flow shear stress. HGPS-iPSC SMCs cultured under arterial flow conditions detach from the chip after a few days of culture; this process is mediated by the upregulation of metalloprotease 13 (MMP13). Importantly, double-mutant LmnaG609G/G609GMmp13-/- mice or LmnaG609G/G609GMmp13+/+ mice treated with a MMP inhibitor show lower SMC loss in the aortic arch than controls. MMP13 upregulation appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the upregulation of glycocalyx. Our HGPS-SMCs chip represents a platform for developing treatments for HGPS individuals that may complement previous pre-clinical and clinical treatments.","Pitrez, Patricia R; Estronca, Luís; Monteiro, Luís Miguel; Colell, Guillem; Vazão, Helena; Santinha, Deolinda; Harhouri, Karim; Thornton, Daniel; Navarro, Claire; Egesipe, Anne-Laure; Carvalho, Tânia; Dos Santos, Rodrigo L; Lévy, Nicolas; Smith, James C; de Magalhães, João Pedro; Ori, Alessandro; Bernardo, Andreia; De Sandre-Giovannoli, Annachiara; Nissan, Xavier; Rosell, Anna; Ferreira, Lino",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17901-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807790/,762
134543,Clinical and oncological outcomes of single-incision vs. conventional laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer.,2019-12-19,"Histopathologic examination of lungs afflicted by chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) consistently show both mononuclear cell (MNC) inflammation and mesenchymal cell (MC) fibroproliferation. We hypothesize that interleukin 6 (IL-6) trans-signaling may be a critical mediator of MNC-MC crosstalk and necessary for the pathogenesis of CLAD. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained after the diagnosis of CLAD has approximately 2-fold higher IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) levels compared to matched pre-CLAD samples. Human BAL-derived MCs do not respond to treatment with IL-6 alone but have rapid and prolonged JAK2-mediated STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation when exposed to the combination of IL-6 and sIL-6R. STAT3 phosphorylation within MCs upregulates numerous genes causing increased invasion and fibrotic differentiation. MNC, a key source of both IL-6 and sIL-6R, produce minimal amounts of these proteins at baseline but significantly upregulate production when cocultured with MCs. Finally, the use of an IL-6 deficient recipient in a murine orthotopic transplant model of CLAD reduces allograft fibrosis by over 50%. Taken together these results support a mechanism where infiltrating MNCs are stimulated by resident MCs to release large quantities of IL-6 and sIL-6R which then feedback onto the MCs to increase invasion and fibrotic differentiation.","Wheeler, David S; Misumi, Keizo; Walker, Natalie M; Vittal, Ragini; Combs, Michael P; Aoki, Yoshiro; Braeuer, Russell R; Lama, Vibha N",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33249747/,762

METHODS We reviewed the medical records of 353 children who visited our emergency department with bronchiolitis. MMI was defined as the need for any of the following interventions during admission: supplementary oxygen, intravenous fluids, intravenous antibiotics or admission to the intensive care unit. RESULTS Altogether 19% of the 353 patients required a MMI and 3% had apnoea. The patients with apnoea were all under 2 months of age, and 90% had a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and 40% had been born prematurely. The risk of needing a MMI continued for up to 5 days after disease onset. A positive RSV test predicted a MMI with an odds ratio (OR) of 11.5 (95% CI 2.6-50.5), and a fever of over 38°C predicted a MMI with an OR of 3.5 (95% CI 1.4-8.8). Each 1% increase in the initial oxygen saturation value was associated with a decreased risk of MMI (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.8).

OBJECTIVE This study aims to examine the extent of health initiatives using social media that aimed to improve the health of Australian Aboriginal communities. METHODS A scoping review was conducted by systematically searching databases CINAHL Plus; PubMed; Scopus; Web of Science, and Ovid MEDLINE in June 2017 using the terms and their synonyms ""Aboriginal"" and ""Social media."" In addition, reference lists of included studies and the Indigenous HealthInfonet gray literature were searched. Key information about the social media intervention and its impacts on health were extracted and data synthesized using narrative summaries. RESULTS Five papers met inclusion criteria. All included studies were published in the past 5 years and involved urban, rural, and remote Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people aged 12-60 years. No studies reported objective impacts on health. Three papers found that social media provided greater space for sharing health messages in a 2-way exchange. The negative portrayal of Aboriginal people and negative health impacts of social media were described in 2 papers. CONCLUSIONS Social media may be a useful strategy to provide health messages and sharing of content among Aboriginal people, but objective impacts on health remain unknown.

135068,Combined endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery may be an alternative to bowel resection for the management of colon polyps not removable by standard colonoscopy.,2013,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an oncogenic retrovirus that is etiologically associated with adult T-cell leukemia. The HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), which is encoded by the minus strand of the provirus, is involved in both regulation of viral gene transcription and T-cell proliferation. We showed in this report that HBZ interacted with Smad2/3, and enhanced transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad transcriptional responses in a p300-dependent manner. The N-terminal LXXLL motif of HBZ was responsible for HBZ-mediated TGF-β signaling activation. In a serial immunoprecipitation assay, HBZ, Smad3, and p300 formed a ternary complex, and the association between Smad3 and p300 was markedly enhanced in the presence of HBZ. In addition, HBZ could overcome the repression of the TGF-β response by Tax. Finally, HBZ expression resulted in enhanced transcription of Pdgfb, Sox4, Ctgf, Foxp3, Runx1, and Tsc22d1 genes and suppression of the Id2 gene; such effects were similar to those by TGF-β. In particular, HBZ induced Foxp3 expression in naive T cells through Smad3-dependent TGF-β signaling. Our results suggest that HBZ, by enhancing TGF-β signaling and Foxp3 expression, enables HTLV-1 to convert infected T cells into regulatory T cells, which is thought to be a critical strategy for virus persistence.","Zhao, Tiejun; Satou, Yorifumi; Sugata, Kenji; Miyazato, Paola; Green, Patrick L; Imamura, Takeshi; Matsuoka, Masao",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2010-12-326199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21705495/,762
135161,A simulator-based resident curriculum for laparoscopic common bile duct exploration.,2014,"BACKGROUND Crossed fused renal ectopia (CFRE) is a rare congenital malformation. Renal bladder ultrasound (RBUS) is a good tool for establishing the diagnosis, however, additional imaging with a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA) might be required. We assessed the need for postnatal evaluation and the long-term consequences in patients with this diagnosis. METHODS A retrospective review of the records of all patients diagnosed with CFRE between 2004 and 2014 was done. We included all patients who underwent postnatal evaluation with RBUS, DMSA and VCUG. Long-term radiological and functional outcomes were assessed. RESULTS A total of 29 patients with CFRE were identified. Majority of cases were detected antenatally (79%) and left to right crossed ectopia constituted the majority of cases (65%). RBUS revealed associated hydronephrosis (HN) in 11 patients (38%). DMSA scans confirmed the diagnosis in all patients and showed impaired renal function in 10 ectopic kidneys (34%). Vesicoureteral reflux was detected in 12 patients (41%); one third of them needed surgical intervention. Extra-urinary anomalies were present in 14 patients (48%) mainly of cardiac origin. After a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, 4 patients (14%) with extra-urinary anomalies developed chronic kidney disease and two of them died. CONCLUSIONS Crossed fused renal ectopia is commonly associated with both urinary and extraurinary malformations. Postnatal RBUS is usually sufficient for diagnosis, however, additional imaging may aid for confirming the diagnosis and detection of associated urinary anomalies. Presence of extra-urinary malformations with crossed fused ectopia carries a higher risk of morbidity. TYPE OF THE STUDY Retrospective study [diagnostic/prognostic study].

135290,Comparison of Single Port Access Versus Multiple Port Access Systems in Elective Laparoscopy: 98 Dogs (2005-2014).,2015,"BACKGROUND Adding to the ergonomic inconveniences already presented by traditional laparoscopy (LAP), laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery has been found to entail other more specific problems, including greater reduction in movement freedom, in-line vision with loss of triangulation, and greater proximity of instruments. The objective of this study was to evaluate surgeons' ergonomy during LESS surgery, through the study of muscular activity, wrist angle, and hand movements, and compare it with conventional laparoscopy. METHODS The study group was composed by 14 experienced laparoscopic surgeons, all right-handed. Each one performed dissection tasks on a physical simulator through LAP and LESS approaches. For LAP, straight laparoscopic scissors and dissector were used, whilst for LESS articulating tip scissors and dissector were chosen. During both tasks, muscular activity of biceps brachii, triceps brachii, forearm flexors and extensors, and trapezius muscles was registered through surface electromyography. Simultaneously right-hand movements and wrist angles were obtained through a motion capture data glove (CyberGlove(®)), which allowed for the use of a modified RULA test applied to the recorded angles with subsequent establishment of risk levels for the wrist joint. RESULTS Muscular activity for trapezius (LAP 6.94 ± 4.12 vs. LESS 11.32 ± 4.68; p ≤ 0.05) and forearm extensor muscles (LAP 9.2 ± 2.45 vs. LESS 37.07 ≤ 16.05; p ≤ 0.001) was significantly lower in conventional laparoscopy compared with LESS approach. No statistical significance was obtained between the different sensors, except in 3 of the 11 analyzed CyberGlove(®) sensors. The modified RULA test showed a score of 3 for laparoscopy (unacceptable), whereas for LESS a score of 2 was obtained (acceptable), with statistically significant differences between them (p ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The LESS approach entails greater level of muscular activity in the trapezius and forearm extensor muscles, but we have found evidences of a better wrist position during LESS compared with traditional laparoscopy.","Pérez-Duarte, F J; Lucas-Hernández, M; Matos-Azevedo, A; Sánchez-Margallo, J A; Díaz-Güemes, I; Sánchez-Margallo, F M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3334-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24337915/,762
135312,Single incision laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for colon cancer: less is more?,2011,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE To study the safety and outcome profiles of tunnelled dialysis catheter (TDC) insertions and exchanges with fluoroscopy versus without fluoroscopy. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of all TDC insertions or exchanges performed at our centre, between January 2017 and December 2017. Patient demographics, laboratory results and catheter placement information were obtained from electronic records. Immediate technical success, early and late catheter associated complications were collected. Outcomes for TDC inserted with or without fluoroscopy were statistically analysed. RESULTS A total of 351 TDC insertions and 253 TDC exchanges were performed. Out of 351 TDC insertions, 261 were done with fluoroscopy while 90 were done without. Out of 253 TDC exchanges, 219 were done with fluoroscopy while 34 were done without. For both TDC insertions and exchanges, there were no significant differences in complication rates when done with or without fluoroscopy. Mean duration of catheter patency was longer for TDC inserted without fluoroscopy, after adjusting for site of insertion and presence of previous TDC. CONCLUSIONS The technique of inserting TDC in the right internal jugular vein (IJV) without fluoroscopy is a safe and effective method in selected patients. This supports the practice of performing the procedure without fluoroscopy, especially in institutions where fluoroscopy facilities are not readily available. This potentially translates into reduced healthcare resources and hospitalisation days, which is particularly valuable in times of limited resources such as the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Chang, Zi Yun; Wong, Weng Kin; Chan, Yiong Huak; Khan, Behram A; Leo, Christopher Ch",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/11297298211000872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33706601/,762

OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of preoperative and postoperative AUD, and independent predictors of postoperative AUD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective cohort study (Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2) of adults who underwent bariatric surgery at 10 US hospitals. Of 2458 participants, 1945 (78.8% female; 87.0% white; median age, 47 years; median body mass index, 45.8) completed preoperative and postoperative (at 1 year and/or 2 years) assessments between 2006 and 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Past year AUD symptoms determined with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (indication of alcohol-related harm, alcohol dependence symptoms, or score ≥8). RESULTS The prevalence of AUD symptoms did not significantly differ from 1 year before to 1 year after bariatric surgery (7.6% vs 7.3%; P = .98), but was significantly higher in the second postoperative year (9.6%; P = .01). The following preoperative variables were independently related to an increased odds of AUD after bariatric surgery: male sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.14 [95% CI, 1.51-3.01]; P < .001), younger age (age per 10 years younger with preoperative AUD: AOR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.68], P = .03; age per 10 years younger without preoperative AUD: AOR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.65-2.30], P < .001), smoking (AOR, 2.58 [95% CI, 1.19-5.58]; P = .02), regular alcohol consumption (≥ 2 drinks/week: AOR, 6.37 [95% CI, 4.17-9.72]; P < .001), AUD (eg, at age 45, AOR, 11.14 [95% CI, 7.71-16.10]; P < .001), recreational drug use (AOR, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.37-4.14]; P = .01), lower sense of belonging (12-item Interpersonal Support Evaluation List score per 1 point lower: AOR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.15]; P = .01), and undergoing a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure (AOR, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.40-3.08]; P < .001; reference category: laparoscopic adjustable gastric band procedure). CONCLUSION In this cohort, the prevalence of AUD was greater in the second postoperative year than the year prior to surgery or in the first postoperative year and was associated with male sex and younger age, numerous preoperative variables (smoking, regular alcohol consumption, AUD, recreational drug use, and lower interpersonal support) and undergoing a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure.","King, Wendy C; Chen, Jia-Yuh; Mitchell, James E; Kalarchian, Melissa A; Steffen, Kristine J; Engel, Scott G; Courcoulas, Anita P; Pories, Walter J; Yanovski, Susan Z",JAMA,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2012.6147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22710289/,762

Using an orthopaedic elective surgery model, we aimed to answer the following: (1) What is the expected recovery time until the health-care system is back to nearly full capacity for performing elective surgery? (2) What will be the expected backlog of elective surgery over time? (3) How should health care change to address the backlog? METHODS A Monte Carlo stochastic simulation-based analysis was performed to forecast the post-pandemic volume of elective, inpatient total joint arthroplasty and spinal fusion surgical cases. The cumulative backlog was calculated and analyzed. We tested model assumptions with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS Assuming that elective orthopaedic surgery resumes in June 2020, it will take 7, 12, and 16 months-in optimistic, ambivalent, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively-until the health-care system can perform 90% of the expected pre-pandemic forecasted volume of surgery. In the optimistic scenario, there will be a cumulative backlog of >1 million surgical cases at 2 years after the end of elective-surgery deferment. CONCLUSIONS The deferment of elective surgical cases during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will have a lasting impact on the United States health-care system.

Herein we describe the relationship between the demographics, clinical characteristics, and molecular investigations and the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibodies. METHODS Three hundred and four participants, living in Gauteng, South Africa, were screened for COVID-19 antibodies between September 12, and December 12, 2020. Indications for serological testing included previous infection (n = 45, 14.80%), World Health Organization (WHO) symptoms (n = 122, 40.13%), positive household contact (n = 40, 13.16%), and/or positive close non-household contact (n = 80, 26.32%). RESULTS There were 58 (19.08%) positive rapid antibody tests. Risk factors associated with a positive rapid antibody test included WHO symptoms, namely fever/chills (odds ratio [OR] 3.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50 to 8.19), loss of taste or smell (OR 8.66, 95% CI 3.27 to 22.94), and the presence of a household contact (OR 3.66, 95% CI 1.59 to 8.40).

HYPOTHESIS PVCs may increase the adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes in pregnant women. METHODS Six thousand one hundred and forty-eight pregnant women were prospectively enrolled in our center between 2017 and 2019 in the study. The average PVC burden was determined by calculating the number of PVCs in total beats. Those who had a PVC burden >0.5% were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of adverse fetal or neonatal events. The adverse outcomes were compared between the groups to assess the impact of PVCs on pregnancy. RESULTS A total of 103 (1.68%) women with a PVC burden >0.5% were recorded. Among them, 17 adverse events (12 cases) were documented, which was significantly higher than that among women without PVCs (11.65% vs. 2.93%, p < .01). The median PVC burden among pregnant women with PVCs was 2.84% (1.02%-6.1%). Furthermore, compared with that of the women without adverse events, the median PVC burden of women with adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes was significantly higher (9.02% vs. 2.30%, p < .01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that not the LVEF, heart rate and bigeminy, but only the PVC burden was associated with adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with PVCs (OR: 1.34, 95% CI [1.11-1.61], p < .01).

Independent of its anticoagulant effects, antithrombin III (AT-III) has been shown to block neurovascular inflammation after severe TBI, reduce cerebral endothelial-leukocyte interactions and decrease blood brain barrier permeability. We hypothesized that AT-III administration after TBI would improve post-TBI cognitive recovery, specifically enhancing learning, and memory. METHODS Fifteen CD1 male mice were randomized to undergo severe TBI (controlled cortical impact, CCI: 6 m/sec velocity, 1 mm depth, 3 mm diameter) or sham craniotomy (SHAM) and received either intravenous AT-III (250 IU/kg) or vehicle (VEH:saline) 15 minutes and 24 hours post-TBI. Animals underwent Morris water maze testing from 6-14 days post-injury consisting of cued learning trials (platform visible), spatial learning trials (platform invisible, spatial cues present), and probe (memory) trials (platform removed, spatial cues present). Intergroup differences were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05). RESULTS Morris water maze testing demonstrated that cumulative cued learning (overall mean time in seconds to reach the platform on days 6-8) was worst in CCI+VEH animals (26.1 ± 2.4s) compared to CCI+ATIII counterparts (20.3 ± 2.1s, p<0.01). Cumulative non-cued spatial learning was also worst in the CCI+VEH group (23.4 ± 1.8s) but improved with AT-III (17.6 ± 1.5s, p<0.01. In probe trials, AT-III failed to significantly improve memory ability. SHAM animals demonstrated preserved learning and memory compared to all CCI counterparts (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS AT-III improves neurocognitive recovery weeks after TBI. This improvement is particularly related to improvement in learning but not memory function.

136550,Analysis of the Risk Factors for Hypotension in Laparoscopic Hiatal Hernia Repair.,2021,"BACKGROUND Malakoplakia is an uncommon, tumor-like inflammatory disease characterized by impaired histiocytes that are unable to completely digest phagocytized bacteria. The genitourinary tract is the most common site of involvement, however, cases have also been described in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that it is the second most common site of involvement. This study investigates the clinical and histologic features of malakoplakia in the gastrointestinal tract. CASE PRESENTATION For 23 gastrointestinal specimens (biopsies and resections) from patients with a pathologic diagnosis of malakoplakia, we recorded the gender, age, location, primary diagnosis, endoscopic or surgical indication, endoscopic/gross impression and immune status (immunocompromised vs. immunocompetent). CONCLUSION Malakoplakia occurred throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract with most of the cases located in the sigmoid colon and rectum (n = 10); other sites included the transverse and descending colon (n = 4), stomach/gastroesophageal junction (n = 4), appendix (n = 2), cecum (n = 1), small bowel (n = 1), and the peri-anal area (n = 1). Endoscopically, these lesions most commonly appeared as polyps (n = 10) or masses (n = 5), other clinical endoscopic impressions varied from a thickened area/fibrosis to mucosal erythema. Most patients were immunocompromised due to a disease state (e.g. organ transplantation, cancer diagnosis, autoimmune condition) and/or medication effect. Eight patients with malakoplakia were on immunosuppressive medications (8/23, 35%). Common immunosuppressed disease states included cancer (n = 9), autoimmune disease (n = 5), status post organ transplantation (n = 4), diabetes (n = 5), infection/sepsis (n = 3), and HIV/AIDS (n = 1). Some patients had multiple co-morbidities (i.e. diabetes and organ transplant). Twenty-one patients with malakoplakia were in an immunosuppressive state (21/23, 91%).","Lee, Michael; Ko, Huaibin Mabel; Rubino, Anthony; Lee, Hwajeong; Gill, Ryan; Lagana, Stephen M",Diagnostic pathology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13000-020-01013-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709245/,762

Major US news media provided information to the public about social distancing after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, potentially spurring this preventative health practice. Using data from a representative sample of US residents, this study aims to understand the relationship between news media attention and social-distancing behavior via three potential mediators: perceived effectiveness of social distancing, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, and perceived negative consequences of infection. Media trust and social norms concerning social distancing were included as potential moderators of these relationships, along with political ideology. With multiple regression and mediation analyses, we found that news media attention was positively associated with social-distancing behavior during this period. Perceived effectiveness of social distancing mediated this relationship, while perceived susceptibility and negative consequences of COVID-19 did not. Notably, media trust negatively moderated news attention's impact on the perceived effectiveness of social distancing, with the relationship being more pronounced among those who have lower trust in media. Political ideology did not moderate the relationship between news attention and perceived effectiveness. Further, social norms negatively moderated the relationship between perceived effectiveness and social-distancing behavior, with this relationship growing stronger among those uncertain about the adoption of social-distancing norms in their circle. Overall, the study found news media to have an important role in promoting social-distancing behavior when they emphasized safety measures across the ideological spectrum.","Jiang, Xiaoya; Hwang, Juwon; Shah, Dhavan V; Ghosh, Shreenita; Brauer, Markus",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1868064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33438450/,762

136722,Optimal Timing for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy After Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography: A Systematic Review.,2018,"BACKGROUND Alvimopan, a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist, was recently approved for the reduction of postoperative ileus after open colectomy. No data are available regarding the use of alvimopan following laparoscopic segmental colectomy. OBJECTIVE This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of alvimopan in patients undergoing laparoscopic segmental colectomy. DESIGN A retrospective review of segmental laparoscopic colectomy was conducted in a population of patients using an accelerated postcolectomy care pathway. Patients that received alvimopan were identified from an institutional review board-approved database and matched with nonalvimopan patients for age, sex, procedure, and diagnosis. Patients with a diverting ileostomy or with contraindications for alvimopam were excluded. RESULTS One hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy received alvimopan perioperatively and were matched with a similar group of nonalvimopan patients. Although patients on alvimopan were significantly less likely to develop postoperative ileus (4% vs 12%; P = .04), there was no difference in length of hospital stay (3.63 days in the alvimopan group vs 3.78 in the nonalvimopan group; P = .84) or 30-day readmission rate (4.0% vs 4.2%; P = .95). CONCLUSIONS As the cost of providing health care continues to increase, reductions in perioperative complications and hospital stay are important to hospital efficiency and patient care. Alvimopan effectively reduces the incidence of postoperative ileus in patients undergoing open colectomy; however, hospital stay and readmission rates were not altered in this laparoscopic group. Further study is required before alvimopan can be routinely used in patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy.","Obokhare, Izi D; Champagne, Bradley; Stein, Sharon L; Krpata, David; Delaney, Conor P",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e318217ed17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21552060/,762

We investigated the tolerability and safety of S-1 and oxaliplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III gastric cancer. METHODS Japanese patients with stage III gastric cancer who had undergone D2 or more extensive lymphadenectomy were enrolled. In the first cycle, S-1 (40-60 mg/m2 twice daily) alone was given orally for 2 weeks of a 3-week cycle. From the second cycle, S-1 was administered as in the first cycle and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m2) was infused intravenously on day 1. Treatment was continued for 8 cycles. The primary end point was the treatment completion rate for eight cycles. RESULTS Sixty-three patients were enrolled and 62 patients were included in analysis. The treatment completion rate was 74.2 %, which was higher than the expected completion rate of 72.0 %. The median relative dose intensities were 77.1 % for S-1 and 72.6 % for oxaliplatin, with 41.9 and 61.7 % patients requiring dose reduction of S-1 and oxaliplatin, respectively. Neutropenia was the only grade 3 or higher adverse event with an incidence 10 % or greater (32.3 %). There was no grade 3 or higher peripheral sensory neuropathy or treatment-related death. CONCLUSIONS S-1 and oxaliplatin therapy is suggested to be manageable and safe with optimal dose reduction and delay in selected patients for stage III gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy, and warrants further evaluation in larger studies.","Shitara, Kohei; Chin, Keisho; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Katai, Hitoshi; Terashima, Masanori; Ito, Seiji; Hirao, Motohiro; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Oki, Eiji; Sasako, Mitsuru; Emi, Yasunori; Tsujinaka, Toshimasa",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-015-0581-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26626800/,762

137632,A novel liver retractor for reduced or single-port laparoscopic surgery.,2014,"Recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a pandemic of COVID-19. The absence of a therapeutic drug and vaccine is causing severe loss of life and economy worldwide. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming for viral entry into host cells. A potential way to reduce the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be to inhibit the activity of TMPRSS2. In the current study, the three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was generated by homology modelling and subsequently validated with a number of parameters. The structure-based virtual screening of Selleckchem database was performed through 'Virtual Work Flow' (VSW) to find out potential lead-like TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Camostat and bromhexine are known TMPRSS2 inhibitor drugs, hence these were used as control molecules throughout the study. Based on better dock score, binding-free energy and binding interactions compared to the control molecules, six molecules (Neohesperidin, Myricitrin, Quercitrin, Naringin, Icariin, and Ambroxol) were found to be promising against the TMPRSS2. Binding interactions analysis revealed a number of significant binding interactions with binding site amino residues of TMPRSS2. The all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study indicated that all proposed molecules retain inside the receptor in dynamic states. The binding energy calculated from the MD simulation trajectories also favour the strong affinity of the molecules towards the TMPRSS2. Proposed molecules belong to the bioflavonoid class of phytochemicals and are reported to possess antiviral activity, our study indicates their possible potential for application in COVID-19.

137647,Randomized clinical trial of self-gripping mesh versus sutured mesh for Lichtenstein hernia repair.,2013,"OBJECTIVES To assess the incidence of acute adverse events (AAEs) in gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. METHODS Gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)-enhanced CMR data from the multinational, multicenter European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology MRCT Registry was included. AAE severity was classified according to the American College of Radiology Manual on Contrast Media (mild, moderate, severe). Multivariable generalized linear mixed effect models were used to assess the likelihood of AAEs in various GBCA, adjusting for pharmacological stressor, main indications (i.e., suspected or known coronary artery disease or myocarditis), age, sex, and submitting center as a random effect. RESULTS In the study population of 72,839 GBCA-enhanced CMRs, a total of 260 AAEs were reported (0.36%), with a minority of severe AAEs (n = 24, 0.033%). Allergic-like AAEs were less likely than physiologic AAEs (29% versus 71%). Patients without pharmacological stress imaging had a lower AAE rate (0.22%) compared to stress imaging (0.75%), with the highest AAE rates for regadenoson (2.95%). AAE rates also varied by GBCA subtype (overall p < 0.001). There was significant interaction between GBCA and pharmacological stressor (interaction p = 0.025), with AAE rates ranging between 0 and 10% for certain GBCA/stressor combinations. There was further marginal evidence that higher GBCA volume was associated with higher AAE incidence (OR = 1.02, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION GBCA-enhanced CMR imaging demonstrates low AAE rates comparable to those of other body regions. AAE likelihood correlates with GBCA subtype, pharmacological stressor, and imaging indication. Intravenous fluid administration in patients with cardiac impairment might contribute to these findings. KEY POINTS • Acute adverse event rates in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are low (0.36%), especially for severe adverse events (0.033%). • Mild and moderate adverse events are more frequent during stress CMR imaging. • Physiologic AAEs are more common than allergic AAEs in CMR imaging.","Uhlig, Johannes; Lücke, Christian; Vliegenthart, Rozemarijn; Loewe, Christian; Grothoff, Matthias; Schuster, Andreas; Lurz, Philipp; Jacquier, Alexis; Francone, Marco; Zapf, Antonia; Schülke, Christoph; May, Matthias Stefan; Bremerich, Jens; Lotz, Joachim; Gutberlet, Matthias",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-019-06171-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041566/,762

On clinical examination, he had tachycardia and hypotension needing intravenous fluid resuscitation and inotropic support. A chest radiograph revealed streaky lung opacities, and he was treated with antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia complicated by septic shock. Significant elevation of cardiac enzymes was noted, and there was a continued need for inotropes to maintain normotension. He also developed intermittent bradycardia, with serial electrocardiograms showing first-degree atrioventricular block, low-voltage QRS complexes, and ST-T wave changes and telemetry demonstrating junctional and ventricular escape rhythm. A complete workup for sepsis and acute myocarditis were performed to find the etiologic agent. Intravenous immunoglobulins were started to treat myocarditis, with eventual clinical improvement. He was eventually diagnosed with an unusual etiology for his illness. He was noted to still have intermittent ventricular escape rhythm on electrocardiograms on follow-up 2 weeks after discharge but continues to remain asymptomatic and in good health.","Umapathi, Krishna Kishore; Schmidt, Henry; Salazar, Natalia; Sosnowski, Cyndi; Wilkerson, Marylouise Kiyana; Logan, Latania K",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-017624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33850027/,762

Although initial recommendations for implementation exist, as states and hospitals have moved forward with implementation of screening, new challenges and areas for additional focus have been identified. The objective of this study was to develop recommendations to address current challenges and areas of focus surrounding CCHD newborn screening. METHODS A workgroup of experts and stakeholders was convened in Washington, District of Columbia, for a 1-day meeting in February 2012. At the beginning of the meeting, the stakeholders held a brainstorming session to identify areas of main priority based on their experience. After this, stakeholders broke into small groups to refine recommendations, which were then finalized by consensus. RESULTS Recommendations to address selection of screening equipment, standards for reporting of screening outcomes to stakeholders, training of health care providers and educating families, future research priorities, payment for screening, follow-up diagnostic testing, and public health oversight, and advocacy to facilitate effective and comprehensive screening were proposed. Suggestions for future work were developed. CONCLUSIONS Screening for CCHD presents novel challenges and opportunities; however, addressing these will strengthen newborn screening and newborn care networks, and ultimately improve health outcomes.","Martin, Gerard R; Beekman, Robert H; Mikula, Elizabeth Bradshaw; Fasules, James; Garg, Lorraine F; Kemper, Alex R; Morrow, W Robert; Pearson, Gail D; Mahle, William T",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-3926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23776113/,762
137869,Single incision laparoscopic surgery for appendicectomy: a retrospective comparative analysis.,2010,"Originally composed of the single family Chlamydiaceae, the Chlamydiales order has extended considerably over the last several decades. Chlamydia-related bacteria were added and classified into six different families and family-level lineages: the Criblamydiaceae, Parachlamydiaceae, Piscichlamydiaceae, Rhabdochlamydiaceae, Simkaniaceae, and Waddliaceae. While several members of the Chlamydiaceae family are known pathogens, recent studies showed diverse associations of Chlamydia-related bacteria with human and animal infections. Some of these latter bacteria might be of medical importance since, given their ability to replicate in free-living amoebae, they may also replicate efficiently in other phagocytic cells, including cells of the innate immune system. Thus, a new Chlamydiales-specific real-time PCR targeting the conserved 16S rRNA gene was developed. This new molecular tool can detect at least five DNA copies and show very high specificity without cross-amplification from other bacterial clade DNA. The new PCR was validated with 128 clinical samples positive or negative for Chlamydia trachomatis or C. pneumoniae. Of 65 positive samples, 61 (93.8%) were found to be positive with the new PCR. The four discordant samples, retested with the original test, were determined to be negative or below detection limits. Then, the new PCR was applied to 422 nasopharyngeal swabs taken from children with or without pneumonia; a total of 48 (11.4%) samples were determined to be positive, and 45 of these were successfully sequenced. The majority of the sequences corresponded to Chlamydia-related bacteria and especially to members of the Parachlamydiaceae family.","Lienard, Julia; Croxatto, Antony; Aeby, Sebastien; Jaton, Katia; Posfay-Barbe, Klara; Gervaix, Alain; Greub, Gilbert",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00114-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21562107/,762

Among various types of pneumonitis from different kinds of cancer treatments, immune-checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (ICI pneumonitis) has been recognized as an important topic in the radiology and oncology communities in the past few years, given increasing clinical indications for ICI therapy in patients with cancer. Moreover, clinical applications of ICI continue to advance rapidly with novel combination approaches, leading to further emerging challenges. This focused review describes the current knowledge of ICI pneumonitis and discusses several newly emerging issues involving recurrence and flare of ICI pneumonitis, as well as involving pneumonitis from new combination approaches including ICI with EGFR inhibitors and ICI with radiotherapy. The article concludes with a summary of unmet needs in the care of patients with ICI pneumonitis, as well as of future directions in the advancement of knowledge and patient care for ICI pneumonitis. Given the demonstrated multifaceted value of imaging in ICI pneumonitis, radiologists will remain central in the ongoing multidisciplinary journey to further understand and overcome this challenging toxicity for patients with cancer.","Nishino, Mizuki",AJR.

138381,Single-incision vs straight laparoscopic segmental colectomy: a case-controlled study.,2011,"In watersheds located in semi-arid regions, vegetation dynamics, evapotranspiration (ET), and associated water and energy balances collectively play a major role in controlling hydrological regimes and crop yield. As such, it is challenging to predict the complex hydrological processes and biophysical dynamics. This challenge increases in areas with limited data availability. The key objective of this study was to evaluate the direct integration of remotely sensed Leaf Area Index (LAI) data into a hydrological model to improve streamflow, ET, and crop yield estimates. We also demonstrated how an improved model integrated with remotely sensed LAI data can inform water managers by predicting water productivity (WP) under different irrigation schemes. We took agricultural-dominated San Joaquin Watershed in California, United States, as our testbed and integrated the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m resolution 4-day total LAI data into the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. Results showed that, compared to conventional SWAT model that relies on semi-empirical equations and user inputs for simulating biophysical processes, direct LAI integration into SWAT model (SWAT-LAI) notably captured the actual vegetation dynamics and improved ET and crop yield estimations. The WP simulated by the improved SWAT-LAI model for almond and grape yields varied within a range from 0.363 to 3.81 kg/m3 and 0.32 to 4.76 kg/m3 across different irrigation applications. The outcomes of this study showed that deficit irrigation application could be a viable option in water stressed regions, since it can save a substantial amount of irrigation water and maintain the higher water productivity required for both almond and grape yield production. This study shows an evidence of how remotely sensed data integrated into hydrological models can serve as a decision support tool by providing quantitative information on crop water use and crop production.","Paul, Manashi; Rajib, Adnan; Negahban-Azar, Masoud; Shirmohammadi, Adel; Srivastava, Puneet",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118663/,762
138426,Modified frozen elephant trunk for acute type A aortic dissection: a comparative study with standard repair technique.,2017,"OBJECTIVE In October 2020, the Polish Constitutional Tribunal (CT) ruled that in cases where there are indications of irreversible impairments of a foetus or incurable life-threatening diseases, abortions violate the Polish Constitution. Despite the fact that it was issued during the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Poland, this judgement caused numerous protests. The current study sought to ascertain Poles' opinions regarding the CT's judgement, and the ensuing threat to public health presented by the protests against it. MATERIAL AND METHODS An online survey was conducted on a quota sample of adult Poles (N = 1072). The sample reflected the population structure of Poland. RESULTS Only 15.5% of the people surveyed agreed that the CT's judgement was correct. Logistic regression analysis showed that support for the CT's ruling could be predicted by male gender, more frequent participation in religious practices, and the presence of a greater number of children in household. The majority of people (65.1%) considered protests to be necessary despite the ongoing pandemic. Cluster analysis distinguished between two groups of people, which were labelled ""moderate liberals"" (43.9%) and ""moderate conservatives"" (56.1%). There were no extreme groups - neither one that supported the CT's judgement and condemned the protesters, nor one that supported protesters unconditionally and disagreed with the judgement. CONCLUSIONS Undoubtedly, there is no consensus among Poles on the issue of abortion, but the CT's judgement, resulted in a high level of agreement between people with different views.","Makowska, Marta; Boguszewski, Rafał; Sacharczuk, Katarzyna",The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception,https://doi.org/10.1080/13625187.2021.1980872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34590965/,762
138431,Single incision laparoscopic TAPP with standard laparoscopic instruments and suturing of flaps: A continuing study.,2015,"Background Psoriatic disease (PsD) is a complex systemic disorder with cutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations. Current evidence on pharmacological interventions, effective across the spectrum of clinical manifestations of early, systemic treatment-naïve PsD, is limited. This review aims to appraise such evidence. Methods This systematic review examined seven patient-intervention-comparator-outcome research questions to address the efficacy of the interventions on the following: across the spectrum of clinical manifestations PsD activity; peripheral arthritis; dactylitis; spondylitis; enthesitis; skin; and nails. Early PsD was defined as a disease duration of ≤2 years, except for studies investigating outcomes restricted to the skin. Eligible references were clinical trials or well-designed prospective studies/series reporting on adult humans, untreated, with cutaneous and/or musculoskeletal features of PsD. Results Nine references (out of 160 319, publication range 1946-2019) fulfilled the eligibility criteria. No study adopted comprehensive (that is, simultaneous assessment of different PsD manifestations) composite indices as primary outcome measures. Individual studies reported that apremilast and biologics successfully improved outcomes (disease activity index for PsA, minimal disease activity, PsA DAS, psoriasis area and severity index, PsA response criteria) when efficacy analyses were restricted to single manifestations of untreated PsD. Only qualitative synthesis of evidence was possible, owing to the following factors: data heterogeneity (disease classification criteria, outcome measures); unavailable data subsets (focused on early, untreated PsD) at the single study level; and insufficient data on the exposure of participants to previous treatment. Conclusion Effective interventions, albeit limited in scope, were found for early, treatment-naïve PsD. No study provided evidence about the management of co-occurring cutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations in early, treatment-naïve PsD.

Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the long Solitaire 4 × 40 mm stent retriever for large vessel occlusion in stroke patients. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients treated for acute ischemic large vessel occlusion stroke with the Solitaire 2 FR 4 × 40 device between May and October 2016 at our institution. Patient-specific data at baseline and at discharge were documented. Reperfusion was graded with the thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) classification. Postinterventional angiograms and follow-up cross-sectional imaging were used to evaluate complications. RESULTS TICI 2b/3 recanalization was achieved in 20 of 23 patients (87.0%), in 17 patients with the first retriever pass. NIHSS improved from a mean score at presentation of 16 (range 4-36) to 11 (range 0-41) at discharge. Mean mRS score at discharge was 3 (range 0-6) and 3 (range 0-6) at 90 days post-treatment. No infarcts in other territories were observed. One patient showed a (reversible) vasospasm in the postinterventional angiogram and another a small contrast extravasation in follow-up imaging. CONCLUSION The Solitaire 2 FR 4 × 40 stent retriever is a safe and efficient device for large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke with a high recanalization rate and a low peri- and postinterventional complication rate together with a good clinical outcome. Despite potentially higher friction and shearing forces, no increased incidence of visible damage to the vessel wall was observed.","Zibold, Felix; Mordasini, Pasquale; Mosimann, Pascal; Piechowiak, Eike; Dobrocky, Tomas; Fischer, Urs; Arnold, Marcel; Bellwald, Sebastian; Gralla, Jan",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-017-1785-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864867/,762

PURPOSE To characterize intra- and inter-operator and inter-device reliability of intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements with rebound tonometry ([RT], ic100, iCare USA, Inc, Raleigh, NC). METHODS Three prospective cross-sectional studies were conducted in distinct sample of adult patients with established glaucoma, suspected glaucoma, or no glaucoma at the West Virginia University Eye Institute. Participants in study 1 underwent 5 RT measurements in one randomly-selected eye and 5 Goldmann tonometry measurements in the fellow eye by one operator; intra-operator variability was compared using the F test. In study 2, 3 operators each obtained 3 RT measurements in participants in randomized operator order. In study 3, a single operator collected 3 measurements each with 3 RTs in randomized device order. Between-operator and -device reproducibility were characterized using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS Overall, 28, 19, and 25 subjects participated in the three respective studies. Within-subject variance across subjects was 0.757 in RT measurements and 2.471 in Goldmann measurements (P=0.0035). Inter-operator reproducibility of RT measurements was good in both eyes (ICC for right eyes 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.85; ICC for left eyes 0.75, 95% CI 0.50-0.83). Inter-device reproducibility of RT measurements was good approaching excellent (ICC for right eyes 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.90; ICC for left eyes 0.89, 95% CI 0.86-0.91). CONCLUSIONS The RT's lower measurement variability and good inter-operator and -device reproducibility suggest that it can characterize IOP changes over time more robustly than Goldmann tonometry, aiding clinicians in assessing the effectiveness of glaucoma therapy and the consistency of IOP control.","Realini, Tony; McMillan, Brian; Gross, Ronald L; Devience, Eva; Balasubramani, Goundappa K",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34049350/,762

The proportion of patients achieving fistula closure varied widely between studies for non-Crohn's, ranging from 0.2 (95% CI 0.04-0.48) to 0.86 (95% CI 0.64-0.97). The pooled proportion of patients achieving fistula closure in patients with non-Crohn's fistula-in-ano was 0.54 (95% CI 0.50-0.59). The proportion achieving closure in patients with Crohn's disease was similar (0.55, 95% CI 0.39-0.70). LIMITATIONS This study was limited by the variability of operative technique and perioperative care between studies. CONCLUSIONS Fistula closure is achieved by using the anal fistula plug in approximately 54% of patients without Crohn's disease. The anal fistula plug has not been adequately evaluated in the Crohn's population.","O'Riordan, J M; Datta, I; Johnston, C; Baxter, N N",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0b013e318239d1e4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22469804/,762
139472,Laparoscopy-assisted vs. open total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer: long-term outcomes and technical aspects of a case-control study.,2013,"BACKGROUND Identifying predictors of success in postgraduate examinations can help guide the career choices of medical students and may aid early identification of trainees requiring extra support to progress in specialty training. We assessed whether performance on the educational performance measurement (EPM) and situational judgement test (SJT) used for selection into foundation training predicted success at the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) examination. METHODS This was a longitudinal, cohort study using data from the UK Medical Education Database (https://www.ukmed.ac.uk). UK medical graduates who had attempted Part A (n=2585) and Part B (n=755) of the MRCS between 2014 and 2017 were included. χ2 and independent t-tests were used to examine the relationship between medical school performance and sociodemographic factors with first-attempt success at MRCS Part A and B. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify independent predictors of MRCS performance. RESULTS The odds of passing MRCS increased by 55% for Part A (OR 1.55 (95% CI 1.48 to 1.61)) and 23% for Part B (1.23 (1.14 to 1.32)) for every additional EPM decile point gained. For every point awarded for additional degrees in the EPM, candidates were 20% more likely to pass MRCS Part A (1.20 (1.13 to 1.29)) and 17% more likely to pass Part B (1.17 (1.04 to 1.33)). For every point awarded for publications in the EPM, candidates were 14% more likely to pass MRCS Part A (1.14 (1.01 to 1.28)). SJT score was not a statistically significant independent predictor of MRCS success. CONCLUSION This study has demonstrated the EPM's independent predictive power and found that medical school performance deciles are the most significant measure of predicting later success in the MRCS. These findings can be used by medical schools, training boards and workforce planners to inform evidence-based and contemporary selection and assessment strategies.","Ellis, Ricky; Scrimgeour, Duncan S G; Brennan, Peter A; Lee, Amanda J; Cleland, Jennifer",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400449/,762
139579,A review of 130 humans enrolled in transgastric NOTES protocols at a single institution.,2011,"The chicken has a different repertoire of tissues, cells and genes of the immune response compared to mammals, yet generally survives infection with viral, bacterial, protozoal and fungal pathogens, and also worms and ectoparasites, just like mammals. Poultry are also probably the most heavily vaccinated group of farmed animals. Antigen presentation to the adaptive immune response therefore obviously normally occurs efficiently in birds. Although comparatively much is known about macrophages and B cells in the chicken, there is as yet little work on the other, professional, antigen-presenting cells, the dendritic cells (DC). Birds also have at least two other sets of phagocytic cells, heterophils and thrombocytes, which may also have the ability to present antigen. Here we review the current state of knowledge about antigen presenting cells in the chicken, concentrating mainly on recent advances in our knowledge of DC.","Wu, Zhiguang; Kaiser, Pete",Immunobiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2011.05.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21719145/,762
139593,Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy in geriatric patients.,2016,"Trained immunity (TI) is a de facto innate immune memory program induced in monocytes/macrophages by exposure to pathogens or vaccines, which evolved as protection against infections. TI is characterized by immunometabolic changes and histone post-translational modifications, which enhance production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. As aberrant activation of TI is implicated in inflammatory diseases, tight regulation is critical; however, the mechanisms responsible for this modulation remain elusive. Interleukin-37 (IL-37) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that curbs inflammation and modulates metabolic pathways. In this study, we show that administration of recombinant IL-37 abrogates the protective effects of TI in vivo, as revealed by reduced host pro-inflammatory responses and survival to disseminated candidiasis. Mechanistically, IL-37 reverses the immunometabolic changes and histone post-translational modifications characteristic of TI in monocytes, thus suppressing cytokine production in response to infection. IL-37 thereby emerges as an inhibitor of TI and as a potential therapeutic target in immune-mediated pathologies.","Cavalli, Giulio; Tengesdal, Isak W; Gresnigt, Mark; Nemkov, Travis; Arts, Rob J W; Domínguez-Andrés, Jorge; Molteni, Raffaella; Stefanoni, Davide; Cantoni, Eleonora; Cassina, Laura; Giugliano, Silvia; Schraa, Kiki; Mills, Taylor S; Pietras, Eric M; Eisenmensser, Elan Z; Dagna, Lorenzo; Boletta, Alessandra; D'Alessandro, Angelo; Joosten, Leo A B; Netea, Mihai G; Dinarello, Charles A",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.108955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826894/,762
139709,A Y-shaped vinyl hood that creates pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery (Y-hood method.): a new technique for laparoscopic low anterior resection.,2010,"Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and key intermediates in the synthesis of biologically important molecules, as well as energy sources, neurotransmitters, regulators of cellular metabolism, etc. The efficient recovery of amino acids from the primary filtrate is a well-conserved key role of the kidney proximal tubule. Additionally, renal metabolism participates in the whole body disposition of amino acids. Therefore, a wide array of axially heterogeneously expressed transporters is localized on both epithelial membranes. For transepithelial transport, luminal uptake, which is carried out mainly by active symporters, is coupled with a mostly passive basolateral efflux. Many transporters require partner proteins for appropriate localization, or to modulate transporter activity, and/or increase substrate supply. Interacting proteins include cell surface antigens (CD98), endoplasmic reticulum proteins (GTRAP3-18 or 41), or enzymes (ACE2 and aminopeptidase N). In the past two decades, the molecular identification of transporters has led to significant advances in our understanding of amino acid transport and aminoacidurias arising from defects in renal transport. Furthermore, the three-dimensional crystal structures of bacterial homologues have been used to yield new insights on the structure and function of mammalian transporters. Additionally, transgenic animal models have contributed to our understanding of the role of amino acid transporters in the kidney and other organs and/or at critical developmental stages. Progress in elucidation of the renal contribution to systemic amino acid homeostasis requires further integration of kinetic, regulatory, and expression data of amino acid transporters into our understanding of physiological regulatory networks controlling metabolism.","Makrides, Victoria; Camargo, Simone M R; Verrey, François",Comprehensive Physiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/cphy.c130028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692143/,762
139861,Use of the PleuralPort device for management of pleural effusion in six dogs and four cats.,2011,"BACKGROUND A pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 79 million people and killed exceeding 1.7 million people around the world by the end of 2020. METHOD We obtained the clinical data of all diagnosed patients and lung function test of followed-up patients in Fuyang, Anhui province to investigate laboratory predictors of severe COVID-19 and the impairment of lung function. RESULTS Of the 155 patients, 87(56.13%) were males. The mean age was 41.95 (SD 15.34) years. Only 30(19.35%) patients had critical condition. Fever (84.52%) were the most common symptoms, and short of breath was more common in severe patients (P<0.01). Lymphopenia was observed in most patients (74, 47.7%). It showed the elevation of CRP in 100 (64.5%) patients, the elevation of SAA or IL-6 in 104 (67.1%) patients. The calculated cut-off value of CRP was 19.35 mg/mL, the AUC was 0.777, sensitivity was 73.3%, specificity was 69.6%; SAA was 73.55 mg/L, 0.679, 83.3%, 56.8% respectively; IL-6 was 18.85 pg/mL, 0.797, 83.3%, 64.8%; D-Dimer was 0.325 mg/L, 0.673, 66.7% and 68.8%. The combination of CRP, SAA, IL-6 and D-Dimer was 0.823 in AUC, 73.3% in sensitivity and 78.4% in specificity. 12(42.86%) followed-up patients had completely normal lung function indicators. CONCLUSION Elevated CRP, SAA, IL-6 and D-Dimer can be predictors to severe COVID-19. The combination of these four indicators can improve the effectivity and specificity of assessing severe COVID-19. Most of the followed-up patients showed no abnormalities in lung function test. Abnormal lung function is mainly reflected in the diffusion function.","Pan, Min; Wang, Rui-Rui; Chen, Xu; Han, Jun; Li, Qiang; Miao, Manli; Rao, Jianguo; Huang, Jizheng; Yu, Long; Xu, Yufei; Li, Lingli; Shao, Qiang; Ma, Hengli; Han, Mingfeng; Fan, Xiaoyun",The clinical respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.13381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896114/,762

Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate the relationship of oxidative stress and antioxidant response with VOC in SCA. Methods A cross-sectional case-control study was carried out at University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH), Ituku-Ozalla, Enugu Nigeria involving 116 individuals which included 36 SCA subject, 40 sickle cell carriers (AS) and 40 healthy individuals (AA). Baseline information as well as the frequency of VOC was obtained from the participants and anaemia as well as oxidative stress and antioxidant indices were assessed in blood. Results Anaemia was prevalent (88.9 %) in SCA individuals compared to AS (52.5%) and AA (47.5 %) individuals. Nitric oxide scavenging (NOS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities as well as glutathione level were significantly (p<0.005) lower while catalase activity was higher in SCA individuals compared to controls (AA and AS). Higher malondialdehyde (MDA) level was associated with very severe VOC while low level of NOS activity was associated with severe VOC in SCA individuals. Conclusion Sickle cell anaemia exhibited oxidative stress and alteration in the levels of antioxidant indices which was possibly associated with vaso-occlusive crisis.","Engwa, Godwill Azeh; Okolie, Amanda; Chidili, John Paul Chinedu; Okore, Precious Amara; Onu, Paul Chigozie; Ugwu, Maryrose Onyinye; Oko, Daniella Ebeshe; Ferdinand, Paschaline U",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394292/,762
140070,Transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy using conventional instruments: the first two cases.,2010,"OBJECTIVE In patients undergoing midline incisions, the abdominal fascia can be closed with a continuous or interrupted suture using various materials. The aim of this study is to compare: (1) interrupted technique with rapidly absorbable sutures and (2) continuous techniques with different slowly absorbable sutures, focusing on the incidence of incisional hernias within 1 year. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA A meta-analysis suggested that the incidence of incisional hernias can be more effectively reduced with slowly absorbable continuous sutures. METHODS Multicenter randomized surgical trial with 3 parallel groups. Patients were scheduled for primary elective midline incisions. All surgeons were trained (4:1 suture wound length in continuous groups) and monitored. Primary end point, measured within 1 year after surgery, was the frequency of incisional hernias diagnosed by clinical examination and confirmed by ultrasound. Complications and safety were used as secondary end points. This study has been registered with the ISRCTN Register (INSECT: ISRCTN24023541). RESULTS Conducted on 625 randomized patients (210 interrupted Vicryl, 205 continuous polydioxanone suture (PDS), 210 continuous Monoplus), the primary analysis showed an incidence of 28 incisional hernias (15.9%) versus 15 (8.4%) versus 22 (12.5%) for the 3 closure techniques, respectively (P = 0.09). No significant difference was observed between the 3 groups with regard to burst abdomen (4 [2.0%] vs. 6 [3.0%] vs. 8 [4.0%], P = 0.46), wound infection (26 [12.7%] vs. 39 [19.4%] vs. 33 [16.3%], P = 0.19), pulmonary infections (9 [4.4%] vs. 5 [2.5%] vs. 5 [2.5%], P = 0.46), serious adverse events (63 [30.0%] vs. 57 [27.8%] vs. 61 [29.1%], P = 0.89), and 1-year mortality (16 [7.9%] vs. 11 [5.5%] vs. 16 [7.9%], P = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS The incidence of incisional hernias and the frequency of wound infection was higher than expected in all groups. New concepts need to be developed and studied to substantially reduce the frequency of incisional hernias.","Seiler, Christoph M; Bruckner, Thomas; Diener, Markus K; Papyan, Armine; Golcher, Henriette; Seidlmayer, Christoph; Franck, Annette; Kieser, Meinhard; Büchler, Markus W; Knaebel, Hanns-Peter",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e31819ec6c8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19300233/,762
140115,[Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for incarcerated incisional hernia: a new approach].,2010,"The viewpoints on the control of innate immune cells by the adaptive immune system during sepsis remain controversial. Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is essential to the negative control of innate immunity and suppresses the activation of macrophages by inhibiting activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The purpose of the current study was to observe inflammatory response and macrophage activation in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with endotoxemia and to determine the role of MKP-1 in the control of macrophage activation by the adaptive immune system. Endotoxemia was induced in wild-type and SCID mice by an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and all of the SCID mice died. SCID mice produced more inflammatory cytokines than BALB/c mice systemically and locally. TNF-α mRNA expression was higher and MKP-1 mRNA expression was lower in peritoneal macrophages (PMa) from SCID mice compared to PMa from wild-type mice after and even before LPS injection. Thioglycollate-stimulated PMa from wild-type mice were stimulated with LPS in vitro in the presence or absence of pan-T cells. The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were higher in the supernatants from PMa cultured alone compared to PMa co-cultured with pan-T cells, and PMa MKP-1 mRNA and protein expression were higher when PMa were co-cultured with pan-T cells. Therefore, pan-T cells can up-regulate MKP-1 expression in macrophages and inhibit the secretion of inflammatory cytokines secretion by macrophages. In SCID mice, lymphocyte deficiency, especially T cell deficiency, causes insufficient MKP-1 expression in macrophages, which can be responsible for the severe inflammation and bad prognosis of septic SCID mice. MKP-1 plays an important role in the control of macrophage activation by the adaptive immune system.","Luo, Chong; Yang, Xiqiang; Yao, Lan; Jiang, Liping; Liu, Wei; Li, Xin; Wang, Lijia",International journal of molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.2011.799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21956667/,762

In this study, we developed a series of nanobodies by a phage display screening building from lymphocytes isolated from an alpaca immunized with recombinant mouse Kupffer cell receptor Clec4F, which is involved in pathogen recognition by binding to galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine. Bio-panning selections retrieved 14 different nanobodies against Clec4F with an affinity ranging from 0.2 to 2 nM as determined by SPR. Those nanobodies mainly recognize 4 different epitopes as analyzed via competitive epitope binning. By analysis of the radioactivity in each organ after injection of 99mTc labeled Clec4F nanobodies in naïve mice, we found that these nanobodies are targeting the liver. Furthermore, we performed a structural characterization at atomic resolution of two of the Clec4F nanobodies from different epitope groups, which revealed distinct features within the CDR2 and CDR3 regions. Taken together, we developed a series of nanobodies targeting multiple distinct recognition epitopes of the Kupffer cell-specific receptor Clec4F which may be useful for its structural and functional investigation as well as for use as molecular imaging and therapeutic agents.","Zheng, Fang; Zhou, Jinhong; Ouyang, Zhenlin; Zhang, Jiaxin; Wang, Xinyi; Muyldermans, Serge; Van Ginderachter, Jo; Devoogdt, Nick; Wen, Yurong; Schoonooghe, Steve; Raes, Geert",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.641819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692811/,762

We aimed to further investigate its value in response assessment in WM/LPL. PATIENTS AND METHODS Fifteen patients with WM/LPL were recruited in a prospective cohort study and underwent both 68Ga-pentixafor and 18F-FDG PET/CT at baseline and posttreatment. PET/CT-based responses were analyzed with visual assessments and compared with clinical response. RESULTS At baseline, all of the 15 patients had a positive 68Ga-pentixafor PET/CT scan, whereas 18F-FDG PET/CT was positive in 11/15 patients. After chemotherapy, the overall response rate was 86.7% (13/15), and 68Ga-pentixafor PET/CT showed different degree of tumor response from baseline in these patients. In the 2 patients with progressive disease, 68Ga-pentixafor PET/CT detected new lesions or remarkable increase of 68Ga-pentixafor uptake in tumor involvements. However, 18F-FDG PET/CT failed to detect the improvement of disease in 6/13 patients and missed disease progression in 1 of the 2 patients.

140850,Minimally invasive resection of adrenal masses in infants and children: results of a European multi-center survey.,2017,"BACKGROUND The evidence of sarcopenia based on CT-scan as an important prognostic factor for critically ill patients has not seen consistent results. To determine the impact of sarcopenia on mortality in critically ill patients, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the association between sarcopenia and mortality. METHODS We searched studies from the literature of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from database inception to June 15, 2020. All observational studies exploring the relationship between sarcopenia based on CT-scan and mortality in critically ill patients were included. The search and data analysis were independently conducted by two investigators. A meta-analysis was performed using STATA Version 14.0 software using a fixed-effects model. RESULTS Fourteen studies with a total of 3,249 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of sarcopenia among critically ill patients was 41 % (95 % CI:33-49 %). Critically ill patients with sarcopenia in the intensive care unit have an increased risk of mortality compared to critically ill patients without sarcopenia (OR = 2.28, 95 %CI: 1.83-2.83; P < 0.001; I2 = 22.1 %). In addition, a subgroup analysis found that sarcopenia was associated with high risk of mortality when defining sarcopenia by total psoas muscle area (TPA, OR = 3.12,95 %CI:1.71-5.70), skeletal muscle index (SMI, OR = 2.16,95 %CI:1.60-2.90), skeletal muscle area (SMA, OR = 2.29, 95 %CI:1.37-3.83), and masseter muscle(OR = 2.08, 95 %CI:1.15-3.77). Furthermore, critically ill patients with sarcopenia have an increased risk of mortality regardless of mortality types such as in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.99, 95 %CI:1.45-2.73), 30-day mortality(OR = 2.08, 95 %CI:1.36-3.19), and 1-year mortality (OR = 3.23, 95 %CI:2.08 -5.00). CONCLUSIONS Sarcopenia increases the risk of mortality in critical illness. Identifying the risk factors of sarcopenia should be routine in clinical assessments and offering corresponding interventions may help medical staff achieve good patient outcomes in ICU departments.","Zhang, Xiao-Ming; Chen, Denghong; Xie, Xiao-Hua; Zhang, Jun-E; Zeng, Yingchun; Cheng, Andy Sk",BMC geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02276-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34078275/,762

We aimed to explore the changes in ECG parameters after treatment with triple combination therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19. METHODS This retrospective, single-center case series analyzed 91 patients with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 at Ankara Gazi Mus-tafa Kemal State Hospital of Ankara City, Turkey, from April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. Forty-three patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine+oseltamivir+azithromycin (Group 1) and 48 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine+oseltamivir+levofloxacin (Group 2). Heart rate, P wave duration, P wave dispersion, PR interval, QRS duration, corrected QT interval (QTc), QTc dispersion (QTD), delta QTc, Tp-e, Tp-e dispersion, and Tp-e/QTc ratio were all calculated from the baseline and posttreatment 12-lead ECG recordings. RESULTS The QTc, QRS duration, Tp-e, PR interval, and P wave duration were significantly increased after treatment (p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p=0.001; p=0.001). The posttreatment C-reactive protein level was significantly lower than at baseline in Group 1 (p=0.014). At admission, 30% of patients had QT prolongation, and 4.3% of them had a QT duration >500 ms. Both Group 1 and Group 2 showed significant prolongation of the QTc interval (Group 1; p<0.001 vs. Group 2; p<0.001), QRS duration (Group 1; p=0.006 vs. Group 2; p=0.014), Tp-e (Group 1; p=0.036 vs. Group 2; p<0.001), and PR interval (Group 1; p=0.002 vs. Group2; p=0.05). The QTD was significantly decreased in Group 1 (p<0.001). None of the patients experienced any overt ventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate QT prolongation in a population of COVID-19 patients treated with triple combination therapy. We found that there was a significant decrease in the QTD after the treatment in patients who were taking triple therapy including azithromycin.","Uğurlu Ilgın, Burcu; Akbulut Koyuncu, İrem Müge; Kızıltunç, Emrullah",Anatolian journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.14744/anatoljcardiol.2020.79138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690133/,762

However, robust data are lacking on the relative performance of available rapid molecular tests across a full range of viral concentrations. Objective This study aimed to compare two recently-authorized rapid tests, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID Now SARS-CoV-2, to the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay for samples with low, medium, and high viral concentrations. Study design A total of 113 nasopharyngeal swabs from remnant patient samples were tested, including 88 positives spanning the full range of observed Ct values on the cobas assay. Results Compared to cobas, the overall positive agreement was 73.9% with ID Now and 98.9% with Xpert. Negative agreement was 100% and 92.0% for ID Now and Xpert, respectively. Both ID Now and Xpert showed 100% positive agreement for medium and high viral concentrations (Ct value <30). However, for Ct values >30, positive agreement was 34.3% for ID Now and 97.1% for Xpert. Conclusions While Xpert showed high agreement with cobas across a wide range of viral concentrations, this study highlights an important limitation of ID Now for specimens collected in viral or universal transport media with low viral concentrations. Further studies are needed to evaluate the performance of ID Now for direct swabs.","Smithgall, Marie C; Scherberkova, Ioana; Whittier, Susan; Green, Daniel A",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405252/,762

DESIGN/SAMPLE Using qualitative description, in-depth interviews were conducted among Hispanic fathers between the ages of 18 and 24 years, from community-based fatherhood program. The interviews of seven young Hispanic fathers were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS The participants' initial and ongoing fears about COVID-19 resulted from not having adequate information about the severity of the disease and how easily one can contract and transmit it to others. They also expressed concerns about the threat of the pandemic on their family's well-being, finances, and employment status. Providing for their families was their main priority, with some continuing to work, despite the risks of becoming infected with COVID-19. Despite their many hardships, fathers found strength in their families and remained hopeful in overcoming the challenges during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The pandemic has presented difficulties and loss for many. Nurses in the community are well positioned to serve young Hispanic fathers to ensure their needs are met. A family-centered approach is ideal for young fathers to provide them equal opportunity to be actively involved in promoting health for themselves and their families during the pandemic.","Recto, Pamela; Lesser, Janna",Public health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.12857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33368577/,762
141611,Success of Minimally Invasive Transumbilical Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (T-SILS) Plus Double-Balloon Endoscopy (DBE) for Pediatric Intestinal Angiodysplasia: A Case Report.,2015,"neuECG, the simultaneous noninvasive recording of ECG and skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA), directly records sympathetic nerve activity over a long period of time. It can be used to measure sympathetic tone in healthy subjects and in subjects with non-cardiovascular diseases. The electrical activity that can be measured on the surface of the skin originates from the heart, the muscle or nerve structures. Because the frequency content of nerve activity falls in a higher frequency range than that of the ECG and myopotential, it is possible to use high-pass or band-pass filtering to specifically isolate the SKNA. neuECG is voltage calibrated and does not require invasive procedures to impale electrodes in nerves and thus has advantages over microneurography. Here, we present a protocol that takes <10 min to set up. The neuECG can be continuously recorded over a 24-h period or longer. We also describe methods to efficiently analyze neuECG from humans using commercially available hardware and software to facilitate adoption of this technology in clinical research.","Kusayama, Takashi; Wong, Johnson; Liu, Xiao; He, Wenbo; Doytchinova, Anisiia; Robinson, Eric A; Adams, David E; Chen, Lan S; Lin, Shien-Fong; Davoren, Katherine; Victor, Ronald G; Cai, Cheng; Dai, Ming-Yan; Tian, Ying; Zhang, Pei; Ernst, Dereen; Rho, Richard H; Chen, Minglong; Cha, Yong-Mei; Walega, David R; Everett, Thomas H; Chen, Peng-Sheng",Nature protocols,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-0316-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313253/,762

The management of the bleeding phenotype associated with these disorders is poorly described. Systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the bleeding rates associated with tranexamic acid, desmopressin, platelet transfusion, plasma transfusion and recombinant activated factor VII, for patients with unclassified bleeding disorders undergoing surgery, childbirth or with menorrhagia. We searched for randomized controlled trials in MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, ISI Web of Science and the Transfusion Evidence Library from inception to 24 February 2020. Wherever appropriate, data were pooled using the metaprop function of STATA. Two studies with 157 participants with unclassified bleeding disorders were identified. The pooled risk of minor bleeding for patients undergoing surgery treated with peri-operative tranexamic acid was 11% (95% confidence interval 3--20%; n = 52; I2 = 0%); the risk for desmopressin and tranexamic acid in combination was 3% (95% confidence interval 0--7%; n = 71; I2 = 0%). There were no instances of major bleeding. In one procedure, 1 of 71 (1.4%), treated with a combination of desmopressin and tranexamic acid, the patient had a line-related deep vein thrombosis. There were too few patients treated to prevent postpartum haemorrhage or for menorrhagia to draw conclusions. The GRADE quality of evidence was very low suggesting considerable uncertainty over the results. However, both tranexamic acid, and the combination of tranexamic and desmopressin have high rates of haemostatic efficacy and have few adverse events.

It requires the surgeon to identify contributing factors, provide patient education, make a further management plan, and optimize the conditions for a favorable result. Various techniques have been described in literature but the rate of reoperation is still high. The first author has been using a supero-anterior capsular flap with a neopectoral subcapsular pocket and an implant change in these cases. Objectives To review the patient characteristics, indications, and early results of using part of the existing implant capsule for secondary subpectoral breast augmentations. Methods All patients who underwent secondary breast augmentation, over a period of 2 years by the first author (P.M.), using the supero-anterior capsular flap technique were included. The technique involves dissection of a new subpectoral pocket and uses the existing implant capsule as an internal brassiere. Results A total of 36 patients were operated by this technique. Of these, 17 patients had developed a complication while 19 patients wanted a change in size only. At a mean follow up of 10.2 months, there was no bottoming out, double bubble, or capsular contracture.

In addition, substantial research indicates that descriptive normative perceptions are a strong predictor of drinking behavior more generally. However, less is known about SNS-specific norms and how they might be associated with health-related behavior. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to determine whether descriptive normative perceptions for alcohol posting related to COVID-19 on SNSs are associated with both personal SNS posting behavior and drinking to cope with COVID-19-related stress, among a sample of 587 adults (48.4 percent women; mean age = 48.7 years) across the United States. All study procedures were approved by the local IRB. Results indicate that perceiving same-age peers to be posting on SNSs about their alcohol use to cope with pandemic-related stress/boredom is associated with both an increased likelihood of making such postings oneself and increased drinking to cope with the pandemic. Results have important implications for prevention and intervention efforts aimed to curb risky drinking during the pandemic and suggest that SNS behavior and norms should be incorporated into these strategies.","Litt, Dana M; Rodriguez, Lindsey M; Stewart, Sherry H","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33733832/,762

The aim of the study was to gain an in-depth understanding of how nursing and midwifery students experience, understand and cope with disgust in their clinical work. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Six participants (all women: two nursing students, four midwifery students) from a university in the South of England were interviewed. Four superordinate themes with eight subthemes were identified. Overall, findings suggest that participants experience both moral and physical disgust; however, they find it difficult to talk about and use other terms to describe their experience. Findings are discussed through the lens of social identity theory, to understand the relevance of professional identity and how this might further maintain the disgust taboo. The strategies participants have developed in order to cope with disgust are explored and understood within the current healthcare climate. Future research should focus on ways of addressing the experience of disgust by healthcare professionals in order to improve the quality of care provided, especially in the climate of the COVID-19 crisis.","Hadjittofi, Marilena; Gleeson, Kate; Arber, Anne",Nursing inquiry,https://doi.org/10.1111/nin.12427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143918/,762

MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients underwent thermal ablation including radiofrequency (n = 9) and microwave ablation (n = 5), or cryoablation (n = 5). Target tumors were located in the lung (n = 7), soft tissue (n = 5), liver (n = 4), and bone (n = 3). Patient peripheral blood samples were collected before and within 14 days after ablation. Peripheral blood populations of cytotoxic T-cells (CTL), type-1 (Th1) and type-2 helper T-cells (Th2), and regulatory T-cells (Treg) were measured using flow cytometry. Changes in CTL/Treg and Th1/Th2 ratios before and after ablation therapy were compared using paired t-tests. RESULTS Peripheral blood CTL population (27.5 ± 2.1% to 30.2 ± 2.5%, p < .03) and CTL/Treg ratios (18.8 ± 3.7% to 21.6 ± 3.6%, p < .05) increased significantly after ablation. Although a significant increase in CTL/Treg ratios was found after heat-based ablation (18.0 ± 4.4% to 21.6 ± 4.7%, p < .02), it remained unchanged after cryoablation (21.0 ± 7.0% to 21.5 ± 4.3%, p = .92). Th1/Th2 ratio (13.7 ± 3.0% to 17.2 ± 3.5%, p = .12) remained unchanged after ablation. CONCLUSION Ablation therapy alters the T-cell balance by increasing the systemic CTL/Treg, ratio. Heat-based ablation might be a more effective approach than cryoablation to enhance systemic anti-tumor immunity.","Takaki, Haruyuki; Imai, Naoko; Thomas, Contessa T; Yamakado, Koichiro; Yarmohammadi, Hooman; Ziv, Etay; Srimathveeravalli, Govindarajan; Sofocleous, Constantinos T; Solomon, Stephen B; Erinjeri, Joseph P",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2017.1310737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28417678/,762

METHODS Data on demographics, referral source, and patient's concern were recorded. The web-based referral sources were website and Instagram and non-web-based included other patients (word-of-mouth), medical professionals (physician, nurse, and optometrist), and others (printed media, TV, and radio). Patients' concerns were divided into cosmetic and noncosmetic. The first (2012-2015) and second (2016-2019) half of the study period were also compared. RESULTS Included patients were 19,965. The 8-year referral sources, in order of frequency, were medical professionals (34%), other patients (32.7%), web-based sources (32.5%), and the others (0.7%). The web-based sources significantly increased by 2.4 times in the second half. While they had a third rank after the medical professionals and other patients in the first half of the study period, they became the first in the second half. The non-web-based source showed a decline during the study period. Type of referral sources was not significantly different between the 2 genders. A significantly higher percentage of the patients between 21 and 50 years of age were referred through web-based sources than the other age groups. Patients with cosmetic concerns were 2 times more likely to be referred through web-based sources. CONCLUSION The web-based referral sources have significantly grown from the third rank in the beginning to the first one from 2015 till the end of study.","Abdolalizadeh, Parya; Kashkouli, Mohsen Bahmani; Gandomi, Alireza; Karimi, Nasser; Chaibakhsh, Samira; Jafarpour, Soheila",Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/iop.0000000000001918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315846/,762

Epithelial barrier impairment has been associated with the development of various pathologies such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In the inflamed mucosa, superficial erosions or micro-erosions that corrupt epithelial monolayers correspond to sites of high permeability. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the formation of micro-erosions including cell shedding and apoptosis. These micro-erosions often represent microscopic epithelial gaps randomly distributed in the colon. Visualization and quantification of those epithelial gaps has emerged as an important tool to investigate intestinal epithelial barrier function. Here, we describe a new method to visualize the specific location of where transcellular and paracellular permeability is enhanced in the inflamed colonic mucosa. In this assay, we apply a 10 kDa fluorescent dye conjugated to a lysine fixable dextran to visualize high permeability regions (HPR) in the colonic mucosa. Additional use of cell death markers revealed that HPR encompass apoptotic foci where epithelial extrusion/shedding occurs. The protocol described here provides a simple but effective approach to visualize and quantify micro-erosions in the intestine, which is a very useful tool in disease models, in which the intestinal epithelial barrier is compromised.","Castro-Martínez, Felipe; Encarnación-García, María Del Rocío; Candelario-Martinez, Aurora; Medina-Contreras, Oscar; Patiño-Lopez, Genaro; Schnoor, Michael; Nava, Porfirio",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/62204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180884/,762

The high levels of stress experienced by nurses during this pandemic may have immediate and long-term effects on their mental health. PURPOSE To explore the stress and psychological problems of nurses during this pandemic and to identify strategies used by these nurses to relieve stress. METHODS A cross-sectional online survey was conducted that included a basic information datasheet, stress of nursing staff during COVID-19 outbreak scale, psychological distress scale, and stress relief methods survey form. Convenience sampling was used and a total of 469 practicing nurses participated in this study. RESULTS Most of the participants expressed concerns about living problems (72.7%). On the stress questionnaire, the facets of ""burden of taking care of patients"" and ""worries about social isolation"" earned the first and second highest scores, respectively. In terms of items, ""worrying about infecting family members and friends"" and ""worrying about being separated from family after being infected"" earned the two highest scores (2.35 ± 0.79 and 2.17 ± 0.92, respectively). Scores for psychological distress averaged 5.49 ± 3.83, with stress anxiety (1.32 ± 0.84) earning the highest mean subscale score followed by distress and irritability (1.17 ± 0.92) and depression (1.12 ± 0.94). Nearly two-thirds (61.8%) of the participants earned psychological and emotional distress scores within the 'normal' range, and 3.4% earned scores indicating severe distress. ""Receiving education and training"" was the most common method used by the participants to relieve stress (2.27 ± 0.51). CONCLUSIONS The following six strategies are proposed based on the above findings: (1) Caring: provide psychological assessment and care; (2) Supporting: create a friendly team atmosphere and provide support; (3) Inquiring: recruit volunteers with relevant experience; (4) Informing: provide timely, open, and transparent epidemic-prevention information; (5) Equipping: provide complete and appropriate epidemic-prevention education and training; (6) Assisting: establish a strategy for family support and caring to reduce the stress and worries of nurses.","Feng, Ming-Chu; Wu, Hsiang-Chun; Lin, Hui-Tzu; Lei, Lei; Chao, Chia-Ling; Lu, Chun-Mei; Yang, Wan-Ping",Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,https://doi.org/10.6224/jn.202006_67(3).09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32495331/,762

In the model we allowed the regression coefficients for influenza to drift over time, and adjusted for temperature and humidity. The regression coefficient for influenza A(H3N2) increased significantly in 2005. The regression coefficients for influenza A(H1N1) and B were relatively stable over the period. Our model suggested an increase in seriousness of A(H3N2) in 2005, the year after the appearance of the A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2)-like virus when the drifted A/California/7/2004(H3N2)-like virus appeared.

METHODS AND RESULTS STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and included in the prospective Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (MARINA-STEMI) cohort study from 2015- 2020 (n = 474) were categorized according to (i) timeframes with and without major public health restrictions in 2020, and (ii) timeframes of major public health restrictions during 2020 and during the corresponding timeframes between 2015-2019. Myocardial damage was evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. During major public health restrictions in 2020 (n = 48), there was an increase in infarct size (22 [IQR 12-29] vs. 14 [IQR 6-23]%, P < 0.01), a higher frequency (77% vs. 52%, P < 0.01) and larger extent of microvascular obstruction (1.5 [IQR 0.1-11.4] vs. 0.2 [IQR 0.0-2.6]%, P < 0.01) and a higher rate of intramyocardial haemorrhage (56% vs. 34%, P = 0.02) as compared to the phases without major restrictions in 2020 (n = 101). These findings were confirmed in adjusted analysis and were consistent when comparing patients admitted in 2020 versus patients admitted in the ""pre-pandemic"" era (2015-2019).

FebriDx diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in the emergency room and urgent care setting. METHODS A prospective, multicentre, observational cohort study of acute upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), with and without a confirmed fever at the time of enrolment, was performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FebriDx to identify clinically significant bacterial infection with host response and acute pathogenic viral infection. The reference method consisted of an algorithm with physician override that included bacterial cell culture, respiratory PCR panels for viral and atypical pathogens, procalcitonin, and white blood cell count. RESULTS Among 220 patients enrolled, 100% reported fever 100.5°F within the last 72 hours while 55% had a measured hyperthermia (T > 100.4) at the time of enrolment. FebriDx demonstrated a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 77-100%), specificity of 94% (88-98%), PPV of 76% (59-87%), and a NPV of 99% (93-100%). CONCLUSION FebriDx may identify clinically significant bacterial URI's and supports outpatient antibiotic decisions. Key messages FebriDx is an outpatient POC test designed to identify a clinically significant systemic host immune response and aid in the differentiation of viral and bacterial infection through rapid measurement of MxA and CRP from a fingerstick blood sample. FebriDx test was determined to be an accurate test, with a 85% sensitivity, 93% specificity and 97% NPV to rule out bacterial infection for any patient presenting with symptoms and reported fever within the prior 3 days, and when confirming fever (hyperthermia) at the time of testing, the test was even more sensitive (95%) and specific (94%) with a 99% NPV. FebriDx may support antibiotic stewardship by rapidly identifying clinically significant bacterial URIs.","Shapiro, Nathan I; Self, Wesley H; Rosen, Jeffrey; Sharp, Stephan C; Filbin, Michael R; Hou, Peter C; Parekh, Amisha D; Kurz, Michael C; Sambursky, Robert",Annals of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2018.1474002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29775092/,762
145178,Intra and postoperative assessment of re-sterilised Ligasure Atlas for orchidectomies in horses: clinical study.,2012,"Photoresponsive physical gels using liquid crystals (LCs) as solvents have attracted great interest owing to their potential applications. But current investigations mainly focus on UV light, which is not environment-friendly enough. On the other hand, the halogen bond is a novel tool for constructing supramolecular gels because of its good hydrophobicity, high directionality, tunable strength, as well as large size of halogen atoms. Herein, to construct a LC physical gel with both the advantages of halogen bond and visible light response, azopyridine-containing Azopy-C10 is chosen as a halogen bond acceptor, while 1,2-bis(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-iodophenyl)diazene (BTFIPD) is selected both as the halogen bond donor and for the intrinsically visible light response. Such a binary gelator can self-assemble in the anisotropic solvent of nematic LC 5CB to form a LC physical gel. It experiences the gel-to-sol transition by green light irradiation. As the gelator concentration increases, the saturation voltage increases, but the switch-off time decreases. The combination of halogen bond and controllable visible light responsive LC physical gel provides the feasibilities of manipulating these smart soft materials.","Tong, Xun; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Qiu, Yuan; Wang, Hong; Liao, Yonggui; Xie, Xiaolin",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c01901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962351/,762

145454,Safety and efficacy of 1020 consecutive laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies performed as a primary treatment modality for morbid obesity. A single-center experience from the metabolic and bariatric surgical accreditation quality and improvement program.,2016,"The intracellular availability of all biologically required transition metal ions in bacteria, e.g., Zn, Cu, Fe, as well as the detoxification of nonbiological heavy metal pollutants, is controlled at the molecular level by a panel of metalloregulatory or ""metal sensor"" proteins. Metal sensor proteins are specialized allosteric proteins that regulate the transcription of genes linked to transition metal homeostasis as a result of direct binding of a single metal ion or two closely related metal ions, to the exclusion of all others. In many cases, the binding of the cognate metal ion induces a structural change in a metal sensor oligomer that either activates or inhibits operator DNA binding. A quantitative measure of the degree to which a particular metal drives metalloregulation of transcription is the allosteric coupling-free energy, ΔG(c). In this chapter, we outline detailed spectroscopically derived methods for measuring metal binding affinity, K(Me), as well as ΔG(c) independent of K(Me), presented in the context of a simple coupled equilibrium scheme. Studies carried out in this way provide quantitative insights into the degree to which a particular metal ion is capable of driving allosteric switching, and via ligand substitution, the extent to which individual coordination bonds establish structural linkage of allosteric metal and operator DNA-binding sites.","Grossoehme, Nicholas E; Giedroc, David P",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-61779-806-1_8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22573440/,762

This study sought to share our experiences with in-hospital management and outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive AMI patients, including those with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI), from February 1, 2020, to April 15, 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic), and from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic), respectively. Fifty-three AMI patients (31 STEMI, 22 NSTEMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic were matched to 53 AMI patients before the pandemic. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the matched patients. STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic had a longer delay time, less primary or remedial PCI and more emergency thrombolysis than those before the pandemic. Less coronary angiography and stenting were performed in AMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic. There were no statistically significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the matched patients. However, STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic had a 4-fold (12.9% vs. 3.2%) increase in all-cause mortality rate compared with those before the pandemic. AMI combined with COVID-19 infection was associated with higher rates of mortality than AMI alone. This study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic results in significant reperfusion delays in STEMI patients and has a marked impact on the treatment options selection in AMI patients. The mortality rate of STEMI patients exhibits an increasing trend during the pandemic of COVID-19.","Huang, Bing; Xu, Changwu; Liu, Huafen; Deng, Wei; Yang, Zheng; Wan, Jun; Yan, Hui; Cao, Guiqiu; Chen, Jing; Jiang, Hong",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1097/fjc.0000000000000909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33170591/,762
145896,An analysis of skills acquisition during a training program for experienced laparoscopists in laparoendoscopic single-site surgery.,2014,"Background As of May 4, 2020, India has reported 42,836 confirmed cases and 1,389 deaths from COVID-19. India's multipronged response included nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) like intensive case-based surveillance, expanding testing capacity, social distancing, health promotion, and progressive travel restrictions leading to a complete halt of international and domestic movements (lockdown). Objectives We studied the impact of NPI on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India and estimated the minimum level of herd immunity required to halt it. Methods We plotted time distribution, estimated basic (R0) and time-dependent effective (Rt) reproduction numbers using software R, and calculated doubling time, the growth rate for confirmed cases from January 30 to May 4, 2020. Herd immunity was estimated using the latest Rtvalue. Results Time distribution showed a propagated epidemic with subexponential growth. Average growth rate, 21% in the beginning, reduced to 6% after an extended lockdown (May 3). Based on early transmission dynamics, R0was 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.79-3.07). Early, unmitigated Rt= 2.51 (95% CI = 2.05-3.14) (March 15) reduced to 1.28 (95% CI = 1.22-1.32) and was 1.83 (95% CI = 1.71-1.93) at the end of lockdown Phase 1 (April 14) and 2 (May 3), respectively. Similarly, average early doubling time (4.3 days) (standard deviation [SD] = 1.86) increased to 5.4 days (SD = 1.03) and 10.9 days (SD = 2.19). Estimated minimum 621 million recoveries are required to halt COVID-19 spread if Rtremains below 2. Conclusion India's early response, especially stringent lockdown, has slowed COVID-19 epidemic. Increased testing, intensive case-based surveillance and containment efforts, modulated movement restrictions while protecting the vulnerable population, and continuous monitoring of transmission dynamics should be a way forward in the absence of effective treatment, vaccine, and undetermined postinfection immunity.","Patel, Purvi; Athotra, Aditya; Vaisakh, T P; Dikid, Tanzin; Jain, Sudhir Kumar",Indian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.ijph_510_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32496246/,762

146339,Ramifications of single-port laparoscopic surgery: measuring differences in task performance using simulation.,2014,"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is a newer approach that may be a safe alternative to traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (TLC) based on retrospective and small prospective studies. As the demand for single-incision surgery may be driven by patient perceptions of benefits, we designed a prospective randomized study using patient-reported outcomes as our end points. METHODS Patients deemed candidates for either SILC or TLC were offered enrollment in the study. After induction of anesthesia, patients were randomized to SILC or TLC. Preoperative characteristics and operative data were recorded, including length of stay (LOS). Pain scores in recovery and for 48 h and satisfaction with wound appearance at 2 and 4 weeks were reported by patients. We used the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) survey preoperatively and at 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively to assess recovery. Procedural and total hospital costs per case were abstracted from hospital billing systems. RESULTS Mean age of the study group was 44.1 years (±14.8), 87% were Caucasian, and 77% were female, with no difference between groups. Operative times were longer for SILC (median = 57 vs. 47 min, p = 0.008), but mean LOS was similar (6.8 ± 4.2 h SILC vs. 6.2 ± 4.8 h TLC, p = 0.59). Operating room cost and encounter cost were similar. GIQLI scores were not significantly different preoperatively or at 2 or 4 weeks postoperatively. Patients reported higher satisfaction with wound appearance at 2 weeks with SILC. There were no differences in pain scores in recovery or in the first 48 h, although SILC patients required significantly more narcotic in recovery (19 mg morphine equivalent vs. 11.5, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS SILC is a longer operation but can be done at the same cost as TLC. Recovery and pain scores are not significantly different. There may be an improvement in patient satisfaction with wound appearance. Both procedures are valid approaches to cholecystectomy.","Brown, Kimberly M; Moore, B Todd; Sorensen, G Brent; Boettger, Conrad H; Tang, Fengming; Jones, Phil G; Margolin, Daniel J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-2914-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23519495/,762

146731,A modular magnetic anastomotic device for minimally invasive digestive anastomosis: proof of concept and preliminary data in the pig model.,2014,"Asthma commonly occurs in pregnant females, and recent data have outlined the risks of adverse perinatal outcomes among this population. There is an increased risk of low birth weight and small for gestational age, particularly among females with moderate-to-severe asthma and exacerbations during pregnancy. There is also an increased risk of preterm birth, especially with oral steroid use, a small but statistically significant increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly of cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and an increased risk of neonatal hospitalisation and death. Active management may reduce these risks, possibly through reductions in exacerbations. Additional reassuring data have been presented for asthma medication use, which support the benefits outweighing the risks of indicated asthma medication use in pregnancy. Viral infections are an important trigger of asthma exacerbations in pregnancy, and recent data provides possible immunological changes that may explain this. Poor medication adherence despite worsening asthma symptoms in pregnancy is a problem which continues to be demonstrated in the literature. Improving asthma control in pregnancy has the potential to improve not only the mother's health but also that of her child.","Murphy, Vanessa E; Schatz, Michael",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,https://doi.org/10.1183/09059180.00008313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591663/,762
146845,Effect of patient rotation on ovary observation during laparoscopic ovariectomy in dogs.,2018,"BACKGROUND Scope-induced duodenal perforation is a life-threatening complication and surgery remains the standard of care. With the advent of over-the-scope clip (OTSC), scope-induced perforations are increasingly managed conservatively, though there is no study comparing this form of non-surgical treatment with surgery. We aimed to compare OTSC and surgery in the management of scope-induced perforation of the duodenum. METHODS We retrospectively collected data of scope-induced duodenal perforation patients. Perforations identified and treated within 24 h of procedure were analyzed. Factors analyzed were spectrum, etiology, baseline parameters, perforation size, outcome, comorbidities, and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS A total of 25 patients had type I duodenal perforations, out of whom five were excluded due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Of the twenty, eight were treated with OTSC placement while the rest underwent surgery. Age was comparable and the majority were females. Baseline parameters and comorbidities were similar in both the groups. The median size of perforation was 1.5 cm in both the OTSC group and the surgical group. All patients were treated with standard of care according to institutional protocols. Patients in the OTSC group were started orally after 48 h of OTSC placement, while in the surgery group median time to oral intake was 7 days. Two patients in the surgical group died while there was no mortality in the OTSC group (p = 0.48). Median hospital stay was shorter in the OTSC group (2 days vs. 22 days, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS OTSC is a feasible and better option in type I duodenal perforations with a shorter hospital stay.","Dahale, Amol S; Srivastava, Siddharth; Saluja, Sundeep Singh; Sachdeva, Sanjeev; Dalal, Ashok; Varakanahalli, Shivakumar",Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12664-021-01152-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974228/,762

To identify features useful for supporting the confirmation of comorbid anxiety disorders, we investigated the prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders and their associated factors in Japanese patients with mood disorders using data from our previously reported JET-LMBP study. Patients and Methods Patients with bipolar disorder (BD; n=114) and patients with major depressive disorder (MDD; n=334), all with major depressive episodes (DSM-IV-TR) were analyzed. Comorbid anxiety disorders were confirmed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Demographic and clinical features were assessed using patient background forms, including the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report Japanese version, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CATS). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and severity of depressive symptoms was used to identify factors associated with comorbid anxiety disorders (post hoc analysis). Results The prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders was significantly higher in patients with BD (53.2%) than in patients with MDD (37.2%). Factors associated with comorbid anxiety disorders in BD included no spouse, interpersonal rejection sensitivity, higher CATS sexual abuse scores, and lower SF-36 mental component summary scores. In MDD, factors included hypersomnia, pathological guilt feelings, higher CATS neglect scores, and lower SF-36 physical component summary scores. Conclusion Comorbid anxiety disorders were commonly seen in Japanese patients with mood disorders. Childhood abuse, atypical depression symptoms, and deterioration of health-related QoL were commonly associated with comorbid anxiety disorders in BD and MDD, suggesting that the presence of these features may be useful to support the confirmation of comorbid anxiety disorders in these patients.","Inoue, Takeshi; Kimura, Toshifumi; Inagaki, Yoshifumi; Shirakawa, Osamu",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s246294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764945/,762
147153,The diagnostic efficacy of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery: is there a role in the intensive care unit?,2010,"BACKGROUND Parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience considerable amounts of stress and impaired emotional well-being. Consequently, it is likely that these have been adversely impacted by COVID-19 outbreak due to disruptions to the schedules of children with ASD. AIM This study investigated the stress and emotional well-being of parents of children with ASD in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD The study obtained quantitative data from 150 parents of children with ASD from different regions in Saudi Arabia using an online survey. The data collected included demographic data of the parents, ASD status of the family, ASD support during COVID-19 pandemic, severity of ASD behaviours in comparison to the pre- COVID-19 status eating behaviour of the child with ASD, Parental Stress, and emotional well-being. The PSI-short form (PSI-SF) (Abidin, 1995) scale was utilised to obtain data related to parental stress and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) (Goldberg, 1992) scale was utilised to obtain data related to parents' emotional well-being. RESULTS The study found that family ASD status (in particular, age and gender of child with ASD, and severity of his/her symptoms) had a significant impact on parental stress and emotional well-being. Moreover, parental stress and emotional well-being were negatively impacted by the frequency and usefulness of ASD support received during COVID-19 pandemic. These were also adversely impacted by the change in severity of ASD behaviours of the children with ASD. Finally, parental stress was found to have a negative impact on the emotional well-being of parents. Overall, the study found that the parental stress and emotional well-being of parents of children with ASD in Saudi Arabia had been unfavourably impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the study found that the parental stress and emotional well-being of parents with ASD in Saudi Arabia had been unfavourably impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. This study recommends the involvement of the Saudi Ministry of Health to establish and extend support services to support parents of children with ASD. Moreover, the provision of training programs to help parents deal with the characteristic behaviour of their children with ASD such as, the ability to maintain routines, aggressive or repetitive behaviour, is also recommended.","Alhuzimi, Talal",Research in developmental disabilities,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33271447/,762

Prescribing practice varies despite national guidelines, and there is concern that stewardship principles have suffered. Aim To analyse antibiotic prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic at a teaching hospital and to propose improved approaches to stewardship. Methods We reviewed COVID-19 admissions to medical wards and intensive care units (ICUs) in a London teaching hospital to assess initial antibiotic usage and evidence of bacterial co-infection, and to determine if our current antibiotic guidelines were adhered to. Findings Data from 130 inpatients (76% medical and 24% ICU) were obtained. On admission, 90% were treated with antibiotics. No microbiological samples taken on admission provided definitive evidence of respiratory co-infection. In 13% of cases, antibiotics were escalated, usually without supporting clinical, radiological or laboratory evidence. In 16% of cases, antibiotics were stopped or de-escalated within 72 h. Blood results and chest radiographs were characteristic of COVID-19 in 20% of ward patients and 42% of ICU patients. Overall mortality was 25% at 14 days - similar to rates described for the UK as a whole. Conclusion The majority of patients received antibiotics despite limited evidence of co-infection. Most patients received narrower spectrum antibiotics than recommended by NICE. As understanding of the natural history of COVID-19 infections progresses, stewardship programmes will need to evolve; however, at this point, we feel that a more restrictive antibiotic prescribing approach is warranted. We propose strategies for effective stewardship and estimate the effect this may have on antibiotic consumption.","Evans, Terry John; Davidson, Harriet Claire; Low, Jen Mae; Basarab, Marina; Arnold, Amber",Journal of infection prevention,https://doi.org/10.1177/1757177420976813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34239610/,762
147345,Improved Outcomes Utilizing a Valveless-Trocar System during Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP).,2019,"IMPORTANCE Seasonal influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality, with cardiovascular and respiratory complications the most common among susceptible individuals. Upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) are known to precede olfactory dysfunction in some patients. To our knowledge, there has been no study assessing the possible relationship between influenza vaccination status and olfactory dysfunction. OBJECTIVE To compare vaccination status of a group of patients with subjective olfactory dysfunction with that of a group of controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective medical record review and telephone survey in a matched case-control study. Forty-two patients were identified via diagnosis codes who presented to a tertiary care academic rhinologic center with subjective smell dysfunction over the course of 1 year. Only post-URI and idiopathic etiologies were included. Forty-two age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched control patients were also selected. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Demographic data, influenza vaccination status, and smoking status were reviewed. χ² Testing was used. RESULTS We were able to obtain vaccination data for 36 of 42 patients in the olfactory dysfunction group and 38 of 42 in the control group. Seven of the 36 (19%) in the olfactory dysfunction group had received the vaccine in the year prior to presentation compared with 16 of 38 (42%) in the control group (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Influenza vaccination seems to be associated with a decreased rate of subjective olfactory dysfunction. This is a preliminary finding, and further studies would be needed to elucidate the exact role of influenza and influenza vaccination in patients with olfactory loss.","Flanagan, Carrie E; Wise, Sarah K; DelGaudio, John M; Patel, Zara M",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2014.3399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25590362/,762

METHODS A systematic review was performed to identify studies reporting on transabdominal division of the levator ani during APER. A comprehensive literature search was performed using a combination of free-text terms and controlled vocabulary when applicable on the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library. The search period was from January 1945 to December 2015. The following search headings were used: ""transabdominal"", ""transpelvic"", ""abdominal"" or ""pelvic"" combined with either ""levator"" or ""extralevator"" and with ""abdominoperineal"". RESULTS Nine publications were identified reporting on 99 participants. The male/female distribution was 1.44:1, respectively, and the mean age was 56.6 (30-77) years. All tumours were less than 5 cm from the anal verge. The preoperative radiological staging was T2 in 18% of cases, T3 in 53.5% and T4 in 28.5%. Transabdominal division of the levators was performed laparoscopically in 55 cases, robotically in 34 and open in 10. The mean operating time was 255 (177-640) min. Mean intraoperative blood loss was 140 (92-500) ml. There were no conversions to open. Circumferential resection margins were positive in two cases, and there was one intraoperative perforation. Mean post-operative length of stay was 9.3 (3-67) days. Follow-up (from 0 to 31 months) revealed 19 perineal wound infections, 15 cases of sexual dysfunction and 7 cases of urinary retention. There was no mortality and 1 readmission. CONCLUSIONS Transabdominal division of the levators during APER is feasible and reproducible, with acceptable perioperative and good early oncological outcomes. Further comparative studies are needed.","Baird, D L H; Simillis, C; Kontovounisios, C; Sheng, Q; Nikolaou, S; Law, W L; Rasheed, S; Tekkis, P P",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-017-1682-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891039/,762

Animals were given a single dose of CCFA intramuscularly at 5 mg/kg body weight. Blood was collected at 0 (pretreatment), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240 h postinjection. Plasma was analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Plasma concentration-time curves for each group were evaluated with noncompartmental modeling. When compared to control animals, those receiving the PRRSv wild-type challenge only had a lower AUC0-last , higher Cl/F, and higher Vz/F. The PRRSv wild-type challenge only group had the longest T1/2λ . The Cmax did not differ among all four treatments. Control animals had no statistically significant differences from animals vaccinated with PRRS MLV alone or animals vaccinated with PRRS MLV and later challenged with wild-type PRRSv. Our results suggest that PRRSv wild-type infection has the potential to alter CCFA pharmacokinetics and PRRS MLV vaccination may attenuate those changes.","Sparks, J W; Karriker, L A; Day, D N; Wulf, L W; Zhang, J; Stock, M L; Bates, J L; Gehring, R; Coetzee, J F",Journal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvp.12369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27885695/,762

Left atrial strain (LAS) is a surrogate measure of left ventricular filling. We hypothesized that survivors (1) have lower LAS versus controls, and (2) survivors exposed to higher anthracycline dosage have even lower LAS. Cross-sectional study of 45 survivors exposed to anthracyclines ≥ 1 year after chemotherapy and 45 healthy controls. Echo variables included mitral spectral and tissue Doppler, left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF), LV dimension, LA volume, LV global longitudinal strain (GLS), and LAS. Peak strain (Ɛ) and strain rate (SR) at three phases were obtained: atrial contraction (ac), reservoir (res), and conduit (con). Two sub-analyses of cancer survivors were performed: (1) those with anthracycline dosage ≥ 250 mg/m2, and (2) those with Ɛres in the lowest quartile. On the whole, survivors had lower Ɛres and Ɛcon values. The majority of survivors had relatively normal LAS, while a subset had very low LAS values and were more likely to be older. Survivors exposed to ≥ 250 mg/m2 anthracycline also had lower Ɛres than those < 250 mg/m2. There were no differences in mitral spectral/tissue Doppler, LV dimension, left atrial volume, or GLS. A subset of childhood cancer survivors have lower LAS than their healthy counterparts, while most are essentially normal. Those exposed to higher anthracycline dosage have even lower Ɛres. Longitudinal study of LAS may prove useful in monitoring for CTRCD.","Loar, Robert W; Colquitt, John L; Rainusso, Nino C; Gramatges, M Monica; Liu, Asela M; Noel, Cory V; Tunuguntla, Hari P; Lilje, Christian; Pignatelli, Ricardo H",The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10554-020-01970-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803485/,762

Its infection spread to thousands of people globally within a short span of time with a progressive trend towards mortality of citizens. Posing a potential public health threat, SARS-CoV-2 progressed from animal-to-human to human-to-human transmission with symptoms ranging from little to no illness to persons severely ill to many deaths, confirming two criteria for declaring COVID-19 a pandemic. The disease shows a progressive trend in symptomology, ranging from mild to severe pneumoniae to respiratory and multi-visceral failure that often shows trend to death of patients with comorbidity within a short span of time. Intensive research efforts on different aspects of this human pathogen are underway across the globe towards elucidating viral transmission routes and the mechanisms employed to overcome host defense responses. With huge infective potential, studies are being carried out vigorously to develop effective diagnostics and therapeutic interventions including re-purposing antivirals and other potential inhibitors. Herein, we describe the taxonomic classification of SARSCoV-2; the structural organization of its genome; its infectivity, transmission, and receptor interaction; and we summarize risk assessment and approaches used in preventing infection.

Strict quarantine measures implemented as a result of the pandemic have disrupted many aspects of people's lives, triggering psychological distress. A total of 256 participants were recruited through a convenience sample. Data were collected through snowball sampling, an assessment of distress symptoms using the Brief Symptoms Inventory, and an assessment of leisure-time physical activity using the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Significant changes in paranoid ideation (z = -2.45, P = .01) and interpersonal sensitivity (z = -2.01, P = .04) dimensions were noted between those who were and those who were not authorized to leave their homes during quarantine. Similarly, for physical activity, significant changes in depression (z = -2.15, P = .03), anxiety (z = -2.13, P = .03), interpersonal sensitivity (z = -1.95, P = .05), and somatization (z = -2.11, P = .03) were reported among the insufficiently active group compared with the more physically active group. From multiple regression analysis, variables correlated with general distress were type of quarantine, gender, age, education level, chronic disease, and smoking (R2 = .80). With some variables, leisure-time physical activity domains appeared to be associated only with interpersonal sensitivity and somatization. Having to leave one's home during the outbreak was linked to distress, especially symptoms like suspiciousness, hostility, fearful thoughts of losing autonomy, and feelings of inadequacy, uneasiness, and discomfort during interpersonal interactions. Individuals who were moderately or sufficiently active physically reported less psychological distress.","Sfendla, Anis; Hadrya, Fatine",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32946286/,762

MATERIALS AND METHODS From September 2009 through December 2012, 18 patients with moderate to severe ED secondary to insufficiency of physiologic venous occlusion as diagnosed by color Doppler evaluation of the penis after direct pharmacologic stimulation were treated. Preliminary diagnoses were also confirmed with dynamic cavernosography. Selective AEPV was achieved using a combination of N-butyl cyanoacrylate and endovascular coils. Follow-up consisted of collecting International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire (IIEF-6) scores and repeated color Doppler evaluation. RESULTS Immediate technical success was achieved in 16 of 18 patients (88.8%). Follow-up data were obtained at a mean of 13.3 months ± 7.5. In 12 of the patients with technical success, the mean IIEF-6 score improved from 10.5 ± 5.2 to 20.6 ± 8.4 after the procedure (P = .0069). At 3-month short-term follow-up, clinical success defined by an end-diastolic velocity of < 5 cm/s on color Doppler was noted in 81% (13 of 16 patients). Of these 13 patients, 7 patients had continued erectile function at the end of follow-up, and the other 6 patients reported progressive diminishment in the benefit over time. No major complications and two minor complications were encountered.

Remarkably, the susceptibility to both the viral disease and iron dyshomeostasis can be traced back to the same gene loci of the ABO blood group system. The overlapping of susceptible gene loci together with the phenomenological correlations in gender and age are strong indicators for the interrelation of body iron dyshomeostasis with COVID-19 infection and disease.","Lawaczeck, Rüdiger",ACS chemical neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196159/,762

Therefore, there is a need for sampling methods that do not risk infecting them. In this study, we aimed to compare the saliva and Oro-Nasopharyngeal Swab (ONS) sampling methods. METHODS Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 included patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Group 2 included patients with COVID-19 compatible findings in lung computed tomography (CT), but with a negative PCR. Group 3 included patients who presented to the emergency department with COVID-19 compatible complaints but had normal CT. Saliva and ONS samples were taken on the third day of hospitalization in groups 1 and 2, whereas in group 3, they were taken at the time of admission to the hospital. RESULTS A total of 64 patients were included in the study. The average age was 51.04 ± 17.9 years, and 37 (57.8%) were male. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 27 (42.2%) patients' saliva samples. While the sensitivity and positive predictive value of saliva samples were 85.2%, specificity and negative predictive value were 89.2%. The value of kappa was in substantial agreement (0.744), and it was found statistically significant (<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Saliva samples can be used instead of ONS samples in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Investigating SARS-CoV-2 with saliva is cheaper, easier for the patient and overall, and, most importantly, it poses much less risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination to healthcare personnel.","Güçlü, Ertuğrul; Koroglu, Mehmet; Yürümez, Yusuf; Toptan, Hande; Kose, Elif; Güneysu, Fatih; Karabay, Oğuz",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.8.1116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935807/,762

148648,Application of single incision laparoscopic surgery for appendectomies in patients with complicated appendicitis.,2010,"BACKGROUND Long-term physical conditions affect 10% to 12% of children and adolescents worldwide. These individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression, sometimes directly related to their illness or medical care (e.g. health-related anxiety). There is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychological therapies for treating anxiety and depression in this population. Therapies designed for children and adolescents without medical issues may or may not be appropriate for use with those who have long-term physical conditions. OBJECTIVES This review was undertaken to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological therapies in comparison with controls (treatment-as-usual, waiting list, attention placebo, psychological placebo, or non-psychological treatment) for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions. SEARCH METHODS We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 27 September 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to May 2016). In addition we searched the Web of Science (Core Collection) (12 October 2018) and conducted a cited reference search for reports of all included trials. We handsearched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and grey literature. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials and cross-over trials of psychological therapies for treating anxiety or depression in children with long-term physical conditions were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Abstracts and complete articles were independently reviewed by two authors. Discrepancies were addressed by a third author. Odds ratio (OR) was used for comparing dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) for comparing continuous data. Meta-analysis was undertaken when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were similar. Otherwise, narrative analysis of data was undertaken. MAIN RESULTS Twenty-eight RCTs and one cross-over trial with 1349 participants were included in the review. Most participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high-income countries. For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short-term depression (versus any control), there was low-quality evidence from 16 trials involving 1121 participants suggesting that psychological therapies may be more effective than control therapies (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.03; I2 = 79%). For the primary outcome of treatment efficacy, short-term anxiety (versus any control), there was inadequate evidence of moderate-quality from 13 studies involving 578 participants to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions (SMD -0.26, CI -0.59 to 0.07, I2 = 72%). Planned sensitivity analyses could not be undertaken for risk of bias due to the small number of trials that rated high for each domain. Additional sensitivity analysis demonstrated that psychological interventions specifically designed to reduce anxiety or depression were more effective than psychological therapies designed to improve other symptoms or general coping. There was some suggestion from subgroup analyses that they type of intervention (Chi² = 14.75, df = 5 (P = 0.01), I² = 66.1%), the severity of depression (Chi² = 23.29, df = 4 (P = 0.0001), I² = 82.8%) and the type of long-term physical condition (Chi² = 10.55, df = 4 (P = 0.03), I² = 62.1%) may have an impact on the overall treatment effect.There was qualitative (reported), but not quantitative evidence confirming the acceptability of selected psychological therapies for anxiety and depression. There was low-quality evidence that psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions in improving quality of life (SMD 1.13, CI 0.44 to 1.82, I2 = 89%) and symptoms of long-term physical conditions (SMD -0.34, CI -0.6 to -0.06, I2 = 70%), but only in the short term. There was inadequate low-quality evidence to determine whether psychological therapies were more effective than control conditions at improving functioning in either the short term or long term. No trials of therapies for addressing health-related anxiety were identified and only two trials reported adverse effects; these were unrelated to psychological therapies. Overall, the evidence was of low to moderate quality, results were heterogeneous, and only one trial had an available protocol. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS A limited number of trials of variable quality have been undertaken to assess whether psychological therapies are effective for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions. According to the available evidence, therapies specifically designed to treat anxiety or depression (especially those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)) may be more likely to work in children and adolescents who have mild to moderate levels of symptoms of these disorders, at least in the short term. There is a dearth of therapies specifically designed to treat health-related anxiety in this age group.","Thabrew, Hiran; Stasiak, Karolina; Hetrick, Sarah E; Donkin, Liesje; Huss, Jessica H; Highlander, April; Wong, Stephen; Merry, Sally N",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012488.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578633/,762
148649,"Novel technique for total laparoscopic myomectomy: the ""bottom-up suture"".",2011,"INTRODUCTION The coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, and COVID-19 itself causes serious cardiac sequelae. Strategies to minimise the risk of viral transmission to health care workers and uninfected cardiac patients while prioritising high quality cardiac care are urgently needed. We conducted a rapid literature appraisal and review of key documents identified by the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand Board and Council members, the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons, and key cardiology, surgical and public health opinion leaders. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS Common acute cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 include left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, arrhythmias and acute coronary syndromes. The presence of underlying CVD confers a five- to tenfold higher case fatality rate with COVID-19 disease. Special precautions are needed to avoid viral transmission to this population at risk. Adaptive health care delivery models and resource allocation are required throughout the health care system to address this need. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS STATEMENT Cardiovascular health services and cardiovascular health care providers need to recognise the increased risk of COVID-19 among CVD patients, upskill in the management of COVID-19 cardiac manifestations, and reorganise and innovate in service delivery models to meet demands. This consensus statement, endorsed by the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons, the National Heart Foundation of Australia and the High Blood Pressure Research Council of Australia summarises important issues and proposes practical approaches to cardiovascular health care delivery to patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zaman, Sarah; MacIsaac, Andrew I; Jennings, Garry Lr; Schlaich, Markus P; Inglis, Sally C; Arnold, Ruth; Kumar, Saurabh; Thomas, Liza; Wahi, Sudhir; Lo, Sidney; Naismith, Carolyn; Duffy, Stephen J; Nicholls, Stephen J; Newcomb, Andrew; Almeida, Aubrey A; Wong, Selwyn; Lund, Mayanna; Chew, Derek P; Kritharides, Leonard; Chow, Clara K; Bhindi, Ravinay",The Medical journal of Australia,https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.50714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734645/,762

METHODS The study included 123 patients who underwent elective LS. Operative outcomes before and after the operative procedure was standardized and the impact of treatment with PA on surgical-site infection were investigated. RESULTS With regard to complications, wound infection developed in one (0.8%), portal trunk thrombosis in one (0.8%), pancreatic fistula in one (0.8%), postoperative bleeding in two (1.6%), pleural effusion in one (0.8%), and reoperation because of bowel injury in one (0.8%). Although morbidity did not differ between patients in the early (until the end of 2010) and late (after the beginning of 2011) periods, intraoperative blood loss was lower in patients in the late period. During the late period, no patients required conversion to open surgery. The proportion of patients with surgical-site infection did not differ between those who received PA 1 h before the start of surgery and every 3 h during surgery and those who received PA 1 h before the start of surgery, every 3 h during surgery, and twice a day for 24-72 h after surgery. CONCLUSION Operative outcomes after LS improved after the standardization of the operative procedure. The administration of PA 1 h before surgery and every 3 h during surgery seems to be sufficient to prevent surgical-site infection during LS.","Matsuda, Tsunemi; Kubo, Shoji; Ueno, Masaki; Takifuji, Katsunari; Yamaue, Hiroki; Takemura, Shigekazu; Tanaka, Shogo; Shinkawa, Hiroji; Yamada, Koichi; Kakeya, Hiroshi",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30411513/,762

We investigated the application of SILS for an appendectomy (SILS-A) in cases of complicated appendicitis and compare it with a conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (C-LA). METHODS This study involved a total of 40 patients who underwent C-LA or SILS-A in patients with complicated appendicitis; 25 patients received a C-LA, and the other 15 patients received a SILS-A. The clinical outcomes and cosmetic results were compared between the groups. RESULTS The SILS-A procedures were performed successfully in patients with complicated appendicitis, but 6 patients who underwent SILS-A needed an additional port for dissection and drainage. Clinical outcomes and postoperative complications were similar in both study groups. The SILS-A group showed significantly higher numbers of pain control than the C-LA group, and the one port SLLS-A group showed significantly better cosmetic result than the C-LA group. CONCLUSION SILS-A is technically feasible and safe in patients with complicated appendicitis. However, SILS-A has more postoperative pain than C-LA, and more active pain control should be considered for patients undergoing SILS-A.","Kang, Kyung Chae; Lee, Seok Youn; Kang, Dong Baek; Kim, Seung Ho; Oh, Jung Taek; Choi, Duk Hwa; Park, Won Cheol; Lee, Jeong Kyun",Journal of the Korean Society of Coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.3393/jksc.2010.26.6.388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21221238/,762

However, its mode of action and enzyme-selective inhibition mechanism have remained elusive. Intriguingly, MTh inhibits some thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) enzymes, while being coenzymatically active in others. Here we report the strong inhibition of Escherichia coli transketolase activity by MTh and unravel its mode of action and the structural basis thereof. The unique 2'-methoxy group of MTh diphosphate (MThDP) clashes with a canonical glutamate required for cofactor activation in ThDP-dependent enzymes. This glutamate is forced into a stable, anticatalytic low-barrier hydrogen bond with a neighboring glutamate, disrupting cofactor activation. Molecular dynamics simulations of transketolases and other ThDP enzymes identify active-site flexibility and the topology of the cofactor-binding locale as key determinants for enzyme-selective inhibition. Human enzymes either retain enzymatic activity with MThDP or preferentially bind authentic ThDP over MThDP, while core bacterial metabolic enzymes are inhibited, demonstrating therapeutic potential.","Rabe von Pappenheim, Fabian; Aldeghi, Matteo; Shome, Brateen; Begley, Tadhg; de Groot, Bert L; Tittmann, Kai",Nature chemical biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-020-0628-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839604/,762

With the epicentre of the outbreak projected to shift to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) after making significant impact in China, Europe, USA, and South America, it is necessary for countries in this region to begin to plan for how to tackle a rapid surge in cases. Health facilities are already being primed for increased presentation of COVID-19 cases. As countries prepare, they also need to consider how non-urgent services will not be interrupted. Estimates of a potential disruption in access to long and short acting contraceptives for up to 12 months will result in an additional 15 million unintended pregnancies and additional 28,000 maternal deaths. Thus, effort must be made to ensure that the gains made in SRH outcomes over several years are not lost. The potential of utilizing telemedicine to continue to offer healthcare services to the population for non-urgent care needs to be considered. It will not only provide for continued access to important services that can be delivered remotely but will reduce the risks of COVID-19 infection for both the client and the health workers.","Oyediran, Kolawole A; Makinde, Olusesan A; Adelakin, Olugbemiga",African journal of reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.29063/ajrh2020/v24i2s.8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34077053/,762

PROGRAM We describe logistics of establishing and operating isolation and noncongregate hotels for COVID-19 mitigation and use the isolation hotel as an opportunity to understand COVID-19 symptom evolution among people experiencing homelessness (PEH). IMPLEMENTATION Multiple agencies in Atlanta, Georgia, established an isolation hotel for PEH with COVID-19 and noncongregate hotel for PEH without COVID-19 but at risk of severe illness. PEH were referred to the isolation hotel through proactive, community-based testing and hospital-based testing. Daily symptoms were recorded prospectively. Disposition location was recorded for all clients. EVALUATION During April 10 to September 1, 2020, 181 isolation hotel clients (77 community referrals; 104 hospital referrals) were admitted a median 3 days after testing. Overall, 32% of community referrals and 7% of hospital referrals became symptomatic after testing positive; 83% of isolation hotel clients reported symptoms at some point; 93% completed isolation. Among 302 noncongregate hotel clients, median stay was 18 weeks; 61% were discharged to permanent housing or had a permanent housing discharge plan. DISCUSSION Overall, a high proportion of PEH completed isolation at the hotel, suggesting a high level of acceptability. Many PEH with COVID-19 diagnosed in the community developed symptoms after testing, indicating that proactive, community-based testing can facilitate early isolation. Noncongregate hotels can be a useful COVID-19 community mitigation strategy by bridging PEH at risk of severe illness to permanent housing.","Montgomery, Martha P; Paulin, Heather N; Morris, Asher; Cotton, Afrika; Speers, Austin; Boyd, Andrew T; Buff, Ann M; Mathews, Darlene; Wells, Alyssa; Marchman, Cathryn; Gaffga, Nicholas; Bamrah Morris, Sapna; Cavanaugh, Sean S",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762544/,762

149810,Utility of thoracic cage width in assessing surgical difficulty of minimally invasive esophagectomy in left lateral decubitus position.,2019,"BACKGROUND Approximately 18,000 Syrian refugees have resettled to the United States. Half of these refugees are children, whose age and refugee status jeopardize their abilities to attain quality healthcare. Information on Syrian refugees' health in the U.S. is limited. This qualitative study sought to explore Syrian refugee parents' beliefs, perspectives, and practices regarding their children's health through in-depth interviews. METHODS Eighteen Syrian refugee parents residing in Cincinnati, Ohio were interviewed in Arabic by bilingual researchers using semi-structured in-depth interviews. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated. Three members of the research team independently coded each interview using an inductive thematic analysis approach. RESULTS Analysis identified four salient themes: stressors preclude health seeking behaviors, parents perceive health barriers, parents are dissatisfied with the healthcare system, and parents use resilience behaviors to overcome barriers. Stressors included poor housing and neighborhoods, reliving traumatic experiences, depression and anxiety, and social isolation. Dissatisfaction included emergency room wait times, lack of testing and prescriptions. Health barriers included missed appointments and inadequate transportation, translation services, health literacy and care coordination. Parents reported resilience through faith, by seeking knowledge, use of natural remedies, and utilizing community resources. CONCLUSION This qualitative study provides information on the beliefs, practices, and behaviors of Syrian refugee parents related to health care utilization of pediatric refugees in the United States. Psychosocial and environmental stressors as well as perceived systemic health barriers, hinder health seeking behaviors in Syrian refugee parents. Culturally relevant care targeting perceived barriers and incorporating resilience behaviors may improve parental satisfaction and parental health seeking behaviors. Further study is needed to implement and evaluate interventions that target identified barriers.","Alwan, Riham M; Schumacher, Daniel J; Cicek-Okay, Sevsem; Jernigan, Sarah; Beydoun, Ahmed; Salem, Tasnim; Vaughn, Lisa M",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764783/,762
149847,Early experience with single-incision laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with mental retardation via a gastrostomy site incision: report of five cases.,2012,"PURPOSE The application of sentinel node navigation surgery in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not popular because of the difficulty of sentinel node identification and the low incidence of complications after systemic lymph node dissection. We report the intraoperative assessment of sentinel node metastasis by thoracoscopic ICG fluorescence imaging system and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHODS Sixty-one patients who underwent surgery between January 2009 and December 2010 were investigated for sentinel node biopsy. ICG fluorescence imaging was applied by an infrared light CCD system, and sentinel nodes were identified and dissected. Intraoperative real-time quantitative RT-PCR to determine the expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) was performed for evaluation of metastasis and finally histologic examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained, paraffin-embedded sections. RESULTS Sixteen (80%) of 20 patients with segmentectomy and 33 (80.5%) of 41 with lobectomy were identified for sentinel lymph nodes. The total identification rate was 80.3% (49 of 61). The false-negative rate was 2.1% (1 of 49). The overall accuracy rate was 78.7% (48 of 61 patients). Disease of four of these patients was upstaged to stage IIA by RT-PCR for CK-19 expression, which was positive for sentinel nodes and micrometastases. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrated that thoracoscopic ICG fluorescence imaging-guided surgery and real-time quantitative RT-PCR were useful for sentinel node biopsy and might be a powerful tool for more focused pathologic or molecular evaluation for staging.","Yamashita, Shin-ichi; Tokuishi, Keita; Miyawaki, Michiyo; Anami, Kentaro; Moroga, Toshihiko; Takeno, Shinsuke; Chujo, Masao; Yamamoto, Satoshi; Kawahara, Katsunobu",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-011-2145-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101727/,762
149925,Flexible videoscope for thoracoscopic lobectomy: evolution of uniportal technique.,2015,"OBJECTIVE Patient experience serves as both a subjective measure of value-based health care delivery and a metric to inform operational decision making. The objective of this study was to determine if specific diagnostic and therapeutic interventions affect patient experience scores for children seen in the emergency department. METHODS We performed a retrospective observational study in the emergency department of a large quaternary care children's hospital on patients who were discharged to home and later completed a National Research Corporation Health patient experience survey. We matched the survey results to electronic health record (EHR) data and were able to extract demographics, operational metrics, and order information for each patient. We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to determine the association of image acquisition, laboratory test ordering, medication administration, and discharge prescribing with likelihood to recommend the facility as our measure of patient experience. RESULTS Of the 4103 patients who met inclusion criteria for the study, 75% strongly recommended the facility. Longer wait times were associated with lower patient experience scores [odds ratio (OR) per waiting room hour increase, 0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65-0.81]. Significant diagnostic factors associated with higher patient experience included magnetic resonance imaging ordering (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.00-5.67), x-ray ordering (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.42), and electrocardiogram ordering (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.07-2.44). Of the treatment factors studied, only antibiotic prescribing at discharge was found to have a significant positive association with patient experience (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.63). CONCLUSION The positive association between more intensive diagnostic workups and patient experience could have implications on the utility of patient experience scores to evaluate pediatric care teams. Consideration should be taken to interpret patient experience scores in the context of compliance with approaches in evidence-based medicine.","Gorski, Jillian K; Mendonça, Eneida A; Showalter, Cory D",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000002485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140447/,762
150028,"Usefulness of a novel, slim long syringe-like device for applying surgical mesh through a 5-mm trocar.",2018,"INTRODUCTION Gallstone ileus (GI) results from the passage of a stone through a cholecystoenteric fistula, subsequently causing a bowel obstruction. The ideal treatment procedure for GI remains controversial. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 63-year-old female was admitted to our hospital following persistent nausea and vomiting for 7 days. Computed tomography revealed a partially calcified 4-cm circular object in the jejunum, and the proximal intestine was dilated, with concomitant pneumobilia. Based on the preoperative diagnosis of GI, enterotomy with stone extraction by single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was performed. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and the cholecystoduodenal fistula closed spontaneously 4 months after the surgery. DISCUSSION Recent studies have reported that enterotomy with stone extraction alone is associated with better outcomes than with more invasive techniques. This case also suggests that enterotomy with stone extraction alone and careful postoperative follow-up is feasible for the management of GI. Although the use of laparoscopy in the management of GI has been described previously, laparoscopic surgery has not been widely performed, and SILS is not generally performed. When only this less demanding procedure is required, laparoscopic surgery, including SILS, can be a viable option. CONCLUSION SILS can be an alternative surgical procedure for the management of GI.","Watanabe, Yusuke; Takemoto, Junkichi; Miyatake, Eiji; Kawata, Jun; Ohzono, Keigo; Suzuki, Hiroyuki; Inoue, Masaaki; Ishimitsu, Toshiyuki; Yoshida, Junichi; Shinohara, Masahiro; Nakahara, Chihiro",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2014.04.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858981/,762

150433,Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration using V-Loc suture with insertion of endobiliary stent.,2016,"OBJECTIVES We aimed to establish which of sitting height (SH) and total height (Ht) is most appropriately used in the scaling of adult body mass (BM), waist circumference (WC), and forced vital capacity (FVC), considering likely explanations and proposing a suitable index for each. METHODS Data were from the US Third National Health and Nutrition Survey for white and black American women and men aged 20 to 50 years. Statistical analysis involved mainly correlation coefficients, the multiple regression of BM, WC, or FVC on SH and leg length (LL), and fitting of allometric regression equations relating each of BM, WC, and FVC to SH or Ht. RESULTS BM and WC correlated more strongly with SH than with Ht, and FVC correlated more strongly with Ht. Associations with LL were negative for WC, negative or nonsignificant for BM, and positive for FVC. Using round-number exponents for Ht and SH, the allometric relationships indicated that appropriate indices are BM/SH3 , WC/SH, and FVC/Ht2 . CONCLUSIONS Contrary to usual practice, BM and WC are better scaled in relation to SH than to Ht. FVC is slightly better scaled in relation to Ht, as is conventional. Interpretations involve the small influence of LL on BM and the influence both of gluteo-femoral fatness on measured SH and of childhood health and nutrition on adult LL, WC, and FVC. It is evident that SH should be measured more often for research purposes.","Burton, Richard Francis; Burton, Francis Lindley",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530561/,762
150498,The crossover technique for intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy following laparoscopic total gastrectomy: a simple and safe technique using a linear stapler and two barbed sutures.,2019,"BACKGROUND Compression anastomosis has been recently abandoned because of a nonsuperiority compared to stapling anastomosis. Nonremoval of the rings has frequently been reported and this technique does not support a routine use. The aim of this experimental study was to assess the feasibility of anastomosis using compression with a device consisting of fragmented rings. METHODS A new compression device, the ""Anastocom,"" was compared to standard double-stapled colocolonic anastomosis in 2 groups of 8 pigs. In each group, colocolonic anastomosis was performed with a circular stapler (DST Series EEA Staplers) in 4 pigs and with the Anastocom device for the other 4 pigs. RESULTS The anastomotic rings were expelled between postoperative day 7 and day 13 from the 4 animals sacrificed at day 30. The anastomosis was clean and intact in all pigs. After sacrifice, there was no difference in the bursting pressure at day 7 ( P = .226) or at day 30 ( P = .885) between the 2 types of anastomosis. After sacrifice at day 7, the mean bursting pressure values for the Anastocom and EEA anastomoses were 128.6 mm Hg (range 119-143 mm Hg) and 218.9 mm Hg (range 84-240 mm Hg), respectively. After sacrifice at day 30, the mean bursting pressure values for the Anastocom and EEA anastomoses were 111 mm Hg (range 59-234 mm Hg) and 105 mm Hg (range 81-130 mmHg), respectively. CONCLUSION No bowel obstruction was observed with Anastocom. This fragmentation mechanism should better prevent nonexpulsion compared to basic compression anastomosis.","Vanbrugghe, Charles; Birnbaum, David Jérémie; Berdah, Stéphane Victor",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350617693125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28492355/,762

Antiphospholipidic antibodies were found in some studies. AIM Assessment of protein S activity in patients with COVID-19 as a cause this prothrombotic state, and of the association of protein S activity with worse outcome. METHODS All patients admitted for COVID-19 disease in a university hospital between 15th of May and 15th of July 2020 were prospectively enrolled into this cohort study. Patients treated with antivitamin K anticoagulants and with liver disease were excluded. All patients had protein S activity determined at admission. The main outcome was survival, secondary outcomes were clinical severity and lung damage. RESULTS 91 patients were included, of which 21 (23.3%) died. Protein S activity was decreased in 65% of the patients. Death was associated with lower activity of protein S (median 42% vs. 58%, p<0.001), and the association remained after adjustment for age, inflammation markers and ALAT. There was a dose-response relationship between protein S activity and clinical severity (Kendall_tau coefficient = -0.320, p < 0.001; Jonckheere-Terpstra for trend: p<0.001) or pulmonary damage on CT scan (Kendall_tau coefficient = -0.290, p<0.001; Jonckheere-Terpstra for trend: p<0.001). High neutrophil count was also independently associated with death (p=0.002). CONCLUSION Protein S activity was lower in COVID-19 patients, and its level was associated with survival and disease severity, suggesting that it may have a role in the thrombotic manifestations of the disease.","Stoichitoiu, Laura Elena; Pinte, Larisa; Balea, Marius Ioan; Nedelcu, Valentin; Badea, Camelia; Baicus, Cristian",Romanian journal of internal medicine = Revue roumaine de medecine interne,https://doi.org/10.2478/rjim-2020-0024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32841167/,762

They claim legitimacy for their decisions through reference to evidence-based scientific method and the implementation of just decision-making procedures, often citing the criteria of 'accountability for reasonableness'; publicity, relevance, challenge and revision, and regulation. Central to most decision methods are estimates of gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), a measure that combines the length and quality of survival. However, all agree that the QALY alone is not a sufficient measure of all relevant aspects of potential healthcare benefits, and a number of value assessment frameworks have been suggested. I argue that the practical implementation of these procedures has the potential to lead to a distorted assessment of value. Undue weight may be ascribed to certain attributes, particularly those that favour commercial or political interests, while other attributes that are highly valued by society, particularly those related to care processes, may be omitted or undervalued. This may be compounded by a lack of transparency to relevant stakeholders, resulting in an inability for them to participate in, or challenge, the decisions. The makes it likely that costly new technologies, for which inflated prices can be justified by the current value frameworks, are displacing aspects of healthcare that are highly valued by society.","Michaels, Jonathan Anthony",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33687915/,762

151144,Is single port enough in minimally surgery for pneumothorax?,2016,"OBJECTIVES Recently, EUCAST released guidelines for rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (RAST) directly from positive blood culture bottles. The aim of our prospective single-centre clinical study was to assess the proportion of readable results and errors compared with routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the clinical consequences drawn by infectious disease (ID) physicians from RAST results during same-day bedside consultation. METHODS All positive blood cultures suitable for RAST from January to December 2019 were included and RAST results at 4 and 6 h compared with standard disc diffusion. The real-life impact of RAST on clinical decisions was assessed during same-day ID bedside consultation. RESULTS The proportion of readable RAST results was significantly higher after 6 h of incubation compared with after 4 h (881/930 versus 642/847; P < 0.0001). Major and very major errors were rare (17/642 after 4 h and 12/881 after 6 h; P = 0.087). ID consultation was performed in 134 patients after the RAST result. Antimicrobial treatment was changed in 73 patients and 84 additional measures (i.e. imaging studies, surgery, additional resistance testing) were ordered in 62 patients. CONCLUSIONS RAST according to EUCAST methods was easy to implement with a low number of major and very major errors after 6 h of incubation. ID physicians performing bedside consultations frequently used this information to change antimicrobial treatment and recommended additional measures.","Valentin, Thomas; Koenig, Elisabeth; Prattes, Juergen; Wunsch, Stefanie; Loizenbaur, Tobias; Krause, Robert; Zollner-Schwetz, Ines",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkaa380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305799/,762

Balloon remodeling and permanent stent implantation may lead to thromboembolic complications or the need for antiplatelet use. A temporary stent that does not lead to complete flow arrest may be beneficial. METHODS We studied 20 New Zealand white rabbits in whom aneurysms were created using elastase and ligation of the right common carotid artery. The aneurysms were then embolized with bare platinum coils along with adjunctive treatment using the Comaneci device or the Hyperglide balloon. Assessments were made for endothelial injury using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy. RESULTS 20 rabbits of mean±SD weight 3.1±0.2 kg were studied. Twelve rabbits were treated with the Comaneci device and eight with the Hyperglide balloon. There were no substantial differences on SEM or light microscopy in the subacute and chronic phase to suggest the Comaneci device caused endothelial injury. CONCLUSIONS The Comaneci device is a new adjuvant treatment for bridging of wide necked aneurysms with the advantage of averting flow arrest during deployment.

In this study, the adaptation of single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery approach to primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients necessitating surgical treatment, with its pros and cons over the traditional two- or three-port approaches are examined. METHODS Between January 2011 and August 2013, 146 primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients suitable for surgical treatment are evaluated prospectively. Indications for surgery included prolonged air leak, recurrent pneumothorax, or abnormal findings on radiological examinations. Visual analog scale and patient satisfaction scale score were utilized. RESULTS Forty triple-port, 69 double-port, and 37 single-port operations were performed. Mean age of 146 (126 male, 20 female) patients was 27.1 ± 16.4 (range 15-42). Mean operation duration was 63.59 ± 26 min; 61.7 for single, 64.2 for double, and 63.8 min for triple-port approaches. Total drainage was lower in the single-port group than the multi-port groups (P = 0.001). No conversion to open thoracotomy or 30-day hospital mortality was seen in our group. No recurrence was seen in single-port group on follow-up period. Visual analog scale scores on postoperative 24th, 48th, and 72nd hours were 3.42 ± 0.94, 2.46 ± 0.81, 1.96 ± 0.59 in the single-port group; significantly lower than the other groups (P = 0.011, P = 0.014, and P = 0.042, respectively). Patient satisfaction scale scores of patients in the single-port group on 24th and 48th hours were 1.90 ± 0.71 and 2.36 ± 0.62, respectively, indicating a significantly better score than the other two groups (P = 0.038 and P = 0.046).

Although many of these vaccines are undergoing pre-clinical trials, several large clinical trials investigating the clinical efficacy and safety of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have produced promising findings. AREAS COVERED In this review, we provide a status update on COVID-19 vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials and discuss issues of concern beyond vaccine efficacy and safety, including dosing regimens, the mixed vaccine strategy, prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection, antibody levels, cellular immunity and protection, variants of concern, COVID-19 vaccine distribution, vaccination willingness, herd immunity, immunity passports, and vaccine indications. EXPERT OPINION Four vaccines have obtained emergency use authorization, 87 are at the clinical development stage, and 186 are in pre-clinical development. While the knowledge and development of COVID-19 vaccines is rapidly expanding, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines must outweigh the potential risks of adverse events. To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians should consistently update COVID-19-associated information, and healthcare authorities and manufacturers should work together to provide adequate and appropriate vaccinations for the prevention of COVID-19.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Chen, I-Tzu; Chao, Chien-Ming; Lee, Ping-Ing; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1949293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180347/,762

In this month's Magnet Perspectives column, we explore how the virtual site visit has provided healthcare organizations with the opportunity to complete this phase of their appraisal process while addressing the safety and well-being of the organization's staff as well as that of the Magnet appraisers.","Curto, Christine; Martin, Deborah Maust",The Journal of nursing administration,https://doi.org/10.1097/nna.0000000000000934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33074954/,762
151852,Initial multicenter technical experience with the Apollo device for minimally invasive intracerebral hematoma evacuation.,2015,"A survey of UK fertility counsellors' experiences of the impact on their service, including its availability, during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 received 64 responses. Fifty three respondents had continued to provide a service. Forty now worked from a wholly/substantially different location to normal but many clinics provided no practical support for this (n = 17), or remote access to relevant clinic (n = 17) or client information (n = 12) and twenty five respondents reported reduced multi-disciplinary involvement. Few received regular information updates. Some whose service was stopped (n = 11) abruptly lost income and/or were unsure whether they could or would resume working. Increased remote counselling proved crucial for accessibility and could be effective. Concerns included fatigue, technical and practical challenges, confidentiality, lowered therapeutic effectiveness. Respondents supported patients having choice over how to receive counselling in the future but a third (n = 21) had not been included in such planning. These findings suggest the need for increased involvement and support of fertility counsellors in the event of a future waves, other pandemic or healthcare crisis. More needs to be understood about why clinic responses varied; how to improve the safety and efficacy of remote counselling; and how to accommodate future needs for face-to-face contact.","Pericleous-Smith, Angela; Dark, Suzanne; McCluskey, Gerry; Mizen, Lynda; Crawshaw, Marilyn",Human fertility,https://doi.org/10.1080/14647273.2021.1898053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33749479/,762
152381,Stenosis after use of the double-stapling technique for reconstruction after laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy.,2013,"This work explores the unique antibiofilm activity of pentasilver hexaoxoiodate (Ag(5)IO(6)). To test this activity, wound dressings were impregnated with Ag(5)IO(6) and compared with various commercially available silver-containing dressings, as well as dressings containing chlorhexidine, iodine and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB). The materials were tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans for their ability to prevent micro-organism adherence, eliminate planktonic micro-organisms and disrupt/eliminate mature biofilms generated using the MBEC™ assay within 24 h of microbial exposure. Only the Ag(5)IO(6)-containing dressings were able to prevent adherence and eliminate surrounding planktonic micro-organisms for all species tested for ≥28 days of elution with log reductions >4. Two other silver dressings succeeded against P. aeruginosa only after 28 elution days, whilst the PHMB dressing succeeded after 28 days of elution against C. albicans only. Ag(5)IO(6)-containing dressings were able to generate >4 log reductions against all biofilms tested. The only commercial dressings able to generate >4 log reductions against biofilms were iodine against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, and PHMB against S. aureus. The Ag(5)IO(6) dressings demonstrated complete kill (>4 log reduction) in a standard 30-min planktonic log reduction assay against all species. These results demonstrate that Ag(5)IO(6) has superior activity to a number of antimicrobials, with broad-spectrum efficacy that includes long-term prevention of microbial adherence, rapid kill of planktonic micro-organisms, and the ability to disrupt and eliminate mature biofilms. Thus, Ag(5)IO(6) may be a valuable antimicrobial agent for use in a number of medical device applications, including wound dressings, various catheters or implants.","Incani, Vanessa; Omar, Amin; Prosperi-Porta, Graeme; Nadworny, Patricia",International journal of antimicrobial agents,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2014.09.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25604278/,762
152427,Standing thyroidectomy in 10 horses.,2018,"AIMS To evaluate the comparative cardiovascular disease (CVD) safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in head-to-head comparisons with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, sulphonylureas or insulin, when added to metformin, as used in 'real-world' patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS Within a large US commercial health plan database linked to laboratory test results, we identified three pairwise 1 : 1 propensity-score-matched cohorts of patients with T2DM aged ≥18 years treated with metformin who initiated a GLP-1 RA or a comparator, i.e. DPP-4 inhibitor (n = 35 534), second-generation sulphonylureas (n = 28 138) or insulin (n = 47 068), between 2005 and 2013. We examined the association between drug initiation and a composite CVD endpoint, comprising hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke or coronary revascularization. RESULTS During the course of 1 year, there were 13.9 and 13.7 CVD events per 1000 person-years among propensity-score-matched initiators of GLP-1 RAs versus DPP-4 inhibitors [hazard ratio (HR) 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84-1.24]; and 12.1 versus 14.0 events among initiators of GLP-1 RAs versus sulphonylureas (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.69-1.08). The effect estimates for GLP-1 RAs versus insulin were sensitive to the adjustment for glycated haemoglobin, after which the HR was 1.01 (95% CI 0.73-1.41). Results were robust across several sensitivity analyses, including an as-treated analysis considering up to 8.7 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This large study, performing head-to-head comparisons of GLP-1 RAs with other antidiabetic agents in real-world patients, provides estimates of relative safety precise enough to exclude large differences in CVD risk and adds further understanding to results from recent clinical trials.","Patorno, E; Everett, B M; Goldfine, A B; Glynn, R J; Liu, J; Gopalakrishnan, C; Kim, S C","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.12665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27003762/,762

152628,Risk factors for an additional port in single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with cholecystitis.,2017,"PURPOSE To evaluate, characterise and compare the extent of tissue shrinkage induced from three different commercial microwave ablation devices, and to elucidate the mechanism behind the distinctive performances obtained. MATERIALS AND METHODS Microwave ablation (N = 152) was conducted with three different commercial devices on cubes of ex vivo liver (10-40 ± 2 mm/side) embedded in agar phantoms. 50-60 W was applied for 1-10 min duration. Pre- and post-ablation dimensions of the samples, as well as the extent of carbonisation and coagulation were measured and correlated. ANOVA was performed to evaluate statistical significance. RESULTS For all devices, logarithmic correlations with time were observed for both tissue shrinkage (R2 = 0.84-1.00) and induced carbonisation (R2 = 0.73-0.99) radially to the antenna axis. Along the longitudinal axis of the antenna, for two of the devices shrinkage did not appreciably change with time (p > 0.05), yet carbonisation increased linearly (R2 = 0.57-0.94). For the third fully internally-cooled device, both carbonisation and shrinkage showed logarithmic trends (R2 = 0.85-0.98 and R2 = 0.78-0.94, respectively) based upon delayed carbonisation appearing only 5 min into ablation and onward. For all devices, non-uniform shrinkage was noted within the coagulated area increasing from the boundary of the ablated area (14%) to the limit of carbonisation (39%) in a linear fashion (R2 = 0.88) Conclusions: Microwave ablation device construction can alter the extent of post-ablation coagulation and tissue shrinkage. Given that tissue shrinkage in the coagulated area shows non-uniform behaviour, observed differences can be attributed in part to the applicator cooling system that alters the ablation temperature profile.","Farina, Laura; Nissenbaum, Yitzhak; Cavagnaro, Marta; Goldberg, S Nahum","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2017.1362115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28756721/,762

152921,Technique and short-term outcomes of single-port surgery for rectal cancer: a feasibility study of 25 patients.,2014,"BACKGROUND Research suggests that the disruptions introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased psychological distress and time spent on digital technology among young people, thus intensifying pre-pandemic concerns regarding the putative effects of digital technology use on mental health. To robustly examine whether increases in digital technology use are associated with increases in psychological distress during the pandemic it is crucial to (1) collect objective data on digital technology use and (2) account for potential confounding caused by pandemic-related stressors. METHODS We conducted a four-wave panel study of U.S. young adults (N=384; Mage = 24.5 ± 5.1; 57% female) from August-November of 2020. Participants provided screenshots of their iPhone ""Screen Time"" application and completed measures assessing current mental health status (depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation) and pandemic-related impacts on well-being. We used random-intercept multilevel models to examine the within- and between-person associations between mental health, objective digital technology use, and pandemic-related stressors. RESULTS Multilevel analyses revealed that none of the objectively-measured digital technology use variables were positively associated with depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation at the within- or between-person levels. In contrast, pandemic-related impacts on mental health had by far the largest effects on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. LIMITATIONS The convenience-based sample and use of single-item measures of pandemic-related impacts are limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS Current speculations about the direct harms of digital technology use on mental health may be unfounded and risk diverting attention from a more likely cause: pandemic-related distress.","Sewall, Craig J R; Goldstein, Tina R; Rosen, Daniel",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33894615/,762

153189,Evaluation of relative criteria for single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2018,"Systematic reviews (SRs) have been reported with increasing frequency as a means of collating studies which may have been performed over different period of times, in different geographical areas and by different groups of investigators. As SRs have become more common, quality metrics such as Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) have become available for these reviews. AMSTAR is an 11-point checklist that assesses the methodological and reporting quality of a SR. In clinical practice, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been increasingly used for the treatment and prevention of both venous and arterial thromboembolism. We sought to evaluate the quality of SRs published on DOACs using the AMSTAR criteria. A comprehensive search of Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 2013 to February 2019 was performed. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts for eligibility. Data extraction was also completed in duplicate. Categories of extracted data included AMSTAR rating, journal of publication, year of publication, number of studies included in the SR, reporting adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, number of times the paper was cited and journal impact factor. A total of 3729 articles were identified, of which 250 were eligible for analysis. SR quality was highly variable with mean (SD) AMSTAR score of 5.68/11 (2.21). Reporting adherence to PRISMA guideline correlated with a moderate (5-8) or high quality (9-11) (OR=4.19, p<0.01) AMSTAR score. The methodological quality of DOACs was generally rated to be low-moderate, and improved adherence to AMSTAR methodological practices are strongly recommended.","Eshaghpour, Ali; Li, Allen; Javidan, Arshia Pedram; Chen, Natalie; Yang, Sarah; Crowther, Mark Andrew",BMJ evidence-based medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2019-111326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32493834/,762
153200,A surgical glove port technique for laparoscopic-assisted ovariohysterectomy for pyometra in the bitch.,2016,"In this paper, we take up three terms - containment, delay, mitigation - that have been used by the UK Government to describe their phased response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the terms refer to a political and public health strategy - contain the virus, flatten the peak of the epidemic, mitigate its effects - we offer a psychosocial reading that draws attention to the relation between time and care embedded in each term. We do so to call for the development of a form of care-ful attention under conditions that tend to prompt action rather than reflection, closing down time for thinking. Using Adriana Cavarero's notion of 'horrorism', in which violence is enacted at precisely the point that care is most needed, we discuss the ever-present possibility of failures within acts of care. We argue that dwelling in the temporality of delay can be understood as an act of care if delaying allows us to pay care-ful attention to violence. We then circle back to a point in twentieth-century history - World War II - that was also concerned with an existential threat requiring a response from a whole population. Our purpose is not to invoke a fantasised narrative of 'Blitz spirit', but to suggest that the British psychoanalytic tradition born of that moment offers resources for understanding how to keep thinking while 'under fire' through containing unbearable anxiety and the capacity for violence in the intersubjective space and time between people. In conditions of lockdown and what will be a long and drawn-out 'after life' of COVID-19, this commitment to thinking in and with delay and containment might help to inhabit this time of waiting - waiting that is the management and mitigation of a future threat, but also a time of care in and for the present.","Baraitser, Lisa; Salisbury, Laura",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15970.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32704549/,762

One area of agreement among these reports is that front line health care workers, especially those who come into regular contact with Covid-19 patients, ought to be afforded highest priority. But this convergence, though significant, raises questions concerning the ethics of vaccine distribution among those highest-priority health care workers: If a hospital has inadequate supply to vaccinate its entire workforce, which of its essential workers should it prioritize? In this paper, we begin with a general overview of ethical questions of vaccine administration before narrowing our focus to some of the most pressing theoretical and practical issues hospital officials must face in building justifiable and actionable frameworks for vaccinating their workers. We discuss and assess some potential ambitions of hospital allocation plans, concentrating especially on the goal of protecting the community from catastrophic loss of life. Finally, we consider some specific questions hospitals will encounter when developing distribution guidelines that aim to realize this aspiration.","Reis-Dennis, Samuel; Applewhite, Megan K",Immunological investigations,https://doi.org/10.1080/08820139.2021.1924771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036865/,762

The CORR will characterize the role that individual characteristics, household characteristics, and community characteristics have on an individual's risk of opioid use disorder or opioid overdose. DATA SOURCES Study data sources include the voluntary Oregon All Payer Claims Database (APCD), American Community Survey Census Data, Oregon Death Certificate data, Oregon Hospital Discharge Data (HDD), and Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring (PDMP) Data in 2013 through 2018. STUDY DESIGN To create the CORR we first prepared the APCD data set by cleaning and geocoding addresses, creating a community grouper and adding census indices, creating household grouper, and imputing patient race. Then we deployed a probabilistic linkage methodology to incorporate other data sources maintaining compliance with strict data governance regulations. DATA COLLECTION / EXTRACTION METHODS Administrative datasets were obtained through an executed data use agreement with each data owner. The APCD served as the population universe to which all other data sources were linked. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS There were 3 628 992 unique people in the APCD over the entire study period. We identified 968 767 unique households in 2013 and 1 209 236 in 2018, and geocoded patient addresses representing all census tracts in Oregon. Census, death certificate, HDD, and PDMP datasets were successfully linked to this population universe. CONCLUSIONS This methodology can be replicated in other states and may also apply to a broad array of health services research topics.","Hallvik, Sara E; Dameshghi, Nazanin; El Ibrahimi, Sanae; Hendricks, Michelle A; Hildebran, Christi; Bishop, Carissa J; Weiner, Scott G",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.5259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913205/,762

A portable neuromodulation stimulation (PoNS) device rests on the tongue and stimulates cranial nerves V and VII (trigeminal and facial nerves, respectively). Emerging evidence suggests that CN-NINM using the PoNS device, combined with targeted physical therapy, improves balance and gait outcomes but has not yet been comprehensively reviewed. OBJECTIVE This review will describe CN-NINM via TLNS and its applications, effects, and implications for rehabilitation science in adult populations with neurological conditions. We will identify how CN-NINM via TLNS is currently being incorporated into neurological rehabilitation and identify gaps in evidence with respect to this novel technology. METHODS Joanna Briggs Institute methodology will be used to conduct this scoping review. Electronic databases MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science will be searched, as well as gray literature databases ProQuest, DuckDuckGo, and Google. Studies published in English and French between 2000 and 2021 will be included. Two reviewers will independently screen all titles and abstracts and full-text papers that meet the inclusion criteria. Data will be extracted and collated in a table to synthesize the results. Extracted data will be reported in a comprehensive summary. RESULTS The final manuscript is intended for submission to an indexed journal in September 2021. CONCLUSIONS This scoping review will be the first, to our knowledge, to address the current evidence on CN-NINM. The results will inform the use of CN-NINM in neurological rehabilitation and the development of recommendations for future research.

The number of COVID-19 cases in Japan in the early stage was not uniform and were largely concentrated in several prefectures. The distribution of the COVID-19 cases and the number of foreign travelers as well as Chinese travelers at prefectural level showed a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.68 (P<0.0001) and 0.60 (P<0.0001), respectively. Moreover, phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the all of the registered SARS-CoV-2 detected in from January 23 and through February 29, 2020 belonged to the Chinese lineage, while those detected in March 2020, belonged to American and European lineages. Only 14 (20.3%) were infected outside of Japan, but the majority of the cases (79.7%) were infected domestically. To conclude, higher number of COVID-19 cases were found in prefectures with more Chinese travelers, supporting the importance of enforcing policies to restrict entry of overseas travelers to control COVID-19 spread. These findings highlight the risk of secondary transmission in the community caused by apparent or silent imported cases.","Wagatsuma, Keita; Phyu, Wint Wint; Osada, Hidekazu; W Tang, Julian; Saito, Reiko",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2020.471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863355/,762

We hypothesized that age-related strength reductions might relate to differential changes in corticospinal and reticulospinal connectivity. Methods: We divided 83 participants (age 20-84) into age groups <50 (n = 29) and ≥50 (n = 54) years; five of which had probable sarcopenia. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was applied to the left cortex, inducing motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the biceps muscles bilaterally. Contralateral (right, cMEPs) and ipsilateral (left, iMEPs) MEPs are carried by mainly corticospinal and reticulospinal pathways respectively; the iMEP/cMEP amplitude ratio (ICAR) therefore measured the relative importance of the two descending tracts. Grip strength was measured with a dynamometer and normalized for age and sex. Results: We found valid iMEPs in 74 individuals (n = 44 aged ≥50, n = 29 < 50). Younger adults had a significant negative correlation between normalized grip strength and ICAR (r = -0.37, p = 0.045); surprisingly, in older adults, the correlation was also significant, but positive (r = 0.43, p = 0.0037). Discussion: Older individuals who maintain or strengthen their RST are stronger than their peers. We speculate that reduced RST connectivity could predict those at risk of age-related muscle weakness; interventions that reinforce the RST could be a candidate for treatment or prevention of sarcopenia.","Maitland, Stuart; Baker, Stuart N",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.612352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746734/,762

154653,Transvaginal specimen extraction in a laparoscopic anterior resection of a sigmoid colon neoplasia with en bloc right salpingo-oophorectomy.,2010,"The increasing number of studies demonstrates the high potency of the intrathecal (IT) route for the delivery of biopharmaceuticals to the central nervous system (CNS). Our earlier data exhibited that both the infused volume and the infusion rate can regulate the initial disposition of the administered solute within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This disposition is one of key factors in defining the subsequent transport of the solute to its intended target. On the other hand, fast additions of large volumes of liquid to the CSF inevitably raise the CSF pressure [a.k.a. intracranial pressure (ICP)], which may in turn lead to adverse reactions if the physiologically delimited threshold is exceeded. While long-term biological effects of elevated ICP (hydrocephalus) are known, the safety thresholds pertaining to short-term ICP elevations caused by IT administrations have not yet been characterized. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of ICP in rats and non-human primates (NHPs) with respect to IT infusion rates and volumes. The safety regimes were estimated and analyzed across species to facilitate the development of translational large-volume IT therapies. The data revealed that the addition of a liquid to the CSF raised the ICP in a rate and volume-dependent manner. At low infusion rates (<0.12 ml/min in rats and <2 ml/min in NHPs), NHPs and rats displayed similar tolerance patterns. Specifically, safe accommodations of such added volumes were mainly facilitated by the accelerated pressure-dependent CSF drainage into the blood, with I stabilizing at different levels below the safety threshold of 28 ± 4 mm Hg in rats and 50 ± 5 mm Hg in NHPs. These ICPs were safely tolerated for extended durations (of at least 2-25 min). High infusion rates (including boluses) caused uncompensated exponential ICP elevations rapidly exceeding the safety thresholds. Their tolerance was species-dependent and was facilitated by the compensatory role of the varied components of craniospinal compliance while not excluding the possibility of other contributing factors. In conclusion, large volumes of liquids can safely be delivered via IT routes provided that ICP is monitored as a safety factor and cross-species physiological differences are accounted for.","Belov, Vasily; Appleton, Janine; Levin, Stepan; Giffenig, Pilar; Durcanova, Beata; Papisov, Mikhail",Frontiers in neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.604197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935624/,762

When behavior guidance methods (eg, direct observation, tell-show-do, and ask-tell-ask) fail, general anesthesia is an important alternative; however, the procedure of anesthesia can also induce fear and anxiety. This study assessed the effectiveness of guided imagery in relieving the anxiety associated with dental surgery in children and caregivers. DESIGN A prospective randomized trial with two groups. METHODS The guided imagery in this study was meant to establish a rapport between the medical team and the patient, by encouraging the child to imagine having an adventure while riding in a spacecraft. Anxiety levels and behavior were measured using five well-established scales: the modified Yale Preoperative Scale-Short Form, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-6 items, the Watcha score, the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergent Delirium scale, and the Posthospitalization Behavioral Questionnaire-Ambulatory Surgery. FINDINGS The results indicate that the guided imagery had no significant effects on anxiety levels. CONCLUSIONS Guided imagery is a low-cost, easy-to-implement, interesting exercise capable of enhancing interactions between nursing staff and children. It may also help to condition children to the environment and thereby assist them in overcoming their fears.","Ko, Yu-Chen; Chou, An-Hsun; Wu, Chia-Fen; Chen, Jenny; Chen, Chun-Yu",Journal of perianesthesia nursing : official journal of the American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2020.04.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917508/,762

We describe a case of a 47-year-old male, who presented clinically with proximal muscle weakness, skin rash and elevated creatin kinase (CK) levels. The muscle biopsy revealed inflammatory myopathy, with perifascicular pathology, and scattered ectopic lymphoid follicles-like structures harboring reactive B-cells. Clonality analysis of B-cells using polymerase chain reaction ruled out malignant lymphoma. The patient responded favorably to steroid therapy, and his muscle weakness improved. In conclusion, the clinical and histopathologic features of DM can be atypical, and the presence of lymphoid follicles, although rare, is not inevitably linked to an unfavorable prognosis.","Maghrabi, Yazid; Hakamy, Sahar; Bahabri, Nizar; AlSobaei, Mohammed; Abuzinadah, Ahmad R; Kurdi, Maher",Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmd.2021.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407910/,762

PURPOSE The case of a transgender female who developed gallstone pancreatitis in the context of estrogen use for gender-affirming hormone therapy is reported. SUMMARY A 24-year-old Caucasian transgender female presented to the emergency department for abdominal pain and vomiting after referral from urgent care for suspected pancreatitis. Her home medications included estradiol, medroxyprogesterone, and spironolactone for gender-affirming hormone therapy and omeprazole for reflux. The patient reported minimal alcohol intake, presented with mildly elevated triglyceride levels, and did not have a family history of pancreatitis or gallstone disease. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on hospital day 4 and was given a postoperative diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and pancreatitis. Given her history and the present illness, the use of estrogen therapy is a likely risk factor for the development of gallstone pancreatitis. CONCLUSION Estrogen is a cornerstone of gender-affirming hormone therapy used by transgender women; however, in addition to its role in gender identity confirmation, estrogen can result in drug-induced pancreatitis.","Freier, Emily; Kassel, Lynn; Rand, Joel; Chinnakotla, Bhavana",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948625/,762

155768,Technique-associated outcomes in horses following large colon resection.,2017,"PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY Patient safety is a growing research area. However, although patients and the public are increasingly involved in clinical research, there is little guidance on how best to involve patients in patient safety research. Here we focus on how patients can contribute to the design of patient safety research. We conducted a workshop with patients as part of a project exploring errors and safety in the delivery of intravenous medication (medication given via a vein). The workshop was designed to explore how best to engage with hospital inpatients about these issues, to generate research topics, and to inform researchers about patients' experiences. Nine patients participated, each of whom had previously received intravenous medication. Participants advised against using terms such as 'error'; they also advocated caution when using terms such as 'safety' when describing the study to patients as this may worry some who had not thought about these issues before. We received thorough and useful feedback on our patient information sheets to ensure they were clear and understandable to patients. Patients also shared rich experiences with us about their treatment, which emphasised the need to extend our research focus to include a wider range of factors affecting quality and safety. ABSTRACT Background Patient safety has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This paper explores patients' contributions to informing patient safety research at an early stage, within a project on intravenous infusion errors. Currently, there is little or no guidance on how best to involve patients and the wider public in shaping patient safety research, and indeed, whether such efforts are worthwhile. Method We ran a 3-hour workshop involving nine patients with experience of intravenous therapy in the hospital setting. The first part explored patients' experiences of intravenous therapy. We derived research questions from the resulting discussion through qualitative analysis. In the second part, patients were asked for feedback on patient information sheets considering both content and clarity, and on two potential approaches to framing our patient information: one that focused on research on safety and error, the other on quality improvement. Results The workshop led to a thorough review of how we should engage with patients. Importantly, there was a clear steer away from terms such as 'error' and 'safety' that could worry patients. The experiences that patients revealed were also richer than we had anticipated, revealing different conceptions of how patients related to their treatment and care, their role in safety and use of medical devices, the different levels of information they preferred, and broader factors impacting perceptions of their care. Conclusion Involving patients at an early stage in patient safety research can be of great value. Our workshop highlighted sensitivities around potentially worrying patients about risks that they might not have considered previously, and how to address these. Patient representatives also emphasised a need to expand the focus of patient safety research beyond clinicians and error, to include factors affecting perceptions of quality and safety for patients more broadly.","Furniss, Dominic; Iacovides, Ioanna; Lyons, Imogen; Blandford, Ann; Franklin, Bryony Dean",Research involvement and engagement,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-016-0035-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29062520/,762
155964,Learning curves for single incision and conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy: a multidimensional analysis.,2015,"Over the last century, attending rounds have shifted away from the bedside. Despite evidence for greater patient satisfaction rates and improved nursing perception of teamwork with bedside presentations, residents and attending physicians are apprehensive of the bedside approach. There is lack of data to guide rounding practices within neurology, and therefore optimal rounding methods remain unclear. The objective of this study was to compare bedside rounding with hallway rounding on an academic neurology inpatient service and assess efficiency, trainee education, and satisfaction among patients and staff.We conducted a single-center prospective randomized study of bedside versus hallway rounding on new inpatient neurology admissions over one-week blocks. The bedside team presented patients at the bedside, while the hallway team presented patients outside of the patient's room. We evaluated the two approaches with time-motion analysis, which investigated the rounding style's effect on composition and timing of rounds (primary outcome), and surveys of patients, nurses, residents, and attending physicians on both teams (secondary outcomes).The mean rounding time per newly admitted patient in the bedside group (n = 38 patients) and hallway group (n = 41 patients) was 23 minutes and 23.2 minutes, respectively (p = 0.93). The bedside group spent on average 56.4% of patient rounding time in the patient's room, while the hallway group spent 39.5% of rounding time in the patient's room (p = 0.036). Residents perceived hallway rounding to be more efficient and associated it with a superior educational experience and more effective data review. Nurses had improved perception of their participation in bedside rounds. Though patients' views of bedside and hallway rounds were similar, patients who had experienced bedside rounds preferred it.In conclusion, bedside rounding was perceived less favorably by most residents but was as efficient as hallway rounding. Although bedside rounding limited the use of technology for data review, it promoted nursing participation and resulted in more time spent with the patient.","Solomon, Jacqueline M; Bhattacharyya, Shamik; Ali, Ahya S; Cleary, Liam; Dibari, Sarah; Boxer, Robert; Healy, Brian C; Milligan, Tracey A",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000012407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158383/,762

The safety of performing breast reconstruction during the pandemic was unknown. This study aims to review the safety of performing mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction during the first COVID-19 surge in Massachusetts. METHODS A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction by Massachusetts General Hospital breast and plastic surgeons immediately preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed. RESULTS Thirty patients (34 breasts) underwent mastectomies with immediate breast reconstruction during the COVID-19 restriction period in Massachusetts. Most reconstructions were unilateral. All reconstructions were performed with implants or expanders, and no autologous reconstructions were performed. Two patients (2 breasts) had operative complications. The complication rate during the pandemic was similar to the complication rate pre-pandemic. No patients or surgeons experienced symptoms or positive COVID-19 tests. Over 90% of patients were discharged the same day. CONCLUSION Prosthetic breast reconstruction was able to be performed safely during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic surge in Massachusetts. Strict screening protocols, proper use of personal protective equipment, and same-day discharge when possible are essential for patient and surgeon safety during the pandemic.","Faulkner, Heather R; Coopey, Suzanne B; Liao, Eric C; Specht, Michelle; Smith, Barbara L; Colwell, Amy S",Breast cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12282-021-01304-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652688/,762

METHODS This retrospective study included the initial 35 cases in each group. Learning curves were evaluated by the moving average of operative time, mean operative time of every five consecutive cases, and cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. The learning phase was considered overcome when the moving average of operative times reached a plateau, and when the mean operative time of every five consecutive cases reached a low point and subsequently did not vary by more than 30 minutes. RESULTS Six patients with missing data in the CL RHC group were excluded from the analyses. According to the mean operative time of every five consecutive cases, learning phase of SIL and CL RHC was completed between 26 and 30 cases, and 16 and 20 cases, respectively. Moving average analysis revealed that approximately 31 (SIL) and 25 (CL) cases were needed to complete the learning phase, respectively. CUSUM analysis demonstrated that 10 (SIL) and two (CL) cases were required to reach a steady state of complication-free performance, respectively. Postoperative complications rate was higher in SIL than in CL group, but the difference was not statistically significant (17.1% vs. 3.4%). CONCLUSION The learning phase of SIL RHC is longer than that of CL RHC. Early oncological outcomes of both techniques were comparable. However, SIL RHC had a statistically insignificant higher complication rate than CL RHC during the learning phase.","Park, Yoonah; Yong, Yuen Geng; Yun, Seong Hyeon; Jung, Kyung Uk; Huh, Jung Wook; Cho, Yong Beom; Kim, Hee Cheol; Lee, Woo Yong; Chun, Ho-Kyung",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2015.88.5.269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25960990/,762
156479,Port site hernia after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: a retrospective cohort study of 352 patients.,2018,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) has gained wide acceptance by both surgeons and patients, but hernias that approach a bony prominence are more complex due to the difficulty of proper fixation. This study was conducted to evaluate the use of bone anchor mesh fixation for complex LVHR. METHODS A prospective study of patients having complex LVHR with bone anchors was conducted using patients from 2 academic institutions between July 2003 and December 2007. Patient demographic data, characteristics of the hernia, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. RESULTS A total of 30 patients who had LVHR using bone anchors were evaluated (20 women, 10 men; mean age 60.9 years, range 41-83 years). In all, 17 suprapubic and 13 lateral hernias were included, requiring a mean of 2.8 and 3.2 bone anchors, respectively. The average hernia defect was 263 cm(2) (range 35-690 cm(2)), and the average mesh size was 663 cm(2) (range 255-1360 cm(2)). Mean operative time was 218 minutes (range 98-420 minutes), with an estimated blood loss of 46 mL (range 10-100 mL). The average length of stay was 5.2 days (range 1-26 days). Seven patients (23.3%) developed postoperative complications, and 1 patient in this study died (mortality 3.3%). During follow-up of 13.2 months (range 1-26 months), 2 patients (6.7%) developed a recurrent hernia. CONCLUSIONS Bone anchors can be used successfully in the laparoscopic repair of complex ventral hernias, particularly with suprapubic and lateral hernias that approach a bony prominence. The complication rate is acceptable, with a short hospital stay and low recurrence rate.","Yee, J A; Harold, K L; Cobb, W S; Carbonell, A M",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350608325231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18945708/,762

This study deals with the analysis of uncertainties in the data on material properties and model parameters, and their influence on the results delivered by advanced computational models of lyophilisation. As a means of uncertainty analysis, the Stochastic Collocation Method is applied, allowing the use of existing reliable deterministic models as black boxes in the stochastic computations. As a deterministic model, the lyophilisation model is used, based on the axisymmetric approximation of a vial, and the Boundary Element Method as a solver. Five parameters, covering material properties, process conditions and model constants, are selected for the sensitivity analysis simulation of the lyophilisation of an aqueous mannitol solution. The results show that during the initial stage of the primary drying heat transfer from the shelf is crucial, and that the uncertainties in the contact surface area and material properties of the vial play a more important role than the thermal properties of the drying material. When the temperature of the material reaches its distinct primary drying stage level the mass transfer through the porous cake becomes the most important, with great sensitivity to the Knudsen diffusivity in the porous cake. We observed uncertainties in the results for the primary drying time in the order of ±6%, and uncertainties in the results for temperatures of ±0.6°C in the frozen material and ±3°C in the porous cake. The uncertainty analysis proved to be a great help in determining the critical parameters in the heat and mass transfer during the important primary drying step, which led to a better definition of the numerical model for use in the context of design space determination.","Ravnik, J; Ramšak, M; Zadravec, M; Kamenik, B; Hriberšek, M",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2020.12.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385510/,762

Captive breeding and saving each individual are therefore becoming more important to save this species from extinction. This paper describes the husbandry and diets of successfully hand-reared Rothschild's giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi; n = 3) and reticulated giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata; n = 2). All calves were initially fed with bovine colostrum followed by cow's milk (Holstein milk; Holstein milk with 10% of bovine colostrum; Jersey and Guernsey milk). Additionally, lactase enzymes (Lactaidt, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Guelp, Ontario N1K1A5, Canada) and probiotics (Probiost, Vets Plus, Inc., Menomonie, WI 54751, USA) were used. Average growth varied from 764 to 1,239 g/day from birth until 2 mo of age and between 508 and 1,161 g/day from birth until last measurement before weaning. Hand-reared calves gained up to 21 cm in height within the first month and 82-138% of their birth weight during the first 2 mo. The giraffes were weaned at 6 (n = 1), 8 (n = 3), and 11.5 (n = 1) mo and successfully socialized and introduced to other giraffes. The described diets and husbandry proved to be effective in all five calves. Large amounts of cow's milk per feeding (up to 6 L) did not result in gastrointestinal problems.","Meuffels, Janine; Ververs, Cyrillus; Pootoolal, Jason; Zijll Langhout, Martine van; Govaere, Jan",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2018-0016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120680/,762

We examined the performance and quantitative aspects of the AGC. After IRB approval and individual informed consent, anesthesia in 24 ASA I-II patients undergoing abdominal or gynecological surgery was maintained with sevoflurane in O2/air with a target FIO2 of 40 % and a target sevoflurane FA (FAsevo) of 2.0 %. The AGC tool also allows the user to select 1 out of 9 different speeds with which the target FAsevo can be reached (with 9 being the fastest speed). Eight patients each were randomly assigned to speed 2, 4, and 6 (= group 2, group 4, and group 6, respectively); these three speeds were chosen arbitrarily. AGC was activated immediately after securing the airway, which defined the start of the study, and the study ended 60 min later. The following parameters were compared among the three groups: age, height, weight, FIO2, FAsevo, BIS values, heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, fresh gas flow, and sevoflurane usage. Agent usage as reported by the FLOW-i was compared among the three groups. Patient demographics and maintenance FGF did not differ among groups. A very short-lived very high FGF (≈20 L min(-1) for 8-12 s) ensured that the target FIO2 was attained within 1-2 min in all patients. FAsevo was 1.8 % after 15, 10, and 6 min, and 1.9 % after 30, 20 and 15 min in groups 2, 4, and 6, respectively. Blood pressure, heart rate, and BIS values did not differ among the three groups. BIS values remained acceptable in all patients, even with the slowest speed. Cumulative agent usage differed among all three groups between 2 and 30 min (lower with the lower speed), and between group 2 and 6 between 35 and 60 min. AGC combines an exponentially decreasing FGF pattern with a choice of ramp functions for the end-expired target concentration of the inhaled anesthetic. Consequently, both FGF and the choice of speed become factors that influence agent usage. After 15 min, a 300 mL min(-1) maintenance FGF reduces agent usage to near closed-circuit conditions. This new addition to our automated low flow armamentarium helps to reduce anesthetic waste, cost, and pollution, while minimizing the ergonomic burden of low flow anesthesia.","Carette, Rik; De Wolf, Andre M; Hendrickx, Jan F A",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-015-9723-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26072157/,762

Digital medicine is purported to enhance patient access to care while promising cost savings. Using institutional ethnography, we examined the potential for publicly funded digital testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) in Ontario, Canada. Our analyses draw from 23 stakeholder interviews with healthcare professionals conducted between 2019 and 2020, and textual analyses of government documents and private, for-profit digital healthcare websites. We uncovered a ""two-tiered"" system whereby private digital STI testing services enable people with economic resources to ""pay to skip the line"" queuing at public clinics and proceed directly to provide samples for diagnostics at local private medical labs. In Ontario, private lab corporations compete for fee-for-service contracts with government, which in turn organises opportunities for market growth when more patient samples are collected vis-à-vis digital testing. However, we also found that some infectious disease specimens (e.g., HIV) are re-routed for analysis at government public health laboratories, who may be unable to manage the increase in testing volume associated with digital STI testing due to state budget constraints. Our findings on public-private laboratory funding disparities thus discredit the claims that digital healthcare necessarily generates cost savings, or that it enhances patients' access to care. We conclude that divergent state funding relations together with the creeping privatisation of healthcare within this ""universal"" system coordinate the conditions through which private corporations capitalise from digital STI testing, compounding patient access inequities.

158729,The Early Results of the Laparoscopic Mini-Gastric Bypass/One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass on Patients with Different Body Mass Index.,2020,"BACKGROUND Ticagrelor has been shown to offer potential outcome benefits in acute coronary syndromes and for the long-term cardiovascular prevention, reducing mortality and the recurrence of ischemic events. However, data from real-world and recent meta-analyses have suggested that the anti-ischemic benefits of ticagrelor could be lower than expected, potentially outweighed by an increased risk of bleeding complications. Therefore, the aim of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the prognostic impact of ticagrelor as compared to the conventional antiplatelet agents (ASA and clopidogrel) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), enclosing patients with acute coronary syndromes and stable CAD. METHODS Literature and main scientific session abstracts were searched for studies comparing a ticagrelor-based antiplatelet regimen vs different antiplatelet agents in patients with CAD. The primary efficacy endpoint was mortality, and the primary safety endpoint was the occurrence of major bleedings. Secondary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). RESULTS We included 15 randomized clinical trials, with a total population of 73,402 patients (55% randomized to ticagrelor). At a mean follow-up of 15 ± 11.3 months, the ticagrelor based strategy did not significantly reduce mortality as compared to traditional therapy (OR[95%CI] = 0.88[0.70,1.09], p = 0.24; phet<0.00001), with comparable results and no interaction according to patients' presentation (p interaction = 0.80). A similar result was achieved for cardiovascular mortality, whereas the reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction was significant (OR[95%CI] = 0.84[0.78,0.90], p < 0.00001; phet = 0.76). As for the risk of stroke, the largest reduction was observed in stable patients, while a neutral effect was observed in the ACS subgroup (p int = 0.35). Major bleeding events were increased in ticagrelor-treated patients (OR [95%CI] = 1.40 [1.06, 1.84], p = 0.02; phet<0.00001), especially ICH (OR [95% CI] = 1.45[1.13,1.84], p = 0.003; phet = 0.93), and mainly among non-ACS patient. No interaction for any outcome endpoint was observed according to patients' age. CONCLUSIONS Based on the current meta-analysis, a ticagrelor-based strategy for the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease is associated to a significant increase in major bleeding complications and especially for intracranial hemorrhage, as compared to a strategy based on conventional antiplatelet agents, while resulting in a neutral effect on survival. However, a significant reduction of recurrent myocardial infarction was observed with ticagrelor.","Verdoia, Monica; Savonitto, Stefano; Dudek, Darius; Kedhi, Elvin; De Luca, Giuseppe",Vascular pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vph.2020.106828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385541/,762
158751,Permanent mesh results in long-term symptom improvement and patient satisfaction without increasing adverse outcomes in hiatal hernia repair.,2014,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE Medical schools have evolved toward competency-based education and active learner-centered strategies. Medical informatics course was introduced in 2011 in the 3rd year at the College of Medicine (CoM), King Saud University (KSU), to enhance future medical graduates with technological and information competencies. Modified team-based learning and blended learning were emphasized using face-to-face lectures, various e-learning technologies, workshop and seminars. The current study's main objective was to assess students' perceptions towards blended and modified team-based learning at the CoM in KSU. METHODS A survey was distributed to medical students in three consecutive years: 2017-2019. The survey contains items regarding student perception of various types of blended learning techniques applied in the course. The survey was administered using i-Clicker; an interactive device that enables students to answer survey questions. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the perception of students on these blended learning dimensions investigated. RESULTS Seven-hundred and one student responded to the questionnaire (male; 69.5%, female 30.5%). Out of which, 59.1% of students found team interactions positively supported discussions and asked questions freely, and 48.1% expressed that working in groups facilitated their learning process. However, 56.0% of students chose face-to-face lectures as the most preferred class activities followed by discussion 23.8%. More than 78% of participants agree that online quizzes are good experience and enjoyable. Grade center where students can check for marks and attendance also received high perception (66.3%). CONCLUSION Introducing modified team-based and blended-learning are considered challenging, and therefore, investigating their perceptions can provide useful insights into how these methods could be used more effectively. The blended-learning technique is highly essential in teaching medical informatics to overcome challenges faced due to a large number of students and the need for various exposures to reach the course's learning goals. Moreover, it is noticed that students were engaged in face-to-face and online activities, furthermore, modified team-based learning reported facilitating learning and asking questions without embarrassment.","Albarrak, Ahmed I; Zakaria, Nasriah; Almulhem, Jwaher; Khan, Samina A; Karim, Norshahriza Abdul",BMC medical education,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02639-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33832479/,762

STC can be defined as the hearing induced when vibratory stimuli reach skin and soft tissue sites not directly overlying skull bone such as the head, neck, thorax, and body. Examples of STC include the delivery of vibrations to the skin of parts of the body by a clinical bone vibrator, hearing underwater sounds and free field air sounds, while AC hearing is attenuated by earplugs. The vibrations induced in the soft tissues are apparently transmitted along soft tissues, reaching, and exciting the ear. Further research is required to determine whether the mechanism of the final stage of STC hearing involves the excitation of the ear by eliciting inner ear fluid pressures that activate the hair cells directly, by the induction of skull bone vibrations, or by a combination of both mechanisms, depending on the magnitude of each mechanism.","Sohmer, Haim",Trends in hearing,https://doi.org/10.1177/2331216517734087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28969522/,762

Antigen-presenting cells, in particular dendritic cells (DCs), are early and preferred targets of LASV, and their productive infection contributes to the virus-induced immunosuppression observed in fatal disease. Here, we characterized the role of the C-type lectin DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) in LASV entry into primary human DCs using a chimera of the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) expressing the LASV glycoprotein (rLCMV-LASVGP). We found that differentiation of human primary monocytes into DCs enhanced virus attachment and entry, concomitant with the upregulation of DC-SIGN. LASV and rLCMV-LASVGP bound to DC-SIGN via mannose sugars located on the N-terminal GP1 subunit of LASVGP. We provide evidence that DC-SIGN serves as an attachment factor for rLCMV-LASVGP in monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (MDDC) and can accelerate the capture of free virus. However, in contrast to the phlebovirus Uukuniemi virus (UUKV), which uses DC-SIGN as an authentic entry receptor, productive infection with rLCMV-LASVGP was less dependent on DC-SIGN. In contrast to the DC-SIGN-mediated cell entry of UUKV, entry of rLCMV-LASVGP in MDDC was remarkably slow and depended on actin, indicating the use of different endocytotic pathways. In sum, our data reveal that DC-SIGN can facilitate cell entry of LASV in human MDDC but that its role seems distinct from the function as an authentic entry receptor reported for phleboviruses.","Goncalves, Ana-Rita; Moraz, Marie-Laurence; Pasquato, Antonella; Helenius, Ari; Lozach, Pierre-Yves; Kunz, Stefan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01893-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23966408/,762
159499,Effect of local anesthetics on postoperative pain and opioid consumption in laparoscopic colorectal surgery.,2012,"BACKGROUND Given the increase in the number of deaths within long-term care facilities (LTCFs), the need for palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care education among such facilities has been increasing. As such, a systematic synthesis of global palliative and EOL care educational approaches and evaluation can aid further educational development. OBJECTIVE To synthesise the current literature on palliative and EOL care educational interventions for staff working in LTCFs and identify barriers to, and facilitators of, intervention implementation. METHODS The study used an integrative review framework wherein indexed databases, namely, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Japan Medical Abstract Society, were systematically searched for studies published in English and Japanese between 2007 and 2019. Search terms that are related to palliative care, LTCF, and education were combined to increase search sensitivity. The quality of the papers was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools and the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. RESULTS A total of 52 studies were included in the review. Our results suggested that although studies in this area and setting have been evolving, suboptimal developmental research and educational practices, global variability and unstandardised approaches to education and lacking viewpoints from service users have remained. Barriers to intervention implementation were also reported due to the specific characteristics of LTCFs, which include high staff turnover and considerable variation in professional skills and experience. CONCLUSIONS Given the different LTCF types, systems and policies across each country or region, further research on standardised educational interventions with contextual considerations using large-scale studies with robust methodology is needed to meet the increasing demand for palliative and EOL care among the global ageing population. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Palliative and EOL care educational intervention for LTCF staff need to include more consideration of context, organisational culture and the user involvement throughout the process of education and research to enhance the quality of care in this complex setting.","Iida, Kieko; Ryan, Assumpta; Hasson, Felicity; Payne, Sheila; McIlfatrick, Sonja",International journal of older people nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/opn.12347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32918793/,762

159618,Raising the quality of hernia care: Is there a need?,2015,"OBJECTIVE By the end of February 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic infection had spread in Northern Italy, with thousands of patients infected. In Lombardy, the most affected area, the majority of public and private hospitals were dedicated to caring for COVID-19 patients and were organized following the 'Hub-and-Spoke' model for other medical specialties, like cardiac surgery and interventional procedures for congenital cardiac disease (CHD). Here, we report how the congenital cardiac care system was modified in Lombardy and the first results of this organization. METHODS We describe a modified 'Hub-and-Spoke' model - that involves 59 birthplaces and three specialized Congenital Cardiac Centers -- and how the hub center organized his activity. We also reported the data of the consecutive cases hospitalized during this period. RESULTS From 9 March to 15 April, we performed: a total of 21 cardiac surgeries, 4 diagnostic catheterizations, 3 CT scans, and 2 CMR. In three cases with prenatal diagnosis, the birth was scheduled. The spoke centers referred to our center six congenital cardiac cases. The postop ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation support was required in two cases; one case died. None of these patients nor their parents or accompanying person was found to be COVID-19-positive; 2 pediatric intensivists were found to be COVID-19-positive, and needed hospitalization without mechanical ventilation; 13 nurses had positive COVID swabs (4 with symptoms), and were managed and isolated at home. CONCLUSION Our preliminary data suggest that the model adopted met the immediate needs with a good outcome without increased mortality, nor COVID-19 exposure for the patients who underwent procedures.","Chessa, Massimo; Varrica, Alessandro; Andronache, Andreea; Carminati, Mario; Colli, Anna Maria; D'Aiello, Angelo Fabio; Ferrero, Paolo; Mannarino, Savina; Marcora, Simona; Marianeschi, Stefano Maria; Micheletti, Angelo; Piazza, Luciane; Saracino, Antonio; Uricchio, Nicola; Vignati, Gabriele; Giamberti, Alessandro",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32740429/,762

BACKGROUND ESAs have effects beyond erythropoiesis. The administration of the ESA epoetin alfa to critically ill trauma patients has been associated with a reduction in mortality. METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis. We searched Medline, Medline in Process, and other nonindexed citations, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database from inception until September 9, 2015, for randomized controlled trials comparing ESAs to placebo (or no ESA). RESULTS We identified 9 eligible studies that randomly assigned 2607 critically ill patients after trauma to an ESA or placebo (or no ESA). Compared with placebo (or no ESA), ESA therapy was associated with a substantial reduction in mortality [risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.79, P = 0.0001, I = 0%). In patients with traumatic brain injury, ESA therapy did not increase the number of patients surviving with moderate disability or good recovery (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88-1.15, P = 0.95, I = 0%). With the dosing regimens employed in the included studies, ESA therapy did not increase the risk of lower limb proximal deep venous thrombosis (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72-1.29, P = 0.78, I = 0%). CONCLUSIONS The administration of ESAs to critically ill trauma patients is associated with a significant improvement in mortality without an increase in the rate of lower limb proximal deep venous thrombosis. Given the worldwide public health significance of these findings research to validate or refute them is required.","French, Craig J; Glassford, Neil J; Gantner, Dashiell; Higgins, Alisa M; Cooper, David James; Nichol, Alistair; Skrifvars, Markus B; Imberger, Georgina; Presneill, Jeffrey; Bailey, Michael; Bellomo, Rinaldo",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000001746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27070933/,762

The downstaging subgroups include 1 lesion >5 and ≤8 cm (n = 43), 2 or 3 lesions at least one >3 and ≤5 cm with total tumor diameter ≤8 cm (n = 61), or 4-5 lesions each ≤3 cm with total tumor diameter ≤8 cm (n = 14). In the downstaging group, 64 patients (54.2%) had received LT and 5 (7.5%) developed HCC recurrence. Two of the five patients with HCC recurrence had 4-5 tumors at presentation. The 1- and 2-year cumulative probabilities for dropout (competing risk) were 24.1% and 34.2% in the downstaging group versus 20.3% and 25.6% in the T2 group (P = 0.04). Kaplan-Meier's 5-year post-transplant survival and recurrence-free probabilities were 77.8% and 90.8%, respectively, in the downstaging group versus 81% and 88%, respectively, in the T2 group (P = 0.69 and P = 0.66, respectively). The 5-year ITT survival was 56.1% in the downstaging group versus 63.3% in the T2 group (P = 0.29). Factors predicting dropout in the downstaging group included pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein ≥1,000 ng/mL (multivariate hazard ratio [HR]: 2.42; P = 0.02) and Child's B versus Child's A cirrhosis (multivariate HR: 2.19; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION Successful downstaging of HCC to within T2 criteria was associated with a low rate of HCC recurrence and excellent post-transplant survival, comparable to those meeting T2 criteria without downstaging. Owing to the small number of patients with 4-5 tumors, further investigations are needed to confirm the efficacy of downstaging in this subgroup.","Yao, Francis Y; Mehta, Neil; Flemming, Jennifer; Dodge, Jennifer; Hameed, Bilal; Fix, Oren; Hirose, Ryutaro; Fidelman, Nicholas; Kerlan, Robert K; Roberts, John P",Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.27752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25689978/,762
160407,"The NOVEL trial: natural orifice versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy-a prospective, randomized evaluation.",2018,"BACKGROUND Cognitive dysfunction is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery and has been found to be associated with decreases in cerebral oxygen saturation measured with near-infrared spectroscopy. Sevoflurane has neuroprotective properties in vitro and in animal models. This study was designed to determine cognitive and clinical outcomes after sevoflurane- compared with propofol-based anaesthesia for on-pump cardiac surgery and the impact of decreases in under different anaesthesia regimens. METHODS One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to either i.v. anaesthesia with propofol- (PROP) or sevoflurane-based anaesthesia (SEVO). An intraoperative was defined as desaturation. The Abbreviated Mental Test, Stroop Test, Trail-Making Test, Word Lists, and mood-assessment tests were performed before, 2, 4, and 6 days after cardiac surgery. Markers of general outcome were obtained. RESULTS The analysis groups had differences in baseline cognitive performance. Analysis of variance for repeated measures (incorporating covariance of baseline scores) showed that in three of four cognitive tests, patients with cerebral desaturation showed worse results than patients without desaturation. Patients assigned to sevoflurane-based anaesthesia showed better results in all cognitive tests than patients after propofol. Interactions between the anaesthetic regimen and desaturation were found in all four cognitive tests. There were no differences in markers of organ dysfunction or general clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS Patients with impaired cognitive performance before operation may be at particular risk for intraoperative cerebral insult. A sevoflurane-based anaesthesia was associated with better short-term postoperative cognitive performance than propofol.","Schoen, J; Husemann, L; Tiemeyer, C; Lueloh, A; Sedemund-Adib, B; Berger, K-U; Hueppe, M; Heringlake, M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aer091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21518736/,762

There are some oncological indications that have special priority and studies are still being carried out despite the current situation. In these studies we have found suspicious findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic patients. The objective of this work is to assess the incidence of these findings, describe their characteristics and the evolution of suspected patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Oncological PET studies carried out in asymptomatic patients between March 18 and April 8, 2020 have been reviewed. Patients who presented findings suggestive of corresponding to an pulmonary infectious process were selected. Clinical findings have been reviewed to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS During the specified period, a total of 129 PET/CT studies were performed. Of these, 11 (8.5%) found suspicious findings of a pulmonary infectious process. These were 8 men and 3 women aged between 30 and 79 years (mean 62.2). CONCLUSIONS Patients with COVID-19 can present few symptoms of the disease, and in PET/CT studies both presymptomatic and almost asymptomatic patients can be detected, so nuclear medicine physicians should take special attention to the pulmonary evaluation of PET/CT studies.","Mucientes Rasilla, J; Jimeno Pernett, R; Cardona Arboniés, J",Revista espanola de medicina nuclear e imagen molecular,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.remn.2020.04.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532586/,762

161517,Risk factors for conversion to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy in single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2016,"Antibody-based interventions against SARS-CoV-2 could limit morbidity, mortality, and possibly disrupt epidemic transmission. An anticipated correlate of such countermeasures is the level of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, yet there is no consensus as to which assay should be used for such measurements. Using an infectious molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses eGFP as a marker of infection, we replaced the glycoprotein gene (G) with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and developed a high-throughput imaging-based neutralization assay at biosafety level 2. We also developed a focus reduction neutralization test with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 at biosafety level 3. We compared the neutralizing activities of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody preparations, as well as ACE2-Fc soluble decoy protein in both assays and find an exceptionally high degree of concordance. The two assays will help define correlates of protection for antibody-based countermeasures including therapeutic antibodies, immune γ-globulin or plasma preparations, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Replication-competent VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 provides a rapid assay for testing inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 mediated entry that can be performed in 7.5 hours under reduced biosafety containment.

METHODS The clinical course of a patient with right colon cancer recurrent within the resection site and on the anterior aspect of the duodenum was reviewed. RESULTS Resection of recurrent right colon cancer was accomplished by subtotal duodenectomy. Reconstruction was with jejunal advancement and reimplantation of the ampulla of Vater. No postoperative complications occurred and palliation was excellent. CONCLUSIONS Prevention of recurrent right colon cancer is an import consideration for primary resection.

To date, no published research has been found on stroke caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore Hong Kong stroke caregivers' caregiving experiences in the midst of this difficult time. METHODS Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 Chinese adult primary stroke caregivers from May to June 2020 via telephone. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using an interpretive description approach and constant comparison strategy. RESULTS Five themes of the stroke caregiving experience during the COVID-19 pandemic emerged: care service adversities, additional caregiving workload and strain, threatened relationship between caregiver and stroke survivors, threats to caregivers' physical and psychological well-being, and needs for continuing caregiving roles. Our findings suggested that caregivers have worsened physical and psychological well-being because of increases in care burden with simultaneously reduced formal and informal support. The relationship between caregiver and stroke survivor was subsequently affected, placing some survivors at heightened risk of abuse. CONCLUSIONS Our study provides valuable findings about stroke caregiving experiences and needs during the pandemic. Delivery of psychological support, telemedicine, and household hygiene resources would be useful to mitigate caregivers' psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Jung Jae; Tsang, Wing Nga; Yang, Sook Ching; Kwok, Jojo Yan Yan; Lou, Vivian W Q; Lau, Kui Kai",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.032250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588588/,762

The paper presents a case study approach in a Nagpur, India to understand the relation between urban population density and the COVID-19 spread during the first wave. Spatial density maps and COVID-19 patient data for five consecutive critical months have been correlated using the corona index method. The corona index helps to determine the severity of the disease spread in neighbourhoods of varying population densities. The study reveals a high corona index in high-density areas and a low corona index in low- and medium-density areas. It shows that although high-density planning is sustainable, it proves hazardous for public health during pandemics. The study reveals that high-density areas are at a greater risk of disease spread during pandemics.","Kamble, Tanushri Bahadure Sarika",Journal of Settlements and Spatial Planning,https://doi.org/10.24193/jssp.2021.1.03,762

In 81 % of cases, mortality in COVID-19 patients is associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Another critical challenge associated with COVID-19 is the development of a cytokine storm, which is an uncontrolled release of proinflammatory mediators due to the excessive activation of immune system. Cytokine storm is another cause of high mortality because of COVID-19, as it leads to multiple organ failure, ARDS and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Thus, the management of cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients is an urgent issue for the medical society. Recent research assessed the potential role of interleukin(IL)-17 in the pathogenesis of cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Some authors also pointed to using anti-IL17 medications in the management of patients with severe COVID-19.

The paper offers a comprehensive study on the role of digital technologies and its important impact on employees in the competitive world. A measure for the role of digital technologies and employee experience was built and tested for its reliability and validity. Descriptive statistics were used to understand the importance of digital technology and its impact on the employee experience in Indian firms. The results show that if a company has to thrive through these testing times, the only solution is through the integration of technology into their organizational structure. This has to be a permanent inclusion instead of a temporary solution for battling the side effects of the Covid-19 lockdown. The results also show that technological resolutions offer sustainable compensations across the business segments, and companies should emphasize investing in updating employee’s skill sets. Through the survey, it was also evident that organizations and institutions irrespective of their size or market share had to incorporate employee development including basic technological know-how apart from technical skill sets.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic and anti-rotavirus properties of crude extracts of A. kellalensis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried and powdered flowers of Achillea kellalensis were extracted with hot water and ethanol 50% (v/v). The cell viability and toxicity of the extracts were evaluated on MA-104 cells using four methods; trypan blue dye, NR, crystal violet and MTT assay. The in vitro anti-rotavirus properties were determined via four different assays, in order to evaluate the direct inhibition and/or the inhibition of viral replication. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity of two A. kellalensis extracts showed different concentrations. Hydro-alcoholic extract had low CC(50) at 600 µg/mL by the NR assay while the aqueous extract had high CC(50) at 1000µg/mL by the crystal violet method. In the simultaneous treatment assay and post treatment assay, the extracts were able to prevent viral replication and inhibit the viral CPE on MA-104 cells at 10 TCID(50), but the extracts did not exhibit direct antiviral activity on rotavirus adsorption. The effective concentration (EC(50)) of both extracts was observed to be 100 µg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that A. kellalensis extracts exert potent anti-rotaviral activity only after viral adsorption. The two extracts from A. kellalensis showed a good selectivity index. Also these results suggest that extracts prepared from the flowers of A. kellalensis may be potential anti-rotaviral agents in vivo and be useful in veterinary medicine.","Taherkhani, Reza; Farshadpour, Fatemeh; Makvandi, Manoochehr",Jundishapur J Nat Pharm Prod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941895/,762

The present study aims to investigate the echocardiography findings in COVID-19 patients and possible correlations between the findings and the disease outcome. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, baseline characteristics and echocardiographic findings of hospitalized COVID-19 cases, and their correlation with mortality were evaluated. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed to assess possible pulmonary embolism. In-hospital mortality was considered as the main outcome of the present study. RESULTS: 680 confirmed COVID-19 cases with the mean age of 55.15 ± 10.92 (range: 28 – 79) years were studied (63.09% male). Analysis showed that history of ischemic heart disease (RR=1.14; 95% CI: 1.08-1.19), history of hypertension (RR=1.04; 95% CI: 1.00-1.08), presence of embolism in main pulmonary artery (RR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.35-1.74), CT involvement more than 70% (RR=1.08; 95% CI: 1.1.01-1.16), left ventricular ejection fraction < 30 (RR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.07-1.32), pleural effusion (RR=1.08; 95% CI: 1.00-1.16), pulmonary artery systolic blood pressure 35 to 50 mmHg (RR=1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.18), right ventricular dysfunction (RR=1.54; 95% CI: 1.40-1.08), and collapsed inferior vena-cava (RR=1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.08) were independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that cardiac involvement is a prevalent complication in COVID-19 patients. Echocardiography findings have independent prognostic value for prediction of in-hospital mortality. Since echocardiography is an easy and accessible method, echocardiography monitoring of COVID-19 patients can be used as a screening tool for identification of high-risk patients.","Pishgahi, Mehdi; Karimi Toudeshki, Kimia; Safari, Saeed; Yousefifard, Mahmoud",Arch Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8035697/,762

188668,Single-port laparoscopic surgery by use of a surgical glove port: initial experience with 25 cases.,2013,"The molecular determinants of stimulation of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) by RNA pseudoknots are poorly understood. Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) encodes a 28-nt mRNA pseudoknot that promotes -1 PRF between the P1 (protease) and P2 (polymerase) genes in plant luteoviruses. The solution structure of the ScYLV pseudoknot reveals a well ordered loop 2 (L2) that exhibits continuous stacking of A20 through C27 in the minor groove of the upper stem 1 (S1), with C25 flipped out of the triple-stranded stack. Five consecutive triple base pairs flank the helical junction where the 3' nucleotide of L2, C27, adopts a cytidine 27 N3-cytidine 14 2'-OH hydrogen bonding interaction with the C14-G7 base pair. This interaction is isosteric with the adenosine N1-2'-OH interaction in the related mRNA from beet western yellows virus (BWYV); however, the ScYLV and BWYV mRNA structures differ in their detailed L2-S1 hydrogen bonding and L2 stacking interactions. Functional analyses of ScYLV/BWYV chimeric pseudoknots reveal that the ScYLV RNA stimulates a higher level of -1 PRF (15 +/- 2%) relative to the BWYV pseudoknot (6 +/- 1%), a difference traced largely to the identity of the 3' nucleotide of L2 (C27 vs. A25 in BWYV). Strikingly, C27A ScYLV RNA is a poor frameshift stimulator (2.0%) and is destabilized by approximately 1.5 kcal x mol(-1) (pH 7.0, 37 degrees C) with respect to the wild-type pseudoknot. These studies establish that the precise network of weak interactions nearest the helical junction in structurally similar pseudoknots make an important contribution to setting the frameshift efficiency in mRNAs.","Cornish, Peter V; Hennig, Mirko; Giedroc, David P",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16123125/,762

Because the cats were coinfected with other potential pathogens, including Campylobacter helveticus, and because H. canis was isolated from nondiarrheic cats, the causal role of H. canis in producing the diarrhea could not be proven. Histologically, the colons of the four affected cats were characterized by mild to moderate neutrophilic, plasmacytic, and histocytic infiltrates in the lamina propria. Rare crypt abscesses were also noted for three cats but were a more prominent feature of the colonic lesions noted for the fourth cat. This is the first observation of H. canis in cats and raises the possibility that H. canis, like H. hepaticus and H. bilis in mice, can cause inflammation of the colon, particularly in hosts with immune dysregulation.

Two laparoscopic accesses to the adrenal have been developed: transperitoneal and retroperitoneal. Retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy may be recommended for the treatment of pheochromocytoma with the same peri-operative outcomes of the transperitoneal approach because it allows direct access to the adrenal glands without increasing the operative risks. Although technically more demanding than the transperitoneal approach, retroperitoneoscopy can shorten the mean operative time, which is critical for cases with pheochromocytoma where minimizing the potential for intra-operative hemodynamic changes is essential. Blood loss and the convalescence time can be also shortened by this approach. There is no absolute indication for either the transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach; however, the latter procedure may be the best option for patients who have undergone previous abdominal surgery and obese patients. Also, retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy is a good alternative for treating cases with inherited pheochromocytomas, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, in which the pheochromocytoma is highly prevalent and frequently occurs bilaterally.","Hisano, Marcelo; Vicentini, Fabio Carvalho; Srougi, Miguel",Clinics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22584723/,762

METHODS Between March and June 2003, 122 patients with possible SARS were admitted to the isolation ward of Tri-Service General Hospital. SARS was diagnosed according to the modified World Health Organization case definition (May 1, 2003). Among them, 43 were classified as probable SARS cases and a SARS etiology was excluded in 32 patients. RESULTS Presenting symptoms on admission included fever (97.7% of probable cases, 84.4% of excluded cases), chills (39.5% vs 18.8%), cough with sputum production (16.3% vs 40.6%), dry cough (23.3% vs 9.4%), dyspnea (18.6% vs 9.4%), diarrhea (14.0% vs none), rhinorrhea (2.3% vs none), and myalgia (7.0% vs 6.6%). Common laboratory features included lymphopenia and elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein and creatine kinase values. Intubation and mechanical ventilation were required in 12 probable cases and 6 excluded cases. Five patients with probable SARS (11.6%) died. A scoring system which was developed to differentiate SARS patients from other febrile patients in the emergency room could differentiate probable cases from excluded cases with a sensitivity of 36.4% and a specificity of 70.6%. CONCLUSIONS The clinical presentation and laboratory features at the early stage do not allow differentiation of patients with SARS-CoV infection from other febrile patients.

This result suggests that the recombinant PAS16 antibody can be applicable for the rapid immunohistochemical diagnosis of PEDV infection.","Lee, H M; Lee, B J; Tae, J H; Kweon, C H; Lee, Y S; Park, J H",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10770610/,762

METHOD A literature search was conducted in PubMed, the Spanish Official State Gazette and Eudralex. The websites of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and of the Ministry of Health, as well as the relevant UNE standards were also reviewed. RESULTS The different types of face masks available on the market meet different regulatory requirements. Community masks are not considered medical devices or personal protective equipment and do not require marketing authorization. They do not carry a CE mark and need not comply with the general regulations applicable to consumer products. Surgical masks, for their part, must meet the quality criteria defined in UNE-EN standard 14683: 2019. According to Regulation (EU) 745/2017 they are class I devices, subject to an EU declaration of conformity, and must bear a CE mark. Filtering masks are considered category III personal protective equipment, regulated by Regulation (EU) 2016/425, and must also bear a CE mark. In spite the abundant regulations in place, market control instruments have detected counterfeit face masks, which means that public authorities and users should ask manufacturers or suppliers for additional information in case of doubt. CONCLUSIONS The legal and quality requirements of the masks are sufficient for their safe use. It is necessary for the general public to know these requirements to avoid the fraudulent use of high consumption products.","Fraga-García, Miriam; Nácher-Alonso, Amparo; Díez-Sales, Octavio",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218765/,762

During experimental rhinovirus infection, expression of ICAM-1 on nasal epithelial cells was examined with immunohistochemical staining of nasal scrape biopsy specimens, and levels of soluble ICAM-1 in nasal lavage fluid were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Expression of ICAM-1 on nasal epithelial cells increased following inoculation in 20 of 23 infected subjects. The median number of ICAM-1-positive cells per 6.25-mm(2) area of stained biopsy specimen was 0 in control samples (day 20 or 33 after inoculation), and in those without infection, 6 on day 1 (P< or =.05), 14.5 on day 3 (P< or =.01), 1.5 on day 5, and 0 on day 9. In a different group of volunteers, soluble ICAM-1 in nasal lavage fluid was higher on days 1 and 3 compared with preinoculation levels (P< or =.001), but only 11 of 23 infected subjects had a 2-fold or greater increase. Up-regulation of ICAM-1 receptor expression on nasal epithelial cells occurred within 24 hours after inoculation in experimental rhinovirus infections (prior to onset of symptoms) and declined promptly by day 5.","Winther, Birgit; Arruda, Eurico; Witek, Theodore J; Marlin, Steven D; Tsianco, Michael M; Innes, Donald J; Hayden, Frederick G",Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11843719/,762

Barbed suture in particular has been demonstrated to be effective for both wound closure and tendon repair. Ten fresh-frozen flexor digitorum profundus tendons of pig were transected and repaired using the two-strand modified Kirchmayr-Kessler technique. The samples were divided into two groups: 4-0 barbed absorbable polyglyconate sutures and 4-0 monofilament absorbable polyglyconate sutures. We measured tensile strength and distance that the testing system pulled the tendon using a universal testing machine. Tensile strength at which 1 and 2 mm of gapping occurred was measured visually at the repair site. Tendons repaired by barbed sutures showed greater tensile strength than monofilament sutures forming still 2-mm gap. However, statistical significance was obtained only at 1-mm gap formation. We concluded that for tendon repair, barbed sutures were superior material to monofilament sutures because of their greater tensile strength, reducing both the initial tendon load and the risk of dehiscence.","Sato, Munenori; Matsumura, Hajime; Gondo, Masahide; Shimada, Kazuki; Watanabe, Katsueki",European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24121796/,762

197086,Tips and tricks to avoid bile duct injury in SILC: an experience of 500 cases.,2016,"INTRODUCTION During an acute hypoxia exposure, impairment of memory is one of the most frequently reported symptoms, either during hypoxia awareness training of aircrews or after an in-flight hypoxic incident. However, the effects of acute hypoxia on memory have been little studied in laboratory-controlled conditions. Moreover, none of these studies were performed in hypobaric conditions. The main aim of our study was to investigate the effects of acute hypobaric hypoxia on working memory (WM). This study also aimed to find links between physiological measurements and cognitive performance during acute hypoxia exposure. METHODS During hypoxia awareness training, 28 subjects (experimental group) were exposed to a simulated altitude level of 10,000 m (31,000 ft) in a hypobaric chamber, while 29 subjects (control group) stayed at sea level. WM was assessed in both groups with the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate were recorded. RESULTS WM was strongly impaired in the hypoxic group. One major finding is that hypoxia highly increased the mean error frequency rate. WM performance decreased linearly with hypoxemia, but SpO2 was weakly predictive of PASAT performance and vice versa. DISCUSSION WM is impaired by acute hypobaric hypoxia. Given the importance of WM in aircraft piloting and its sensitivity to hypoxia, the PASAT, in association with SpO2 and EEG recordings, could improve both hypoxia training and our understanding of the effects of hypoxia on memory.","Malle, Carine; Quinette, Peggy; Laisney, Mickaël; Bourrilhon, Cyprien; Boissin, Jacqueline; Desgranges, Beatrice; Eustache, Francis; Piérard, Christophe","Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23926651/,762

Moreover, legislation and practices on sanitation and diseases surveillance related to ships internationally were also reviewed. Some relevant historical information about infections on merchant ships is provided as well. MATERIAL AND METHODS The methods used to develop the state-of-the-art report included a scientific literature review and an extensive and thorough search of the websites of organisations and government departments. A considerable effort was made to capitalise on previous experience in the field. In particular, for the literature review, a total of 158 scientific articles were used including 91 full papers and 67 abstracts, 7 guidelines published by the WHO, and 13 guideline documents published by other organisations. Moreover, 5 international conventions relevant to passenger ships were identified. RESULTS At the international level, public health issues related to ships are regulated by the revised International Health Regulations (2005). Other conventions of the International Maritime Organization regulate safety on board ships and waste and ballast water management, while conventions of the International Labour Organization regulates issues related to working conditions on board ships. Guidelines for preventing and controlling public health threats on board ships can be found in seven Guidelines published by the World Health Organization, including the WHO Guide to Ship Sanitation, which provides a framework for policy making and local decision making. The literature review results revealed that the infections/outbreaks that occur on passenger ships include Norovirus, Legionella spp., Salmonella spp., E. coli, Vibrio spp., and influenza A and B virus. The modes of transmission include person to person, waterborne, foodborne, airborne, and vector-borne, and shore excursions are responsible for some outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS The industry (especially the ferry industry) and sanitary organisations can enhance collaboration in order to implement integrated hygiene programmes and prevent the occurrence of communicable diseases aboard passenger ships.","Mouchtouri, Varvara A; Nichols, Gordon; Rachiotis, George; Kremastinou, Jenny; Arvanitoyannis, Ioannis S; Riemer, Tobias; Jaremin, Bogdan; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos",International maritime health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21154293/,762

Recent work has revealed that there is another system of NK-cell inhibition, which is independent of MHC class I molecules. Newly discovered NK-cell inhibitory receptors that have non-MHC-molecule ligands broaden the definition of self as seen by NK cells.","Kumar, Vinay; McNerney, Megan E",Nature reviews.

Besides clinical risk factors (such as numerous comorbidities, immune disorders), dialysis patients are additionally exposed to the virus through regular stays for several hours in a dialysis center and ambulance journeys. In such an epidemiological situation, it seems that peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis are good alternatives for treatment. Currently available telemedicine and medical technologies allow for effective renal replacement therapy also outside dialysis centers. Thanks to this, it is possible to limit the stay of patients in a medical facility to clinically justified situations. For this reason, increasing the number of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis, which is carried out at home and without contact with medical personnel, seems to be a good solution. Enabling patients to undergo home hemodialysis treatment, nowadays unavailable in Poland and establishing it as a guaranteed benefit in the health care system will enable renal replacement therapy to be adapted to the clinical condition and the need for isolation.","Żebrowski, Paweł; Zawierucha, Jacek; Marcinkowski, Wojciech; Prystacki, Tomasz; Chomicka, Inga; Malyszko, Jolanta",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33310971/,762

207632,Abstracts from USCAP 2021: Informatics (771-794),2021,"BACKGROUND: Aortic sac hygroma (AH) and concealed endoleaks (EL) following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) needs particular attention with aggressive management as they are associated with rapid sac expansion and rupture risk. However, they can be erroneously reported as type IV or V EL with supine computed tomography (CT) scans, leading to delay in management. Therefore, we describe a novel diagnostic technique, 'Prone contrASt enHanced computed tomography Angiography' (PASHA), to document concealed EL. TECHNICAL SUMMARY: We present eight case-descriptions with continuous sac expansion following primary EVAR. Management began with diagnosis using the PASHA imaging technique. PASHA is a multi-phase CTA positional technique for increasing the accuracy of detecting EL post-EVAR. The PASHA technique diagnosed all cases of type IIIb EL, as it enhanced the degree of contrast infiltration into the aortic sac when micro-leaks were present. Furthermore, the PASHA imaging technique helped to guide whether the open or endovascular intervention could be employed effectively to manage the sac expansion. In synchrony with the PASHA technique, 'EVAR GORE SalvAge FAbric Technique' (ARAFAT) was used in five elderly patients to salvage previous EVAR. Another three had an open conversion; two with double breasting of the aortic sac and one EVAR explantation. DISCUSSION: The PASHA protocol helped classify and localise the concealed ELs (type IV, V), which were not appropriately diagnosed by supine CT protocols. PASHA and ARAFAT were employed as a fully functioning protocol to overcome apparent challenges in accurate diagnosis and subsequent concealed EL management in high-risk patients.","Sultan, Sherif; Acharya, Yogesh; Atteia, Emad; Hynes, Niamh",Ann. vasc. surg,,762
209251,SARS-CoV-2 has stable genome,2020,"Cuba implemented policies mandating social distancing on March 11, 2020, which were still in place at the time of this study. During such periods of isolation, people with psychoactive substance-related disorders and other addictions may be tempted to reduce tension, stress, uncertainty and possible distress by increasing the use of substances or practices they have abused. This can mean relapses and setbacks for patients undergoing treatment. A multidisciplinary team of health professionals specializing in addiction at the Center for Academic Development in Drug Addiction, in Havana, Cuba, cares for people with these disorders and followed their evolution during the initial period of COVID-19 social isolation. With the aim of characterizing strategies employed by patients undergoing treatment for substance abuse and addictions, we conducted a qualitative study from April 2020 through May 2020, using a convenience sample of 37 patients (all students) who had been progressing towards recovery from addictive behaviors when face-to-face encounters were suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions. Contact was maintained through information and communication technologies. The research used telepsychology and focused on understanding patient life experiences. Patients were interviewed using a semi-structured survey, which was then transcribed and coded thematically using a grounded-theory approach. We found that patients' ability to cope successfully with challenges presented by COVID-19 were influenced by: 1) the individual's own methods for maintaining self-control (commitment to studies, projects, and work with therapists) that aided them in their goals concerning abstinence; 2) difficulties faced in addressing specific events and situations (doubts, uncertainties, disagreements, isolation and time use); 3) perpetuation and revivification of myths related to substances and addictive activities (exacerbation of supposed benefits of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, overuse of social networks); and 4) tendencies toward irrationality and lack of emotional control (fear, sadness, anger, constant worry and self-imposed demands). Our findings suggest that despite the potential negative psychological impact of preventive social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual coping mechanisms developed by these patients, aiming at improved self-control, allowed most to avoid setbacks that could have affected their recovery. Nevertheless, patients faced challenges to their recovery that were compounded by difficulties in specific situations, myths related to substances and addictive activities, and tendencies toward irrationality or lack of emotional control.","Fabelo-Roche, Justo R; Iglesias-Moré, Serguei; Gómez-García, Ana M",MEDICC Rev,,762

The World Health Organization declared it a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and called for collaborative efforts, such as contact tracing and promoting the public awareness about COVID-19, and recommended prevention and control measures. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of telephone counselling on the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAPs) of contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases towards COVID-19 epidemiology and infection prevention and control measures. SETTING: Ten areas in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt divided into six rural and four urban areas. METHODS: A non-randomised controlled trial was conducted in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt, from 26 March 2020 to 12 April 2020 on 208 contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, divided equally into two groups: an experiment group that was exposed to telephone counselling by the researchers and a control group that was exposed to routine surveillance by local health authority. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to assess the KAP of both groups towards COVID-19 before and after intervention. RESULTS: After intervention the percent of contacts who achieved good knowledge, positive attitudes and better practice scores in the experimental group was 91.3%, 57.8% and 71.2%, respectively, compared with 13.5%, 7.8% and 16.3%, respectively, in the control group. Male gender and working group were significantly associated with bad practice score. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between differences in knowledge, attitudes and practices of the experimental group before and after the intervention.

This novel strain is highly transmittable and severe disease has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. More than 600,000 cases have been confirmed and the number of deaths is constantly increasing. COVID-19 hospitalized patients, especially those suffering from severe respiratory or systemic manifestations, fall under the spectrum of the acutely ill medical population, which is at increased venous thromboembolism risk. Thrombotic complications seem to emerge as an important issue in patients infected with COVID-19. Preliminary reports on COVID-19 patients' clinical and laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. As the pandemic is spreading and the whole picture is yet unknown, we highlight the importance of coagulation disorders in COVID-19 infected patients and review relevant data of previous coronavirus epidemics caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).","Giannis, Dimitrios; Ziogas, Ioannis A; Gianni, Panagiota",J Clin Virol,,762

435683,Abstracts from USCAP 2021: Education (271-295),2021,"Gas-phase nitrous acid (HONO) is a major precursor of hydroxyl radicals that dominate atmospheric oxidizing capacity. Nevertheless, pathways of HONO formation remain to be explored. This study unveiled an important CO2-catalysis mechanism of HONO formation, using Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy samplings. In the mechanism, HCO3- formed from CO2 hydrolysis reacts with NO2 dimers to produce HONO at water surfaces, and simultaneously, itself reconverts back to CO2 via intermediates OC(O)ONO- and HOC(O)ONO. A flow system experiment was performed to confirm the new mechanism, which indicated that HONO concentrations with CO2 injections were increased by 29.4-68.5%. The new mechanism can be extended to other humid surfaces. Therefore, this study unveiled a previously overlooked vital role of CO2 that catalyzes formation of HONO and affects atmospheric oxidizing capacity.","Xia, Deming; Zhang, Xinran; Chen, Jingwen; Tong, Shengrui; Xie, Hong-Bin; Wang, Zhongyu; Xu, Tong; Ge, Maofa; Allen, David T",Environ. sci. technol,,762

Preschool teachers working in 14 provinces where the number of cases is high form the universe of the study. Sample group is 140 teachers in total. So as to get data for the study, survey questions prepared by the researcher and submitted to expert opinion and structured interview forms were used. The findings of the study are as follows: preschool children had feelings of anxiety, fear and longing all together during this process and they wanted to return to their schools as soon as possible. Similarly, most of the teachers were highly concerned and worried. The teachers attended online educations related to their professional development during the process of staying home. Before COVID-19 came to Turkey, the schools did not take any measures;then, when distance education started, all schools were disinfected, the materials and toys in the classrooms were put aside after disinfection. Distance education process was quite difficult in preschool education;all the teachers taught in line with their own initiatives. During this process, while the activities most preferred by the teachers were games and art activities, the activities having pandemic theme were experiments and dramas about hygiene. Distance education increased parent participation to preschool education and this had a positive effect on parent-child interaction. In the distance education process, by establishing platforms intended for preschools, suggestions to make more and professional activities, to have common actions in cooperation with schools and to train parents were made.","Duran, Munise",International Journal of Educational Methodology,,762
469563,Heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 virus produced in cell culture revealed by shotgun proteomics and supported by genome sequencing,2021,"During the spring 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, faculty and staff within Ohio State University's College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences came together from multiple disciplines to support essential agricultural workers. Concerted leadership from administration provided a framework for this interaction to occur while faculty worked off-campus to address the many issues identified by the agricultural community, the industry sector, and other state agencies. During the onset period, much of our work was reactive; our efforts to address worker safety and health involved three primary areas within: 1) production agricultural workers, 2) produce growers and direct marketing enterprises, and 3) meat supply chain workers. Communication to target audiences relied upon our ability to convert face-to-face programming into virtual webinars, social media, and digital publications. A Food System Task Force mobilized specialists to address emerging issues, with one specific topic related to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). As we continue to face new seasons in agriculture production, and pockets of COVID-19 outbreaks within our state, we will continue to address the dynamic needs of our food supply systems. There are implications for how we will teach the agricultural workforce within a virtual platform, including the evaluation of the effectiveness of those training programs. There are renewed opportunities to integrate health and safety content into other Extension teams who conventionally focused on production practices and farm management topics. Several research themes emerged during subgroup dialog to pursue new knowledge in workers' cultural attitude and barriers, PPE design, PPE access, and overall attitude toward COVID-19 health practices.","Jepsen, S Dee; Pfeifer, Lisa; Garcia, Lyda G; Plakias, Zoë; Inwood, Shoshanah; Rumble, Joy N; Rodriguez, Mary T; Puskas, Judit E; Custer, Samuel G",J Agromedicine,,762

In addition, to assess the impact of smell loss on psychological well-being and distress, and to assess coping strategies used by COVID-19 patients with smell loss. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study. A total of 487 COVID-19 positive patients with anosmia were recruited. All participants filled in the validated Multi-Clinic Smell and Taste Questionnaire, and the validated General Well-being Schedule. RESULTS: Negative impacts of smell loss, associated risks, interference with daily activities, and deterioration in well-being were common. The importance of the sense of smell was evaluated (In relation to other senses) as higher in the period after the loss than before the loss (p < 0.001). All aspects of health-related QOL are statistically significant (p < 0.001), with the exception of financial security and friendship, which are not statistically significant (p = 0.129, p = 0.334), respectively. Psychological well-being was negatively affected, and the use of both problem- and emotion-focused strategies was common. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 Patients with loss of smell have significant reductions in health-related QOL. Their loss of smell directly affects daily activities related to the olfactory function. Therefore, priority should be given to diagnose and treat the loss of smell. Patients who have recently developed smell loss may be offered a combination of the problem- and emotion-focused strategies to cope with their condition.","Elkholi, Safaa Mostafa Ali; Abdelwahab, Mohamed Kamal; Abdelhafeez, Marwa",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,762

COVID-19, you can't get rid of us without a fight!",2020,"The binding and displacement interaction of colchicine and azithromycin to the model transport protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) was evaluated in this study. Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has antiviral properties and hence, has been used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2. Colchicine, a natural plant product is used to treat and prevent acute gout flares. Some macrolide antibiotics are reported to have fatal drug-drug interactions with colchicine. The displacement interaction between colchicine and azithromycin on binding to BSA was evaluated using spectroscopic techniques, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies. The binding constant recorded for the binary system BSA-colchicine was 7.44â¯×â¯104 whereas, the binding constant for the ternary system BSA-colchicine in presence of azithromycin was 7.38â¯×â¯104 and were similar. Azithromycin didn't bind to BSA neither did it interfere in binding of colchicine. The results from molecular docking studies also led to a similar conclusion that azithromycin didn't interfere in the binding of colchicine to BSA. These findings are important since there is possibility of serious adverse event with co-administration of colchicine and azithromycin in patients with underlying gouty arthritis and these patients need to be continuously monitored for colchicine toxicity.","Wani, Tanveer A; Bakheit, Ahmed H; Al-Majed, Abdulrahman A; Altwaijry, Nojood; Baquaysh, Anwar; Aljuraisy, Ashwaq; Zargar, Seema",J Mol Liq,,762

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we collected the first clinical laboratory data of 114 patients on admission, and 80 healthy controls. Meanwhile, we monitored the serum lipid profile, COVID-19 nucleic acid and chest CT scan of a severe patient from the early stage of infection to the recovery period for a total of 80 days. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy controls, the patients had sharply decreased concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (P<0.001). Among the patients, HDL-cholesterol concentration in severe groups was significantly lower than the common groups [1.01 (0.88-1.20) vs 1.21 (1.02-1.48) mmol/l, P<0.001]. The lipid profile of a severe patient showed that serum cholesterol concentration significantly decreased in the early stage and returned to be normal in the recovery period. Moreover, the change of HDL-cholesterol in this patient was consistent with the results of nucleic acid tests and chest CT scans. In correlation analysis, HDL-cholesterol concentration was negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP, r=-0.396, P<0.001) and positively correlated with lymphocytes (r=0.336, P<0.001).

600099,Leveraging the antiviral type-I interferon system as a first line defense against SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity,2021-01-29,"Abstract The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly changing our habits. To date, April 12, 2020, the virus has reached 209 nations, affecting 1.8 million people and causing more than 110,000 deaths. Maxillofacial surgery represents an example of a specialty that has had to adapt to this outbreak, because of the subspecialties of oncology and traumatology. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of this outbreak on the specialty of maxillofacial surgery and how the current situation is being managed on a worldwide scale. To achieve this goal, the authors developed an anonymous questionnaire which was posted on the internet and also sent to maxillofacial surgeons around the globe using membership lists from various subspecialty associations. The questionnaire asked for information about the COVID-19 situation in the respondent’s country and in their workplace, and what changes they were facing in their practices in light of the outbreak. The objective was not only to collect and analyse data, but also to highlight what the specialty is facing and how it is handling the situation, in the hope that this information will be useful as a reference in the future, not only for this specialty, but also for others, should COVID-19 or a similar global threat arise again.","Maffia, F.; Fontanari, M.; Vellone, V.; Cascone, P.; Mercuri, L.

Social distancing requirements following the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid changes to intervention delivery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed-methods process evaluation will investigate how the changes were implemented and the impact that these have on participants’ experience. An implementation study will investigate how the intervention was delivered during the pandemic. A study on the mechanisms of impact and context will investigate how these changes were experienced by the PrAISED participants, their carers and the therapists delivering the intervention. The study will commence in May 2020. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The PrAISED RCT and process evaluation have received ethical approval number 18/YH/0059. The PrAISED process evaluation will enable us to understand how distancing and isolation affected participants, their activity and exercise routines and whether the therapy programme could be continued with remote support. This will be valuable both in explaining trial results and also contribute to understanding and designing new ways of delivering home-based services and rehabilitation interventions for people with dementia and their carers.

620567,The Immunophenotyping Changes of Peripheral CD4+ T Lymphocytes and Inflammatory Markers of Class III Obesity Subjects After Laparoscopic Gastric Sleeve Surgery – A Follow-Up Study,2021-05-05,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has spread substantially within India over multiple waves of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the risk factors and disease burden associated with COVID-19 in India remain poorly understood. We aimed to assess predictors of infection and mortality within an active surveillance study, and to probe the completeness of case and mortality surveillance. METHODS: In this prospective, active surveillance study, we used data collected under expanded programmatic surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the district of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India (population of 3 266 000 individuals). Prospective testing via RT-PCR was done in individuals with fever or acute respiratory symptoms as well as returning travellers, frontline workers, contacts of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, residents of containment zones, patients undergoing medical procedures, and other risk groups. Standardised data collection on symptoms and chronic comorbid conditions was done as part of routine intake. Additionally, seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G was assessed via a cross-sectional survey recruiting adults across 38 clusters within Madurai District from Oct 19, 2020, to Nov 5, 2020. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for positive RT-PCR results comparing individuals by age, sex, comorbid conditions, and aspects of clinical presentation. We estimated case-fatality ratios (CFRs) over the 30-day period following RT-PCR testing stratified by the same variables, and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for death associated with age, sex, and comorbidity. We estimated infection-fatality ratios (IFRs) on the basis of age-specific seroprevalence. RESULTS: Between May 20, 2020, and Oct 31, 2020, 13·5 diagnostic tests were done per 100 inhabitants within Madurai, as compared to 7·9 tests per 100 inhabitants throughout India. From a total of 440 253 RT-PCR tests, 15 781 (3·6%) SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified, with 8720 (5·4%) of 160 273 being positive among individuals with symptoms, and 7061 (2·5%) of 279 980 being positive among individuals without symptoms, at the time of presentation. Estimated aORs for symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed infection increased continuously by a factor of 4·3 from ages 0–4 years to 80 years or older. By contrast, risk of asymptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed infection did not differ across ages 0–44 years, and thereafter increased by a factor of 1·6 between ages 45–49 years and 80 years or older. Seroprevalence was 40·1% (95% CI 35·8–44·6) at age 15 years or older by the end of the study period, indicating that RT-PCR clinical testing and surveillance testing identified only 1·4% (1·3–1·6%) of all infections in this age group. Among RT-PCR-confirmed cases, older age, male sex, and history of cancer, diabetes, other endocrine disorders, hypertension, other chronic circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders, and chronic kidney disease were each associated with elevated risk of mortality. The CFR among RT-PCR-confirmed cases was 2·4% (2·2–2·6); after age standardisation. At age 15 years or older, the IFR based on reported deaths was 0·043% (0·039–0·049), with reported deaths being only 11·0% (8·2–14·5) of the expected count. INTERPRETATION: In a large-scale SARS-CoV-2 surveillance programme in Madurai, India, we identified equal risk of asymptomatic infection among children, teenagers, and working-age adults, and increasing risk of infection and death associated with older age and comorbidities. Establishing whether surveillance practices or differences in infection severity account for gaps between observed and expected mortality is of crucial importance to establishing the burden of COVID-19 in India.

Objective: To determine the variation in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in school children across districts, schools, grades, and classes, and the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence with self-reported symptoms. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline measurements of a longitudinal cohort study (Ciao Corona) from June-July 2020. Setting: 55 randomly selected schools and classes stratified by district in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland (1.5 million inhabitants). Participants: Children, aged 6-16 years old, attending grades 1-2, 4-5 and 7-8. Exposure: Exposure to circulating SARS-CoV-2 between February and June 2020 including public lock-down and school closure (March 16-May 10, 2020). Main Outcomes and Measures: Variation in seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children across 12 cantonal districts, schools, and grades using a Luminex-based antibody test with four targets for each of IgG, IgA and IgM. Clustering of cases within classes. Analysis of associations of seropositivity and symptoms. Comparison of seroprevalence with a randomly selected adult population, based on Luminex-based IgG and IgA antibody test of Corona Immunitas. Results: In total, 55 schools and 2585 children were recruited (1337 girls, median age 11, age range 6-16 years). Overall seroprevalence was 2.8 % (95% CI 1.6-4.1%), ranging from 1.0% to 4.5% across districts. Seroprevalence was 3.8% (1.9-6.1%) in grades 1-2, 2.5% (1.1-4.2%) in grades 4-5, and 1.5% (0.5-3.0%) in grades 7-8. At least one case was present in 36/55 tested schools and in 43/128 classes with [â¥]50% participation rate and [â¥]5 children tested. 73% of children reported COVID-19 compatible symptoms since January 2020, but none were reported more frequently in seropositive compared to seronegative children. Seroprevalence of children was very similar to seroprevalence of randomly selected adults in the same region in June-July 2020, measured with the same Corona Immunitas test, combining IgG and IgA (3.1%, 95% CI 1.4-5.4%, versus 3.3%, 95% CI 1.4-5.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: Seroprevalence was inversely related to age and revealed a dark figure of around 90 when compared to 0.03% confirmed PCR+ cases in children in the same area by end of June. We did not find clustering of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive cases in schools so far, but the follow-up of this school-based study will shed more light on transmission within and outside schools.

Both natural and human-induced disasters present major risks to sustainable development trajectories and require strategic management within regional and local plans. Climate change and its impacts, including intensified storms, flash floods, and other water-based disasters (WD), also pose a serious and increasing threat. Small, remote communities prone to weather extremes are particularly vulnerable as they often lack effective early warning systems and experience energy insufficiency. Humanitarian engineering provides a transdisciplinary approach to these issues, supporting practical development resources such as renewable energy, which can also be adapted for disaster response. This study details an exploratory investigation of community vulnerability and capability mapping (VCM) that identifies communities with high WD risk and limited response capability which may benefit from risk reduction engagement and program co-development. By presenting criteria appropriate for VCM, we highlight the anthropocentric characteristics that could potentially be incorporated within community-led action as part of a comprehensive scheme that promotes sustainable development.","Schismenos, Spyros; Stevens, Garry J.; Emmanouloudis, Dimitrios; Georgeou, Nichole; Shrestha, Surendra; Chalaris, Michail",Sustain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425037/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00890-y,762

Here, we report two cases of neurological long COVID with abnormal FDG PET findings marked by hypometabolic regions of the cingulate cortex.","Hugon, Jacques; Msika, Eva-Flore; Queneau, Mathieu; Farid, Karim; Paquet, Claire",J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-021-10655-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143277/,762
666461,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA residue on object surfaces in nucleic acid testing laboratory using droplet digital PCR,2020-06-19,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal anxiety has been a significant public health issue globally, leading to adverse health outcomes for mothers and children. The study aimed to evaluate the sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP), and anxiety level of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan and investigate the influencing factors for prenatal anxiety in this specific context. METHODS: Pregnant subjects’ KAP towards COVID-19 and their sociodemographics and pregnancy information were collected using questionnaires. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess anxiety status. Factors associated with the level of prenatal anxiety were analyzed by Pearson’s chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prenatal anxiety prevalence in this population was 20.8%. The mean score of knowledge was 13.2 ± 1.1 on a 0 ~ 14 scale. The attitudes and practices data showed that 580/ 817 (71.0%) were very concerned about the news of COVID-19, 455/817 (55.7%) considered the official media to be the most reliable information source for COVID-19, and 681/817 (83.4%) were anxious about the possibility of being infected by COVID-19. However, only 83/817 (10.2%) worried about contracting COVID-19 infection through the ultrasound transducer during a routing morphology scan. About two-thirds 528/817 (64.6%) delayed or canceled the antenatal visits. Approximately half of them 410/817 (50.2%) used two kinds of personal protection equipments (PPEs) during hospital visits. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the influential factors for prenatal anxiety included previous children in the family, knowledge score, media trust, worry of contracting the COVID-19 infection and worry about getting infected with COVID-19 from the ultrasound probe antenatal care (ANC) schedule. CONCLUSION: Prenatal anxiety was prevalent among pregnant women in Wuhan during the outbreak of COVID-19. The current findings identified factors associated with the level of prenatal anxiety that could be targeted for psychological care.

687592,Structural basis for accommodation of emerging B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 variants by two potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies,2021-06-09,"To date, the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been considered genetically more stable than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Here we report a 382-nt deletion covering almost the entire open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from eight hospitalized patients in Singapore. The deletion also removes the ORF8 transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the N gene. We also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks. During the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population [1], and similar variation has since been observed across SARS-related CoVs in humans and bats. Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in ORF8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus [2]. This is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human SARS cases possessed an ORF8 deletion that may be associated with host adaptation [1]. We therefore hypothesise that the major deletion revealed in this study may lead to an attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2.","Su, Yvonne CF; Anderson, Danielle E; Young, Barnaby E; Zhu, Feng; Linster, Martin; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Low, Jenny GH; Yan, Zhuang; Jayakumar, Jayanthi; Sun, Louisa; Yan, Gabriel Z; Mendenhall, Ian H; Leo, Yee-Sin; Lye, David Chien; Wang, Lin-Fa; Smith, Gavin JD",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.987222,762
