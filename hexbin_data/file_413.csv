3465,Characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia complicating pregnancy: a retrospective study of 12 cases and a literature review,2018-11-03,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia during pregnancy has been proven to be associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The management of severe pneumonia in gravid patients is even more challenging. Thus, we summarized the characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of these patients and explored the probable risk factors and predictive factors for pneumonia during pregnancy and the appropriate timing of delivery in severe pneumonia patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 12 patients who were diagnosed with severe pneumonia complicating pregnancy at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2010 and June 2017. The clinical features, treatment strategies, and pregnancy outcomes were collected from medical records and telephone calls. RESULTS: All 12 patients were in their late second or third trimester. The patients had a higher prevalence of anemia (50%) and preeclampsia (25%) than ordinary pregnant women. Delayed diagnoses were not uncommon. Two mothers died in our series, resulting in a mortality rate of 17%. Two intrauterine deaths were observed. Elective delivery was not performed in any of the four patients in their second trimester. Six of the seven patients who presented after 28 weeks of gestation and had live fetuses underwent emergency deliveries. Preterm births (6/7) and cesarean sections (5/7) were the two leading adverse outcomes in newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia, advanced gestational age, and preeclampsia might be associated with the severity of pneumonia. Chest radiographs should be taken as soon as pneumonia is highly suspected to facilitate an early diagnosis. High incidences of adverse fetal outcomes were observed; thus, termination of the pregnancy is recommended for patients in their third trimester when respiratory function deteriorates progressively. However, it might be reasonable to continue pregnancy for those in their first or second trimester.","Tang, Pingping; Wang, Jiangshan; Song, Yingna",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6215647/,413
4004,Impact of ultrasound on management for dyspnea presentations in a Rwandan emergency department,2019-08-28,"BACKGROUND: The complexity of diagnosis for critically ill dyspnea presentations in the emergency department remains a challenge. Accurate and rapid recognition of associated life-threatening conditions is paramount for timely treatment. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been shown to impact the diagnosis of dyspnea presentations in resource-rich settings, and may be of greater diagnostic benefit in resource-limited settings. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled a convenience sample of 100 patients presenting with dyspnea in the Emergency Department at University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (UTH-K) in Rwanda. After a traditional history and physical exam, the primary treating team listed their 3 main diagnoses and ranked their confidence accuracy in the leading diagnosis on a Likert scale (1–5). Multi-organ ultrasound scans performed by a separate physician sonographer assessed the heart, lungs, inferior vena cava, and evaluated for lower extremity deep vein thrombosis or features of disseminated tuberculosis. The sonographer reviewed the findings with the treating team, who then listed 3 diagnoses post-ultrasound and ranked their confidence accuracy in the leading diagnosis on a Likert scale (1–5). The hospital diagnosis at discharge was used as the standard in determining the accuracy of the pre- and post-ultrasound diagnoses. RESULTS: Of the 99 patients included in analysis, 57.6% (n = 57) were male, with a mean age of 45 years. Most of them had high-level acuity (54.5%), the dyspnea was of acute onset (45.5%) and they came from district hospitals (50.5%). The most frequent discharge diagnoses were acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) (26.3%) and pneumonia (21.2%). Ultrasound changed the leading diagnosis in 66% of cases. The diagnostic accuracy for ADHF increased from 53.8 to 100% (p = 0.0004), from 38 to 85.7% for pneumonia (p = 0.0015), from 14.2 to 85.7% for extrapulmonary tuberculosis (p = 0.0075), respectively, pre and post-ultrasound. The overall physician diagnostic accuracy increased from 34.7 to 88.8% pre and post- ultrasound. The clinician confidence in the leading diagnosis changed from a mean of 3.5 to a mean of 4.7 (Likert scale 0–5) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In dyspneic patients presenting to this Emergency Department, ultrasound frequently changed the leading diagnosis, significantly increased clinicians’ confidence in the leading diagnoses, and improved diagnostic accuracy.","Umuhire, Olivier Felix; Henry, Michael B.; Levine, Adam Carl; Cattermole, Giles N.; Henwood, Patricia",Ultrasound J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6702246/,413
5473,Programming errors from patient-controlled analgesia,2003,"Recent observations revealed a novel role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R) in lung injury, thereby extending knowledge about the functions of the angiotensin system. Angiotensin II, whose target is the AT1R, is a potent vasoconstrictor. Accordingly, an imbalance leading to enhanced activity of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis is postulated to contribute to both circulatory disturbances and lung injury. In this context, a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism, AT1R A1166C, which leads to enhanced responsiveness of the AT1R, has been postulated as a candidate susceptibility factor for ischemic stroke. The aim of our study was to investigate its occurrence in ischemic stroke and to analyze its possible synergistic associations with clinical risk factors. Genetic and clinical data on 308 consecutive patients with acutely developing ischemic stroke were analyzed. A total of 272 stroke and neuroimaging alteration-free subjects served as a control group. Univariate and logistic regression statistical approaches were used. Alone, the AT1R 1166C allele did not pose a risk of stroke. In hypertensive smokers, however, it was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR 22.3, 95% CI 5.8–110.2, p<0.001). Further subgroup analysis revealed the same association for both small-vessel (OR 24.3, 95% CI 6.1–121.1, p<0.001) and large-vessel (OR 21.3, 95% CI 4.6–81.1, p<0.001) infarction. On a pathophysiological basis, our results suggest the possibility that the AT1R A1166C polymorphism might give rise to ischemic stroke indirectly via an unfavorable effect on the cardiorespiratory function.","Szolnoki, Zoltán; Havasi, Viktória; Talián, Gábor; Bene, Judit; Komlósi, Katalin; Somogyvári, Ferenc; Kondacs, András; Szabó, Mihály; Fodor, Lajos; Bodor, Anita; Melegh, Béla",J Mol Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090441/,413

10811,A Systematic Review of Tracheostomy Modifications and Swallowing in Adults,2020-05-06,"INTRODUCTION: Cognitive integration from multiple disciplines is essential to clinical problem-solving. Because it is not directly observable, demonstrating evidence of learners’ cognitive integration remains a challenge. In addition, little is known about preclinical medical students’ approach to diagnostic reasoning despite widespread implementation of clinical reasoning curricula for these early learners. The objectives of this study were to characterize how first-year medical students integrated knowledge to problem-solve during a simulated viral pandemic and to characterize students’ diagnostic reasoning approach to this clinical scenario. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Student teams analyzed clinical data to formulate hypotheses for the pandemic’s source and submitted reports justifying their hypotheses and treatment recommendations. A content analysis on students’ reports identified codes and themes characterizing the learning content integrated and students’ approaches to diagnostic reasoning tasks. RESULTS: Sixteen problem-solving codes were identified, demonstrating integration of new and previously encountered content from multiple disciplines. A compare-contrast analytical approach was the most commonly employed diagnostic reasoning approach (100%), with a smaller subset of teams also using a causal approach (20%). DISCUSSION: Content analysis of preclinical students’ diagnostic justification tasks provided insights into their approach to diagnostic reasoning, which was most consistent with the search-inference framework rather than a causal approach, likely due to limited pathophysiological knowledge at that point in training. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of cognitive integration can be made explicit through learners’ narrative justification of diagnostic reasoning tasks. Preclinical students’ diagnostic reasoning development has implications for curricular design and implementation for this learner group.","Jackson, Jennifer M.; Skelton, Joseph A.; Peters, Timothy R.",Med Sci Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202796/,413

12087,Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES Jerusalem guidelines,2020-04-15,"BACKGROUND: In pairwise meta-analysis, the contribution of each study to the pooled estimate is given by its weight, which is based on the inverse variance of the estimate from that study. For network meta-analysis (NMA), the contribution of direct (and indirect) evidence is easily obtained from the diagonal elements of a hat matrix. It is, however, not fully clear how to generalize this to the percentage contribution of each study to a NMA estimate. METHODS: We define the importance of each study for a NMA estimate by the reduction of the estimate’s variance when adding the given study to the others. An equivalent interpretation is the relative loss in precision when the study is left out. Importances are values between 0 and 1. An importance of 1 means that the study is an essential link of the pathway in the network connecting one of the treatments with another. RESULTS: Importances can be defined for two-stage and one-stage NMA. These numbers in general do not add to one and thus cannot be interpreted as ‘percentage contributions’. After briefly discussing other available approaches, we question whether it is possible to obtain unique percentage contributions for NMA. CONCLUSIONS: Importances generalize the concept of weights in pairwise meta-analysis in a natural way. Moreover, they are uniquely defined, easily calculated, and have an intuitive interpretation. We give some real examples for illustration.","Rücker, Gerta; Nikolakopoulou, Adriani; Papakonstantinou, Theodoros; Salanti, Georgia; Riley, Richard D.; Schwarzer, Guido",BMC Med Res Methodol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7386174/,413
12385,Predictors of Spasticity After Stroke,2016-07-22,"Tissue simulants are typically used in ballistic testing as substitutes for biological tissues. Many simulants have been used, with gelatine amongst the most common. While two concentrations of gelatine (10 and 20 %) have been used extensively, no agreed standard exists for the preparation of either. Comparison of ballistic damage produced in both concentrations is lacking. The damage produced in gelatine is also questioned, with regards to what it would mean for specific areas of living tissue. The aim of the work discussed in this paper was to consider how damage caused by selected pistol and rifle ammunition varied in different simulants. Damage to gelatine blocks 10 and 20 % in concentration were tested with 9 mm Luger (9 × 19 full metal jacket; FMJ) rounds, while damage produced by .223 Remington (5.56 × 45 Federal Premium® Tactical® Bonded®) rounds to porcine thorax sections (skin, underlying tissue, ribs, lungs, ribs, underlying tissue, skin; backed by a block of 10 % gelatine) were compared to 10 and 20 % gelatine blocks. Results from the .223 Remington rifle round, which is one that typically expands on impact, revealed depths of penetration in the thorax arrangement were significantly different to 20 % gelatine, but not 10 % gelatine. The level of damage produced in the simulated thoraxes was smaller in scale to that witnessed in both gelatine concentrations, though greater debris was produced in the thoraxes.

However, what may not be widely known, is that this duty is not always absolute. In the United Kingdom, both the General Medical Council governing the practice of all doctors, as well as many other professional codes of practice recognise that, under certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to break confidentiality. This arises when there is a wider duty to protect the health of others, and when the risk of non-disclosure outweighs the potential harm from breaking confidentiality. We discuss this situation specifically in relation to genomic medicine where relatives in a family may have differing views on the sharing of familial genetic information. Overruling a patient’s wishes is predicated on balancing the duty of care towards the patient versus protecting their relative from serious harm. We discuss the practice implications of a pivotal legal case that concluded recently in the High Court of Justice in England and Wales, ABC v St Georges Healthcare NHS Trust & Ors. Professional guidance is already clear that genetic healthcare professionals must undertake a balancing exercise to weigh up contradictory duties of care. However, the judge has provided a new legal weighting to these professional duties: ‘The scope of the duty extends not only to conducting the necessary balancing exercise but also to acting in accordance with its outcome’ [1: 189]. In the context of genomic medicine, this has important consequences for clinical practice.","Anna, Middleton; Christine, Patch; Jonathan, Roberts; Richard, Milne; Alessia, Costa; Lauren, Robarts; Jerome, Atutornu",Eur J Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7609317/,413

Two basic components of complex shapes are straight and curved contours. A large body of evidence suggests a modular hierarchy for shape representation progressing from simple and complex orientation in early areas V1 and V2, to increasingly complex stages of curvature representation in V4, TEO, and TE. Here, we reinforce and extend the concept of modular representation. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging in Macaque area V4, we find sub-millimeter sized modules for curvature representation that are organized from low to high curvatures as well as domains with complex curvature preference. We propose a possible ‘curvature hypercolumn’ within V4. In combination with previous studies, we suggest that the key emergent functions at each stage of cortical processing are represented in systematic, modular maps.","Hu, Jia Ming; Song, Xue Mei; Wang, Qiannan; Roe, Anna Wang",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7707819/,413

We investigated how different fundamental sonication parameters influence the effects of TUS on the motor cortex (M1) of 16 healthy subjects by probing cortico-cortical excitability and behavior. A low-intensity 500 kHz TUS transducer was coupled to a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coil. TMS was delivered 10 ms before the end of TUS to the left M1 hotspot of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Varying acoustic parameters (pulse repetition frequency, duty cycle, and sonication duration) on motor-evoked potential amplitude were examined. Paired-pulse measures of cortical inhibition and facilitation, and performance on a visuomotor task was also assessed. TUS safely suppressed TMS-elicited motor cortical activity, with longer sonication durations and shorter duty cycles when delivered in a blocked paradigm. TUS increased GABA(A)-mediated short-interval intracortical inhibition and decreased reaction time on visuomotor task but not when controlled with TUS at near-somatosensory threshold intensity.","Fomenko, Anton; Chen, Kai-Hsiang Stanley; Nankoo, Jean-François; Saravanamuttu, James; Wang, Yanqiu; El-Baba, Mazen; Xia, Xue; Seerala, Shakthi Sanjana; Hynynen, Kullervo; Lozano, Andres M; Chen, Robert",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7728443/,413
15167,Young people’s perspectives on patient-reported outcome measures in inflammatory arthritis: results of a multicentre European qualitative study from a EULAR task force,2021-01-29,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) represent a group of synthetic compounds widely used in industry plants due to their low grade of degradation, surfactant properties, thermic and flame resistance. These characteristics are useful for the industrial production, however they are also potentially dangerous for human health and for the environment. PFAS are persistent pollutants accumulating in waters and soil and recoverable in foods due to their release by food packaging. Humans are daily exposed to PFAS because these compounds are ubiquitous and, when assimilated, they are difficult to be eliminated, persisting for years both in humans and animals. Due to their persistence and potential danger to health, some old generation PFAS have been replaced by newly synthesized PFAS with the aim to use alternative compounds presumably safer for humans and the environment. Yet, the environmental pollution with PFAS remains a matter of concern worldwide and led to large-scale epidemiological studies both on plants’ workers and on exposed people in the general population. In this context, strong concern emerged concerning the potential adverse effects of PFAS on the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones play a critical role in the regulation of metabolism, and thyroid function is related to cardiovascular disease, fertility, and fetal neurodevelopment. In vitro, ex vivo data, and epidemiological studies suggested that PFASs may disrupt the thyroid hormone system in humans, with possible negative repercussions on the outcome of pregnancy and fetal-child development. However, data on the thyroid disrupting effect of PFAS remain controversial, as well as their impact on human health in different ages of life. Aim of the present paper is to review recent data on the effects of old and new generation PFAS on thyroid homeostasis. To this purpose we collected information from in vitro studies, animal models, and in vivo data on exposed workers, general population, and pregnant women.","Coperchini, Francesca; Croce, Laura; Ricci, Gianluca; Magri, Flavia; Rotondi, Mario; Imbriani, Marcello; Chiovato, Luca",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7851056/,413

Furthermore, a network analysis indicates that the phenomenon of echo chambers, in which discourse is more likely with like-minded others, is not limited to politics: people who scored lower in cognitive reflection tended to follow a set of accounts which are avoided by people who scored higher in cognitive reflection. Our results help to illuminate the drivers of behavior on social media platforms and challenge intuitionist notions that reflective thinking is unimportant for everyday judgment and decision-making.","Mosleh, Mohsen; Pennycook, Gordon; Arechar, Antonio A.; Rand, David G.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7875970/,413

Though surgical indications and timing of these two procedures have been described, there are no large case series describing the anesthetic management of these cases. We sought to describe our experience. METHODS: We performed a historical cohort study on 54 consecutive cases of simultaneous bilateral nephrectomy with renal transplantation at a single, tertiary-care medical centre. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: The most common etiology of kidney disease involved was autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease at 52/54 (96%) cases. All patients received grafts from living donors. An arterial line was placed in 44 (81%) and a central venous catheter in 16 (30%) subjects. At least one vasopressor infusion was used in 44 (81%) cases and 37 (69%) patients required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Of this subset, 30 (81%) were admitted for ongoing vasopressor support and six (16%) for hemodynamic monitoring. All patients were extubated in the operating room upon completion of the procedure. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] ICU length of stay (LOS) was 0.9 [0.7–1.4] days and total hospital LOS was 4.4 [4.3–5.4] days. There were no cases of mortality at 30 days or of postoperative dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral nephrectomy with renal transplantation often developed perioperative hypotension requiring vasopressor infusions and postoperative transfer to the ICU. This is possibly due to a temporary loss of the renin-angiotensin system. Despite this, patients most commonly were transferred to the floor on postoperative day 1 and had successful outcomes with no mortality at 30 days.","Hofer, Ryan E.; Kor, Todd M.; Prieto, Mikel; Findlay, James Y.",Can J Anaesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8041388/,413

However, therapeutic proteins destabilization and aggregation may occur during the frozen storage or the freeze-thawing step. In this work, an effective method was proposed to freeze-dry therapeutic protein samples to allow subsequent storage or transport of samples without freezing them. This new method was validated with quality control samples of adalimumab and etanercept, and it was also used in the bioanalysis of adalimumab and etanercept in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. Adalimumab and etanercept were stable for 14 days at 4 °C after being prepared and stored using the new method, with detection that was accurate and repeatable. Studies of adalimumab and etanercept in animals and humans showed that the PK parameters of the analytes stored with the new method were consistent with those of analytes stored using the conventional method. This effective method will be attractive for facilitating the storage and transport of plasma samples containing therapeutic proteins.","Wang, Lei; Liu, Lixiong; Hong, Xiaoping; Liu, Dongzhou; Cheng, Zeneng",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8062679/,413

As one of the most conserved activities of the innate immune system, limiting the availability of free trace metals by cells of the immune system serves not only to conceal these vital nutrients from invading bacteria but also operates to tightly regulate host immune cell responses and function. In the setting of chronic lung disease, the regulation of trace metals by the host is often disrupted, leading to the altered availability of these nutrients to commensal and invading opportunistic pathogenic microbes. Similarly, alterations in the uptake, secretion, turnover and redox activity of these vitally important metals has significant repercussions for immune cell function including the response to and resolution of infection. This review will discuss the intricate role of nutritional immunity in host immune cells of the lung and how changes in this fundamental process as a result of chronic lung disease may alter the airway microbiome, disease progression and the response to infection.","Healy, Claire; Munoz-Wolf, Natalia; Strydom, Janné; Faherty, Lynne; Williams, Niamh C.; Kenny, Sarah; Donnelly, Seamas C.; Cloonan, Suzanne M.",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8082489/,413

As an example, genome-wide protein interaction networks are widely used in systems biology and continuously extended and refined as new sources of evidence become available. Despite the vast amount of information about individual protein structures and protein complexes that has accumulated in the past 50 years in the Protein Data Bank, the data, computational tools, and language of structural biology are not an integral part of systems biology. However, increasing effort has been devoted to this integration, and the related literature is reviewed here. Relationships between proteins that are detected via structural similarity offer a rich source of information not available from sequence similarity, and homology modeling can be used to leverage Protein Data Bank structures to produce 3D models for a significant fraction of many proteomes. A number of structure-informed genomic and cross-species (i.e., virus–host) interactomes will be described, and the unique information they provide will be illustrated with a number of examples. Tissue- and tumor-specific interactomes have also been developed through computational strategies that exploit patient information and through genetic interactions available from increasingly sensitive screens. Strategies to integrate structural information with these alternate data sources will be described. Finally, efforts to link protein structure space with chemical compound space offer novel sources of information in drug design, off-target identification, and the identification of targets for compounds found to be effective in phenotypic screens.","Murray, Diana; Petrey, Donald; Honig, Barry",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8095114/,413

Use of measures to assess the functional impact of TD in routine clinical practice is lacking. To address this gap, an advisory panel of experts in psychiatry and movement disorder neurology was convened to develop consensus recommendations on assessment of the impact of TD on patients’ functioning that can be used in clinical practice. METHODS: An advisory panel provided recommendations using an iterative process, beginning with a narrative literature review regarding current practices for assessing the impact of TD in clinical settings. A detailed summary was generated, and the advisory panel provided comments about the content and answered questions about assessing TD impact in clinical practice. The panelists’ responses were discussed during a virtual meeting held on August 28, 2020. A second meeting on September 25, 2020, focused on developing and refining recommendations for assessment of the impact of TD in clinical practice. At the conclusion of the second meeting, general consensus was reached on all recommendation statements. RESULTS: As part of routine clinical practice, it is imperative to assess the impact of TD on the patient’s life to help guide treatment decisions. Key domains for assessing the overall impact of TD include social, physical, vocational, and psychological functioning and the impact of TD on the underlying psychiatric disorder. Assessment of TD impact should be performed at every patient visit. Impact assessments should include consultation with patients, caregivers, and family members. Shared decision-making to initiate TD treatment should consider impact. CONCLUSION: The impact of TD should be assessed routinely, including the key domains of social, physical, vocational, and psychological functioning and the impact of TD on the underlying psychiatric disorder.","Jackson, Richard; Brams, Matthew N; Citrome, Leslie; Hoberg, Amber R; Isaacson, Stuart H; Kane, John M; Kumar, Rajeev",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8164384/,413
18334,Implementation of a Machine-Learning Algorithm in the Electronic Health Record for Targeted Screening for Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A Quality Improvement Study,2021-06-10,"Fungal infections cause >1 million deaths annually and the emergence of antifungal resistance has prompted the exploration for novel antifungal targets. Quadruplexes are four-stranded nucleic acid secondary structures, which can regulate processes such as transcription, translation, replication and recombination. They are also found in genes linked to virulence in microbes, and ligands that bind to quadruplexes can eliminate drug-resistant pathogens. Using a computational approach, we quantified putative quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) in 1359 genomes across the fungal kingdom and explored their presence in genes related to virulence, drug resistance and biological processes associated with pathogenicity in Aspergillus fumigatus. Here we present the largest analysis of PQS in fungi and identify significant heterogeneity of these sequences throughout phyla, genera and species. PQS were genetically conserved in Aspergillus spp. and frequently pathogenic species appeared to contain fewer PQS than their lesser/non-pathogenic counterparts. GO-term analysis identified that PQS-containing genes were involved in processes linked with virulence such as zinc ion binding, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and regulation of transcription in A. fumigatus. Although the genome frequency of PQS was lower in A. fumigatus, PQS could be found enriched in genes involved in virulence, and genes upregulated during germination and hypoxia. Moreover, PQS were found in genes involved in drug resistance. Quadruplexes could have important roles within fungal biology and virulence, but their roles require further elucidation.","Warner, Emily F.; Bohálová, Natália; Brázda, Václav; Waller, Zoë A.

STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort study enrolled very preterm infants (gestational age <32 weeks) from Denmark. Weekly samples of fresh MOM and urine were analyzed for HCMV-DNA. RESULTS: Twenty-six very preterm infants were enrolled. Four acquired an HCMV infection, of which two developed SLS. HCMV-infected infants received MOM with a significant higher viral load compared to the HCMV-uninfected infants. CONCLUSION: A combination of a high viral load and an increased amount of fresh MOM increased the risk of HCMV transmission. SLS was only slightly more common among infants exposed to HCMV positive MOM.","Volder, Christina; Work, Benedicte Juul; Hoegh, Silje Vermedal; Eckhardt, Maria-Christina; Zachariassen, Gitte",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8216583/,413
19616,A molecular signature for the metabolic syndrome by urine metabolomics,2021-07-28,"A previously healthy 49-year-old Japanese woman presented with cervical lymph node swelling and tenderness. Lymph node biopsy revealed reactive lymphadenitis without granulomas. No malignant cells were found, and no acid-fast positive bacilli were identified by Ziehl–Neelsen staining. She was treated unsuccessfully with various antibiotics, and it was very challenging to reach a diagnosis. (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake in bones was evaluated using positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), and disseminated mycobacterial infection was suspected. The interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assays QuantiFERON (QFT) and T-SPOT were used to diagnose tuberculosis infection. On testing, a difference in mitogen response was found between these assays. The response was low for QFT but adequate for T-SPOT, suggesting the presence of anti-IFN-γ antibodies. This difference depended on whether the patient’s plasma (including anti-IFN-γ antibodies) was used within the assay system. Mycobacterium abscessus was isolated from lymph node cultures, and plasma anti-IFN-γ antibodies were confirmed. The patient was diagnosed with disseminated M. abscessus infection with underlying adult-onset immunodeficiency caused by anti-IFN-γ antibodies. Granulomas are a pathological hallmark of mycobacterial infection, but may not fully form in immunodeficient patients. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of mycobacterial infection without granuloma formation due to anti-IFN-γ antibodies.","Asako, Mizuki; Matsunaga, Hitomi; Nakahara, Wataru; Ikeda, Mako; Mima, Fuka; Minami, Ryota; Sekiguchi, Masahiro; Oka, Kazumasa; Wada, Naoki; Suzuki, Katsuhiro; Yoshizawa, Kazutaka; Sakagami, Takuro; Ueda, Shuji",Int J Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8322644/,413
19655,The incidence of multimorbidity and patterns in accumulation of chronic conditions: A systematic review,2021-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions, such as websites and smartphone apps, can be effective in treating drug use disorders (DUDs). However, their implementation in primary care is hindered, in part, by a lack of knowledge on how patients might like these treatments delivered to them. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to increase the understanding of how patients with DUDs prefer to receive app-based treatments to inform the implementation of these treatments in primary care. METHODS: The methods of user-centered design were combined with qualitative research methods to inform the design of workflows for offering app-based treatments in primary care. Adult patients (n=14) with past-year cannabis, stimulant, or opioid use disorder from 5 primary care clinics of Kaiser Permanente Washington in the Seattle area participated in this study. Semistructured interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative template analysis. The coding scheme included deductive codes based on interview topics, which primarily focused on workflow design. Inductive codes emerged from the data. RESULTS: Participants wanted to learn about apps during visits where drug use was discussed and felt that app-related conversations should be incorporated into the existing care whenever possible, as opposed to creating new health care visits to facilitate the use of the app. Nearly all participants preferred receiving clinician support for using apps over using them without support. They desired a trusting, supportive relationship with a clinician who could guide them as they used the app. Participants wanted follow-up support via phone calls or secure messaging because these modes of communication were perceived as a convenient and low burden (eg, no copays or appointment travel). CONCLUSIONS: A user-centered implementation of treatment apps for DUDs in primary care will require health systems to design workflows that account for patients’ needs for structure, support in and outside of visits, and desire for convenience.","Glass, Joseph E; Matson, Theresa E; Lim, Catherine; Hartzler, Andrea L; Kimbel, Kilian; Lee, Amy K; Beatty, Tara; Parrish, Rebecca; Caldeiro, Ryan M; Garza McWethy, Angela; Curran, Geoffrey M; Bradley, Katharine A",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293157/,413
20021,"Closing gaps in histoplasmosis: clinical characteristics and factors associated with probable/histoplasmosis in HIV/AIDS hospitalized patients, a retrospective cross-sectional study in two tertiary centers in Pereira, Colombia",2021-08-12,"BACKGROUND: Local transmission of seasonal influenza viruses (IVs) can be difficult to resolve. Here, we study if coupling high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes with variant analysis can resolve strains from local transmission that have identical consensus genome. We analyzed 24 samples collected over four days in January 2020 at a large university in the US. We amplified complete hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genomic segments followed by Illumina sequencing. We identified consensus complete HA and NA segments using BLASTn and performed variant analysis on strains whose HA and NA segments were 100% similar. RESULTS: Twelve of the 24 samples were PCR positive, and we detected complete HA and/or NA segments by de novo assembly in 83.33% (10/12) of them. Similarity and phylogenetic analysis showed that 70% (7/10) of the strains were distinct while the remaining 30% had identical consensus sequences. These three samples also had IAV and IBV co-infection. However, subsequent variant analysis showed that they had distinct variant profiles. While the IAV HA of one sample had no variant, another had a T663C mutation and another had both C1379T and C1589A. CONCLUSION: In this study, we showed that HTS coupled with variant analysis of only HA and NA genes can help resolve variants that are closely related. We also provide evidence that during a short time period in the 2019–2020 season, co-infection of IAV and IBV occurred on the university campus and both 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 WHO recommended H1N1 vaccine strains were co-circulating.

Full-night polysomnography has been used for diagnosing OSA, but it is too expensive and inconvenient for patients to handle. Metabolome-wide analyses were performed to find and validate surrogate markers for OSA. We further investigated the mechanism underlying hypoxic induction of the markers in human cells and mice. Arachidonic acid derivatives 5-HETE and 5-oxoETE were detected in urine samples. The levels (mean ± SD, ng per mg creatinine) of 5-HETE and 5-oxoETE were 56.4 ± 26.2 and 46.9 ± 18.4 in OSA patients, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in controls (22.5 ± 4.6 and 18.7 ± 3.6). Both levels correlated with the apnea-hypopnea index and the lowest oxygen saturation on polysomnography. After the treatment with the continuous positive airway pressure, the metabolite levels were significantly reduced compared with those before the treatment. In human mononuclear cells subjected to intermittent hypoxia, 5-HETE and 5-oxoETE productions were induced by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and glutathione peroxidase. When mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia, 5-HETE and 5-oxoETE were excreted more in urine. They were identified and verified as new OSA markers reflecting hypoxic stress. The OSA markers could be used for OSA diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation.","Shin, Hyun-Woo; Cho, Kumsun; Rhee, Chae-Seo; Hong, Il-Hee; Cho, Seok Hyun; Kim, Sung Wan; Kim, Jiyoung; So, Daeho; Cho, Joo-Youn; Park, Jong-Wan",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8389315/,413
21539,Goal attainment scaling for patients with low back pain in rehabilitation: A systematic review,2021-09-22,"Mutant p53 (mutp53) commonly loses its DNA binding affinity to p53 response elements (p53REs) and fails to induce apoptosis fully. However, the p53 mutation does not predict chemoresistance in all subtypes of breast cancers, and the critical determinants remain to be identified. In this study, mutp53 was found to mediate chemotherapy-induced long intergenic noncoding RNA-p21 (lincRNA-p21) expression by targeting the G-quadruplex structure rather than the p53RE on its promoter to promote chemosensitivity. However, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) suppressed mutp53-mediated lincRNA-p21 expression by hijacking mutp53 to upregulate damaged DNA binding protein 2 (DDB2) transcription for subsequent DNA repair and chemoresistance. Levels of lincRNA-p21 positively correlated with the clinical responses of breast cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had an inverse correlation with the ER status and DDB2 level. In contrast, the carboplatin-induced DDB2 expression was higher in ER-positive breast tumor tissues. These results demonstrated that ER status determines the oncogenic function of mutp53 in chemoresistance by switching its target gene preference from lincRNA-p21 to DDB2 and suggest that induction of lincRNA-p21 and targeting DDB2 would be effective strategies to increase the chemosensitivity of mutp53 breast cancer patients.","He, Yu-Hao; Yeh, Ming-Hsin; Chen, Hsiao-Fan; Wang, Tsu-Shing; Wong, Ruey-Hong; Wei, Ya-Ling; Huynh, Thanh Kieu; Hu, Dai-Wei; Cheng, Fang-Ju; Chen, Jhen-Yu; Hu, Shu-Wei; Huang, Chia-Chen; Chen, Yeh; Yu, Jiaxin; Cheng, Wei-Chung; Shen, Pei-Chun; Liu, Liang-Chih; Huang, Chih-Hao; Chang, Ya-Jen; Huang, Wei-Chien",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8463322/,413
25615,Stevens Johnson Syndrome – “Steven Who? And Why I Should Care About His Johnson?”,2019-11-15,"Apoptosis is a fundamental process contributing to tissue homeostasis, immune response, and development. CD95, also called Fas, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. Its ligand, CD95L, was initially detected at the plasma membrane of activated T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells where it contributes to the elimination of transformed and infected cells. Given its implication in immune homeostasis and immune surveillance combined with the fact that various lineages of malignant cells exhibit loss-of-function mutations, CD95 was initially classified as a tumor suppressor gene. Nonetheless, in different pathophysiological contexts, this receptor is able to transmit non-apoptotic signals and promote inflammation and carcinogenesis. Although the different non-apoptotic signaling pathways (NF-κB, MAPK, and PI3K) triggered by CD95 are known, the initial molecular events leading to these signals, the mechanisms by which the receptor switches from an apoptotic function to an inflammatory role, and, more importantly, the biological functions of these signals remain elusive.","Fouqué, Amélie; Legembre, Patrick",Cancer Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122270/,413

However, the availability of potent antiviral compounds would be an appreciable advantage in fighting these pathogens. Inside their non-enveloped capsid, picornaviruses possess a positive sense RNA genome with a single open reading frame. Upon release into the cytoplasm, the genome is translated into a single polyprotein that is processed by virally encoded proteinases. These proteinases represent excellent targets for the development of anti-virals for two reasons. First, efficient polyprotein processing is essential for successful viral replication. Second, the picornaviral proteinases show notable differences to cellular proteinases. To aid in the development of anti-virals, detailed knowledge of the mechanisms, substrate specificities and structures of these proteinases is needed. This chapter reviews recent progress, discusses selected substances with antiviral activity against picornavirus proteinases and outlines several new avenues for the design of novel anti-virals.","Neubauer, David; Steinberger, Jutta; Skern, Tim",Viral Proteases and Antiviral Protease Inhibitor Therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122559/,413

27585,Volume 63 - 2007,2011-07-21,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies conducted in various parts of the world have clearly demonstrated that metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an increasing global health problem, not only in Western societies but also in Asian populations. Web-based and mobile phone-based self-management applications have been proven to be effective in improving self-management behaviour of patients with MetS components (i.e., diabetes or hypertension). However, evidence is lacking in terms of their effectiveness specifically for patients with MetS. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN Self-Management e-Health Intervention in improving activation and self-management behaviours among patients with MetS. This paper presents the study protocol. METHODS: A pilot randomised controlled trial will be conducted in a university primary care clinic. A total of 232 patients aged 18–60 years with MetS will be recruited; 116 will be randomised to receive the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN intervention for 6 months, and another 116 patients will continue with usual care. The EMPOWER-SUSTAIN intervention is a multifaceted chronic disease management strategy based on the Chronic Care Model and persuasive technology theory. It consists of training primary care physicians, nurses and patients to use the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN web-based self-management mobile app, strengthening the patient–physician relationship and reinforcing the use of relevant clinical practice guidelines to guide management and prescribing. The primary outcome is the mean change in patient activation score using the Patient Activation Measure short form Malay version (PAM-13-M) questionnaire. The secondary outcomes include the changes in waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, patient physical activity level, eating behaviour, perception of chronic illness care, satisfaction with patient–physician interaction, and perceived absolute 10-year cardiovascular disease risk. Feasibility of implementing the intervention will be evaluated. This includes acceptability of the intervention, estimating the likely rate of participant recruitment and retention, appropriateness of the outcome measures, calculation of sample size, and the intervention’s potential effectiveness. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study in Malaysia that aims to determine the feasibility of a multifaceted e-health intervention, as well as to indicate more useful aspects of this intervention for further exploration in a larger trial.

The BDRI, applied on Africa, includes the topic of happiness within the digital wellbeing driver, but the link between the two topics requires further investigation. Thus, two underlying questions emerge: what is the relation between happiness and big data? And how does Africa perform in digital wellbeing? This paper includes a structured literature review highlighting five key clusters indicating this link. Furthermore, we present some first empirical insights using the BDRI focusing on Africa.

Any person can catch COVID-19 from an infected person via aerosol droplets when the person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To limit such a transmission, World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended people to wear masks and physically distance themselves by staying at least 1 m (3 feet) away from others. As aerosol droplets (by cough or sneeze) land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails, and remain active on these surfaces for hours to days, people are advised to use soaps for at least 20 s. and alcohol-based sanitizers as well. As the public made efforts, clinicians and researchers investigated and found that drugs which were initially used to treat other diseases may work as a treatment option for COVID-19. One of those drugs was Chloroquine and its related derivative called hydroxychloroquine. In this review article, we have systematically searched for details of COVID-19 pandemic till May 2020 and assembled few data pertaining to (i) Corona viruses; (ii) SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19’ and (iii) How chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine mediates anti-viral effect in both prophylactic and therapeutic setting. These data have been acquired mostly from PubMed and websites of WHO and Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).

This added to an existing climate of variability in the undergraduate and foundation teaching curriculum. Junior doctors were subsequently reporting a lack in confidence when dealing with surgical patients. We aimed to assess the surgical learning needs of junior doctors and designed a quality improvement project that included implementing a surgical teaching programme to improve the quality of surgical education. METHODS: A baseline questionnaire was completed by foundation year one doctors to establish confidence levels in managing surgical patients and carrying out practical procedures. Two sequential improvement strategies were subsequently implemented and assessed using the Plan-Do-Study-Act methodology. Junior doctors participated in a local surgical workshop in limited numbers during cycle 1, and then attended four online webinar tutorials themed around general surgery for cycle 2. RESULTS: A total of 15 participants responded to the baseline questionnaire, 13 attended the workshop and a combined total of 572 viewed the four webinars. Mean confidence increase following the workshop was 113% (W = 91.0, p < 0.001). Mean knowledge increase from the online webinars was 62.3% (t = 4.67, p = 0.009) and mean confidence increase was 66.67% (p < 0.0001).

57502,POSTER ABSTRACTS: P37 CONTRACEPTIVE SERVICE PROVISION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AMONG SAFETY-NET FAMILY PLANNING CLINICS IN A SOUTHEASTERN STATE,2021-09-06,"Defense mechanisms are relevant indicators of psychological functioning and vulnerability to psychopathology. Their evaluation can unveil individuals' unconscious strategies for mediating reactions to emotional conflict and external stressors. At the beginning of their journey toward gender reassignment, individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria (GD) may experience conflict and stressful experiences that trigger a wide range of defense mechanisms. Mature defenses may strengthen these individuals as they travel along this important path, while neurotic and immature defenses may exacerbate their body dissatisfaction (BD) and hinder their processing of change. Only a few studies have investigated self-reported defensive functioning in transgender people, finding a higher frequency of maladaptive defense mechanisms relative to controls. The present study was the first to apply an in-depth clinician-rated tool to assess the entire hierarchy of defense mechanisms within a sample of transgender people. Defensive functioning and personality organization were assessed in 36 individuals diagnosed with GD (14 trans women, 22 trans men, mean age 23.47 years), using the Defense Mechanisms Rating Scales (Perry, 1990) and the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure-200 (Shedler et al., 2014). Body uneasiness was assessed using the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT; Cuzzolaro et al., 2006). The findings showed that defensive functioning correlated positively with healthy personality functioning and negatively with BD. Compared to cisgender controls, participants with GD who presented greater defensive functioning were found to be more immature and to demonstrate significant differences in many levels of functioning. The clinical implications of the results suggest that psychological interventions aimed at improving defensive functioning in individuals with GD will be important in helping them manage the challenges posed by their gender transition.","Giovanardi, Guido; Mirabella, Marta; Di Giuseppe, Mariagrazia; Lombardo, Francesco; Speranza, Anna Maria; Lingiardi, Vittorio",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415164/,413
57780,Single-Session Therapy by Appointment for the Treatment of Anxiety Disorders in Youth and Adults: A Systematic Review of the Literature,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Reaping the benefits from massive volumes of data collected in all sectors to improve population health, inform personalized medicine, and transform biomedical research requires the delicate balance between the benefits and risks of using individual-level data. There is a patchwork of US data protection laws that vary depending on the type of data, who is using it, and their intended purpose. Differences in these laws challenge big data projects using data from different sources. The decisions to permit or restrict data uses are determined by elected officials; therefore, constituent input is critical to finding the right balance between individual privacy and public benefits. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the US public’s preferences for using identifiable data for different purposes without their consent. METHODS: We measured data use preferences of a nationally representative sample of 504 US adults by conducting a web-based survey in February 2020. The survey used a choice-based conjoint analysis. We selected choice-based conjoint attributes and levels based on 5 US data protection laws (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, Privacy Act of 1974, Federal Trade Commission Act, and the Common Rule). There were 72 different combinations of attribute levels, representing different data use scenarios. Participants were given 12 pairs of data use scenarios and were asked to choose the scenario they were the most comfortable with. We then simulated the population preferences by using the hierarchical Bayes regression model using the ChoiceModelR package in R. RESULTS: Participants strongly preferred data reuse for public health and research than for profit-driven, marketing, or crime-detection activities. Participants also strongly preferred data use by universities or nonprofit organizations over data use by businesses and governments. Participants were fairly indifferent about the different types of data used (health, education, government, or economic data). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a notable incongruence between public preferences and current US data protection laws. Our findings appear to show that the US public favors data uses promoting social benefits over those promoting individual or organizational interests. This study provides strong support for continued efforts to provide safe access to useful data sets for research and public health. Policy makers should consider more robust public health and research data use exceptions to align laws with public preferences. In addition, policy makers who revise laws to enable data use for research and public health should consider more comprehensive protection mechanisms, including transparent use of data and accountability.","Schmit, Cason; Giannouchos, Theodoros; Ramezani, Mahin; Zheng, Qi; Morrisey, Michael A; Kum, Hye-Chung",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406123/,413
59310,"Decrease of Infectious Complications in Outpatients With Autoimmune Diseases From 2019 to 2020 Under the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single-Center, Retrospective Cohort Study in Japan",2021-10-05,"To handle the massive high-speed internet traffic, free space optics (FSO) or single-mode fiber (SMF) based fiber optic communication is being used everywhere across the world. These technologies are capable of providing huge bandwidth and transmitting the data at very high speed with low energy consumption. FSO is a very convenient technology to quickly expand the legacy network in the adverse geographical areas. However, its link performance is highly dependent of inconsistent weather conditions. SMF based fiber optic link has a very low loss and its performance is almost independent on the weather conditions. Though, the installation and maintenance of fibers are quite complex and costly. Individually, FSO or SMF links have their limitations and have to be integrated to leverage their benefits. In this paper, we integrated FSO/SMF links and compared the performance of the proposed architecture which is capable of providing high-speed dual-rate data transmission. The proposed architecture transmits data over either FSO or SMF or both links simultaneously and has 100% more reliability against any one of the link failures. In case of operational link failure (FSO/SMF), data may be switched to the alternative working link (SMF/FSO), simply by tuning the transmitted signal by 50 GHz. The proposed architecture is also reliable against the optical line terminal transceiver (TRx) failure as each user located in the network can be served by two transceivers (1 Gbps and 10 Gbps). The proposed architecture also supports the wavelength division multiplexing overlay transmission for broadcasting the common signal to all the available users in the networks. The architecture reduces ~ 27% of the energy consumption by utilizing the appropriate link of hybrid architecture and TRx according to weather conditions and traffic load. The integrated architecture looks attractive for providing energy-efficient, high speed, and reliable internet coverage to the areas where there is a difficulty of laying fibers and has frequent fiber faults. The architecture is useful for strengthening and boosting rural and urban development.","Garg, Amit Kumar; Metya, Sanjeev Kumar; Singh, Ghanshyam; Janyani, Vijay; Aly, Moustafa H.; Zainol Abidin, N.

60353,Hydroxychloroquine: Not a Heart Breaker!,2020-10-23,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow-diverter stents are widely used for the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. Various parameters may influence intracranial aneurysm thrombosis, including the flow reduction induced by flow-diverter stent implantation, which is assumed to play a leading role. However, its actual impact remains unclear due to the lack of detailed intra-aneurysmal flow measurements. This study aimed to clarify this relationship by quantitatively measuring the intra-aneurysmal flow using 4D phase-contrast MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS We acquired prospective pre- and post-stent implantation 4D phase-contrast MR imaging data of a consecutive series of 23 patients treated with flow-diverter stents. Velocity field data were combined with the intraprocedural 3D angiogram vessel geometries for precise intracranial aneurysm extraction and partial volume correction. Intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic modifications were compared with occlusion outcomes at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS The averaged velocities at systole were lower after flow-diverter stent implantation for all patients and ranged from 21.7 ± 7.1 cm/s before to 7.2 ± 2.9 cm/s after stent placement. The velocity reduction was more important for the group of patients with aneurysm thrombosis at 6 months (68.8%) and decreased gradually from 66.2% to 55% for 12-month thrombosis and no thrombosis, respectively (P = .08). CONCLUSIONS We propose an innovative approach to measure intracranial flow changes after flow-diverter stent implantation. We identified a trend between flow reduction and thrombosis outcome that brings a new insight into current understanding of the flow-diversion treatment response.","Brina, O; Bouillot, P; Reymond, P; Luthman, A S; Santarosa, C; Fahrat, M; Lovblad, K O; Machi, P; Delattre, B M A; Pereira, V M; Vargas, M I",AJNR.

METHODS We used synthetic control methods to estimate programme effects on homicides and incidents of non-fatal penetrating firearm injury (non-fatal shootings) in neighbourhoods that had Safe Streets' sites and model-generated counterfactuals. Synthetic control analyses were conducted for each firearm violence outcome in each of the seven areas where Safe Streets was implemented. The study also investigated variation in programme impact over time by generating effect estimates of varying durations for the longest-running programme sites. RESULTS Synthetic control models reduced prediction error relative to regression analyses. Estimates of Safe Streets' effects on firearm violence varied across intervention sites: some positive, some negative and no effect. Beneficial programme effects on firearm violence reported in prior research were found to have attenuated over time. CONCLUSIONS For highly targeted interventions, synthetic control methods may provide more valid estimates of programme impact than panel regression with data from all city neighbourhoods. This research offers new understanding about the effectiveness of the Cure Violence intervention over extended periods of time in seven neighbourhoods. Combined with existing Cure Violence evaluation literature, it also raises questions about contextual and implementation factors that might influence programme outcomes.","Buggs, Shani A; Webster, Daniel W; Crifasi, Cassandra K",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,https://doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2020-044056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558396/,413

We hypothesized that older adults would reduce the number of days driving and number of trips/day they make after COVID-19 case acceleration. Data from 214 adults aged 66.5 to 92.8 years were used. Women comprised 47.6% of the sample and 15.4% were African American. Participants reduced the proportion of days driven during the pandemic (.673 vs. .382 [p < .001]) compared with same period the year before (.695 vs. .749). Trips/day showed a similar decline (p < .001). Participants also took shorter trips (p = .02), drove slower (p < .001), had fewer speeding incidents (p < .001), and had different trip destinations (p < .001).

There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, although cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV but also has implications for immunogen design and vaccine development.","Lv, Huibin; Wu, Nicholas C; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Yuan, Meng; Perera, Ranawaka A P M; Leung, Wai Shing; So, Ray T Y; Chan, Jacky Man Chun; Yip, Garrick K; Chik, Thomas Shiu Hong; Wang, Yiquan; Choi, Chris Yau Chung; Lin, Yihan; Ng, Wilson W; Zhao, Jincun; Poon, Leo L M; Peiris, J S Malik; Wilson, Ian A; Mok, Chris K P",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500101/,413

Intermittent pneumatic compression reduced deep venous thrombosis after stroke.,2013,"The relationship between immunosenescence and the host response to virus infection is poorly understood at the molecular level. Two different patterns of pulmonary host responses to virus were observed when gene expression profiles from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected young mice that show minimal disease were compared to those from SARS-CoV-infected aged mice that develop pneumonitis. In young mice, genes related to cellular development, cell growth, and cell cycle were downregulated during peak viral replication, and these transcripts returned to basal levels as virus was cleared. In contrast, aged mice had a greater number of upregulated immune response and cell-to-cell signaling genes, and the expression of many genes was sustained even after viral clearance, suggesting an exacerbated host response to virus. Interestingly, in SARS-CoV-infected aged mice, a subset of genes, including Tnfa, Il6, Ccl2, Ccl3, Cxcl10, and Ifng, was induced in a biphasic pattern that correlated with peak viral replication and a subsequent influx of lymphocytes and severe histopathologic changes in the lungs.

They are also linked to neurological disorders, cancer, and aging processes. Genome-wide studies continue to identify helicase genes that change their expression patterns after infection or disease outbreak, but the mechanism of RNA helicase action has been defined for only a few diseases.

A systematic review.,2021-05-05,"Since the early 2000s, three novel zooanthroponous coronaviruses (Betacoronavirus) have emerged. The first outbreak of infection (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV virus occurred in the fall of 2002 in China (Guangdong Province). A second outbreak (MERS) associated with the new MERS-CoV virus appeared in Saudi Arabia in autumn 2012. The third epidemic, which turned into a COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in China (Hubei Province) in the autumn 2019. This review focuses on ecological and genetic aspects that lead to the emergence of new human zoanthroponous coronaviruses. The main mechanism of adaptation of zoonotic betacoronaviruses to humans is to changes in the receptor-binding domain of surface protein (S), as a result of which it gains the ability to bind human cellular receptors of epithelial cells in respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. This process is caused by the high genetic diversity and variability combined with frequent recombination, during virus circulation in their natural reservoir - bats (Microchiroptera, Chiroptera). Appearance of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (subgenus Sarbecovirus), and MERS (subgenus Merbecovirus) viruses is a result of evolutionary events occurring in bat populations with further transfer of viruses to the human directly or through the intermediate vertebrate hosts, ecologically connected with bats.

Sleep fragmentation caused hyperalgesia in volunteers, while nocturnal hypoxemia enhanced morphine analgesic potency in children with OSA. This evidence directly relates to surgical OSA patients who are at risk for airway compromise due to postoperative use of opioids. Using accepted experimental pain models, we characterized pain processing and opioid analgesia in male volunteers recruited based on their risk for OSA. METHODS After approval from the Intitutional Review Board and informed consent, we assessed heat and cold pain thresholds and tolerances in volunteers after overnight polysomnography (PSG). Three pro-inflammatory and 3 hypoxia markers were determined in the serum. Pain tests were performed at baseline, placebo, and two effect site concentrations of remifentanil (1 and 2 µg/ml), an μ-opioid agonist. Linear mixed effects regression models were employed to evaluate the association of 3 PSG descriptors [wake after sleep onset, number of sleep stage shifts, and lowest oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO(2)) during sleep] and all serum markers with pain thresholds and tolerances at baseline, as well as their changes under remifentanil. RESULTS Forty-three volunteers (12 normal and 31 with a PSG-based diagnosis of OSA) were included in the analysis. The lower nadir SaO(2) and higher insulin growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) were associated with higher analgesic sensitivity to remifentanil (SaO(2), P = 0.0440; IGFBP-1, P = 0.0013). Other pro-inflammatory mediators like interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were associated with an enhanced sensitivity to the opioid analgesic effect (IL-1β, P = 0.0218; TNF-α, P = 0.0276). CONCLUSIONS Nocturnal hypoxemia in subjects at high risk for OSA was associated with an increased potency of opioid analgesia. A serum hypoxia marker (IGFBP-1) was associated with hypoalgesia and increased potency to opioid analgesia; other pro-inflammatory mediators also predicted an enhanced opioid potency.

Plasma coproporphyrin-I (CP-I) is spotlighted as a highly accurate endogenous substrate of OATP1B. This study focused on patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and evaluated the influence of several factors comprising gene polymorphisms, uremic toxins and inflammatory cytokines on OATP1B activity using plasma CP-I concentration. Thirty-seven outpatients with RA who satisfied the selection criteria were analyzed at the time of recruitment (baseline) and at the next visit. OATP1B1*15 carriers tended to have higher CP-I concentration compared to non-carriers. Plasma CP-I correlated positively with CMPF concentration, but did not correlate with IL-6 or TNF-α concentration. Multiple logistic regression analysis by stepwise selection identified plasma CMPF concentration and OATP1B1*15 allele as significant factors independently affecting plasma CP-I concentration at baseline and at the next visit, respectively. In conclusion, the present results suggest that inflammatory cytokines do not have clinically significant effects on OATP1B activity, whereas the effects of genetic polymorphisms and uremic toxins should be considered.","Ono, Hiroyuki; Tanaka, Ryota; Suzuki, Yosuke; Oda, Ayako; Ozaki, Takashi; Tatsuta, Ryosuke; Maeshima, Keisuke; Ishii, Koji; Ohno, Keiko; Shibata, Hirotaka; Itoh, Hiroki",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34319605/,413

We retrospectively reviewed eight patients with craniocervical junction DAVF who were evaluated at our institution between 2009 and 2012. We also conducted a MEDLINE search for all reports of craniocervical junction DAVF between 1970 and 2013, and reviewed 119 patients from 56 studies. From a total of 127 patients, 46 (37.1%) presented with myelopathy, 53 (43.1%) with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and four (3.3%) with brainstem dysfunction. SAH was typically mild, most often Hunt and Hess Grade I or II (83.3%), and associated with ascending venous drainage via the intracranial veins (p<0.001). Higher rates of obliteration were observed after microsurgery compared to embolization. Overall, younger age (odds ratio [OR] 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.12; p=0.011), hemorrhagic presentation (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.06-0.50; p=0.001), and microsurgery (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.08-0.6; p=0.004) were independently predictive of good outcome at the last follow-up. Microsurgery was the only independent predictor of overall improvement at the last follow-up (OR 4.35; 95% CI 1.44-13.2; p=0.009). Prompt diagnosis and microsurgical management, offering a greater chance of immediate obliteration, may optimize the outcomes for patients with craniocervical junction DAVF. Endovascular treatment is often not feasible due to lesion angioarchitecture, and is associated with a higher risk of lesion recanalization or recurrence. However, long term studies with newer embolic agents such as Onyx (ev3 Endovascular, Plymouth, MN, USA) are yet to be performed.","Wang, Joanna Y; Molenda, Joseph; Bydon, Ali; Colby, Geoffrey P; Coon, Alexander L; Tamargo, Rafael J; Huang, Judy",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2015.05.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26195333/,413

However, renal dysfunction is often observed in patients with thromboembolic disease and was previously shown to be associated with increased D-dimer levels. We seek to validate previously suggested estimated glomerular filtration rate-adjusted D-dimer cutoff levels. Furthermore, we strive to explore whether the type of renal dysfunction affects estimated glomerular filtration rate-adjusted D-dimer test characteristics. DESIGN Single-center retrospective data analysis from electronic healthcare records of all emergency department patients admitted for suspected thromboembolic disease. SETTING Tertiary care academic hospital. SUBJECTS Exclusion criteria were as follows: age less than 16 years old, patients with active bleeding, and/or incomplete records. INTERVENTIONS Test characteristics of previously suggested that estimated glomerular filtration rate-adjusted D-dimer cutoff levels (> 333 µg/L [estimated glomerular filtration rate, > 60 mL/min/1.73 m], > 1,306 µg/L [30-60 mL/min/1.73 m], and > 1,663 µg/L [< 30 mL/min/1.73 m]) were validated and compared with the conventional D-dimer cutoff level of 500 µg/L. MAIN RESULTS A total of 14,477 patients were included in the final analysis, with 467 patients (3.5%) diagnosed with thromboembolic disease. Renal dysfunction was observed in 1,364 (9.4%) of the total population. When adjusted D-dimer levels were applied, test characteristics remained stable: negative predictive value (> 99%), sensitivity (91.2% vs 93.4%), and specificity (42.7% vs 50.7%) when compared with the conventional D-dimer cutoff level to rule out thromboembolic disease (< 500 µg/L). Comparable characteristics were also observed when adjusted D-dimer cutoff levels were applied in patients with acute kidney injury (negative predictive value, 98.8%; sensitivity, 95.8%; specificity, 39.2%) and/or ""acute on chronic"" renal dysfunction (negative predictive value, 98.0%; sensitivity, 92.9%; specificity, 48.5%). CONCLUSIONS D-Dimer cutoff levels adjusted for renal dysfunction appear feasible and safe assessing thromboembolic disease in critically ill patients. Furthermore, adjusted D-dimer cutoff levels seem reliable in patients with acute kidney injury and ""acute on chronic"" renal dysfunction. In patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m, the false-positive rate can be reduced when estimated glomerular filtration rate-adjusted D-dimer cutoff levels are applied.","Schefold, Joerg C; Gerber, Joël L; Angehrn, Michelle C; Müller, Martin; Messmer, Anna S; Leichtle, Alexander B; Fiedler, Georg M; Exadaktylos, Aristomenis K; Pfortmueller, Carmen A",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31913987/,413

Clinically, it may manifest as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), with GAD-Ab patients difficult to distinguish. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare brain metabolism of patients with mTLE and high serum titers of GAD-Ab (>2000 UI/ml) to those with mTLE and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and confirmed GAD-ab negativity. METHODS Images from PET studies were normalized to an SPM 12 template. Voxel to voxel comparisons were made using a two-sample one-tailed t-test. RESULTS In both patients with GAD-Ab and controls (mTLE-HS), hypometabolism in mesial temporal lobe areas was observed. When comparing the two groups, GAD-Ab patients had statistically significant reduced metabolism in both insulae and medial inferior frontal-hypothalamus area (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Hypometabolism in mesial temporal lobe areas together with hypometabolism in insulae and medial inferior frontal-hypothalamus may be characteristic of patients with epilepsy and GAD-ab. This PET pattern could be a useful diagnostic tool to identify GAD-Ab patients.","Mongay-Ochoa, Neus; Sala-Padró, Jacint; Reynés-Llompart, Gabriel; Rodríguez-Bel, Laura; Jaraba, Sònia; Morandeira, Francisco; Falip, Mercè",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,https://doi.org/10.1111/jon.12874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955107/,413

74523,Protocol for systematic review: patient decision aids for total hip and knee arthroplasty decision-making.,2021-01-04,"Introduction There is conflicting evidence on the impact of atrial fibrillation (AF) type, i.e. non-paroxysmal AF or paroxysmal AF, on thromboembolic recurrence. The consensus of risk equivalence is greatly based on historical evidence, focussing on initial stroke risks. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the impact of AF type on the risk of thromboembolic recurrence, mortality and major haemorrhage in patients with previous stroke. Methods We systematically searched four multidisciplinary databases from inception to December 2018. We selected observational studies investigating clinical outcomes in patients with ischaemic stroke and AF, stratified by AF type. We assessed all included studies for risk of bias using the 'Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Exposures' tool. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software was used to calculate odds ratios from crude event rates. Results After reviewing 14,127 citations, we selected 108 studies for full-text screening. We extracted data from a total of 26 studies, reporting outcomes on 23,054 patients. Overall, risk of bias was moderate. The annual incidence rates of thromboembolism in patients with non-paroxysmal AF and paroxysmal AF were 7.1% (95% confidence interval: 4.2-11.7) and 5.2% (95% confidence interval: 3.2-8.2), respectively. The odds ratio for thromboembolism in patients with non-paroxysmal AF versus paroxysmal AF was 1.47 (95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.99, p = 0.013). The annual mortality rates in patients with non-paroxysmal AF and paroxysmal AF were 20.0% (95% confidence interval: 13.2-28.0) and 10.1% (95% confidence interval: 5.4-17.3), respectively, and odds ratio was 1.90 (95% confidence interval: 1.43-2.52, p < 0.001). There was no difference in rates of major haemorrhage, odds ratio = 1.01 (95% confidence interval: 0.61-1.69, p = 0.966). Conclusion In patients with prior stroke, non-paroxysmal AF is associated with significantly higher risk of thromboembolic recurrence and mortality than paroxysmal AF. Although current guidelines make no distinction between non-paroxysmal AF and paroxysmal AF for secondary stroke prevention, future guidance and risk stratification tools may need to consider this differential risk (PROSPERO ID: CRD42019118531).","Mentel, Antonia; Quinn, Terence J; Cameron, Alan C; Lees, Kennedy R; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil H",European stroke journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987319896674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637649/,413

METHODS The authors conducted a propensity score (PS)-matched double-cohort study (N=5,562 in each cohort) with data from the TriNetX Research Network database to identify 54,529 adult patients (≥18 years) diagnosed as having COVID-19 between February 20 and June 30, 2020. RESULTS Primary analysis (PS matched on demographic characteristics and presence of diabetes and obesity) showed that substance use disorder was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (odds ratio [OR]=1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.69-2.01), ventilator use (OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.22-1.72), and mortality (OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.08-1.56). CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that COVID-19 patients with substance use disorders are at increased risk for adverse outcomes. The attenuation of ORs in the model that matched for chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases associated with substance abuse suggests that the observed risks may be partially mediated by these conditions.","Baillargeon, Jacques; Polychronopoulou, Efstathaia; Kuo, Yong-Fang; Raji, Mukaila A",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138712/,413

76315,Depression and anxiety in pregnancy during COVID-19: A rapid review and meta-analysis.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Surgical correction of hiatal hernia (HH) during bariatric surgery has been found to improve patient outcomes and decrease reoperation rate. Although barium esophagram is more sensitive than endoscopy for detection of HH, accurate preoperative diagnosis remains a challenge. The aim of this study is to determine whether diagnostic accuracy improves by utilizing right anterior oblique (RAO) esophagram technique instead of the commonly used upright technique when comparing to the gold standard of intraoperative detection. METHODS All patients undergoing bariatric surgery were prospectively evaluated for HH by barium esophagram. After the first 69 patients, the technique was changed from upright to RAO. Hiatal hernia was assessed intraoperatively by laxity of the phrenoesophageal ligament and, if present, was repaired posteriorly. Two board-certified radiologists specializing in gastrointestinal radiology, who were blinded to the intraoperative results, retrospectively reviewed the esophagrams. Consensus reads were utilized for divergent opinions. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each technique. RESULTS Between 2008 and 2010, a total of 388 patients underwent preoperative esophagrams (69 upright, 388 RAO). For upright esophagram, sensitivity was 50 % and specificity was 97 %. For RAO esophagram, sensitivity was 70 % and specificity was 77 %. RAO had a lower percentage of false negatives (11 vs. 21 %) than upright esophagram. CONCLUSIONS The use of RAO technique for preoperative esophagram is more sensitive for diagnosis of hiatal hernia than upright esophagram. If surgeons desire routine preoperative esophagram, RAO technique is the best.","Heacock, Laura; Parikh, Manish; Jain, Rajat; Balthazar, Emil; Hindman, Nicole",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-012-0721-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23011460/,413

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty RF ablations were performed in 24 patients (mean age: 61 years) with bone metastases. Half of the patients had an additional PV. The primary end point was pain relief evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS) before treatment, and at 1 and 6 months' FU. Functional outcome was assessed according to the evolution of their ability to walk at 6 months' FU. Imaging FU was available in 20 out of 24 patients with a mean delay of 4.7 months. RESULTS Reduction of pain was obtained at 6 months FU in 81% of cases (15 out of 18). Mean pretreatment VAS was 6.4 (±2.7). Mean VAS was 1.9 (±2.4) at 1 month FU, and 2.3 (±2.9) at 6 months' FU. Pain was significantly reduced at 6 months FU (mean VAS reduction = 4.1; P < 0.00001). Functional improvement was obtained in 74% of the cases. Major complications rate was 12.5 % (3 out of 24) with 2 skin burns, and 1 case of myelopathy. Local tumour recurrence or progression was recorded in 5 cases. CONCLUSION Radiofrequency ablation is an effective technique in terms of pain relief and functional recovery for the treatment of bone metastases, which provides a relatively low rate of local recurrence.","Clarençon, Frédéric; Jean, Betty; Pham, Hang-Phuong; Cormier, Evelyne; Bensimon, Gilbert; Rose, Michèle; Maksud, Philippe; Chiras, Jacques",Skeletal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-011-1294-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22080377/,413

Most commonly this is a result of thrombus formation within the vessel, thromboembolism or an acute vasospastic response. There are several options for flow restoration including pharmacological, mechanical and microsurgical. Mechanical flow restoration, usually by thrombectomy, is typically performed in large cerebral vessels. Current mechanical thrombectomy devices have limited utility in smaller vessels that are more difficult to access, such as the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). We present two cases where successful flow restoration of an intraoperative acutely occluded or thrombotic ACA was rapidly achieved by balloon dilation using a new coaxial dual-lumen balloon catheter.

In July 2013, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended the following treatment hierarchy for varicose veins: endothermal ablation, ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, surgery and compression hosiery. The aim of this paper is to review the randomised controlled trials that have compared endothermal ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy to determine if the level 1 evidence base still supports an ""endothermal ablation first"" strategy for the treatment of varicose veins. METHODS A PubMed and OVID literature search (until 31 January 2015) was performed and randomised controlled trials comparing endothermal ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy were obtained. RESULTS Although anatomical success appeared higher with endothermal ablation than ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, clinical success and patient-reported outcomes measures were similar. Morbidity and complication rates were very low and not significantly different between endothermal ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy. Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy was consistently less expensive that endothermal ablation. CONCLUSIONS All endovenous modalities appear to be successful and have a role in modern day practice. Although further work is required to optimise ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy technique to maximise anatomical success and minimise retreatment, the present level 1 evidence base shows there is no significant difference in clinical important outcomes between ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy and endothermal ablation. As ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy is less expensive, it is likely to be a more cost-effective option in most patients in most healthcare settings. Strict adherence to the treatment hierarchy recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence seems unjustified.","Davies, Huw Ob; Popplewell, Matthew; Darvall, Katy; Bate, Gareth; Bradbury, Andrew W",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355515595194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26163507/,413

Here we introduce chemical-crosslinking assisted proximity capture (CAP-C), a method that uses multifunctional chemical crosslinkers with defined sizes to capture chromatin contacts. CAP-C generates chromatin contact maps at subkilobase (sub-kb) resolution with low background noise. We applied CAP-C to formaldehyde prefixed mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and investigated loop domains (median size of 200 kb) and nonloop domains (median size of 9 kb). Transcription inhibition caused a greater loss of contacts in nonloop domains than loop domains. We uncovered conserved, transcription-state-dependent chromatin compartmentalization at high resolution that is shared from Drosophila to human, and a transcription-initiation-dependent nuclear subcompartment that brings multiple nonloop domains in close proximity. We also showed that CAP-C could be used to detect native chromatin conformation without formaldehyde prefixing.","You, Qiancheng; Cheng, Anthony Youzhi; Gu, Xi; Harada, Bryan T; Yu, Miao; Wu, Tong; Ren, Bing; Ouyang, Zhengqing; He, Chuan",Nature biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0643-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839564/,413

It is the assertion and experience of the authors that the triangle of ethics and ethical behaviour, followers, and patient's outcomes is closely interrelated and affects each other in a very intimate and direct way. Unethical leadership may lead to follower disappointment and distrust, leading to lack of interest and commitment, consequently negatively impacting patient outcomes and organizational effectiveness.","Keselman, David; Saxe-Braithwaite, Marcy",Healthcare management forum,https://doi.org/10.1177/0840470420973051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33327784/,413

The reorganization of the strategies of a surgical department and the nosocomial diffusion of Covid-19. INTRODUCTION During the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, preventive measures and patients' selection were adopted to allow the treatment of non-deferrable oncological and trauma cases and to contain hospital diffusion of the virus. The reorganization of the ward management associated to the training of healthcare providers are the first available interventions. AIM To describe the interventions implemented to limit the spread of virus during the peak of pandemic in a high daily turn-over 25 beds surgical ward (9 patient admitted per day/mean duration of hospital stay 2.3 days). METHOD Description of the interventions implemented and of the admissions from March 9 to May 18 2020, and the swab results. RESULTS 392 patients were treated in the period considered (342 were scheduled cases - 50 urgent cases; 364 were adults and 28 children). All scheduled patients underwent a screening survey, 5% of those contacted showed a risk factor at the interview and were rescheduled; 190 patients underwent a preoperative screening swab, all with negative results. None of healthcare providers was positive to swabs. CONCLUSIONS The prompt application of preventive measures and patients screening (preoperative interview and screening swab) possibly allowed to control the spread of SARS-CoV2 in our hospital. Sharing our experience would allow to find consensus to guarantee the safety for patients and healthcare workers.","Facchin, Federico; Contarato, Roberta; Barzon, Fabiola; Bennici, Silvia Eugenia; Boemo, Deris Gianni; Bassetto, Franco",Assistenza infermieristica e ricerca : AIR,https://doi.org/10.1702/3454.34429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077981/,413
86716,Instant Gratification as a Method to Promote Physician Practice Guideline Adherence: A Systematic Review.,2020-07-25,"Public health surveillance can have profound impacts on the health of populations, with COVID-19 surveillance offering an illuminating example. Surveillance surrounding COVID-19 testing, conﬁrmed cases, and deaths has provided essential information to public health professionals about how to minimize morbidity and mortality. In the United States, surveillance has also pointed out how populations, on the basis of geography, age, and race and ethnicity, are being impacted disproportionately, allowing targeted intervention and evaluation. However, COVID-19 surveillance has also highlighted how the public health surveillance system fails some communities, including sexual and gender minorities. This failure has come about because of the haphazard and disorganized way disease reporting data are collected, analyzed, and reported in the United States, and the structural homophobia, transphobia, and biphobia acting within these systems. We provide recommendations for addressing these concerns after examining experiences collecting race data in COVID-19 surveillance and attempts in Pennsylvania and California to incorporate sexual orientation and gender identity variables into their pandemic surveillance efforts.

We herein performed a network meta-analysis to examine the role of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in Asian patients with AF. METHODS A systematic search of the publications was conducted in PubMed and Embase databases for eligible studies until July 2019. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were regarded as the effect estimates. The surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) for the ranking probabilities was calculated. RESULTS A total of 17 studies were included. For comparisons of NOACs vs warfarin, dabigatran (OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.86), rivaroxaban (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.65-0.81), apixaban (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.49-0.65), but not edoxaban reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism, wheres dabigatran (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.41-0.76), rivaroxaban (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.50-0.86), apixaban (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.36-0.66), and edoxaban (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.24-0.49) decreased the risk of major bleeding. In reducing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism, apixaban and rivaroxaban ranked the best and second best (SUCRA 0.2% and 31.4%, respectively), followed by dabigatran (50.2%), edoxaban (75.2%), and warfarin (93.0%). In reducing the risk of major bleeding, edoxaban, and apixaban ranked the best and second best (1.5% and 30.8%, respectively), followed by dabigatran (48.4%), rivaroxaban (69.2%), and warfarin (100%). CONCLUSION NOACs were at least as effective as warfarin, but more safer in Asians with AF. Apixaban was superior to other NOACs for reducing stroke or systemic embolism, while edoxaban showed a better safety profile than other NOACs.","Liu, Xuyang; Huang, Manxiang; Ye, Caisheng; Zeng, Junquan; Zeng, Changai; Ma, Jianyong",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629725/,413

We reviewed recent peer-reviewed and grey literature to summarize social norms relevant to complementary feeding (CF), intervention approaches that address norms, and their impacts on social norms and CF outcomes. Many reports described various norms, customs, and perceptions related to appropriate foods for young children, parenting practices, gender, and family roles, but rarely explored how they motivated behavior. Community engagement and media interventions addressed norms through facilitated discussions, challenging negative norms, portraying positive norms, engaging emotions, and correcting misperceptions. Evaluations of norms-focused interventions reported improved CF practices, but few assessed impacts on social norms. Although multiple contextual factors influence CF practices, evidence suggests the feasibility and effectiveness of addressing social norms as one component of programs to improve CF practices.","Dickin, Katherine L; Litvin, Kate; McCann, Juliet K; Coleman, Fiona M",Current developments in nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1093/cdn/nzab001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718753/,413
87156,Transition of children with life-limiting conditions to adult care and healthcare use: a systematic review.,2021-03-02,"BACKGROUND Vancomycin is commonly used to treat gram-positive bacterial infections in the paediatric population, but dosing can be challenging. Population pharmacokinetic (popPK) modelling can improve individualization of dosing regimens. The primary objective of this study was to describe popPK models of vancomycin and factors that influence pharmacokinetic (PK) variability in paediatric patients. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and the grey literature without language or publication status restrictions from inception to 17 August 2020. Observational studies that described the development of popPK models of vancomycin in paediatric patients (< 18 years of age) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Study Quality Assessment Tool for Case Series Studies. RESULTS Sixty-four observational studies (1 randomized controlled trial, 13 prospective studies and 50 retrospective studies of 9019 patients with at least 25,769 serum vancomycin concentrations) were included. The mean age was 2.5 years (range 1 day-18 years), serum creatinine was 47.1 ± 33.6 µmol/L, and estimated creatinine clearance was 97.4 ± 76 mL/min/1.73m2. Most studies found that vancomycin PK was best described by a one-compartment model (71.9%). There was a wide range of clearance and volume of distribution (Vd) values (range 0.014-0.27 L/kg/h and 0.43-1.46 L/kg, respectively) with interindividual variability as high as 49.7% for clearance and 136% for Vd, proportional residual variability up to 37.5% and additive residual variability up to 17.5 mg/L. The most significant covariates for clearance were weight, age, and serum creatinine or creatinine clearance, and weight for Vd. Variable dosing recommendations were suggested. CONCLUSION Numerous popPK models of vancomycin were derived, however external validation of suggested dosing regimens and analyses in subgroup paediatric populations such as dialysis patients are still needed before a popPK model with best predictive performance can be applied for dosing recommendations. Significant intraindividual and interindividual PK variability was present, which demonstrated the need for ongoing therapeutic drug monitoring and derivation of PK models for vancomycin for certain subgroup populations, such as dialysis patients.","Chung, Erin; Sen, Jonathan; Patel, Priya; Seto, Winnie",Clinical pharmacokinetics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40262-021-01027-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34002357/,413

Most previous studies focused on recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) whereas data on characteristics and outcomes in patients with hematological malignancies (HM) compared to non-hematological patients are limited. The prognostic value of viral load in respiratory specimens remains elusive. In a two-year retrospective study, we determined frequencies of LRTI-D in HM, HSCT and in non-hematological patients, and HPIV-3 levels in respiratory tract secretions. Among 98 patients with HPIV-3 infection, including 31 HSCT and 40 HM, 36 had a diagnosis of LRTI-D. LRTI-D was significantly more frequent in patients with HM or HSCT (n=32, 45.1%) than in non-hematological patients (n=4, 14.8%) (p=0.006). The median HPIV-3 loads were high in upper respiratory tract secretions regardless of the presence or absence of LRTI-D (8.3 log10 vs 7.6 log10 TCID50 /106 cells). HPIV-3 loads in respiratory tract samples in HM were not significantly higher than those found in HSCT but significantly higher than in non-hematological patients (p=0.007). In conclusion, LRTI-D was frequent in HM patients who were diagnosed with HPIV-3 infection. This article is protected by copyright.

88338,Oral Manifestations in Patients with COVID-19: A Living Systematic Review.,2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND/AIMS There is increased interest in the therapeutic use of statins in cirrhosis, but preferred statin and safety outcomes are still not well known. In this systematic review we aimed to address pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and effects on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes of statins in cirrhosis. METHODS Our systematic search in several electronic databases and repositories of two regulatory bodies up to 2020-06-11 yielded 22 articles and 2 drug monographs with relevant data. RESULTS Rosuvastatin and pitavastatin showed minimal PK changes in Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. Only rosuvastatin was assessed in a repeated dosing PK study. Atorvastatin showed pronounced PK changes in cirrhosis. No PK data was found for simvastatin, the most commonly used statin in cirrhosis trials. There was insufficient data to assess CV effects of statins in cirrhosis. Clinical trials in cirrhosis were limited to simvastatin, atorvastatin, and pravastatin. In patients taking simvastatin 40 mg, pooled frequency of rhabdomyolysis was 2%, an incidence 40-fold higher than that reported in non-cirrhosis patients, while this was no rhabdomyolysis observed in patients on simvastatin 20 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, or pravastatin 40 mg. Drug-induced liver injury was of difficult interpretation due to co-existence of muscle damage. No overt liver failure was reported. CONCLUSIONS Simvastatin 40 mg should be avoided in decompensated cirrhosis. Safety data on simvastatin 20 mg or other statins are based on small study sample size. This rarity of evidence combined with lack of data in dose adjustment methods in cirrhosis is a barrier for using statins for CV indications or for investigational use for liver indications.","Sung, Shuen; Al-Karaghouli, Mustafa; Kalainy, Sylvia; Cabrera Garcia, Lourdes; Abraldes, Juan G",BMC gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12876-021-01704-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33726685/,413

Two evolutionarily distinct lineages of these enzymes, predicated on RecA and AAA+ ATPase folds, have been identified and characterized to date. Hexameric helicases couple NTP hydrolysis with conformational changes that move nucleic acid substrates through a central pore in the enzyme. How hexameric helicases productively engage client DNA or RNA segments and use successive rounds of NTPase activity to power translocation and unwinding have been longstanding questions in the field. Recent structural and biophysical findings are beginning to reveal commonalities in NTP hydrolysis and substrate translocation by diverse hexameric helicase families.

89596,Correction: Should Remdesivir Be Used for the Treatment of Patients With COVID-19?,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND Smartphone reminding applications can help overcome memory difficulties experienced by people with acquired brain injury (ABI). Cognitive difficulties with memory and attention make entering reminders into a device, and remembering to set reminders, challenging for this group. ApplTree is a reminding app with features that aim to address challenges. One app feature was push notifications (asking ""Do you need to set any reminders?"") to support people to initiate use of the app to set reminders. Another app feature was a customisable user interface design to support attention and short term memory during reminder setting. METHODS In a mixed-methods user study, five people with self or other reported memory impairment following ABI used ApplTree for at least 4 months. They received push notifications for at least 2 months and no push notifications for at least 2 months. Monthly participant interviews provided insight into user interface preference, app use, and push notification acceptability. RESULTS Receiving four Push notifications per day doubled number of daily reminders set and four of the five participants found receiving them to be acceptable. This long-term field study uncovered issues relevant for clinicians and designers, including insights into the potential benefits of different user interface designs, the impact of family members on app use, and the importance of perceived need influencing use and acceptance. CONCLUSIONS Feedback provided insight into future considerations when designing reminding apps and using them in neuropsychological rehabilitation. This work highlights the benefit of user-led research into accessible design and use of assistive technologies. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION ""Unsolicited"" push prompts are an easy to implement feature of reminding technology that is useful and acceptable for people with ABI in community rehabilitation. Observations provide insights about how people with ABI make use of reminding apps over time. This can inform those designing apps or providing reminding technology as part of neuropsychological rehabilitation. Participants differed on their preference of the two user-interface designs available in ApplTree. This highlights an area for future research because currently available reminding apps have a broad-shallow design which may not always be appropriate for people with ABI.","Jamieson, Matthew; Cullen, Breda; Lennon, Marilyn; Brewster, Stephen; Evans, Jonathan",Disability and rehabilitation.

90099,"Exercise preferences and associations between fitness parameters, physical activity, and quality of life in high-grade glioma patients.",2017,"BACKGROUND The use of research evidence in health policy-making is a popular line of inquiry for scholars of public health and policy studies, with qualitative methods constituting the dominant strategy in this area. Research on this subject has been criticized for, among other things, disproportionately focusing on high-income countries; overemphasizing 'barriers and facilitators' related to evidence use to the neglect of other, less descriptive concerns; relying on descriptive, rather than in-depth explanatory designs; and failing to draw on insights from political/policy studies theories and concepts. We aimed to comprehensively map the global, peer-reviewed qualitative literature on the use of research evidence in health policy-making and to provide a descriptive overview of the geographic, temporal, methodological, and theoretical characteristics of this body of literature. METHODS We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We searched nine electronic databases, hand-searched 11 health- and policy-related journals, and systematically scanned the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews. No language, date or geographic limitations were imposed. RESULTS The review identified 319 qualitative studies on a diverse array of topics related to the use of evidence in health policy-making, spanning 72 countries and published over a nearly 40 year period. A majority of these studies were conducted in high-income countries, but a growing proportion of the research output in this area is now coming from low- and middle-income countries, especially from sub-Saharan Africa. While over half of all studies did not use an identifiable theory or framework, and only one fifth of studies used a theory or conceptual framework drawn from policy studies or political science, we found some evidence that theory-driven and explanatory (eg, comparative case study) designs are becoming more common in this literature. Investigations of the barriers and facilitators related to evidence use constitute a large proportion but by no means a majority of the work in this area. CONCLUSION This review provides a bird's eye mapping of the peer reviewed qualitative research on evidence-to-policy processes, and has identified key features of - and gaps within - this body of literature that will hopefully inform, and improve, research in this area moving forward.","Verboom, Ben; Baumann, Aron",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33160295/,413

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the geographic maldistribution of health resources in China. We examine the spatial and temporal variation of the SARS epidemic using a difference-in-differences strategy. Our empirical results show that, compared with cities without SARS case reports, exogenous health shocks significantly increased the affected cities' medical resources supply. We provide multiple robustness tests to examine the validity of the main findings. Further study shows that the mechanism is because the SARS event increased the financial autonomy of the epidemic-affected cities, thus providing an incentive for local governments to increase health resources. Meanwhile, health shocks have little influence on the regions with only imported cases than the infected area. These findings provide a possible explanation for the inequality in the distribution of health resources.","Wang, Juan; Wu, Hantao","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731420978871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423602/,413

This retrieval study analyses the tissue reaction to 623 polypropylene mesh samples (170 class 1 with large pores, and 453 class 2 with small pores) explanted for pain, infection, or recurrence. Histopathological assessment included morphometry of inflammatory infiltrate (IF) and connective tissue (CT), and of collagen 1/3 ratio. Half of the meshes were removed after more than 23 month. Despite large inter-individual differences removal for infection showed more IF than for pain or recurrence with significant correlation of IF with CT. Class 1 meshes with large pores showed less IF, CT, fistula formation, calcification, and bridging than class 2 meshes with small pores. Meshes removed for recurrence showed a lowered collagen 1/3 ratio in 70%. Large pore class 1 meshes showed an improved tissue response and may be considered as favorable to prevent inflammatory side effects. The presence of lowered collagen 1/3 ratio in most of the samples with recurrences stresses the relevance of an intact healing process.

Prasugrel is superior to clopidogrel for reducing risk of ischemic events in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but is associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications. PROMETHEUS was a retrospective multicenter observational study of 19,913 ACS patients undergoing PCI from 8 centers in the United States between 2010 and 2013. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke or unplanned revascularization. The study cohort included 3285 (16.5%) patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 5412 (27.2%) patients with NSTEMI and 11,216 (56.3%) patients with unstable angina (UA). The frequency of prasugrel use at discharge was highest in STEMI and lowest in UA patients, 27.3% versus 22.2% versus 18.9% (p < 0.001). Use of prasugrel vs clopidogrel was associated with a lower rate of MACE in STEMI, NSTEMI, or UA at 1 year, but the differences were attenuated for all groups except for patients with UA (adjusted HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.94, p = 0.006) after propensity adjusted analysis. After adjustment, there was no difference in bleeding risk between prasugrel and clopidogrel for all groups at 1 year. STEMI patients were more likely to receive prasugrel compared to NSTEMI and UA patients. Prasugrel was associated with reduced adverse outcomes compared with clopidogrel in unadjusted analyses, findings that were largely attenuated upon adjustment and suggest preferential use of prasugrel in low vs high risk patients.","Ge, Zhen; Baber, Usman; Claessen, Bimmer E; Chandrasekhar, Jaya; Chandiramani, Rishi; Li, Shawn X; Sartori, Samantha; Kini, Annapoorna S; Rao, Sunil V; Weiss, Sandra; Henry, Timothy D; Kapadia, Samir; Muhlestein, Brent; Strauss, Craig; Toma, Catalin; DeFranco, Anthony; Effron, Mark B; Keller, Stuart; Baker, Brian A; Pocock, Stuart; Dangas, George; Mehran, Roxana",Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-019-01842-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30924052/,413

MATERIAL AND METHODS The RFA of a spherical tumor of 2.0 cm diameter along with 0.5 cm clinical safety margin was simulated using Finite Element Analysis software. A total of 86 points inside one-eighth of the tumor volume along the axial, sagittal and coronal planes were selected as the target sites for electrode-tip placement. The angle of the electrode insertion in both craniocaudal and orbital planes ranged from -90° to +90° with 30° increment. The RFA electrode was simulated to pass through the target site at different angles in combination of both craniocaudal and orbital planes before being advanced to the edge of the tumor. RESULTS Complete tumor ablation was observed whenever the electrode-tip penetrated through the epicenter of the tumor regardless of the angles of electrode insertion in both craniocaudal and orbital planes. Complete tumor ablation can also be achieved by placing the electrode-tip at several optimal sites and angles. CONCLUSIONS Identification of the tumor epicenter on the central slice of the axial images is essential to enhance the success rate of complete tumor ablation during RFA procedures.","Givehchi, Sogol; Wong, Yin How; Yeong, Chai Hong; Abdullah, Basri Johan Jeet",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2017.1330757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28612670/,413

Coarse data arises because the time of infection, the time of disease onset or both are not known precisely. Accurate estimates of an incubation period distribution are useful in real-time outbreak investigations and in modeling public health interventions. We compare two methods of estimating such distributions. The first method represents the data as doubly interval-censored. The second introduces a data reduction technique that makes the computation more tractable. In a simulation study, the methods perform similarly when estimating the median, but the first method yields more reliable estimates of the distributional tails. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of the two methods to violations of model assumption and we apply these methods to historical incubation period data on influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus. The analysis of reduced data is less computationally intensive and performs well for estimating the median under a wide range of conditions. However for estimation of the tails of the distribution, the doubly interval-censored analysis is the recommended procedure.","Reich, Nicholas G; Lessler, Justin; Cummings, Derek A T; Brookmeyer, Ron",Statistics in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.3659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19598148/,413

Therefore, it becomes imperative to explore and develop new antiviral compounds continually. The search for pharmacological substances of plant origin that are effective against animal viruses, which have a high mortality rate or cause large economic losses, has garnered interest in the last few decades. This systematic review compiles 130 plant species that exhibit antiviral activity on 37 different virus species causing serious diseases in animals. The kind of extract, fraction, or compound exhibiting the antiviral activity and the design of the trial were particularly considered for review. The literature revealed details regarding plant species exhibiting antiviral activities against pathogenic animal virus species of the following families-Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Poxviridae, Nimaviridae, Coronaviridae, Reoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae-that cause infections, among others, in poultry, cattle, pigs, horses, shrimps, and fish. Overall, 30 plant species exhibited activity against various influenza viruses, most of them causing avian influenza. Furthermore, 30 plant species were noted to be active against Newcastle disease virus. In addition, regarding the pathogens most frequently investigated, this review provides a compilation of 20 plant species active against bovine herpesvirus, 16 against fowlpox virus, 12 against white spot syndrome virus in marine shrimps, and 10 against suide herpesvirus. Nevertheless, some plant extracts, particularly their compounds, are promising candidates for the development of new antiviral remedies, which are urgently required.","Zitterl-Eglseer, Karin; Marschik, Tatiana",Planta medica,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1224-6115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32777833/,413

Multiple studies have revealed their crucial role in the pathophysiology of a number of chronic, infectious and tumour lung diseases. KLK1, 3 and 14 are involved in asthma pathogenesis, and KLK1 could be also associated with the exacerbation of this inflammatory disease caused by rhinovirus. KLK5 was demonstrated as an influenza virus activating protease in humans, and KLK1 and 12 could also be involved in the activation and spread of these viruses. KLKs are associated with lung cancer, with up- or downregulation of expression depending on the KLK, cancer subtype, stage of tumour and also the microenvironment. Functional studies showed that KLK12 is a potent pro-angiogenic factor. Moreover, KLK6 promotes malignant-cell proliferation and KLK13 invasiveness. In contrast, KLK8 and KLK10 reduce proliferation and invasion of malignant cells. Considering the involvement of KLKs in various physiological and pathological processes, KLKs appear to be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for lung diseases.","Lenga Ma Bonda, Woodys; Iochmann, Sophie; Magnen, Mélia; Courty, Yves; Reverdiau, Pascale",Biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1515/hsz-2018-0114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29604204/,413

Ipragliflozin is a potent, selective SGLT-2 inhibitor used for the management of type 2 diabetes. Objective The primary aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin for the management of type 2 diabetes. We also review the discovery, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile of ipragliflozin. Methods To inform our review, we searched MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Embase to identify relevant papers to ipragliflozin use in type 2 diabetes. Clinical trial registries were also searched. Results Findings from randomized clinical trials demonstrate that compared to placebo, ipragliflozin significantly reduces glucose as measured via Hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose levels. Ipragliflozin is also associated with weight reduction and an improvement in some, but not all, cardiovascular risk markers. Ipragliflozin has a favourable safety profile with a low risk of hypoglycemia and the rates of common adverse events are not significantly different than placebo. Limited data are available to assess rare and long-term adverse effects. Conclusion Current evidence shows that ipragliflozin is an effective therapeutic option for the management of glucose control in type 2 diabetes. However, no cardiovascular outcome trials have been conducted to date. Real-world observational studies are still needed to accurately capture any possible rare or long-term adverse events.","Alkabbani, Wajd; Gamble, John-Michael","Drug design, development and therapy",https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s281602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285473/,413

METHODS We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of all COVID-2019 cases in the only referral hospital in Shenzhen city, China from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020 and followed until March 6, 2020. RESULTS Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233 (81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42 (14%) did not have a clear travel history. Only 192(64.4%) cases had a fever as the initial symptom. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, those with underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Slower clearance of the virus was associated with a higher risk of progression to critical condition. As of March 6, 2020, 268 (89.9%) patients were discharged and the overall case fatality ratio was 1.0%.

99099,Errors in Group Information Supplement.,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND Unprecedented public health actions restricting movement and non-COVID related health services are likely to have affected abortion care during the pandemic in Europe. In the absence of a common approach to ensure access to this essential health service, we sought to describe the variability of abortion policies during the outbreak in Europe in order to identify strategies that improve availability and access to abortion in times of public health crises. METHODS We collected information from 46 countries/regions: 31 for which country-experts completed a survey and 15 for which we conducted a desk review. We describe abortion regulations and changes to regulations and practice during the pandemic. RESULTS During COVID-19, abortions were banned in six countries and suspended in one. Surgical abortion was less available due to COVID-19 in 12 countries/regions and services were not available or delayed for women with COVID-19 symptoms in eleven. No country expanded its gestational limit for abortion. Changes during COVID-19, mostly designed to reduce in-person consultations, occurred in 13 countries/regions. Altogether eight countries/regions provided home medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol beyond 9 weeks (from 9 weeks+6 days to 11 weeks+6 days) and 13 countries/regions up to 9 weeks (in some instances only misoprostol could be taken at home). Only six countries/regions offered abortion by telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS The lack of a unified policy response to COVID-19 restrictions has widened inequities in abortion access in Europe, but some innovations including telemedicine deployed during the outbreak could serve as a catalyst to ensure continuity and equity of abortion care.","Moreau, Caroline; Shankar, Mridula; Glasier, Anna; Cameron, Sharon; Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2020-200724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33093040/,413

Older adults have been found as a vulnerable group for developing severe forms of disease and increased mortality. Objective The objective of the study was to propose a pathway to assist the decision-making process for hospital resource allocation for older adults with COVID-19 using simple geriatric assessment-based tools. Methods We reviewed the available literature at this point of the COVID-19 outbreak, focusing in older adult care to extract key recommendations for those health-care professionals who will be treating older adults in the hospital emergency ward (HEW) in developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results We listed a series of easy recommendations for non-geriatrician doctors in the HEW and suggested simple tools for hospital resource allocation during critical care evaluation of older adults with COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries. Conclusions Age must not be used as the sole criterion for resource allocation among older adults with COVID-19.

101779,Advocate for regional anesthesia in the corona pandemic?,2020-04-21,"INTRODUCTION Female orgasmic disorder (FOD) is defined as the absence, delay, infrequency, or marked diminishment in intensity of orgasm in at least 75% of sexual experiences, persisting for at least 6 months and causing distress, has specified subtypes, and affects up to 28% of women in the United States and up to 46% in countries across Asia. Orgasmic difficulties are relatively common and create distress for a substantial number of women, though efficacious treatments exist. OBJECTIVE This article provides a review of psychological treatment of FOD. METHODS A literature search was conducted using PsycINFO to identify research reporting methods and outcomes of psychological treatment of FOD in peer-reviewed journals and textbooks. Search terms were female orgasmic disorder, anorgasmia, female sexual dysfunction, and orgasm. This search was supplemented with hand-searching references of review articles and journal articles. RESULTS Psychological treatment has been shown to be effective in helping women with FOD to gain or regain the ability to have orgasms, with higher success rates overall of treating lifelong or generalized vs acquired or situational FOD. Of the variety of treatment approaches that have been tested, the most consistent support emerges for directed masturbation, sensate focus, and psychotherapy. Approaches with little evidence for efficacy as a primary mode of treatment include systematic desensitization, bibliotherapy, and coital alignment technique training. CONCLUSION While existing research provides a solid foundation of knowledge, treatment of FOD has seen little innovation since the 1980s. Future research should aim for broader understanding of etiologies of all types of FOD, understanding reasons for lack of treatment success for women who have not improved with treatment, and identifying ways of tailoring FOD treatment and success rates for multicultural and community populations.

102658,Is it all bleak? A systematic review of factors contributing to relationship change in dementia.,2018,"This paper considers metapopulation models in the general sense, i.e. where the population is partitioned into sub-populations (groups, patches,...), irrespective of the biological interpretation they have, e.g. spatially segregated large sub-populations, small households or hosts themselves modelled as populations of pathogens. This framework has traditionally provided an attractive approach to incorporating more realistic contact structure into epidemic models, since it often preserves analytic tractability (in stochastic as well as deterministic models) but also captures the most salient structural inhomogeneity in contact patterns in many applied contexts. Despite the progress that has been made in both the theory and application of such metapopulation models, we present here several major challenges that remain for future work, focusing on models that, in contrast to agent-based ones, are amenable to mathematical analysis. The challenges range from clarifying the usefulness of systems of weakly-coupled large sub-populations in modelling the spread of specific diseases to developing a theory for endemic models with household structure. They include also developing inferential methods for data on the emerging phase of epidemics, extending metapopulation models to more complex forms of human social structure, developing metapopulation models to reflect spatial population structure, developing computationally efficient methods for calculating key epidemiological model quantities, and integrating within- and between-host dynamics in models.","Ball, Frank; Britton, Tom; House, Thomas; Isham, Valerie; Mollison, Denis; Pellis, Lorenzo; Scalia Tomba, Gianpaolo",Epidemics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2014.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843386/,413

Currently, this information is often derived from an empirical model (Henssge's nomogram) describing posthumous body cooling under standard conditions. However, nonstandard conditions necessitate the use of subjective correction factors or preclude the use of Henssge's nomogram altogether. To address this, we developed a powerful method for early PMI reconstruction using skin thermometry in conjunction with a comprehensive thermodynamic finite-difference model, which we validated using deceased human bodies. PMIs reconstructed using this approach, on average, deviated no more than ±38 minutes from their corresponding true PMIs (which ranged from 5 to 50 hours), significantly improving on the ±3 to ±7 hours uncertainty of the gold standard. Together, these aspects render this approach a widely applicable, i.e., forensically relevant, method for thermometric early PMI reconstruction.","Wilk, Leah S; Hoveling, Richelle J M; Edelman, Gerda J; Hardy, Huub J J; van Schouwen, Sebastiaan; van Venrooij, Harry; Aalders, Maurice C G",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba4243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523999/,413

Major advances have led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of 7 HER2-targeted therapies for the treatment of early-stage and/or advanced-stage disease. Although oncologic outcomes continue to improve, most patients with advanced HER2-positive BC ultimately die of their disease because of primary or acquired resistance to therapy, and patients with HER2-positive early BC who have residual invasive disease after preoperative systemic therapy are at a higher risk of distant recurrence and death. The concept of treatment de-escalation and escalation is increasingly important to optimally tailor therapy for patients with HER2-positive BC and is a major focus of the current review. Research efforts in this regard are discussed as well as updates regarding the evolving standard of care in the (neo)adjuvant and metastatic settings, including the use of novel combination therapies. The authors also briefly discuss ongoing challenges in the management of HER2-positive BC (eg, intrinsic vs acquired drug resistance, the identification of predictive biomarkers, the integration of imaging techniques to guide clinical practice), and the treatment of HER2-positive brain metastases. Research aimed at superseding these challenges will be imperative to ensure continued progress in the management of HER2-positive BC going forward.","Choong, Grace M; Cullen, Grace D; O'Sullivan, Ciara C",CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32813307/,413
103885,"Electroencephalographic Parameters Differentiating Melancholic Depression, Non-melancholic Depression, and Healthy Controls. A Systematic Review.",2021,"INTRODUCTION Large incisional hernias with loss of domain (LIHLD) of the abdominal wall remain a therapeutic challenge due to the difficulty of replacing the contents of the hernia sac into the peritoneal cavity. Preoperative progressive pneumoperitoneum (PPP) is a valuable option. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of peritoneal catheter insertion under ultrasound guidance for PPP and to compare the morbidity and mortality of this new technique to previously used techniques in our department. METHODS Medical records were reviewed retrospectively from February 1989 to April 2013 in a single institution. Three different techniques of PPP were evaluated: surgical subcutaneous implantable port (SIP), surgical peritoneal dialysis catheter (PDC), and radiologic multipurpose drainage catheter (MDC). Collected data included patients' age, sex, body mass index, medical and surgical history, hernia location, PPP technique, length of hospitalization, volume of air injected, morbidity and mortality linked to PPP, and the procedure of hernia repair. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients with a mean age of 63.1 years were evaluated. Progressive preoperative pneumoperitoneum was performed using SIP, PDC, and MDC for 14, 11, and 12 patients, respectively. Overall morbidity related to the technique was seen in 36 % of SIP, 27 % of PDC, and 0 % of MDC. One patient from the SIP group died on the 3rd postoperative day due to septic shock following aspiration pneumonia. No postoperative mortality in the other groups was observed. CONCLUSION The MDC is an interesting modification of the original technique and is a safe procedure. It is a minimally invasive technique with a very low risk of perforation of the viscera. Therefore, the use of a non-absorbable prosthesis with MDC technique can be offered for all patients undergoing PPP without increasing the risk of infection.","Alyami, M; Passot, G; Voiglio, E; Lundberg, P W; Valette, P J; Muller, A; Caillot, J L",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-015-3206-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26316110/,413

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2018,"Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) are independent predictors of cardiovascular risk and mortality, but little is known about the effect of air temperature changes on these variables. Our study investigated the effect of exposure to whole-body mild-cold on measures of arterial stiffness (aortic and brachial PWV), and on central haemodynamics [including augmented pressure (AP), AIx], and aortic reservoir components [including reservoir and excess pressures (P ex)]. Sixteen healthy volunteers (10 men, age 43 ± 19 years; mean ± SD) were randomised to be studied under conditions of 12 °C (mild-cold) and 21 °C (control) on separate days. Supine resting measures were taken at baseline (ambient temperature) and after 10, 30, and 60 min exposure to each experimental condition in a climate chamber. There was no significant change in brachial blood pressure between mild-cold and control conditions. However, compared to control, AP [+2 mmHg, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.36-4.36; p = 0.01] and AIx (+6 %, 95 % CI 1.24-10.1; p = 0.02) increased, and time to maximum P ex (a component of reservoir function related to timing of peak aortic in-flow) decreased (-7 ms, 95 % CI -15.4 to 2.03; p = 0.01) compared to control. Yet there was no significant change in aortic PWV (+0.04 m/s, 95 % CI -0.47 to 0.55; p = 0.87) or brachial PWV (+0.36 m/s; -0.41 to 1.12; p = 0.35) between conditions. We conclude that mild-cold exposure increases central haemodynamic stress and alters timing of peak aortic in-flow without differentially affecting arterial stiffness.","King, Sibella G; Ahuja, Kiran D K; Wass, Jezreel; Shing, Cecilia M; Adams, Murray J; Davies, Justin E; Sharman, James E; Williams, Andrew D",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-012-2543-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23160656/,413

PURPOSE To compare the efficiency and safety of ioversol (Optiray(TM)) bottles and pre-filled syringes in clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was an observational, non-interventional, prospective, multicenter study conducted at 72 centers in Germany. Patients undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) examinations with ioversol were enrolled. The use of ioversol bottles and pre-filled syringes in the diagnostic procedure was recorded in terms of efficiency (residual volume, re-use of CM) and safety (adverse events [AEs]). RESULTS A total of 10,836 patients were enrolled and included in this study. Ioversol bottles and syringes were used in 72% and 28% of cases, respectively. Analysis of the volume of CM in bottles before and after examinations, together with the volume used during the examination, suggested that in 22.5% of cases a new bottle was connected during the procedure. Further analysis revealed that in 80.2% of cases, the remaining volume of CM in the bottles could potentially be used for subsequent investigations, compared with <1% of cases for pre-filled syringes. For the total study population, AEs and serious AEs were reported in 30 (0.28%) and four (0.037%) patients, respectively, with no significant difference observed between ioversol bottles and syringes. CONCLUSION Administration of ioversol for contrast-enhanced CT examinations is associated with a low incidence of AEs and is generally safe and well tolerated. Ioversol pre-filled syringes were associated with lower residual volumes and less potential re-use compared with bottles.","Vogl, Thomas J; Wessling, Johannes; Buerke, Boris",Acta radiologica,https://doi.org/10.1258/ar.2012.120303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22983259/,413

The World Health Organization characterized the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) as a pandemic in March 2020. In the absence of specific treatments for the virus, treatment options are being examined. Drug repurposing is a process of identifying new therapeutic uses for approved drugs. It is an effective strategy to discover drug molecules with new therapeutic indications. This strategy is time-saving, low-cost, and has a minimal risk of failure. Several existing approved drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline, azithromycin, and ivermectin are currently in use because of their efficacy in inhibiting COVID-19. Multidrug therapy, such as a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, a combination of doxycycline and ivermectin, or a combination of ivermectin, doxycycline, and azithromycin, has been successfully administered. Multidrug therapy is efficacious because the mechanisms of action of these drugs differ. Moreover, multidrug therapy may prevent the emergence of drug-resistant SARS-CoV-2.","Ohe, Masashi; Furuya, Ken; Goudarzi, Houman",Drug discoveries & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.5582/ddt.2021.01005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612572/,413

105884,The Problematic 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics Bronchiolitis Guidelines.,2019,"Hantaviruses, members of the Bunyaviridae family, are emerging category A pathogens that carry three negative stranded RNA molecules as their genome. Hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) is encoded by the smallest S segment genomic RNA (viral RNA). N specifically binds mRNA caps and requires four nucleotides adjacent to the cap for high affinity binding. We show that the N peptide has distinct cap- and RNA-binding sites that independently interact with mRNA cap and viral genomic RNA, respectively. In addition, N can simultaneously bind with both mRNA cap and vRNA. N undergoes distinct conformational changes after binding with either mRNA cap or vRNA or both mRNA cap and vRNA simultaneously. Hantavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) uses a capped RNA primer for transcription initiation. The capped RNA primer is generated from host cell mRNA by the cap-snatching mechanism and is supposed to anneal with the 3' terminus of vRNA template during transcription initiation by single G-C base pairing. We show that the capped RNA primer binds at the cap-binding site and induces a conformational change in N. The conformationally altered N with a capped primer loaded at the cap-binding site specifically binds the conserved 3' nine nucleotides of vRNA and assists the bound primer to anneal at the 3' terminus. We suggest that the cap-binding site of N, in conjunction with RdRp, plays a key role during the transcription and replication initiation of vRNA genome.","Mir, Mohammad A; Sheema, Sheema; Haseeb, Abdul; Haque, Absarul",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m110.102459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20164193/,413

Staple line leakage, as the most frequent and most feared complication, is still a major concern. METHODS Since 2005 data from patients undergoing bariatric procedures in Germany have been prospectively registered in an online database and analyzed. All patients who had undergone primary SG within a 7-year period were considered for analysis. RESULTS Using the German Bariatric Surgery Registry, data from more than 11,800 SGs were collected between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2013. Staple line leak rate decreased from 6.5% to 1.4%. Male sex, higher body mass index, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, a combination of buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate compared with when using either buttresses or oversewing alone. On multivariable analysis, operation time and year of procedure only had a significant impact on staple line leakage rate. CONCLUSIONS Owing to the growing experience a constant decrease in the leakage rate after SG has been observed. Staple line disruption may still lead to sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction, and increased mortality. The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of leakage and which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, select patients more carefully, and offer closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment.","Stroh, Christine; Köckerling, Ferdinand; Volker, Lange; Frank, Benedix; Stefanie, Wolff; Christian, Knoll; Christiane, Bruns; Thomas, Manger",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000001559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26727093/,413

Understanding the precise cross-talk between virus and host is vital for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics. In the present study, we identified the nucleoprotein (NP) of H7N9 IAV as a positive regulator of RIG-I like receptor (RLR)-mediated signaling. Based on a loss-of-function strategy, we replaced H1N1 (mouse-adapted PR8 strain) NP with H7N9 NP, by using reverse genetics, and found that the replication and pathogenicity of rPR8-H7N9NP were significantly attenuated in cells and mice. Biochemical and cellular analyses revealed that H7N9 NP specifically interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) after viral infection. Subsequently, we identified a PxxQxS motif in the H7N9 NP protein that may be a determinant for the NP and TRAF3 interaction. Furthermore, H7N9 NP stabilized TRAF3 expression via competitively binding to TRAF3 with cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2), leading to the inhibition of the Lys48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of TRAF3. Taken together, these data uncover a novel mechanism by which the NP protein of H7N9 IAV positively regulates TRAF3-mediated type I interferon signaling. Our findings provide insights into virus and host survival strategies that involve a specific viral protein that modulates an appropriate immune response in hosts.IMPORTANCE The NS1, PB2, PA-X, and PB1-F2 proteins of influenza A virus (IAV) are known to employ various strategies to counteract and evade host defenses. However, the viral components responsible for the activation of innate immune signaling remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the NP protein of H7N9 IAV specifically associates with and stabilizes the important adaptor molecule TRAF3, which potentiates RLR-mediated type I interferon induction. Moreover, we reveal that this H7N9 protein prevents the interaction between TRAF3 and cIAP2 that mediates Lys48-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3 for degradation. The current study reveals a novel mechanism by which H7N9 NP upregulates TRAF3-mediated type I interferon production, leading to attenuation of viral replication and pathogenicity in cells and mice. Our finding provides a possible explanation for virus and host commensalism via viral manipulation of the host immune system.","Wei, Yanli; Zeng, Yan; Zhang, Xuegang; Xu, Shuai; Wang, Zhengxiang; Du, Yingying; Zhang, Bo; Lei, Cao-Qi; Zhu, Qiyun",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01640-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028715/,413

Conversely, owing to technical difficulties in colonic resection and full mesenteric dissection, single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (SILC) has been considered unsuitable for oncologic purposes. We compared the technical feasibility and early clinical outcomes of SLC and SILC for cancer. METHODS In this prospective randomized clinical trial, 16 (50%) patients underwent SLC (10 left and 6 right) and 16 (50%) patients underwent SILC (8 left and 8 right). RESULTS Demographics, preoperative data, and characteristics of the tumor were similar. The mean number of resected lymph nodes was 16 ± 5 in the SLC and 18 ± 6 in the SILC group (P = NS). Surgical time was 124 ± 8 minutes and 147 ± 5 minutes, respectively (P = NS). Surgical mortality was nil and the major morbidity rate was 6.3% in both groups.

The first experiment uses a 1 mW helium-neon (He-Ne) laser with a wavelength of 632.8 nm, while the second one is carried out using a diode laser of 780.0 nm wavelength and a nominal power of 80 mW. The distribution of the scattered light intensity is recorded experimentally, and since the theoretical background has been known for several decades (see references), only a modest amount of theory is included. We considered the Mie scattering by a set of spheres of different diameters in our case with a distribution of sphere diameters with mean diameter 5.2 μm and standard deviation 0.15 μm. Our measured Mie scattering angular distribution accounts for the effect of the diameter distribution, which we assume to be a Gaussian distribution. Our results indicate that there is very good agreement between experiment and theoretical predictions. The technique we offer here is found to be useful to familiarize technicians who work in the areas of applied optics, such as chemistry, electronics, water contamination, and optical instruments with Mie scattering techniques, and who may not have a formal introduction to the electromagnetic theory. One specific area in which these techniques might be useful is the study of aerosols that may arise when naturally produced droplets from humans, such as those produced by coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing, are present, as it happens in response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, also known as SARS-CoV-2.","Olivares, Ignacio E; Carrazana, P",The Review of scientific instruments,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0015050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32872902/,413

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS A literature research was conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, CQVIP and Wanfang databases. The following search terms in the abstract were used: ""sarcopenia"" in combination with the terms ""prevalence,"" ""epidemiology"" and ""China."" All studies published from January 2010 to November 2020 were included. The random-effect model was used to estimate the prevalence of sarcopenia. The sex-specific prevalence of sarcopenia at a 95% CI was also calculated using different criteria for defining sarcopenia. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES The overall prevalence of sarcopenia in older Chinese adults. RESULTS In total, 23 articles were included in this meta-analysis involving 21 564 participants. On the basis of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criterion, the overall prevalence of sarcopenia among the elderly in China was 14% (95% CI 11% to 18%); the prevalence was higher in Chinese women than in men (15% vs 14%). CONCLUSIONS This systematic review is the first estimation of the pooled prevalence of sarcopenia in older Chinese adults. Our results suggest that China has a large number of patients with sarcopenia. These findings would be useful for sarcopenia prevention in China. There is a high degree of heterogeneity, and although there are a large number of cases and could be an emerging public health issue, more research is required to make these claims.

Due to geographic isolation, small population sizes, and socioeconomic disparities, most Caribbean islands lack medical services for managing, diagnosing, and counseling individuals with genetic disorders. From 2015 to 2019, we organized 2-3 clinics per year on various islands in the Caribbean. We also organized a week-long clinic to provide evaluations for children suspected of having autism spectrum disorder. Consultations for over 100 different individuals with suspected genetic disorders were performed in clinics or during home visits following referral by locally registered physicians. When possible, follow-up visits were attempted. When available and appropriate, clinical samples were shipped to collaborating laboratories for molecular analysis. Laboratory tests included karyotyping, cytogenomic microarray analysis, exome sequencing, triplet repeat expansion testing, blood amino acid level determination, biochemical assaying, and metabolomic profiling. We believe that significant contributions to healthcare by genetics professionals can be made even if availability is limited. Visiting geneticists may help by providing continuing medical education seminars. Clinical teaching rounds help to inform local physicians regarding the management of genetic disorders with the aim of generating awareness of genetic conditions. Even when only periodically available, a visiting geneticist may benefit affected individuals, their families, their local physicians, and the community at large.","Sobering, Andrew K; Li, Dong; Beighley, Jennifer S; Carey, John C; Donald, Tyhiesia; Elsea, Sarah H; Figueroa, Karla P; Gerdts, Jennifer; Hamlet, Andre; Mirzaa, Ghayda M; Nelson, Beverly; Pulst, Stefan M; Smith, Janice L; Tassone, Flora; Toriello, Helga V; Walker, Ruth H; Yearwood, Katherine R; Bhoj, Elizabeth J","American journal of medical genetics.

It also suggests possible recommendations toward elimination and risk reduction of emerging zoonoses. Methods: Epidemiologic information has been drawn from official to assess the situation. There has been significant progress in reducing the risk of brucellosis, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Rabies, West Nile fever, Q fever, and cystic hydatid disease have been confined to wildlife or livestock. Results: There is an increasing threat of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in Oman due to globalization of travel and trade, development activities, and impact of climate change and vector bionomics. Prevention, control, and subsequent elimination of zoonoses on a sustainable basis shall not be possible without intersectoral collaboration between the human and animal health sectors. There are challenges for establishing such strong collaboration and coordination mechanisms in Oman. Institutional and cultural barriers, data and resource sharing, and national capability for rapid and effective investigation of zoonotic infections and emerging zoonoses in humans and animal reservoirs are among others. Conclusions: In the light of achievements made on the prevention and control of zoonoses in Oman during the past decades, priority zoonoses should be identified for elimination, and continuous efforts should be made to further strengthen a holistic multidisciplinary and multisectorial approach for controlling zoonoses at source. Pivotal interventions would include urgent adoption of ""One Health"" strategic approach as well as establishment of a robust, integrated surveillance system with a strong laboratory investigation capacity to eliminate priority zoonoses and minimize the risk of entry, establishment, and spread of emerging zoonoses in Oman.","Al Awaidy, Salah; Al Hashami, Hilal",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2019.2458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31486732/,413

Elderly Healthcare Voucher Scheme has been introduced by the Hong Kong Government since 2009 to provide subsidy to elderly aged 65 and above to visit ten different types of private primary care providers for curative, preventive and chronic disease management. Several enhancements have been made over the past few years. This paper (as part of an evaluation study of this unique healthcare voucher scheme) aims to assess the long term impact of the voucher scheme in encouraging the use of primary care services. METHODS Two rounds of cross-sectional survey among elderly in Hong Kong were conducted in 2010 and 2016. Propensity score matching and analysis were used to compare changes in perception and usage of vouchers over time. RESULTS 61.5% of respondents in 2016 agreed ""the scheme encourages me to use more private primary care services"", a significant increase from 36.2% in 2010. Among those who agreed in 2016, the majority thought the voucher scheme would encourage them to use acute services (90.3%) in the private sector, rather than preventive care (40.3%) and chronic disease management (12.2%). Respondents also reported that their current usual choice of care was visiting ""both public and private doctors"" (61.9%), representing a significant increase (up from 48.4%) prior to their use of voucher. CONCLUSIONS The voucher scheme has encouraged the use of more private care services, particularly acute services rather than disease prevention or management of chronic disease. However, there needs to be caution that the untargeted and open-ended nature of voucher scheme could result in supply-induced demand which would affect long term financial sustainability. The dual utilization of health services in both the public and private sector may also compromise continuity and quality of care. The design of the voucher needs to be more specific, targeting prevention and chronic disease management rather than unspecified care which is mainly acute and episodic in order to maximize service delivery capacity as a whole for equitable access in universal health coverage and to contribute to a sustainable financing system.","Yam, Carrie H K; Wong, Eliza L Y; Fung, Valerie L H; Griffiths, Sian M; Yeoh, Eng-Kiong",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4707-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752826/,413

OBJECTIVE The aim is to assess the effectiveness of internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMI) as a scalable approach for treating depression in a routine care setting. METHODS This is an observer-masked, multicenter, pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a randomization ratio of 1:1.Patients with CBP and diagnosed depressive disorder (mild to moderate severity) were recruited from 82 orthopedic rehabilitation clinics across Germany. The intervention group (IG) received a guided depression IMI tailored to CBP next to treatment-as-usual (TAU; including medication), while the control group (CG) received TAU. The primary outcome was observer-masked clinician-rated Hamilton depression severity (9-week follow-up). The secondary outcomes were: further depression outcomes, pain-related outcomes, health-related quality of life, and work capacity. Biostatistician blinded analyses using regression models were conducted by intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis. RESULTS Between October 2015 and July 2017, we randomly assigned 210 participants (IG, n = 105; CG, n = 105), mostly with only a mild pain intensity but substantial pain disability. No statistically significant difference in depression severity between IG and CG was observed at the 9-week follow-up (β = -0.19, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.05). Explorative secondary depression (4/9) and pain-related (4/6) outcomes were in part significant (p < 0.05). Health-related quality of life was significantly higher in the IG. No differences were found in work capacity. CONCLUSION The results indicate that an IMI for patients with CBP and depression in a routine care setting has limited impact on depression. Benefits in pain and health-related outcomes suggest that an IMI might still be a useful measure to improve routine care.","Baumeister, Harald; Paganini, Sarah; Sander, Lasse Bosse; Lin, Jiaxi; Schlicker, Sandra; Terhorst, Yannik; Moshagen, Morten; Bengel, Jürgen; Lehr, Dirk; Ebert, David Daniel",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33321501/,413

Co-localization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 enables SARS-CoV 2 to enter the cells. Expression of these genes in the alveolar type II cells of elderly and young patients were comparable and therefore do not seem to be responsible for worse outcomes observed in COVID-19 affected elderly. In cells from the elderly, 263 genes were downregulated and 95 upregulated. SOD3 was identified as the top-ranked gene that was most down-regulated in the elderly. Other redox-active genes that were also downregulated in cells from the elderly included ATF4 and M2TA. ATF4, an ER stress sensor that defends lungs via induction of heme oxygenase 1. The study of downstream factors known to be induced by ATF4, according to Ingenuity Pathway AnalysisTM, identified 24 candidates. Twenty-one of these were significantly downregulated in the cells from the elderly. These downregulated candidates were subjected to enrichment using the Reactome Database identifying that in the elderly, the ability to respond to heme deficiency and the ATF4-dependent ability to respond to endoplasmic reticulum stress is significantly compromised. SOD3-based therapeutic strategies have provided beneficial results in treating lung disorders including fibrosis. The findings of this work propose the hypotheses that lung-specific delivery of SOD3/ATF4 related antioxidants may work in synergy with promising anti-viral drugs such as remdesivir to further improve COVID-19 outcomes in the elderly.","Abouhashem, Ahmed S; Singh, Kanhaiya; Azzazy, Hassan Me; Sen, Chandan K",Antioxidants & redox signaling,https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2020.8111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32323565/,413

The challenge and importance of the work, combined with support and recognition at work, fostered an empowering work environment. Few interviewees reported fatigue, whereas the majority displayed dedication to work, indicating a status of work engagement more than burnout among grass-roots officials. Implications of a meaning-oriented empowerment approach to stress management for disaster relief forces are drawn.","Wang, Xiao Lu; Shi, Zhan Biao; Ng, Siu Man; Wang, Bin; Chan, Cecilia L W",Qualitative health research,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049732310386049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20966347/,413

Here we report the genomic characterization and phylogenetic evolution of this coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 that caused COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 genomes and other coronaviruses were obtained from GISAID and GenBank. Then the genome was annotated, and potential genetic recombination was investigated. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted and used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help deduce the origin of virus. An annotation has revealed SARS-CoV-2 possessed a similar genomic organisation to bat-SARS-like-CoV collected in China. The genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were very similar, showing 99.6-100% sequence identity. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was closely related (with 88% identity) to bat-SARS-like coronavirus, but was more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic tree of the complete viral genome showed that the virus clustered with bat SARS-like coronavirus. The results of the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses did not identify any potential genomic recombination events. Therefore, it seems like that the SARS-CoV-2 might be originally hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts of currently unknown wild animal(s). Finally, based on the wide spread of SARS-CoV in their natural reservoirs, future studies should focus more on surveillance of coronavirus, and measures against the domestication and consumption of wild animals should be implemented.

118349,"Effectiveness and safety of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in patients with chronic, moderate-to-severe pain in a primary care setting.",2011,"BACKGROUND Hip fractures are a major public health problem in elderly populations and are accompanied by high-mortality rates. Whether timing of surgery has an impact on morbidity and mortality has been discussed controversially, numerous studies suggest that the delay of surgery can significantly increase the risk of morbidity and mortality; others report that achieving a stable medical condition is more important than early surgery. The goal of our systematic review is to assess the impact of timing of surgery on health outcomes in patients aged 60 years or older with acute hip fracture. In addition, we will investigate differences in beneficial or harmful effects of timing of surgery in subgroups of patients based on demographic characteristics, physical status, and the use of anticoagulant medications. METHODS We will systematically search MEDLINE via Ovid, the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and clinical trial registries (from 1997 to 2017). In addition, we will search reference lists of pertinent reviews, archives of annual meetings of orthopaedic societies, and contact experts. We will include randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies assessing the impact of timing of surgery after hip fracture in patients 60 years or older, published in English or German. Our outcomes of interest include health outcomes such as mortality, perioperative complications, functional capacity, and quality of life. We plan to perform meta-analyses if we have at least three sufficiently similar studies. If data are sufficient, we will conduct subgroup-analyses testing for differences between age groups, sex, patients' physical status as assessed with ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) scores, and the use of anticoagulation. DISCUSSION Since this is the first systematic review on this topic since 2010, our findings will help to inform clinical practice guidelines concerning timing of surgery in hip fractures. Furthermore, our findings could contribute to define an optimal time period for surgery for different groups of patients with acute hip fracture.

A fast and accurate diagnosis in this outbreak is critical to isolate and treat patients. Radiology plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of the patients. Among various imaging modalities, chest CT has received attention with its higher sensitivity and specificity rates. Shortcomings of the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, including inappropriate sample collection and analysis methods, initial false negative results, and limited availability has led to widespread use of chest CT in the diagnostic algorithm.

118511,The evidence for the physiological effects of lactate on the cerebral microcirculation: a systematic review.,2019,"Defensive medicine is a practice that has been utilized by clinicians in efforts of preventing patient dissatisfaction and malpractice claims and may be done through either omission or commission. As much as 57% of physicians have disclosed that they practice defensive medicine. However, this practice does not necessarily prevent malpractice claims and more importantly, neither does it equate to good medical practice, with some leading to poor outcomes. Unfortunately, there is a high percentage of malpractice claims lodged against clinicians in both primary care and hospital settings. Specialists such as surgeons, obstetricians, and gynecologists face the highest claims. In particular, during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, with new challenges and limited treatment algorithms, there is an even greater concern for possible bourgeoning claims. Counteracting defensive medicine can be accomplished through decriminalizing malpractice claims, leaving physician oversight up to state medical boards and hospital claims management committees. Additional tort reform measures must also be taken such as caps on noneconomic damages to ensure emphasis on beneficence and nonmaleficence. Once these are in place, it may well serve to increase clinician-patient trust and improve patient independence in the shared decision-making process of their treatment, allowing clinicians to practice their full scope of practice without feeling wary of potential malpractice claims.","Williams, Preston L; Williams, Joanna P; Williams, Bryce R",Journal of forensic and legal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jflm.2021.102170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878590/,413

STUDY DESIGN For this study, we included nonoverlapping years of Kids Inpatient database and National Inpatient Sample database while including hospitalizations of children between 1 and 20 years of age from more than 4200 hospitals across the United States. We identified patient hospitalizations with severe sepsis using specific ICD codes and modified Angus Criteria. Trend analysis of various factors associated with severe sepsis was calculated using the Cochrane-Armitage test. Associated foci of infection and comorbid conditions were identified using specific ICD codes, and a multivariate regression analysis with death as outcome variable was done to evaluate for in hospital predictors of mortality. RESULTS Totally, 109,026 episodes of severe sepsis were identified during the study period between 2003 and 2014. Incidence of severe sepsis hospitalizations increased by 2.5 times (0.64-1.57 per 10,000 population) over the study period with notable concurrent significant decrease in mortality by more than 50%. Lower age, African American, Hispanic ethnicity, complex neurological conditions, infective endocarditis, immunodeficient states including primary immunodeficiency disorder, HIV, burns, malignancy and transplant status are associated with mortality. There is a significant increase in use of healthcare resources (P < 0.001) with mean charges of 94,966$ despite a notable decrease in mean length of stay (22 vs. 16 days, P < 0.001) over the study period. CONCLUSION Incidence of pediatric severe sepsis is high leading to a significant use of healthcare resources.

METHODS A retrospective, consecutive case series including all patients treated by FND for occlusion of corneal vessels between 2004 and 2012. Indications were lipid keratopathy, preparation for keratoplasty to reduce risk of rejection and treatment of recalcitrant corneal graft rejection associated with stromal vessels. Our outcome measures were occlusion of corneal vessels with reduced corneal vascularisation, reduction in amount of lipid deposition, and reduction of graft rejection episodes. RESULTS FND effectively reduced lipid deposition associated with the treated vessels in 14 out of 17 eyes (82.3%). When used to reduce corneal vascularisation before keratoplasty and to reduce intraoperative bleeding, the 1-year survival of the high-risk grafts was (84.6%). FND prevented further rejection episodes in 3 out of 4 corneal grafts. Fourteen eyes required retreatment (2-5 times) of which 9 had lipid keratopathy and 5 were in preparation for corneal grafting. CONCLUSIONS FND is effective in occluding established corneal vessels. Corneal microperforation is a potentially serious adverse event, but other adverse events, such as striae, whitening and intracorneal haemorrhages are reversible. It should be considered for established corneal vessels, and can be combined with antivascular endothelial growth factors.","Faraj, Lana A; Elalfy, Mohamed S; Said, Dalia G; Dua, Harminder S",The British journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2014-304891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782468/,413
121756,Self-management of patients with advanced cancer: A systematic review of experiences and attitudes.,2020-02-01,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the renin-angiotensin system for viral entry. The ACE2 receptor is present in both female and male reproductive systems, and reports of multi-organ involvement have led to uncertainty regarding its effects on the reproductive system and fertility. We review the existing literature regarding the function of ACE2 and the renin-angiotensin system in the female and male reproductive systems to postulate the possible implications of SARS-CoV-2 regarding fertility. Because of the presence of ACE2 in the ovaries, SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt ovarian function and hence oocyte quality. Higher expression of ACE2 in the endometrium with age and during the secretory phase raises concern about increased susceptibility to infection during periods of high ACE2 expression. The possibility of vertical transmission and the presence of ACE2 in the placenta and during pregnancy are also discussed. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen is controversial, but impaired semen quality has been found in men with moderate coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Evidence of orchitis and hormonal changes seen in male coronavirus disease 2019 infection may lead to infertility. The implications of these effects on assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes are also explored. The ART guidelines from different fertility societies for the management of patients treated with ART are provided. The importance of prioritising 'time-sensitive' patients for ART, counselling patients about the uncertainty and risks of ART, and pregnancy during the pandemic is discussed.

121924,Errors in Group Information Supplement and End Matter.,2021-01-01,"Nidovirus endoribonucleases (NendoUs) include nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15) from coronaviruses and nsp11 from arteriviruses, both of which have been reported to participate in the viral replication process and in the evasion of the host immune system. Results from a previous study of coronaviruses SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and MHV nsp15 indicate that it mainly forms a functional hexamer, whereas nsp11 from the arterivirus PRRSV is a dimer. Here, we found that porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) nsp15 primarily exists as dimers and monomers in vitro Biological experiments reveal that a PDCoV nsp15 mutant lacking the first 27 amino acids of the N-terminal domain (Asn-1-Asn-27) forms more monomers and displays decreased enzymatic activity, indicating that this region is important for its dimerization. Moreover, multiple sequence alignments and three-dimensional structural analysis indicated that the C-terminal region (His-251-Val-261) of PDCoV nsp15 is 10 amino acids shorter and forms a shorter loop than that formed by the equivalent sequence (Gln-259-Phe-279) of SARS-CoV nsp15. This result may explain why PDCoV nsp15 failed to form hexamers. We speculate that NendoUs may have originated from XendoU endoribonucleases (XendoUs) forming monomers in eukaryotic cells, that NendoU from arterivirus gained the ability to form dimers, and that the coronavirus variants then evolved the capacity to assemble into hexamers. We further propose that PDCoV nsp15 may be an intermediate in this evolutionary process. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for improving our understanding of NendoU evolution and offer useful clues for designing drugs and vaccines against nidoviruses.","Zheng, Anjun; Shi, Yuejun; Shen, Zhou; Wang, Gang; Shi, Jiale; Xiong, Qiqi; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo; Fu, Zhen F; Peng, Guiqing",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra118.003756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29887523/,413

Vulnerable populations, such as those living in poverty, experiencing homelessness, or who use drugs, are particularly susceptible to becoming infected with COVID-19 and often have limited access to protective supplies, such as masks and hand sanitizer. Our aim was to understand public opinion on increasing the allocation of COVID-19 prevention resources to vulnerable populations. METHODS Data were from an online survey of 680 United States adults. Participants' opinions on the allocation of COVID-19 prevention resources to people with low income, experiencing homelessness, or who use drugs were assessed using a five-item Likert scale. We examined the prevalence of these opinions and their relationship to sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 beliefs, and drug-related experiences. RESULTS Most participants supported increasing resources for individuals with low incomes (79.6%) and experiencing homelessness (74.6%), while a minority supported increasing resources for people who use drugs (33.5%). Politically conservative participants were less likely to support increasing resources for all three populations than those who were politically liberal. Skepticism about the severity of COVID-19 was also associated with less support for increasing resources across groups. DISCUSSION Our results demonstrate that people who use drugs continue to be stigmatized in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in popular opinion not supporting people who use drugs with potentially lifesaving resources. Overcoming this stigma is essential to prevent COVID-19 among people who use drugs, a population which experiences elevated risk of COVID-19 infection.","Schneider, Kristin E; Wilson, Deborah; Dayton, Lauren; Goodell, Erin M Anderson; Latkin, Carl A",The International journal on drug policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34049234/,413

The present study aimed to identify the prevalence of depression and explore its predictors among older adults with ACS seeking emergency care. METHODS Secondary data analysis of cross-sectional data, using a convenience sample of 300 older adult patients with ACS seeking emergency care, was used in this study. Bivariate and multivariate analyses, including linear regression models, were conducted. RESULTS The prevalence of depression among older adult patients with ACS seeking emergency care was 65.7%. The predictors of depression among this cohort of patients were age (t=3.06, p=0.003), frailty (t=5.77, p<0.001), troponin (t=2.98, p=0.003), and hemoglobin alpha 1C (HBA1C) (t=3.18, p=0.002). The model of these predictors explained 56.6% of the variation in the outcome (depression) (Adjusted R2 =0.566, p=0.017). Depression had a significant positive correlation with each of intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) (rho=0.31, p<0.001), hospital LOS (rho=0.36, p<0.001), and frailty (rho=0.69). CONCLUSION Depression rate is high among those patients, so healthcare providers (HCPs) should assess those patients for depression and be prepared to intervene accordingly. Depression among older adult patients with ACS seeking emergency care necessitates emergency management protocol by HCPs to manage depression among this cohort of at-risk patients.","Hayajneh, Audai A; Rababa, Mohammad; Al-Nusour, Esraa A; Alsatari, Eman S",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33811440/,413

METHODS This study examined 15 metal markers in the gastric walls of 12 patients with gastric cancer treated with external-beam photon RT. Motion assessment was analyzed in 41 respiratory phases covering 20 s acquired with computed tomography (CT) in the RT position using 320-multislice CT. The intra-fraction displacement was assessed in the cranio-caudal (CC), antero-posterior (AP), and right-left (RL) directions. RESULTS Motion in the CC direction showed a very strong correlation (R2 > 0.7) with the respiratory curve in all 15 markers. The mean (+/- SD) intra-fractional gastric motion (maximum range of displacement) was 12.5 (+/- 3.4) mm in the CC, 8.3 (+/- 2.2) mm in the AP, and 5.5 (+/- 3.0) mm in the RL direction. No significant differences in magnitude of motion were detected in the following: a) among the upper (n = 6), middle (n = 4), and lower (n = 5) stomach regions; b) between metal clips (n = 5) and surgical staples (n = 10); and c) between full (n = 9) and empty (n = 6) stomachs. CONCLUSIONS Motion in primary gastric tumor was evaluated with 320-multislice CT.

METHODS We performed a post hoc analysis using data from the Vitamin D And Lifestyle Intervention for gestational diabetes prevention (DALI) trial conducted across nine European countries (2012-2014). In women with a BMI ≥ 29 kg/m2 ), insulin resistance and secretion were estimated from the oral glucose tolerance test values performed before 20 weeks, using homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and Stumvoll first-phase indices, respectively. Women with early gestational diabetes, defined by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria, were classified into three groups: GDM-R (above-median insulin resistance alone), GDM-S (below-median insulin secretion alone), and GDM-B (combination of both) and the few remaining women were excluded. RESULTS Compared with women in the normal glucose tolerance group (n = 651), women in the GDM-R group (n = 143) had higher fasting and post-load glucose values and insulin levels, with a greater risk of having large-for-gestational age babies [adjusted odds ratio 3.30 (95% CI 1.50-7.50)] and caesarean section [adjusted odds ratio 2.30 (95% CI 1.20-4.40)]. Women in the GDM-S (n=37) and GDM-B (n = 56) groups had comparable pregnancy outcomes with those in the normal glucose tolerance group. CONCLUSIONS In overweight and obese women with early gestational diabetes, higher degree of insulin resistance alone was more likely to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes than lower insulin secretion alone or a combination of both.","Immanuel, J; Simmons, D; Harreiter, J; Desoye, G; Corcoy, R; Adelantado, J M; Devlieger, R; Lapolla, A; Dalfra, M G; Bertolotto, A; Wender-Ozegowska, E; Zawiejska, A; Dunne, F P; Damm, P; Mathiesen, E R; Jensen, D M; Andersen, L L T; Hill, D J; Jelsma, J G M; Kautzky-Willer, A; Galjaard, S; Snoek, F J; van Poppel, M N M",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.14413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991758/,413

The primary outcomes examined were identified using the core outcomes recommended by the Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology in Peritoneal Dialysis initiative (PD infection, cardiovascular disease, mortality, PD failure and life participation). Hospitalisation rates were also considered as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, patient skills, patient knowledge and satisfaction. Using the inclusion criteria, 15 studies (1334 participants) were included in the study. The effectiveness of eHealth interventions was mixed. Due to high heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not possible, and quality of evidence was low. Risk of bias across the randomised studies was unclear but bias across non-randomised studies was identified as critical. There were no reported adverse effects of eHealth interventions within the included studies. Despite the high interest of eHealth interventions in PD, good quality evidence is needed to explore their effectiveness before a wider application of eHealth interventions.","Cartwright, Emma J; Zs Goh, Zack; Foo, Marjorie; Chan, Choong M; Htay, Htay; Griva, Konstadina",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,https://doi.org/10.1177/0896860820918135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301380/,413
125358,Bariatric surgery for type 2 diabetes.,2012,"OBJECTIVES We sought to determine the relationships between muscle size, function, and polar second moments of area (J) at the midshaft femur, proximal tibia, and midshaft tibia. MATERIALS AND METHODS We used peripheral quantitative computed tomography to quantify right femoral and tibial J and soft tissue cross-sectional areas, and force plate mechanography to quantify peak power output and maximum force of the right limb, among athletic women and control subjects. RESULTS Lower limb bone J exhibited strong relationships with estimated force but not power between both groups. Among controls, the strongest relationships between force and J were found at the midshaft femur. Among athletes, these relationships shifted to the tibia, regardless of body size, likely reflecting functional strain related to the major knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors. Together, muscle force and stature explained as much as 82 and 48% of the variance in lower limb bone J among controls and athletes, respectively. DISCUSSION Results highlight the importance of considering relevant muscle function variables (e.g., force and lever arm lengths) when interpreting behavioral signatures from skeletal remains. Future work to improve the estimation of muscle force from skeletal remains, and incorporate it with lever arm length into analyses, is warranted. Results also suggest that, in doing so, functional relationships between a given section location and musculature should be considered.","Murray, Alison A; Stock, Jay T",American journal of physical anthropology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.24097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735047/,413

Here we perform reverse transcription lesion-induced DNA amplification (RT-LIDA), an isothermal amplification method that only requires T4 DNA ligase. RT-LIDA involves the RNA-templated ligation of DNA primers to form complementary DNA (cDNA) followed by toehold-mediated strand displacement of the cDNA and its exponential amplification via our isothermal ligase chain reaction LIDA. Each step is tuned to proceed at 28 °C, which falls within the range of global room temperatures. Using RT-LIDA, we can detect as little as ∼100 amol target RNA and can distinguish RNA target from total cellular RNA. Finally, we demonstrate that the resulting DNA amplicons can be detected colorimetrically, also at room temperature, by rapid, target-triggered disassembly of DNA-modified gold nanoparticles. This integrated amplification/detection platform requires no heating or visualization instrumentation, which is an important step towards realizing instrument-free POC testing.","Alladin-Mustan, B Safeenaz; Liu, Yuning; Li, Yimeng; de Almeida, Daria R Q; Yuzik, Jesse; Mendes, Camilla F; Gibbs, Julianne M",Analytica chimica acta,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2020.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551053/,413
127105,Bariatric surgery: a systematic review of the clinical and economic evidence.,2011,"INTRODUCTION Routine ultrasound may be used in abortion services to determine gestational age and confirm an intrauterine pregnancy. However, ultrasound adds complexity to care and results may be inconclusive, delaying abortion. We sought to determine the rate of ectopic pregnancy and the utility of routine ultrasound in its detection, in a community abortion service. METHODS Retrospective case record review of women requesting abortion over a 5-year period (2015-2019) with an outcome of ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) at a service (Edinburgh, UK) conducting routine ultrasound on all women. Records were searched for symptoms at presentation, development of symptoms during clinical care, significant risk factors and routine ultrasound findings. RESULTS Only 29/11 381 women (0.25%, 95% CI 0.18%, 0.33%) had an ectopic pregnancy or PUL (tubal=18, caesarean scar=1, heterotopic=1, PUL=9). Eleven (38%) cases had either symptoms at presentation (n=8) and/or significant risk factors for ectopic pregnancy (n=4). A further 12 women developed symptoms during their clinical care. Of the remaining six, three were PUL treated with methotrexate and three were ectopic (salpingectomy=2, methotrexate=1). In three cases, the baseline ultrasound indicated a probable early intrauterine pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS Ectopic pregnancies are uncommon among women presenting for abortion. The value of routine ultrasound in excluding ectopic pregnancy in symptom-free women without significant risk factors is questionable as it may aid detection of some cases but may provide false reassurance that a pregnancy is intrauterine.","Duncan, Clara I; Reynolds-Wright, John J; Cameron, Sharon T",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2020-200888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33376099/,413
127556,Allergies/asthma and root resorption: a systematic review.,2021-03-15,"Throughout the life course, individuals are confronted with adversities that challenge their ability to live the life they imagined. Adversities that are the most prominently studied and shown to bring about the most serious consequences for adjustment across the adult lifespan include job loss, disease and disability onset, and spousal and child bereavement. However, not all individuals show sustained declines to adversity; some are able to bounce back. The resilience literature is built on the premise that individuals are able to bounce back, or adapt to adversity. The past 15-20 years have seen an abundance of resilience research examining resilience to diverse types of adversity across the adult life-span. The overarching goal of this paper is to evaluate psychological concepts of resilience in adulthood and old age and recommend avenues for future research. To do so, I first evaluate and discuss definitions of resilience and their overlap across literatures with an emphasis on sociological approaches to studying adversity across the adult lifespan. Second, I discuss promising conceptual and methodological approaches to advance the resilience literature in adulthood and old age. Conceptual approaches to furthering the resilience literature include incorporating an anticipation component into the definition of resilience. Methodological approaches to furthering the resilience literature include prospective longitudinal designs that incorporate quantitative and qualitative approaches, multidimensional assessments, and the need to examine repeated adversities or multiple adversities that transpire in relatively close proximity to one another.","Infurna, Frank J",Gerontology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000507365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408298/,413

Based on these findings, the primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that biomarkers of bone turnover and cartilage degradation and their responsiveness to HT differ among the ethnic groups. METHODS The PAM study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluating 1028 postmenopausal women at 22 clinical centers in 11 Asian countries/territories. Subjects were randomized to one of three continuous combined conjugated estrogens (CE)/medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) doses: CE/MPA (in mg/day) = 0.625/2.5; 0.45/1.5; and 0.3/1.5. Following baseline evaluations, subjects received therapy for six continuous 28-day cycles (6 months). Biomarkers for bone resorption (alphaalphaCTX and betabetaCTX, representing newly synthesized and old bone, respectively), bone formation (osteocalcin) and cartilage degradation (CTX-II) were analyzed centrally by state-of-the-art methods. RESULTS The baseline concentrations of the four biomarkers were significantly associated with ethnicity. This association was independent of age and body mass index (BMI). The biomarker levels varied widely among the ethnic groups, showing ranges of alphaalphaCTX = 0.78-1.14 microg/mmol for Taiwanese vs. Malay women; betabetaTCX = 3.77-4.85 microg/mmol for Korean vs. Pakistani women; osteocalcin = 14.9-24.9 microg/l for Korean vs. Pakistani women; and CTX-II = 300-479 microg/mmol for Vietnamese vs. Indonesian women. The baseline biomarker levels were significantly and independently affected by BMI, but not by age. There was a weak but consistent negative correlation between baseline estradiol levels and baseline biomarkers. Hormone therapy for 6 months significantly lowered the biomarker levels in all ethnic groups, with a few exceptions for CTX-II in the lowest dose group. Ethnicity, but not age or BMI, was significantly associated with the response of the bone markers, whereas ethnicity, age and BMI were significantly associated with the response of the cartilage degradation marker. CONCLUSION Baseline levels and hormonal responsiveness of two bone resorption markers, a bone formation marker, and a marker of cartilage degradation differ among the ethnic groups of Asian postmenopausal women evaluated in this study. The clinical significance of these findings remains to be investigated.","Holinka, C F; Christiansen, C; Tian, X W; Ausmanas, M K",Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,https://doi.org/10.1080/13697130701744886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18202964/,413

Fifty patients were randomly assigned into the CMFE and placebo groups to receive 20 ml of the extract or placebo for 12 weeks, respectively. Serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) levels, and steatosis and fibrosis scores were examined before and after the intervention. Although, a significant decrease was observed in CK-18 levels among the CMFE group (288.80 ± 85.40 vs. 235.66 ± 60.38; p = .001) after 12 weeks, no significant difference was found between the two groups.

We compare the inflammatory and arterial blood gas markers between patients with COVID-19 delirium and delirium in other medical disorders. METHODS This cross-sectional study used the CHART-DEL, a validated research tool, to screen patients for delirium retrospectively from clinical notes. Inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and white cell count (WBC), and the partial pressures of oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (PCO2) were compared between patients with COVID-19 delirium and delirium in other medical disorders. RESULTS In bivariate analysis, CRP (mg/L) was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group, (81.7 ± 80.0 vs. 58.8 ± 87.7, p = 0.04), and WBC (109/L) was significantly lower (7.44 ± 3.42 vs. 9.71 ± 5.45, p = 0.04). The geometric mean of CRP in the COVID-19 group was 140% higher in multiple linear regression (95% CI = 7-439%, p = 0.03) with age and sex as covariates. There were no significant differences in pO2 or pCO2 across groups. CONCLUSION The association between higher CRP and COVID-19 in patients with delirium may suggest an inflammatory basis for delirium in COVID-19. Our findings may assist clinicians in establishing whether delirium is due to COVID-19, which may improve management and outcomes of infected patients.","Saini, Aman; Oh, Tae Hyun; Ghanem, Dory Anthony; Castro, Megan; Butler, Matthew; Sin Fai Lam, Chun Chiang; Posporelis, Sotiris; Lewis, Glyn; David, Anthony S; Rogers, Jonathan P",Aging & mental health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1989375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651536/,413

However, eyes with KPro can experience various complications, including the development of retroprosthetic membrane (RPM). RPMs reduce visual acuity in patients due to physical obstruction of the visual axis, but studies have shown that RPM can also lead to a variety of other consequences, from melting of the corneal carrier graft to precipitating retinal detachments. Histopathologic studies have shown that RPMs are composed of elements from both the recipient and donor. The presence of myofibroblasts in RPMs imparts them with contractile properties, which can contribute to their downstream complications, including angle closure, hypotony, and retinal detachment. At present, there are limited treatments to combat the growth of RPM. Future therapies could include anti-metabolites and targeted anti-inflammatory treatments, as well as device coatings or textured device surfaces that can hinder RPM proliferation. The long-term success of KPro depends on devising an effective solution for preventing RPM growth.","Park, Jennifer; Phrueksaudomchai, Pakornkit; Cortina, M Soledad",The ocular surface,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtos.2020.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916253/,413

The best hope of controlling this pandemic is the development of a successful prophylactic vaccine. However, to date, this goal has proven to be exceptionally elusive. The recent failure of an experimental vaccine in a phase IIb study, named the STEP trial, intended solely to elicit cell-mediated immune responses against HIV-1, has highlighted the need for a balanced immune response consisting of not only cellular immunity but also a broad and potent humoral antibody response that can prevent infection with HIV-1.

The purpose of this study was to identify quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and clinical parameters associated with positive treatment outcome. Patients and methods The CT scans, pulmonary function tests (PFT), and 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) data were collected from 72 patients with advanced emphysema prior to and at 3 months after LVRC treatment. The procedure involved placing 10 coils unilaterally. Various QCT parameters were derived using Apollo imaging software (VIDA). Independent predictors of clinically relevant outcome (Δ6-MWT ≥ 26 m, ΔFEV1 ≥ 12%, ΔRV ≥ 10%) were identified through stepwise linear regression analysis. Results The response outcome for Δ6-MWT, for ΔFEV1 and for ΔRV was met by 55%, 32% and 42%, respectively. For Δ6-MWT ≥ 26 m a lower baseline 6-MWT (p = 0.0003) and a larger standard deviation (SD) of low attenuation cluster (LAC) sizes in peripheral regions of treated lung (p = 0.0037) were significantly associated with positive outcome. For ΔFEV1 ≥ 12%, lower baseline FEV1 (p = 0.02) and larger median LAC sizes in the central regions of treated lobe (p = 0.0018) were significant predictors of good response. For ΔRV ≥ 10% a greater baseline TLC (p = 0.0014) and a larger SD of LAC sizes in peripheral regions of treated lung (p = 0.007) tended to respond better. Conclusion Patients with lower FEV1 and 6-MWT, with higher TLC and specific QCT characteristics responded more positively to LVRC treatment, suggesting a more targeted CT-based approach to patient selection could lead to greater efficacy in treatment response.","Kontogianni, Konstantina; Russell, Kanoe; Eberhardt, Ralf; Schuhmann, Maren; Heussel, Claus Peter; Wood, Susan; Herth, Felix Jf; Gompelmann, Daniela",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s159355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30050294/,413

DESIGN A multiprofessional group of experts in end-of-life care and antimicrobial stewardship was convened. Findings from a scoping review of the literature and a consultation of clinicians were triangulated. Expert discussion was used to generate consensus on how to approach decision-making. SETTING Representatives from hospital and a range of community health and care settings. PARTICIPANTS Medical, pharmacy and nursing professionals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Good practice recommendations based on published evidence and the experience of prescribers in Scotland. RESULTS The findings of 88 uncontrolled, observational studies of variable quality were considered alongside a survey of over 200 prescribers. No national or international guidelines were identified. Antibiotic use towards the end of life was common but practice was highly variable. The potential harms associated with giving antibiotics tended to be less well considered than the potential benefits. Antibiotics often extended the length of time to death but this was sometimes at the cost of higher symptom burden. There was strong consensus around the importance of effective communication with patients and their families and making treatment decisions aligned to a patient's goals and priorities. CONCLUSIONS Good practice recommendations were agreed with focus on three areas: making shared decisions about future care; agreeing clear goals and limits of therapy; reviewing all antibiotic prescribing decisions regularly. These will be disseminated widely to support optimal care for patients towards the end of life. A patient version of the recommendations has also been produced to support implementation.","Seaton, R Andrew; Cooper, Lesley; Fairweather, Jack; Fenning, Stephen; Ferguson, Libby; Galbraith, Susan; Duffy, Tony; Sneddon, Jacqueline",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468509/,413

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-two patients from six institutions were included, with a total of 83 pulmonary metastases treated in 65 sessions. RF ablation was always performed percutaneously with computed tomography (CT) guidance. Primary endpoints were technical success and technique effectiveness. Technique effectiveness was evaluated based on sequential follow-up CT images. Secondary study endpoints were complications, patient survival, and determination of prognostic factors. Complications were classified as major or minor. Prognostic factors were determined by analyzing multiple variables with the log-rank test. RESULTS Technical success rate was 100%. Primary technique effectiveness rates were 92% each at 1, 2, and 3 years. Major and minor complications occurred after 16 (25%) and 23 (35%) of the 65 sessions, respectively. The median follow-up period was 20.5 months. Overall survival rates were 87% at 1 year and 57% each at 2 and 3 years (median and mean survival times, 37.7 mo and 43.2 mo, respectively). Significantly better survival rates were obtained in cases of (i) no viable intrahepatic recurrence (P < .001), (ii) Child-Pugh class A disease (P < .001), (iii) absence of liver cirrhosis (P < .001), (iv) absence of hepatitis C virus infection (P = .006), and (v) α-fetoprotein level of 10 ng/mL or lower (P = .007) at the time of RF ablation.

However, conventional endoscopic stapling devices cannot be used during TPL in small children because of limited space. Consequently, Ligasure (LS) and Enseal (ES) devices are being used instead. We are the first to compare LS and ES for efficacy and efficiency during TPL. Of 26 TPL (6 upper, 3 middle, and 17 lower) performed for congenital adenomatoid malformation (n = 16) and sequestration (n = 10), incomplete fissure was found in 14. TPL (LS = 11; ES = 15) was performed conventionally in the lateral decubitus position with single lung ventilation using four 5 mm trocars. All cases had a chest tube inserted intraoperatively that was left in situ. Patient demographics, location of pathology, incidence of incomplete fissure, mean age/weight at TPL, mean blood loss, and mean operative time were all similar. However, duration of chest tube insertion was significantly shorter in ES because there was less postoperative air leakage (1.3 vs. 3.9 days; p < 0.05). ES would appear to seal lung parenchyma more effectively during TPL based on the shorter duration of chest tube insertion.","Koga, Hiroyuki; Suzuki, Kenji; Nishimura, Kinya; Okawada, Manabu; Doi, Takashi; Lane, Geoffrey J; Inada, Eiichi; Okazaki, Tadaharu; Yamataka, Atsuyuki",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-014-3567-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074733/,413
131870,Intravenous Magnesium Sulfate to Treat Acute Headaches in the Emergency Department: A Systematic Review.,2019,"Importance While most viral respiratory tract infections can be diagnosed clinically, clinicians frequently order tests to identify the specific offending virus. While there has been tremendous growth in the variety, availability, and sophistication of the types of respiratory viral tests, there may have been less critical thought and discussion among frontline clinicians about the clinical utility and specific indications for testing. We summarize the rationale historically used to support respiratory virus testing in children, with a review of the supporting evidence. We outline potential considerations and limitations of the various types of respiratory viral tests and suggest some clinical indications where viral testing may play an important role in clinical management. Observations The main value of testing for viruses in children who present with a respiratory tract infection is to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections, hopefully facilitating clinical decision making regarding further investigations and the need for antibiotics. We have highlighted commonly cited rationale used to support testing and the generally poor evidence on which to base this rationale. In addition, difficulties with interpretation of respiratory viral testing results include somewhat poor diagnostic test characteristics for some tests, uncertainty regarding true positives and causation of illness, delay in receiving the test result, and the incidence of concurrent bacterial infections or the presence of multiple viruses. We have given some examples of clinical scenarios where respiratory viral testing results could be expected to contribute to more appropriate clinical management decisions. Conclusions and Relevance It is not good enough to ""do"" just because we ""can."" We suggest that for many healthy immune-competent children presenting with typical viral respiratory tract symptoms, the diagnosis can be made clinically, and frontline clinicians should think critically before automatically requesting a somewhat uncomfortable, expensive respiratory viral test, the result of which may not contribute to the child's treatment.","Gill, Peter J; Richardson, Susan E; Ostrow, Olivia; Friedman, Jeremy N",JAMA pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.0786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28672402/,413
132716,A diagnostic cohort study on the accuracy of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-CT for evaluation of malignancy in anterior mediastinal lesions: the DECiMaL study.,2018,"INTRODUCTION Hysterectomy is the most common major gynaecological procedure in women and minimally invasive approaches should be used wherever possible; total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) is one such surgical approach which allows removal of the uterus entirely laparoscopically. However, lack of surgical training opportunities is impeding its increased adoption. This study will formally test a surgical outreach training model to equip surgeons with the skills to provide TLH as an alternative to total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). METHODS AND ANALYSIS Stepped wedge implementation trial of a surgical training programme for practising obstetrician gynaecologist specialists in four hospitals. PRIMARY OUTCOMES Change in the proportion of hysterectomies performed by TAH, measured between preintervention and postintervention; we aim to reduce TAH by at least 30% in 75% of the trainees. SECONDARY OUTCOMES (1) Number of hospitals screened, eligible, agree to training and complete the training; (2) number of surgeons screened for eligibility, eligible, agree to training, who complete training and achieve proficiency; (3) proportion of trainees achieving proficiency in correct theatre setup, vascular exposure, mobilisation and surgery closure; change in proportion proficient over time; (4) adverse events (conversion from TLH to TAH, anaesthetic incident, intraoperative visceral injury, red cell transfusions, hospital stay >7 days, incidental finding of malignancy, unplanned readmission, admission to intensive care, return to theatre, postoperative pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, development of a fistula, vault haematoma, vaginal vault dehiscence or pelvic infection); (5) hospital length-of-stay; (6) cost-effectiveness and (7) trainee surgeon proficiency with TLH. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study has been approved by the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee and has received site-specific approval from all participating hospitals. Results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

132896,Post-intensive care syndrome and COVID-19 - Implications post pandemic.,2020-08-05,"Introduction: At the end of March, 2020, rapid tests detecting the presence of antiviral IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus were introduced in Hungary for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease). Aim: We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection. Method: Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR; PCR without rapid tests; and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively. (Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively.) Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively. (Note: Clungene test is also marketed as 'Lungene'.) Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33.3% and 72.85%, and 35.48% and 85.02%, respectively. At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7.28%, 94.48%, 13.13%, and 95.38%, respectively. Conclusion: The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 vírus infection in the general population. These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND Budesonide foam is used for the topical treatment of distal ulcerative colitis. This phase III study was performed to confirm mucosal healing and other therapeutic effects of twice-daily budesonide 2-mg foam in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis including left-sided colitis and pancolitis. METHODS This was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. A total of 126 patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis with active inflammation in the distal colon were randomized to two groups receiving twice-daily budesonide 2 mg/25 ml foam or placebo foam. The primary endpoint was the percentage of complete mucosal healing of distal lesions (endoscopic subscore of 0) at week 6. Some patients continued the treatment through week 12. Drug efficacy and safety were evaluated. RESULTS The percentages of both complete mucosal healing of distal lesions and clinical remission were significantly improved in the budesonide as compared with the placebo group (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0035). Subgroup analysis showed similar efficacy of budesonide foam for complete mucosal healing of distal lesions and clinical remission regardless of disease type. The clinical remission percentage tended to be higher in patients achieving complete mucosal healing of distal lesions than in other patients. There were no safety concerns with budesonide foam. CONCLUSIONS This study confirmed for the first time complete mucosal healing with twice-daily budesonide 2-mg foam in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis with distal active inflammation. The results also indicated that complete mucosal healing of distal lesions by budesonide foam promotes clinical remission of ulcerative colitis.

133516,Frailty is associated with in-hospital mortality in older hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands: the COVID-OLD study.,2021-05-05,"OBJECTIVES The National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden published the national guidelines for Parkinson's Disease 2016. The aim of this study was to summarize this evidence review and development of the guidelines, focusing on the economic evaluation of device-aided therapies (deep brain stimulation, pump-based infusion of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel or apomorphine) for Parkinson's disease, and the rate of implementation after 3 years in Sweden. MATERIAL AND METHODS The evidence review underlying the guidelines-including systematic literature searches of clinical and economic evidence, model-based economic evaluation, and formal analysis and guideline development-was examined, condensed, and translated. The impact of the guidelines was assessed with treatment use statistics from 2009 to 2019. RESULTS All device-aided therapies were assigned high priority. Based on a relatively low proportion of device-aided therapies (30%) in Parkinson's disease, a 5-year increase of 500 patients was recommended. This was estimated to reduce total costs by SEK 14 million (€1.7 million). Follow-up data found an increase of 217 patients between 2017 and 2019, following the same trend as before the guidelines. CONCLUSION Three years after the guidelines were published, the use of device-aided therapies has increased in Sweden, albeit not in pace with recommendations. One reason for slow implementation may be poor incentivization related to budget silos in which the costs for device-aided therapies are borne by the regions but the cost offsets (eg, reduced need for home care) are reaped by local stakeholders.","Norlin, Jenny M; Willis, Michael; Persson, Ulf; Andersson, Emelie; E Pålhagen, Sven; Odin, Per",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/ane.13434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33899213/,413

The goal of this research project was to foster the development of adolescents' conceptual understanding of viruses and influenza biology. Thus, the project included two components: 1) pre- and posttests to determine students' conceptions about influenza biology, epidemics/pandemics, and vaccination; and 2) design an intervention that supports conceptual change to promote improvements in influenza knowledge based on these primary conceptions. Thirty-five female students from a high school biology class participated in a series of instructional activities and pre- and posttest assessments. Results from the pretest indicated that high school students exhibit a limited understanding of concepts related to viruses. Six weeks after an intervention that promoted active learning, results from a posttest showed that conceptions about influenza are more accurately related to the provided scientific knowledge. Although adolescents have nonscientific models to explain influenza biology, we showed that a carefully designed intervention can affect students' knowledge as well as influence the implementation of health education programs in secondary schools.","Dumais, Nancy; Hasni, Abdelkrim",CBE life sciences education,https://doi.org/10.1187/cbe.08-08-0048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19255137/,413

135724,Preoperative Quadriceps Muscle Strength and Functional Ability Predict Performance-Based Outcomes 6 Months After Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review.,2019,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 reinfections could be a major aggravating factor in this current pandemic, as this would further complicate potential vaccine development and help to maintain worldwide virus pockets. To investigate this critical question, we conducted a clinical meta-analysis including all available currently reported cases of potential COVID-19 reinfections. METHODS We searched for all peer-reviewed articles in the search engine of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. While there are over 30.000 publications on COVID-19, only about 15 specifically target the subject of COVID-19 reinfections. Available patient data in these reports was analyzed for age, gender, time of reported relapse after initial infection and persistent COVID-19 positive PCR results. RESULTS Following the first episode of infection, cases of clinical relapse are reported at 34 (mean) ± 10,5 days after full recovery. Patients with clinical relapse have persisting positive COVID-19 PCR testing results until 39 ± 9 days following initial positive testing. For patients without clinical relapse, positive testing was reported up to 54 ± 24 days. There were no reports of any clinical reinfections after a 70-day period following initial infection. CONCLUSIONS Reports of COVID-19 reinfections all appear within a vulnerable timeframe, where affected patients are still tested positive for COVID-19 via PCR. According to our data, it is most likely that all reported cases of COVID-19 reinfections are in fact protracted initial infections. To diagnose a true COVID-19 reinfection, positive COVID-19 testing combined with recurrent clinical symptoms occurring outside of this timeframe is required. This article is protected by copyright.

135731,Reduced opiate use after total knee arthroplasty using computer-assisted cryotherapy.,2019,"OBJECT The use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) is controversial regarding the reported complication rates and cost. The authors aimed to assess the complication rates of performing ALIF using rhBMP-2. METHODS This is a prospective study of consecutive patients who underwent ALIF performed by a single spine surgeon and a single vascular surgeon between 2009 and 2012. All patients underwent placement of a polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage filled with rhBMP-2 and a separate anterior titanium plate. Preoperative clinical data, operative details, postoperative complications, and clinical and radiographic outcomes were recorded for all patients. Clinical outcome measures included back and leg pain visual analog scale scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS and MCS) scores. Radiographic assessment of fusion was performed using high-definition CT scanning. Male patients were screened pre- and postoperatively regarding sexual dysfunction, specifically retrograde ejaculation (RE). RESULTS The study comprised 131 patients with a mean age of 45.3 years. There were 67 men (51.1%) and 64 women (48.9%). Of the 131 patients, 117 (89.3%) underwent ALIF at L5-S1, 9 (6.9%) at L4-5, and 5 (3.8%) at both L4-5 and L5-S1. The overall complication rate was 19.1% (25 of 131), with 17 patients (13.0%) experiencing minor complications and 8 (6.1%) experiencing major complications. The mean estimated blood loss per ALIF level was 115 ml. There was 1 incidence (1.5%) of RE. No significant vascular injuries occurred. No prosthesis failure occurred with the PEEK cage and separate anterior screw-plate. Back and leg pain improved 57.2% and 61.8%, respectively. The ODI improved 54.3%, with PCS and MCS scores improving 41.7% and 21.3%, respectively. Solid interbody fusion was observed in 96.9% of patients at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Anterior lumbar interbody fusion with a vascular access surgeon and spine surgeon, using a separate cage and anterior screw-plate, provides a very robust and reliable construct with low complication rates, high fusion rates, and positive clinical outcomes, and it is cost-effective. The authors did not experience the high rates of RE reported by other authors using rhBMP-2.","Malham, Gregory M; Parker, Rhiannon M; Ellis, Ngaire J; Blecher, Carl M; Chow, Fiona Y; Claydon, Matthew H",Journal of neurosurgery.

136115,Risk Factors Associated With In-Hospital Mortality in a US National Sample of Patients With COVID-19.,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVE To determine the consequences of an early catheter-based intervention on pulmonary artery (PA) growth and right ventricular (RV) myocardial function in an animal model of branch PA stenosis. BACKGROUND Acute results and safety profiles of deliberate stent fracture within the pulmonary vasculature have been demonstrated. The long-term impact of early stent intervention and deliberate stent fracture on PA growth and myocardial function is not understood. METHODS Implantation of small diameter stents was performed in a pig model of left PA stenosis at 6 weeks (10 kg) followed by dilations at 10 (35 kg) and 18 weeks (65 kg) with intent to fracture and implant large diameter stents. Hemodynamics, RV contractility, and 2D/3D angiography were performed with each intervention. The heart and pulmonary vasculature were histologically assessed. RESULTS Stent fracture occurred in 9/12 and implantation of large diameter stents was successful in 10/12 animals with no PA aneurysms or dissections. The final stented PA segment and distal left PA branch origins equaled the corresponding PA diameters of sham controls. Growth of left PA immediately beyond the stent was limited and there was diffuse fibro-intimal proliferation within the distal left and right PA. RV contractility was diminished in the intervention group and the response to dobutamine occurred uniquely via increases in heart rate. CONCLUSIONS Early stent intervention in this surgically created PA stenosis model was associated with improved growth of the distal PA vasculature but additional investigation of PA vessel physiology and impact on the developing heart are needed.","Bates, Melissa L; Anagnostopoulos, Petros V; Nygard, Cole; Torgeson, Jenna; Reichert, Jamie; Galambos, Csaba; Eldridge, Marlowe W; Lamers, Luke J",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.27593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29602248/,413

Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) nephrectomy is feasible to remove diseased kidneys. Most of such procedures previously reported were performed through a transperitoneal (trans-abdominal) approach. We report the feasibility, safety, and techniques of performing such operations without disturbing the bowels (a retroperitoneal LESS approach). This approach provides acceptable operative outcomes, and is especially valuable for patients who need to have an intact peritoneal envelope, or those with potentially abnormal or obliterated peritoneal space. OBJECTIVES • To retrospectively review our experience with respect to evaluating the feasibility and safety of retroperitoneoscopic laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) nephrectomy. • To present the technical details of such a procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS • In total, eight retroperitoneoscopic LESS nephrectomies (in seven patients) were completed for a variety of indications in a single centre. • The GelPOINT apparatus (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA) was used as an access platform through a flank incision (3-5 cm). • Except for a bendable grasper and flexible vascular staplers, all instruments used were conventional straight laparoscopic instruments. • Perioperative data were retrospectively obtained for all patients, including demographic data, operative indications, operative records, length of stay, complications, and pathological analysis. RESULTS • All retroperitoneoscopic LESS nephrectomy procedures attempted were completed successfully without complications. No extra working port was required for any case. • Median (range) operating time was 164 (87-198) min and median (range) estimated blood loss was 50 (10-200) cm(3) . Median (range) length of hospital stay was 2 (1-3) days. • The median narcotic used was 34 mg of parental morphine sulphate equivalent. The median (range) visual analogue pain scale score at discharge was 2 (0-3) out of 10. • The present single arm observation study is limited by the small patient number and the absence of a control cohort. CONCLUSIONS • Retroperitoneoscopic LESS nephrectomy using the GelPOINT apparatus as an access platform is feasible and safe. • It provides adequate flexibility and spacing of port placements as well as acceptable operative outcomes. • It is especially valuable for those patients who need to maintain peritoneal integrity or those with an abnormal or obliterated peritoneal space.","Chueh, Shih-Chieh Jeff; Sankari, Bashir R; Chung, Shiu-Dong; Jones, J Stephen",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2011.10120.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21443657/,413
136262,Necessity of Coronary CT Scans-Reply.,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND Despite technical refinements of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement, complications such as early tube dislodgement remain relatively static. This study aimed to review the experience of a high-volume endoscopy center after the introduction of T-fastener placement in high-risk patients. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed PEG placement from October 2010 to September 2011, when their group began to use T-fasteners selectively in high-risk patients. Patients deemed to have an increased risk for early tube dislodgement underwent T-fastener placement at the time of PEG placement. Patients with PEG alone were compared with patients who had PEG with T-fastener (PEG-T) placement. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 18. RESULTS During the study period, 195 patients underwent PEG placement. For 121 patients, PEG alone was performed, whereas PEG-T was performed for 74 patients. Six patients had tube dislodgement (five early, one late) in the PEG-T cohort versus none in the PEG-alone cohort (P = 0.003). The first patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with replacement gastrostomy 2 days after tube dislodgement and was noted to have no contamination, with direct apposition of the stomach to the abdominal wall from the T-fasteners. The subsequent four patients with early tube dislodgement underwent non-emergent PEG replacement in the endoscopy unit within 24 h after tube dislodgement. In the short-term follow-up period, no repeat dislodgements were noted. Early mortality in the entire cohort was experienced by 38 (19.5%) of the 195 patients. CONCLUSION Placement of T-fasteners in high-risk patients may decrease overall morbidity if early tube dislodgement occurs. The findings show the safety of non-emergent endoscopic replacement of PEGs in certain patients. Early tube dislodgement may be a marker of overall mortality.","Timratana, P; El-Hayek, K; Shimizu, H; Kroh, M; Chand, B",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2348-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22648113/,413

137059,Ultrasound-Guided Distal Forearm Fracture Reduction by Pediatric Emergency Physicians: A Single Center Retrospective Study.,2021-06-17,"OBJECTIVES Multiple regression approaches for estimating body mass by somatometry typically use stature and biiliocristal breadth. However, these measures were obtained largely from Europeans, Africans, and Indo-Mediterraneans, whereas mid-latitude Asians were not broadly reflected. Thus, new estimation formulas for circum-Pacific Asians were devised, and the accuracy was evaluated using raw individual data. MATERIALS AND METHODS Targeting Asians in the traditional society or before the 1960s and performing multiple regression analysis (MRA) with body weight as the objective variable, and stature, body breadth, and product of head length/breadth (HLBpr) as explanatory variables. The target population was divided into four climate groups, and the formulas were prepared for each sex or the combined-sexes. RESULTS The MRA by stature and body breadth indicated significant multiple correlation coefficients (R) in many formulas. R was higher in the combined-sexes. Among the four climate groups, the temperate group showed the highest R. In the East/Southeast Asians, R exceeded 0.8 in the MRA by stature and HLBpr. Substituting the raw data of 19th-century Japanese males, the temperate group formulas presented the least error, and the error in all the formulas using body breadth was <2 kg. CONCLUSIONS As body mass index varies significantly depending on some climatic factors, estimation formulas mixed with various climate groups are not desirable because of the large errors. For the mid-latitude Asians, the temperate group formulas are expected to have a smaller error; however, in the group where the proportion of underweight individuals was originally high, any formula tends to be overestimated.","Takigawa, Wataru",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989874/,413
137340,WHO recommends corticosteroids for patients with severe or critical COVID-19.,2021-01-05,"INTRODUCTION Reliable, non-invasive detection of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) with minimal interruptions to chest compressions would be valuable for high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We investigated the potential of photoplethysmography (PPG) to detect the presence of a spontaneous pulse during automated CPR in an animal study. METHODS Twelve anesthetized pigs were instrumented to monitor circulatory and respiratory parameters. Here we present the simultaneously recorded PPG and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. Ventricular fibrillation was induced, followed by 20 min of automated CPR and subsequent defibrillation. After defibrillation, pediatric-guidelines-style life support was given in cycles of 2 min. PPG and ABP waveforms were recorded during all stages of the protocol. Raw PPG waveforms were acquired with a custom-built photoplethysmograph controlling a commercial reflectance pulse oximetry probe attached to the nose. ABP was measured in the aorta. RESULTS In nine animals ROSC was achieved. Throughout the protocol, PPG and ABP frequency content showed strong resemblance. We demonstrate that (1) the PPG waveform allows for the detection of a spontaneous pulse during ventilation pauses, and that (2) frequency analysis of the PPG waveform allows for the detection of a spontaneous pulse and the determination of the pulse rate, even during ongoing chest compressions, if the pulse and compression rates are sufficiently distinct. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate the potential of PPG as a non-invasive means to detect pulse presence or absence, as well as pulse rate during CPR.","Wijshoff, Ralph W C G R; van der Sar, Toeno; Peeters, Wouter H; Bezemer, Rick; Aelen, Paul; Paulussen, Igor W F; Ordelman, Simone C M A; Venema, Alyssa; van Berkom, Paul F J; Aarts, Ronald M; Woerlee, Pierre H; Scheffer, Gert-Jan; Noordergraaf, Gerrit J",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2013.07.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23907100/,413

The use of health e-technology is increasing, with promise for a role in improving breastfeeding outcomes. OBJECTIVE We undertook a scoping review of both individual breastfeeding apps and the literature on breastfeeding apps to map the available evidence on app-based breastfeeding support for African-American mothers. DESIGN A systematic search of online databases identified 241 English language papers published on or before June 2020 that included e-technology in support of breastfeeding. We included those that (1) described individual human subjects research studies utilizing any research design, (2) described app-based breastfeeding support, and (3) could be pertinent for African-American mothers, and assessed for inclusion and relevance for this population. We also searched app stores for breastfeeding apps, and evaluated features with a rubric. Our aim was to identify if gaps exist relative to breastfeeding support for African-Americans. RESULTS Of the 15 publications meeting inclusion criteria, 9 focused on app development, 4 examined user experience, and 3 examined breastfeeding outcomes with use of an app (one study overlapped categories). The percentage of African-American participants ranged from 100% (2 studies) to none (7 studies); 3 studies (20%) focused on African-American mothers' breastfeeding experience. Of 77 apps that met inclusion criteria, just one was both breastfeeding-focused by content and targeted for African-Americans by picture predominance. CONCLUSIONS The quality of studies was generally high and many included African-American participants, but research focused on breastfeeding apps specifically for African-American mothers/parents is limited, creating a meaningful gap in the literature.","Mieso, Bethel; Neudecker, Mandy; Furman, Lydia",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00927-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33219430/,413

138384,Characteristics of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo Following an Earthquake.,2021-03-14,"Acute liver failure (ALF) is a catastrophic condition that can occur after major liver resection. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the spheroid reservoir bio-artificial liver (SRBAL) on survival, serum chemistry, and liver regeneration in posthepatectomy ALF pigs. Wild-type large white swine (20 kg-30 kg) underwent intracranial pressure (ICP) probe placement followed by 85% hepatectomy. Computed tomography (CT) volumetrics were performed to measure the extent of resection, and at 48 hours following hepatectomy to assess regeneration of the remnant liver. Animals were randomized into three groups based on treatment delivered 24-48 hours after hepatectomy: Group1-standard medical therapy (SMT, n = 6); Group2-SMT plus bio-artificial liver treatment using no hepatocytes (0 g, n = 6); and Group3-SMT plus SRBAL treatment using 200 g of primary porcine hepatocyte spheroids (200 g, n = 6). The primary endpoint was survival to 90 hours following hepatectomy. Death equivalent was defined as unresponsive grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy or ICP greater than 20 mmHg with clinical evidence of brain herniation. All animals in both (SMT and 0 g) control groups met the death equivalent before 51 hours following hepatectomy. Five of 6 animals in the 200-g group survived to 90 hours (P < 0.01). The mean ammonia, ICP, and international normalized ratio values were significantly lower in the 200-g group. CT volumetrics demonstrated increased volume regeneration at 48 hours following hepatectomy in the 200-g group compared with the SMT (P < 0.01) and 0-g (P < 0.01) groups. Ki-67 staining showed increased positive staining at 48 hours following hepatectomy (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The SRBAL improved survival, reduced ammonia, and accelerated liver regeneration in posthepatectomy ALF. Improved survival was associated with a neuroprotective benefit of SRBAL therapy. These favorable results warrant further clinical testing of the SRBAL.","Chen, Harvey S; Joo, Dong Jin; Shaheen, Mohammed; Li, Yi; Wang, Yujia; Yang, Jian; Nicolas, Clara T; Predmore, Kelly; Amiot, Bruce; Michalak, Gregory; Mounajjed, Taofic; Fidler, Jeff; Kremers, Walter K; Nyberg, Scott L",Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.30184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30022502/,413

Here we investigate the relationship between joint pain and the gastrointestinal microbiome composition, and osteoarthritis-related knee pain in the Rotterdam Study; a large population based cohort study. We show that abundance of Streptococcus species is associated with increased knee pain, which we validate by absolute quantification of Streptococcus species. In addition, we replicate these results in 867 Caucasian adults of the Lifelines-DEEP study. Finally we show evidence that this association is driven by local inflammation in the knee joint.

138664,Is the association between sleep apnea and left ventricular hypertrophy obesity-independent?,2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND Cerebral oximetry is a noninvasive optical technology that measures frontal cortex blood hemoglobin-oxygen saturation. Commercially available cerebral oximeters have not been evaluated independently. Unlike pulse oximeters, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration standards for performance or accuracy. We tested the hypothesis that cerebral oximeters accurately measure a fixed ratio of the oxygen saturation in cerebral mixed venous and arterial blood. METHODS We evaluated the performance of 5 commercially available cerebral oximeters: the EQUANOX® 7600 in 3- and 4-wavelength versions (Nonin Medical, Plymouth, MN), FORE-SIGHT® (Casmed, Branford, CT), INVOS® 5100C (Covidien, Boulder, CO), and the NIRO-200NX® (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) during stable isocapnic hypoxia in volunteers. Twenty-three healthy adults (14 men, 9 women) had sensors placed on each side of the forehead. The subject's inspired oxygen (FIO2) was then changed to produce 6 steady-state arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) levels between 100% and 70%, while end-tidal CO2 was maintained constant. At each plateau, simultaneous blood samples from the jugular bulb and radial artery were analyzed with a hemoximeter (OSM-3, Radiometer Medical A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). Each cerebral oximeter's bias was calculated as the difference between the instrument's reading (cerebral saturation, ScO2) with the weighted saturation of venous and arterial blood (Sa/vO2), as specified by each manufacturer (INVOS: 25% arterial/75% venous; FORE-SIGHT, EQUANOX, and NIRO: 30% arterial/70% venous). RESULTS Five hundred forty-two comparisons between paired blood samples and oximeter readings were analyzed. The pooled root mean square error was 8.06%, a value higher than for pulse oximeters, which is ±3% by Food and Drug Administration standards. The mean % bias ± SD (precision) and root mean square errors were: FORE-SIGHT 1.76 ± 3.92 and 4.28; INVOS 0.05 ± 9.72 and 9.69; NIRO-200NX -1.13 ± 9.64 and 9.68; EQUANOX-3 λ 2.48 ± 8.12 and 8.47; EQUANOX-4 λ 2.84 ± 6.27 and 6.86. The FORE-SIGHT, NIRO-200NX, and EQUANOX-3 λ had significantly more positive bias at lower SaO2. The amount of bias during hypoxia was reduced when the bias was calculated on the basis of difference between oximeter reading and the arterial and mixed venous saturation difference rather than the weighted average of blood saturation, indicating that differences in the ratio between arterial and venous blood volumes account for some of the positive bias at low saturation. Dark skin pigment tended to produce more negative bias in all instruments but bias was significantly larger than zero only for the FORE-SIGHT oximeter. Bias was significantly more negative in women for INVOS and EQUANOX devices but not for the FORE-SIGHT device. CONCLUSIONS While responsive to desaturation, cerebral oximeters exhibited large variation in reading errors between subjects, with mean bias possibly related to variations in the ratio of arterial and venous blood in the sampling area of the brain. This ratio is probably not fixed, as assumed by the manufacturers, but dynamically changes with hypoxia. Better understanding these factors could improve the performance of cerebral oximeters and help establish saturation or blood flow thresholds for brain well-being.","Bickler, Philip E; Feiner, John R; Rollins, Mark D",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e318297d763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24023027/,413
138710,"Safety of ""pain exposure"" physical therapy in patients with complex regional pain syndrome type 1.",2011,"BACKGROUND In low anterior resections, anastomosis continues to present major problems. Although the single-stapling technique (SST) is considered to be superior to the double-staple technique (DST) in terms of leakage and stenosis, SST requires suturing, which is particularly difficult during laparoscopic surgery. A simpler and safer method of anastomosis is needed. In this study, we developed a pre-ligation SST (L-SST) that does not require suturing and evaluated the usefulness of L-SST in an ex vivo and an in vivo porcine model. METHODS Porcine rectums were ligated using SurgiTie™ and sharply resected instead of using a linear stapler. The burst pressures of the closed rectums after using a linear stapler and SurgiTie™ (each group; n = 5) and the burst pressures of the anastomoses performed with L-SST and DST (each group; n = 4) were measured. During in vivo porcine laparoscopic surgery, we performed and evaluated the feasibility of L-SST. RESULTS After completing the anastomosis with L-SST, the ligated portion using SurgiTie™ was completely removed. The stump closed using SurgiTie™ was much stronger than that closed using a stapler (131.2 and 25.6 mmHg, respectively; P = 0.01). The average burst pressure of the anastomoses performed with L-SST was 33.8 mmHg, whereas that performed with DST was 30.5 mmHg. We did not find significant difference between these two groups (P = 0.88). We also confirmed the feasibility of L-SST in an in vivo porcine laparoscopic surgery model. CONCLUSION We developed a novel SST, the L-SST. We were able to perform L-SST successfully using an ex vivo porcine rectum and during in vivo porcine laparoscopic surgery.","Takeyama, Hiroshi; Yamamoto, Hirofumi; Hata, Taishi; Takahashi, Yusuke; Ohtsuka, Masahisa; Nonaka, Ryoji; Inoue, Akira; Naito, Atsushi; Matsumura, Tae; Uemura, Mamoru; Nishimura, Junichi; Takemasa, Ichiro; Mizushima, Tsunekazu; Doki, Yuichiro; Mori, Masaki",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3960-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480605/,413

Looking beyond this disrepute, this study proposes that nursing renew its attention to classical philosophy. Specifically, it invites a close reading of Xenophon's Anabasis and Plato's Meno, to get three related goals: to show how the use of ancient texts are very valuable tools for the philosophical initiation of nursing students and can help them reflect on their choice of nursing as a practical activity; to reflect on the problem of virtue and the nature of the good life; and to show how the interaction with ancient texts allows students to reflect on questions and issues of life, theirs and others, that are not open to investigation through a purely scientific method. Consequently, both Anabasis and Meno readings strengthen the intellectual relationship between philosophy and nursing, enabling the latter to delve deeper into the key questions of its own thought as a discipline.","Gonzalez-Sanz, Juan D",Nursing philosophy : an international journal for healthcare professionals,https://doi.org/10.1111/nup.12313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32705753/,413

METHODS This institutional ethical board-approved study included 92 patients (mean age, 59 ± 17 years; 57 men, 35 women) with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for COVID-19 infection who underwent noncontrast chest CT. Two radiologists evaluated all chest CT examinations and recorded opacity type, distribution, and extent of lobar involvement. Information on symptom duration before hospital admission, the period of hospital admission, presence of comorbid conditions, laboratory data, and outcomes (recovery or death) was obtained from the medical records. The entire lung volume was segmented on thin-section Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine images to derive whole-lung radiomics. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression with receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (AUC) as the output. RESULTS Computed tomography radiomics (AUC, 0.99) outperformed clinical variables (AUC, 0.89) for prediction of the extent of pulmonary opacities related to COVID-19 pneumonia. Type of pulmonary opacities could be predicted with CT radiomics (AUC, 0.77) but not with clinical or laboratory data (AUC, <0.56; P > 0.05). Prediction of patient outcome with radiomics (AUC, 0.85) improved to an AUC of 0.90 with the addition of clinical variables (patient age and duration of presenting symptoms before admission). Among clinical variables, the combination of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation on hospital admission, duration of symptoms, platelet counts, and patient age provided an AUC of 0.81 for predicting patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Radiomics from noncontrast CT reliably predict disease severity (AUC, 0.99) and outcome (AUC, 0.85) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Babaei, Rosa; Karimi Mobin, Hadi; Arru, Chiara D; Sharifian, Maedeh; Mohseni, Iman; Zhang, Eric; Digumarthy, Subba R; Kalra, Mannudeep K",Journal of computer assisted tomography,https://doi.org/10.1097/rct.0000000000001094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842058/,413

Data Sources A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Library databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Study Selection Two investigators independently screened and included studies against predetermined criteria. Data Extraction One investigator extracted data with review by a second investigator. A narrative analyses approach was used. Data Synthesis A total of 2,610 articles were identified, leaving 68 studies for inclusion. Post-PICU/hospital discharge scores show that PICU survivors report difficulties in physical functioning during and years after PICU stay. Although sustained improvements in the long-term have been reported, most of the reported levels were lower compared with the reference and baseline values. Decreased physical functioning was associated with longer hospital stay and presence of comorbidities. A diversity of instruments was used in which mobility and self-care were mostly addressed. CONCLUSIONS The results show that children perceive moderate to severe difficulties in physical functioning during and years after PICU stay. Longitudinal assessments during and after PICU stay should be incorporated, especially for children with a higher risk for poor functional outcomes. There is need for consensus on the most suitable methods to assess physical functioning in children admitted to the PICU.","Bossen, Daniël; de Boer, Rosa M; Knoester, Hendrika; Maaskant, Jolanda M; van der Schaaf, Marike; Alsem, Mattijs W; Gemke, Reinoud J B J; van Woensel, Job B M; Oosterlaan, Jaap; Engelbert, Raoul H H",Critical care explorations,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151283/,413

Herein, we investigated policies for advancing the development of pediatric medical devices in Japan and the United States. Considering the achievements of each policy, we proposed a strategy to promote further development of pediatric medical devices in Japan. We investigated policies for supporting the development of pediatric medical devices and approved cases in Japan and the United States by searching contents of websites of regulatory bodies and other related administrations, and scientific papers. We found the main six policies in Japan and nine main policies in the United States for the development of pediatric medical devices. In the United States, various measures have initiated mainly in the 2000s, while in Japan, the main measures have been in place since 2013. Similarities were found in both countries, such as subsidies for application fees and research and development expenses, exemption of requirements for regulatory approval, and priority review and consultation by the regulatory body. Our study revealed that there are similarities in initiatives by both countries. To promote further development of pediatric medical devices in the future, improvements to expediting the review process to approval by the regulatory body, global development, and implementation of alternative measures to ensure the efficacy and safety of the device instead of large-scale clinical trials should be anticipated through cooperation among industry, government, and academia.","Takahashi, Sara; Iwasaki, Kiyotaka; Shirato, Haruki; Ho, Mami; Umezu, Mitsuo",Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10047-020-01216-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079285/,413

Depending on the control group used, cytokines have been found to be higher, similar or even lower in COVID-19 compared to critical illnesses associated with elevated cytokine concentrations. However, most of these studies do not take into account critical illness severity. Hence, we decided to compare cytokine levels in critically-ill COVID-19 patients and critically-ill patients of a general intensive care unit (ICU), who did not have sepsis or septic shock, but had an equal disease severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured on ICU admission in mechanically ventilated, COVID-19 (N=36) and non-COVID-19 (N=30) patients, who had not received dexamethasone, and had equal critical illness severity. Non-COVID-19 patients did not have sepsis or septic shock. RESULTS In our case control study, circulating IL-6 and IL-10 were lower, while TNF-α and IL-8 levels were higher in critically-ill COVID-19 patients, compared to critically-ill non-COVID-19 patients.

These findings have been attributed to factors such as inexperienced operators, prolonged intubation times and other airway related complications. As an initial step to examine outcomes of advanced airway placement during in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), where immediate assistance and experienced operators are continuously available, we examined whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts affect intubation difficulty. Additionally, we examined whether or not the use of videolaryngoscopy increases the odds of first attempt intubation success compared with traditional direct laryngoscopy. METHODS The study setting is a large urban university-affiliated teaching hospital where experienced airway managers are available to perform emergent intubation for any indication in any out-of-the-operating room location 24 hours a day, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year. Intubations occurring in all adults >18 years-of-age who required emergent tracheal intubation outside of the operating room between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012 were examined retrospectively. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of difficult intubation during IHCA compared to other emergent non-IHCA indications with adjustment for a priori defined potential confounders (body mass index, operator experience, use of videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy, and age). RESULTS In adjusted analyses, the odds of difficult intubation were higher when taking place during IHCA (OR=2.63; 95% CI 1.1-6.3, p=0.03) compared to other emergent indications. Use of video versus direct laryngoscopy for initial intubation attempts during IHCA, however, did not improve the odds of success (adjusted OR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.35-1.43, p = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS Difficult intubation is more likely when intubation takes place during IHCA compared to other emergent indications, even when experienced operators are available. Under these conditions, direct laryngoscopy (versus videolaryngoscopy) remains a reasonable first choice intubation technique.","Khandelwal, Nita; Galgon, Richard E; Ali, Marwan; Joffe, Aaron M",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2253-14-38; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24904233/,413

Making a diagnosis of HP and identifying a cause are challenging. Cryptogenic cases are frequently reported, and missing or incomplete exposure histories can cause misclassification. AIMS To provide an evidence-based compendium of sources of exposure and causes of HP for the clinician, through systematic review of medical literature. METHODS Articles related to HP causative agents and occupational exposure were searched from the databases OVID Medline (1946 to October 2020) and EMBASE (1974 to October 2020). Abstracts and full texts of articles were screened by two reviewers. Data on causative antigens, occupational source of exposure and any associated eponymous name were extracted and grouped according to source of exposure. RESULTS A total of 1790 articles were identified, from which 305 articles met the inclusion criteria. An additional 22 articles were identified from citation lists of the selected review articles. Sources of exposure identified for HP were sorted into 14 categories of work (agricultural, plant matter processing, wood, animal-related, foodstuff, food processing, metal processing, polymers, other manufacturing, chemicals, aerosolized water, service, waste and sewage and wind instruments).

When physicians move between differing practice environments learners may encounter situations for which they are unprepared. Using a conceptual framework specific to the LE, we therefore asked the following research question: what is the difference in LE for Navy emergency medicine (EM) physicians who practice in U.S. hospitals but serve an operational environment, and how do these differences shape their learning needs? Methods We interviewed Navy EM physicians who recently deployed to explore their perceptions of the deployed LE, how it differed from the LE they practice in stateside, and the perceived effect this difference had on their learning needs. We used the constant comparative method to gather and analyze data until thematic saturation was achieved. Results We interviewed 12 physicians and identified six interconnected themes consistent with the LE framework in the literature: 1) patient care is central to the learning experience; 2) professional isolation versus connectedness; 3) a sense of meaningful practice engages the learner in the LE; 4) physicians as educators shape the LE; 5) team trust impacts the LE; and 6) the larger military organization impacts the LE. Conclusions Our themes span the conceptual framework put forth by previous work and did not find themes outside this framework. These interconnected themes describe the difference in LE between the stateside and deployed setting and impact the learning needs of Navy EM physicians. These results inform strategies to position the deployed medical unit for success.","Hurst, Nicole D; Durning, Steven J; Cervero, Ronald M; Morrison Ponce, Daphne",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041430/,413

Studies investigating underlying immune characteristics are needed to understand disease pathogenesis and inform vaccine design. In this study, we examined immune cell subsets in hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals. In hospitalized patients, many adaptive and innate immune cells were decreased in frequency compared to healthy and convalescent individuals, with the exception of B lymphocytes which increased. Our findings show increased frequencies of T-cell activation markers (CD69, Ox40, HLA-DR and CD154) in hospitalized patients, with other T-cell activation/exhaustion markers (CD25, PD-L1 and TIGIT) remaining elevated in hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals. B cells had a similar pattern of activation/exhaustion, with increased frequency of CD69 and CD95 during hospitalization, followed by an increase in PD1 frequencies in non-hospitalized individuals. Interestingly, many of these changes were found to increase over time in non-hospitalized longitudinal samples, suggesting a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in T-cell activation/exhaustion in non-hospitalized patients were found to positively correlate with age. Severely infected individuals had increased expression of activation and exhaustion markers. These data suggest a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighting the need for additional studies investigating immune dysregulation in convalescent individuals.","Files, Jacob K; Boppana, Sushma; Perez, Mildred D; Sarkar, Sanghita; Lowman, Kelsey E; Qin, Kai; Sterrett, Sarah; Carlin, Eric; Bansal, Anju; Sabbaj, Steffanie; Long, Dustin M; Kutsch, Olaf; Kobie, James; Goepfert, Paul; Erdmann, Nathaniel",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci140491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119547/,413

144288,It Has Been Quite a Year-And the USASP Was Born.,2020,": Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 6 million patients worldwide. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been increasingly recognized complication in these patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the factors associated with development of DVT in patients with COVID-19 have not been elucidated due to the novelty of the virus. We performed a meta-analysis of published studies comparing laboratory results in COVID-19 patients with and without DVT with the aim of identifying risk factors. We searched major databases for studies evaluating DVT in COVID-positive patients and performed a meta-analysis of baseline laboratory markers associated with development of DVT. A total of six studies with 678 patients were included in the pooled analyses. Of the 678 patients, 205 of patients had a DVT. Patients diagnosed with DVT were more likely to be older [mean difference 4.59 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-7.92], and needing admission to ICU (relative risk 1.96, 95% CI 1.09-3.51). Patients with DVT had significantly higher white cell count (mean difference 1.36 × 10/l, 95% CI 0.33-2.40) and D-dimer levels (mean difference 3229.8, 95% CI 1501.5-4958.1). Lymphocyte count was lower in patients with DVT (mean difference -0.19 × 10/l, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.02). Patients with COVID-19 who develop DVT are more likely to be older and have leukocytosis with lymphopenia. Moreover, D-dimer is statistically higher and patients that are admitted to the ICU are at great risk to develop DVT.","Loomba, Rohit S; Aggarwal, Gaurav; Villarreal, Enrique G; Farias, Juan S; Flores, Saul; Lavie, Carl J; Aggarwal, Saurabh",Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,https://doi.org/10.1097/mbc.0000000000000974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196516/,413
144495,Cognitive Fatigability Interventions in Neurological Conditions: A Systematic Review.,2019,"OBJECTIVE To describe the challenges related to COVID-19 affecting pediatric neuropsychologists practicing in inpatient brain injury rehabilitation settings, and offer solutions focused on face-to-face care and telehealth. METHODS A group of pediatric neuropsychologists from 12 pediatric rehabilitation units in North America and 2 in South America have met regularly since COVID-19 stay-at-home orders were initiated in many parts of the world. This group discussed challenges to clinical care and collaboratively problem-solvedsolutions. RESULTS Three primary challenges to usual carewere identified, these include difficulty providing 1) neurobehavioral and cognitive assessments; 2) psychoeducation for caregivers and rapport building; and 3) return to academic instruction and home. Solutions during the pandemic for the first two areas focus on the varying service provision models that include 1) face-to-face care with personal protective equipment (PPE) and social distancing and 2) provision of care via remote methods, with a focus on telehealth. During the pandemic,neuropsychologists generally combine components of both the face-to-face and remote care models. Solutions to the final challenge focus on issues specific to returning to academic instruction and home after an inpatient stay. CONCLUSIONS By considering components of in-person and telehealth models of patient care during the pandemic, neuropsychologists successfully serve patients within the rehabilitation setting, as well as the patient's family who may be limited in their ability to be physically present due to childcare, illness, work-related demands, or hospital restrictions.","Koterba, Christine H; Baum, Katherine T; Hamner, Taralee; Busch, Tyler A; Davis, Kimberly C; Tlustos-Carter, Sarah; Howarth, Robyn; Fournier-Goodnight, Ashley; Kramer, Megan; Landry, Allisen; O'Neill, Jilian; Cass, Jennifer; Wilson, Camille; Slomine, Beth S",The Clinical neuropsychologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1811892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847476/,413

This article looks at walking while conducting psychotherapy with patients and explores the ways in which flexibility in treatment can enhance the alliance, how walking side by side brings the body into focus with its implications for transference and countertransference, and how associations to landscape evoke past memories and access emotions. Issues relating to self-disclosure and boundaries, as well as patient responses to the psychotherapist's personally driven request to consider walking during psychotherapy are addressed. Since writing this article, the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the world and required psychotherapists everywhere to bend the frame of treatment and meet with patients virtually-by phone or video conference-to maintain social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. The hardships posed by this shift in treatment frame combine with benefits not dissimilar to those found with psychotherapy while walking.","Schen, Cathy R",Psychodynamic psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1521/pdps.2020.48.3.295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32996851/,413

In children respiratory tract infections (RTI) are the most common reason for consultation with primary care. Understanding which features are associated with good and poor prognosis with RTI will help develop interventions to support parents manage illness. AIM To identify symptoms, signs, and investigation results associated with good and poor prognosis, and clinical decision making in children aged 1-12 years with RTI symptoms, at home and presenting to ambulatory care. DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic literature review. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, Web of Science and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews for studies of children aged 1 to 12 years with a RTI or related condition reporting symptoms, signs and investigation results associated with prognostic outcomes. Quality was assessed using the QUIPS tool. RESULTS We included 27 studies which included 34802 children and measured 192 factors. Nine studies explored future outcomes and the remainder explored clinical management from the initial consultation with the health services. None were conducted in a home setting. Respiratory signs, vomiting, fever, dehydration and tachycardia at the initial contact were associated with future hospitalisation. Little evidence was available for other outcomes. CONCLUSION Some evidence is available to clinicians to stratify risk of, future hospitalisation, but not of other prognostic outcomes. There is little evidence available to parents to identify children at risk of poor prognosis. Research is needed into whether poor prognosis can be predicted by parents in the home.","Edwards, George; Newbould, Louise; Nesbitt, Charlotte; Rogers, Miranda; Morris, Rebecca L; Hay, Alastair D; Campbell, Stephen M; Hayward, Gail",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872323/,413
147092,"Insulin Use, Diabetes Control, and Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19.",2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND Perioperative hemorrhage and postoperative bile leakage are severe complications of liver surgery. They may be related to the techniques used to divide the tissue. We designed a randomized clinical trial to compare the cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) and an endoscopic stapler device applied in routine clinical hepatic surgical practice. METHODS All consecutive patients admitted for elective hepatic resective surgery--at least bisegmentectomy of the liver--were assessed for enrollment in the study. A total of 100 patients were subsequently randomized. There was a good balance between the study groups concerning issues that may be of relevance for the perioperative and postoperative courses. The primary objective of the study was to achieve an approximately 25 % reduction in perioperative blood loss and postoperative bile leakage. Secondary outcome variables were operating time, general postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay, and direct medical costs. RESULTS The amount of perioperative or postoperative blood loss did not differ significantly between the two groups. We observed a trend toward shorter transection and operating time for patients in whom staplers were used, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The postoperative courses were close to identical in the respective study arms with no difference in bile leakage rates or in the total morbidity profiles. The direct medical costs were nonsignificantly lower in the group where staplers were used for liver transection. CONCLUSIONS The results show that the use of endoscopic vascular staplers in liver surgery is feasible and safe. It offers an attractive alternative for division of the liver parenchyma during routine hepatic surgery, being comparable to the use of CUSA without adding extra costs.","Savlid, Mats; Strand, Angelica Horna; Jansson, Anders; Agustsson, Thorhallur; Söderdahl, Gunnar; Lundell, Lars; Isaksson, Bengt",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-012-1884-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23254945/,413
147289,A Systematic Review of Cognitive Function in Adults with Spina Bifida.,2021-04-19,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES The need for social distancing has resulted in rapid restructuring of medical student education in radiology. While students traditionally spend time learning in the reading room, remote clinical learning requires material shared without direct teaching at the radiology workstation. Can remote clinical learning meet or exceed the educational value of the traditional in-person learning experience? Can student engagement be matched or exceeded in a remote learning environment? MATERIALS AND METHODS To replace the in-person reading room experience, a small-group learning session for medical students named Virtual Read-Out (VRO) was developed using teleconferencing software. After Institutional Review Board approval, two student groups were anonymously surveyed to assess differences in student engagement and perceived value between learning environments: ""Conventional"" students participating in the reading room (before the pandemic) and ""Remote"" students participating in VRO sessions. Students reported perceived frequency of a series of five-point Likert statements. Based on number of respondents, an independent t-test was performed to determine the significance of results between two groups. RESULTS Twenty-seven conventional and 41 remote students responded. Remote students reported modest but significantly higher frequency of active participation in reviewing radiology exams (p < 0.05). There was significantly lower frequency of reported boredom among Remote students (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in perceived educational value between the two groups. CONCLUSION Students report a high degree of teaching quality, clinical relevance, and educational value regardless of remote or in-person learning format. Remote clinical radiology education can be achieved with equal or greater student interaction and perceived value in fewer contact hours than conventional learning in the reading room.","Alpert, Jeffrey B; Young, Matthew G; Lala, Shailee V; McGuinness, Georgeann",Academic radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2020.09.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33268209/,413

Saudi Arabia has the largest reported number of cases so far. Like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), MERS is caused by a coronavirus. Combination therapy with interferon-α2b and ribavirin has been used successfully as primary treatment and prophylaxis in SARS. Because of similarities between the two coronaviruses, treatment with ribavarin and interferon-α2b has been suggested as a potential therapy for MERS-CoV. Studies in animal models of MERS-CoV have shown the combination of ribavirin and interferon-α2b to be effective both as primary treatment and prophylaxis. In this report, we describe for the first time use of this combination as a primary treatment for a patient with MERS-CoV infection and as prophylaxis for his spouse and discuss its possible role.","Khalid, Mohammed; Al Rabiah, Fahad; Khan, Basha; Al Mobeireek, Abdullah; Butt, Taimur S; Al Mutairy, Eid",Antiviral therapy,https://doi.org/10.3851/imp2792; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831606/,413

It is feasible to think about the use of telerehabilitation devices, such as the smartphone, to respond to the growing demand, even in isolation cases, such as during confinement due to coronavirus disease in 2020. It is intended to explore the available Apps for Spanish-speaking patients with Stroke for a specific sensory-motor rehabilitation process. MATERIALS AND METHODS A search of the available apps in Google Play and Apple Store was carried out using the keywords ""Stroke"", ""hemiplegia"" and ""hemiparesis"". The Apps detected have been described and evaluated by an anonymous survey among stroke survivors. RESULTS Nine Apps have been identified and explored, four of which are available in Spanish: ""NeuroRHB"", ""Stroke Hope Health4TheWorld"", ""9zest stroke recovery"" and ""Farmalarm"". Twelve survivors with stroke have participated in the anonymous survey evaluating with the best score the App ""Farmalarm"". CONCLUSIONS There are few specific Apps for the Stroke rehabilitation of sensory-motor impairments, and with important limitations that prevent their incorporation into clinical practice. The creation and adaptation of Apps for health professionals such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists and their users are recommended. Implications for rehabilitation It is necessary to create and adapt specific telerehabilitation tools to address sensory-motor disorders. Telerehabilitation should be introduced in the clinical practice of physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Telerehabilitation via App can be a solution, easily accessible by patients, to reduce healthcare inequality, intensify the rehabilitation process and provide continuity after discharge from the hospital.","Salgueiro, Carina; Urrùtia, Gerard; Cabanas-Valdés, Rosa",Disability and rehabilitation.

METHODS Prospective cohort of 45 women with symptomatic POP recruited between January and December 2010 who self-selected surgery group: group A (n = 15), sacral laparoscopic hysteropexy was performed and group B (n = 30), laparoscopically conducted subtotal hysterectomy plus cervicopexy. All patients had a positive answer in the ""Epidemiology of prolapse and incontinence"" questionnaire (EPIQ, question number 35) and also had a POPQ ≥2nd degree. The primary outcome was the subjective success rate, measured by a negative answer to the Q35 of EPIQ: ""Do you have a sensation that there is bulge in vagina or that something is falling out from your vagina"" and also by rating their symptoms improvement by the ""Patient Global Impression of Improvement"". The secondary outcome was the objective success rate assessed by pelvic examination: cure was considered when POPQ <2nd degree in all vaginal compartments at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS Baseline demographic characteristics were similar between groups. Subjective success rate was significantly superior in group B both after 6 and 12 months (P = 0.001). Similarly, objective pelvic examination led to a significantly higher rate of successful apical outcome in group B after 6 and 12 months (P = 0.009 and P = 0.002, respectively). Neither major complications nor vaginal mesh erosions were registered. CONCLUSIONS The overall success rate was significantly higher in the laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy plus cervicopexy group, compared with the laparoscopic sacral hysteropexy group.","Gracia, Meritxell; Perelló, Maria; Bataller, Eduardo; Espuña, Montserrat; Parellada, Montserrat; Genís, Dolores; Balasch, Joan; Carmona, Francisco",Neurourology and urodynamics,https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.22641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975722/,413

PATIENTS AND METHODS This study included 227 patients who underwent transperitoneal RAPN for anterior or posterior renal tumors. Tumor position was defined by RENAL nephrometry score. To minimize selection bias between anterior and posterior tumors, patient variables were adjusted using 1:1 propensity score matching. RESULTS Of the 227 patients, 125 were classified as having anterior tumors and 102 as having posterior tumors. After matching, 82 patients were included in each group. The mean preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 66 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean tumor size was 28 to 29 mm. The decrease in early postoperative nadir eGFR (-10% vs -4.0%, p = 0.0103) was significantly higher for posterior tumors than for anterior tumors. However, the difference improved 6 to 12 months after surgery (-6.0% vs -6.2%, p = 0.9564). The other surgical outcomes, including operative time, warm ischemia time (WIT), complications, surgical margin status, and length of hospital stay, were not significantly different between the two groups. In multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, posterior tumors (vs anterior tumor, odds ratio [OR]: 2.30, p = 0.0051), longer WIT (OR: 3.10, p = 0.0019), and high tumor complexity (vs low complexity, OR: 3.46, p = 0.0264) were independent predictors for development of a 10% decrease in early postoperative eGFR. CONCLUSIONS Posterior tumors had a greater decrease in early postoperative nadir eGFR than anterior tumors, with equivalent surgical outcomes, including similar renal function, 6 to 12 months after surgery in the setting of transperitoneal RAPN.","Takagi, Toshio; Kondo, Tsunenori; Yoshida, Kazuhiko; Kobayashi, Hirohito; Iizuka, Junpei; Okumi, Masayoshi; Ishida, Hideki; Tanabe, Kazunari",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2017.0654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29092632/,413

METHODS Reddit is a popular and growing social media platform, providing a large, publicly available dataset necessary for high performance of machine learning and topic modeling techniques. We used opioid-related ""subreddits,"" communities where Reddit users engage in conversations about drug use, to examine COVID-19-related content of posts and comments from March to May 2020. This paper investigates the latent topics of users' posts/comments using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, an unsupervised machine learning approach that uncovers the thematic structure of a document collection. We also examine how topics changed over time. RESULTS The final dataset consists of 525 posts and 9284 comments, for a total of 9809 posts/comments (3756 posts/comments in r/opiates, 1641 in r/OpiatesRecovery, 1203 in r/suboxone, and 3209 in r/Methadone) among 2342 unique individuals. There were 5256 posts/comments in March; 3185 in April; and 1368 in May (until May 22). Topics that appeared most frequently in COVID-19-related discussions included medication for opioid use disorder experiences and access issues (22.6%), recovery (24.2%), and drug withdrawal (20.2%). CONCLUSIONS During the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, people who use drugs were impacted in several ways, including forced or intentional withdrawal, confusion between withdrawal and COVID-19 symptoms, take-home medication for opioid use disorder issues, and barriers to recovery. As the pandemic progresses, providers and policymakers should consider these experiences among people who use drugs during the early stage of the pandemic.","El-Bassel, Nabila; Hochstatter, Karli R; Slavin, Melissa N; Yang, Chenghao; Zhang, Yudong; Muresan, Smaranda",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145186/,413

Suicide is a serious health problem that is shaped by a variety of social and mental health factors. A growing body of research connects the arts to positive health outcomes; however, no previous systematic reviews have examined the use of the arts in suicide prevention and survivorship. This review examined how the arts have been used to address suicide prevention and survivorship in nonclinical settings in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Design and Setting. Ten bibliographic databases, five research repositories, and reference sections of articles were searched to identify published studies. Articles presenting outcomes of interventions conducted between 2014 and 2019 and written in English, were included. Primary Results. Nine studies met inclusion criteria, including qualitative, quantitative randomized controlled trials, quantitative nonrandomized, quantitative descriptive, and mixed-methods studies. The programs studied used film and television (n = 3), mixed-arts (n = 3), theatre (n = 2), and quilting (n = 1). All nine interventions used the arts to elicit emotional involvement, while seven also used the arts to encourage engagement with themes of health. Study outcomes included increased self-efficacy, awareness of mental health issues, and likelihood for taking action to prevent suicide, as well as decreases in suicidal risk and self-harming behaviors. Conclusions. Factors that influence suicide risk and survivorship may be effectively addressed through arts-based interventions. While the current evidence is promising with regard to the potential for arts programs to positively affect suicide prevention and survivorship, this evidence needs to be supplemented to inform recommendations for evidence-based arts interventions.","Sonke, Jill; Sams, Kelley; Morgan-Daniel, Jane; Pumariega, Andres; Mallick, Faryal; Pesata, Virginia; Olsen, Nicola",Health promotion practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839921996350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942639/,413

Preserving nerve integrity, to prevent progressive nerve damage, remains a clinical challenge. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are implicated in the development and maintenance of healthy nerves and may be beneficial for promoting peripheral nerve health. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effects of oral omega-3 PUFA supplementation on peripheral nerve integrity, including both subjective and objective measures of peripheral nerve structure and/or function. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of randomised controlled trials that have evaluated the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on peripheral nerve assessments will be conducted. Comprehensive electronic database searches will be performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), US National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The title, abstract and keywords of identified articles will be assessed for eligibility by two reviewers. Full-text articles will be obtained for all studies judged as eligible or potentially eligible; these studies will be independently assessed by two reviewers to determine eligibility. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus. Risk of bias assessment will be performed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool to appraise the quality of included studies. If clinically meaningful, and there are a sufficient number of eligible studies, a meta-analysis will be conducted and a summary of findings table will be provided. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This is a systematic review that will involve the analysis of previously published data, and therefore ethics approval is not required.

155216,Cortical neurophysiology of primary isolated dystonia and non-dystonic adults: a meta-analysis.,2020-09-29,"INTRODUCTION Plant-made virus-like particles (VLP) bearing influenza virus hemagglutinins (HA) are novel vaccine candidates that induce cross-reactive humoral and poly-functional T cell responses. To better understand the mechanisms that underlie this broad immunogenicity we studied early interactions of VLPs bearing either H1 (A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)) or H5 (A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1)) with a human monocytoid cell line (U-937 cells) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) as model antigen-presenting cells (APC). METHODS AND RESULTS Using Vibrio cholerae sialidase and lectins that target α2,6- (Sambucus nigra lectin) or α2,3-linked sialic acids (Maackia amurensis lectin I), we demonstrated that VLPs bind to these APCs in a sialic acid-dependent manner. Using lysosomal markers and DiD-labelled VLPs, we found that attachment to the cell surface leads to internalization, trafficking to acidic cell compartments and fusion of the VLP lipid envelope with endosomal membranes. Incubation of MDMs with H1- but not H5-VLPs induced proliferation of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggesting antigen processing and stimulation of a memory T cell response. CONCLUSIONS Plant-made VLPs bearing influenza HA not only mimic the structure of influenza virions to some degree but also recapitulate key features of the initial virus-APC interaction. These observations may help to explain the balanced humoral and cellular responses to plant-made VLP vaccines.","Makarkov, Alexander I; Chierzi, Sabrina; Pillet, Stéphane; Murai, Keith K; Landry, Nathalie; Ward, Brian J",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.07.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712489/,413
155219,Prognostic factors for change in memory test performance after memory training in healthy older adults: a systematic review and outline of statistical challenges.,2020,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS Small intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) is a frequent, potentially life threatening phenomenon. There is a lack of non-invasive diagnostic modalities. For many intestinal diseases, visualizing the intestinal mucosa using endoscopy is gold standard. However, limited knowledge exists on small intestinal IR-induced, early mucosal changes. The aims of this study were to investigate endoscopic changes in human jejunum exposed to IR, and to study concordance between endoscopic appearance and histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS In 23 patients a part of jejunum, to be removed for surgical reasons, was isolated and selectively exposed to ischemia with 0, 30 or 120 minutes of reperfusion. In 3 patients, a videocapsule was inserted in the isolated segment before exposure to IR, to visualize the mucosa. Endoscopic view at several time points was related to histology (Heamatoxylin & Eosin) obtained from 20 patients. RESULTS Ischemia was characterized by loss of villous structure, mucosal whitening and appearance of punctate lesions. This was related to appearance of subepithelial spaces and breaches in the epithelial lining in the histological view. Early during reperfusion, the lumen filled with IR-damaged, shed cells and VCE showed mucosal erosions, hemorrhage and intraluminal debris. At 60 minutes of reperfusion, the only remaining signs of IR were loss of villous structure and small erosions, indicating rapid mucosal healing. CONCLUSIONS This study shows a unique, real-time in vivo endoscopic view of early mucosal changes during IR of the human small intestine. Future studies should evaluate its usefulness in diagnosis of patients suspected of IR.","Grootjans, Joep; Hameeteman, Wim; Masclee, Ad A; van Dam, Ronald M; Buurman, Wim A; Dejong, Cornelis H C",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0039638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22745799/,413
155837,Efficacy and safety of sacubitril/valsartan in the treatment of heart failure: protocol for a systematic review incorporating unpublished clinical study reports.,2020,"BACKGROUND Synovial Sarcomas (SS) are rare tumors occurring predominantly in adolescent and young adults with a dismal prognosis in advanced phases. We report a first-in-human phase I of monoclonal antibody (OTSA-101) targeting FZD10, overexpressed in most SS but not present in normal tissues, labelled with radioisotopes and used as a molecular vehicle to specifically deliver radiation to FZD10 expressing SS lesions. METHODS Patients with progressive advanced SS were included. In the first step of this trial, OTSA-101 in vivo bio-distribution and lesions uptake were evaluated by repeated whole body planar and SPECT-CT scintigraphies from H1 till H144 after IV injection of 187 MBq of 111In-OTSA-101. A 2D dosimetry study also evaluated the liver absorbed dose when using 90Y-OTSA-101. In the second step, those patients with significant tumor uptake were randomized between 370 MBq (Arm A) and 1110 MBq (Arm B) of 90Y-OTSA-101 for radionuclide therapy. RESULTS From January 2012 to June 2015, 20 pts. (median age 43 years [21-67]) with advanced SS were enrolled. Even though 111In-OTSA-101 liver uptake appeared to be intense, estimated absorbed liver dose was less than 20 Gy for each patient. Tracer intensity was greater than mediastinum in 10 patients consistent with sufficient tumor uptake to proceed to treatment with 90Y-OTSA-101: 8 were randomized (Arm A: 3 patients and Arm B: 5 patients) and 2 were not randomized due to worsening PS. The most common Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reversible hematological disorders, which were more frequent in Arm B. No objective response was observed. Best response was stable disease in 3/8 patients lasting up to 21 weeks for 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS Radioimmunotherapy targeting FZD10 is feasible in SS patients as all patients presented at least one lesion with 111In-OTSA-101 uptake. Tumor uptake was heterogeneous but sufficient to select 50% of pts. for 90Y-OTSA-101 treatment. The recommended activity for further clinical investigations is 1110 MBq of 90Y-OTSA-101. However, because of hematological toxicity, less energetic particle emitter radioisopotes such as Lutetium 177 may be a better option to wider the therapeutic index.

156550,Overview of prognostic factors in adult gliomas.,2020-08-06,"PURPOSE Lidocaine patch 5% is recommended as a first-line therapy for postherpetic neuralgia pain in neuropathic pain guidelines. Postherpetic neuralgia can occur anywhere on the body but often follows acute herpes zoster occurring in trigeminal and brachial plexus dermatomes. An analysis was conducted to determine whether the anatomic location of lidocaine patch 5% is associated with variations in effectiveness or tolerability in patients with postherpetic neuralgia. METHODS This was a post hoc analysis by anatomic site of patch placement (head [including neck], trunk [chest, abdomen, back, hips], and extremities [arm, leg]) of a 4-week, multicenter, open-label study that enrolled patients with persistent pain following herpes zoster infection. Effectiveness was measured by Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average pain intensity (0 [no pain] to 10 [worst imaginable pain]) and the BPI subscale for pain relief (0% [no relief] to 100% [complete relief]). Tolerability was assessed on the basis of patient-reported adverse events. RESULTS Of 332 enrolled patients (59.6% women [n = 198]; 92.5% white [n = 307]; mean [standard deviation] age, 71.2 [13.9] years), those (n = 203) who applied lidocaine patch 5% to a single anatomic site only and had baseline and postbaseline pain score data were analyzed (trunk, n = 130; head, n = 41; extremities, n = 32). The frequency of adverse events differed significantly by anatomic location, with significantly more adverse events reported with patch placement on the head versus the extremities (P = 0.006) or trunk (P = 0.02). BPI average pain improved significantly from baseline in each of the three anatomic areas (mean score decrease, 1.50-2.04; P ≤ 0.002), with no significant difference in effectiveness by patch location. CONCLUSION Lidocaine 5% patch was effective and generally well tolerated for each anatomic area evaluated, although application to the head was tolerated less well compared with the trunk and extremities.","Nalamachu, Srinivas; Wieman, Matthew; Bednarek, Leah; Chitra, Surya",Patient preference and adherence,https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s42643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23814464/,413

Unfortunately, BSA is difficult to quantify, and existing prediction methods are not optimized for contemporary populations. METHODS The present study analyzed data body measurements from 5603 male and female participants of a US Army Anthropometric Survey to determine optimal methods for estimating BSA in modern US Army Soldiers. This data included 94 individual body measurements as well as three dimensional (3D) whole body scans for each participant. We used this data to assess and compared 15 existing equations to the measured data. We also derived best fitting nonlinear regression models for estimating BSA from different combinations of sex, height, and weight and iteratively included the remaining 91 measurements to determine which combinations resulted in the highest goodness-of-fit. RESULTS We found that inclusion of armspan measurements as a third body dimension maximized the model goodness-of-fit. CONCLUSION Some of the existing formulae provide reasonable estimates of 3D-scanner derived BSA; while our new formulae derived from this study allows for more accurate estimates of BSA using one or more common input variables.","Looney, David P; Sanford, Diana P; Li, Peng; Santee, William R; Doughty, Elizabeth M; Potter, Adam W",Journal of thermal biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888557/,413

158304,Impact of a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown on acute coronary syndrome referrals.,2020-07-09,"The second and third waves of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have hit the world. Even after more than a year, the economy is yet to return to a semblance of normality. The conference/meeting room is one of the critical sections of offices that might be difficult not to use. This study analyzes the distribution of the virus-laden droplets expelled by coughing inside a conference room, the effect of ventilation rates, and their positioning. The efficacy of masks is studied to get quantitative information regarding the residence time of the droplets. The effects of evaporation, turbulent dispersion, and external forces have been considered for calculating the droplets' trajectories. We have analyzed six cases, of which two are with masks. Change in the ventilation rate from four air changes per hour (ACH) to eight resulted in a 9 % increment in the number of droplets entrained in the outlet vent, while their average residence time was reduced by ∼ 8 s . The shift in the vents' location has significantly altered droplets' distribution inside a conference room. It results in ∼ 1.5 % of the injected droplets reaching persons sitting across the table, and a similar indoor environment is not recommended. Wearing a mask in the case of eight ACH has presented the best scenario out of the six cases, with a 6.5 % improvement in the number of droplets entrained in the outlet vent and a 9 s decrease in their average residence time compared to the case without a mask. No droplets have reached persons sitting across the table when the infected person is wearing the mask, which follows that a social distancing of 6 ft with a mask is adequate in indoor environments.","Mirikar, Dnyanesh; Palanivel, Silambarasan; Arumuru, Venugopal",Physics of fluids,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0054110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248325/,413
158401,Self-reported questionnaires for lymphoedema: a systematic review of measurement properties using COSMIN framework.,2021-01-21,"Background Chemerin is a chemokine known to be increased in morbidly obese (MO) patients and correlated with markers of inflammation and nitrooxidative stress. We aimed to evaluate the changes of serum chemerin six months after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and to asses if these changes are accompanied by variations of inflammatory and nitrooxidative stress markers. Material and Methods We investigated the levels of chemerin, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), nitrite and nitrate (NOx), total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant response (TAR), and oxidative stress index (OSI) in a group of 24 MO patients submitted to SG before and six months after surgery. The MO group was compared with 20 controls. Results hsCRP (p < 0.001), NOx (p < 0.001), TOS (p < 0.001), TAR (p = 0.007), and OSI (p = 0.001) were significantly different between the two groups. Six months after surgery, we noticed significant changes (42.28% decrease) of hsCRP (p = 0.044) and OSI (p = 0.041) (31.81% decrease), while no significant changes were observed for chemerin (p = 0.605), TNF-α (p = 0.287), NOx (p = 0.137), TOS (p = 0.158), and TAR (p = 0.563). Conclusions Our study showed no significant changes of chemerin, and except for hsCRP and OSI, no other inflammatory and nitrooxidative stress markers changed six months after surgery.","Cӑtoi, Adriana Florinela; Pârvu, Alina Elena; Mironiuc, Aurel; Chiorescu, Ştefan; Crӑciun, Alexandra; Pop, Ioana Delia; Cӑtoi, Cornel",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/1583212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29849863/,413

158806,The ethical dimension of prioritization and allocation decisions within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-05-01,"PURPOSE Mesh repair of large hiatal hernias has increasingly gained popularity to reduce recurrence rates. Integration of iron particles into the polyvinylidene fluoride mesh-based material allows for magnetic resonance visualisation (MR). METHODS In a pilot prospective case series eight patients underwent surgical repair of hiatal hernias repair with pre-shaped meshes, which were fixated with fibrin glue. An MR investigation with a qualified protocol was performed on postoperative day four and 3 months postoperatively to evaluate the correct position of the mesh by assessing mesh appearance and demarcation. The total MR-visible mesh surface area of each implant was calculated and compared with the original physical mesh size to evaluate potential reduction of the functional mesh surfaces. RESULTS We documented no mesh migrations or dislocations but we found a significant decrease of MR-visualised total mesh surface area after release of the pneumoperitoneum compared to the original mesh size (mean 78.9 vs 84 cm(2); mean reduction of mesh area = 5.1 cm(2), p < 0.001). At 3 months postoperatively, a further reduction of the mesh surface area could be observed (mean 78.5 vs 78.9 cm(2); mean reduction of mesh area = 0.4 cm(2), p < 0.037). CONCLUSION Detailed mesh depiction and accurate assessment of the surrounding anatomy could be successfully achieved in all cases. Fibrin glue seems to provide effective mesh fixation. In addition to a significant early postoperative decrease in effective mesh surface area a further reduction in size occurred within 3 months after implantation.","Köhler, G; Pallwein-Prettner, L; Lechner, M; Spaun, G O; Koch, O O; Emmanuel, K",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-015-1398-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26129921/,413

159689,A systematic review on posterior circumflex humeral artery pathology: sports and professions at risk and associated risk factors.,2019,"Despite the potential immediate access to diagnosis and care, in-hospital stroke (IHS) is associated with delay in diagnosis, lower rates of reperfusion treatment, and unfavorable outcome. Endovascular reperfusion therapy has shown promising results in recent trials for community-onset strokes (COS) and is limited by less contraindications than systemic thrombolysis. Thus, endovascular approaches may offer additional acute treatment options for IHS. We performed a retrospective, observational monocentric analysis of patients with acute ischemic stroke between January 2010 and December 2014. Out of 3506 acute ischemic strokes, 331 (9.4%) were IHS. In-hospital mortality (31.4 vs. 8.0%) and duration of stay after stroke (19.5 vs. 12.1 days) were higher in IHS than in COS. Most IHS occurred in cardiologic and cardiosurgical patients after catheterization or surgery. In 111 cases (33.5%) the time of onset could not be established as a result of sedation or delayed referral resulting in delayed symptom recognition. 52 IHS (15.7%) and 828 COS (26.0%, p < 0.001) patients received any kind of reperfusion therapy, of which 59.6% (IHS) and 12.1% (COS) comprised isolated endovascular interventions (p < 0.001). Intra-hospital delays (time to brain imaging, systemic thrombolysis, and angiography) were longer and outcome parameters (mRS d90, in-hospital mortality, length of stay) were worse in IHS, whereas rates of procedural complications and intracranial hemorrhages were similar in both groups. The overall rate of reperfusion treatment is lower in IHS compared to COS, as IHS patients are less likely to be eligible for systemic thrombolysis. Interventional stroke treatment is a safe and feasible therapeutic option for patients who are not eligible for systemic thrombolysis and should be anticipated whenever IHS is diagnosed.","Schürmann, Kolja; Nikoubashman, Omid; Falkenburger, Björn; Tauber, Simone C; Wiesmann, Martin; Schulz, Jörg B; Reich, Arno",Journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-015-8010-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26762395/,413

However, despite mass campaigns to stimulate healthy nutrition during pregnancy, the diet of Dutch pregnant women is often suboptimal. Innovative technologies offer an opportunity to develop tailored tools, which resulted in the release of various apps on healthy nutrition during pregnancy. As midwives act as primary contact for Dutch pregnant women, the goal was to explore the experiences and perspectives of midwives on (1) nutritional counselling during pregnancy, and (2) nutritional mHealth apps to support midwifery care. Analyses of eleven in-depth interviews indicated that nutritional counselling involved the referral to websites, a brochure, and an app developed by the Dutch Nutrition Centre. Midwives were aware of the existence of other nutritional mHealth apps but felt uncertain about their trustworthiness. Nevertheless, midwives were open towards the implementation of new tools providing that these are trustworthy, accessible, user-friendly, personalised, scientifically sound, and contain easy-digestible information. Midwives stressed the need for guidelines for professionals on the implementation of new tools. Involving midwives early-on in the development of future nutritional mHealth apps may facilitate better alignment with the needs and preferences of end-users and professionals, and thus increase the likelihood of successful implementation in midwifery practice.","Wit, Renate F; Lucassen, Desiree A; Beulen, Yvette H; Faessen, Janine P M; Bos-de Vos, Marina; van Dongen, Johanna M; Feskens, Edith J M; Wagemakers, Annemarie; Brouwer-Brolsma, Elske M",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201452/,413
160442,"Developing a business case for a regional anesthesia block room: up with efficiency, down with costs.",2021-05-12,"Background: Although there is growing evidence that close reading of literature and reflective writing can improve providers' appreciation of the patient experience, foster physician development, and combat burnout, there has been less work on the experience of reading literature with patients, and even less literature about its effect on those facing serious or life-threatening illness. In addition, longer form reading may be unsuitable for some patient populations, given high burden of fatigue and possible contribution of delirium. Time pressure may also preclude discussion by a practitioner working in a busy clinical context. Hypothesis: We feel the condensed medium of poetry presents a natural opportunity to engage patients with the medical humanities, helping them to articulate difficult or joyful experiences, and/or serving as necessary diversion when facing serious illness. Project Description: Poetry for patients-a project developed through collaboration between Northwestern Memorial Hospital, The Jesse Brown VA, and the Poetry Foundation in Chicago, an independent literary organization committed to a vigorous presence for poetry in our culture-has developed three short collections of poems, and an accompanying discussion guides for use specifically with patients and families. Hereunder, we present three case examples of a short (10-30 minutes) reading session with patients demonstrating that it is feasible to incorporate reading poetry with patients facing serious illness. Potential therapeutic value includes helping patients to articulate pain and joy, giving patients a vehicle to recapture their creative voice, and altering the power dynamics inherit to the provider-patient relationship. We have also noted enhanced life review, often on themes otherwise difficult to access. In turn, these readings have deepened our ability to see out patients as creative, intellectual, and larger than their medical illness.","Segar, Nora; Sullivan, Jessica; Litwin, Katherine; Hauser, Joshua",Journal of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2020.0078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830990/,413

Pandemics are characterized by pathogen's ability of emerging or re-emerging across geographical boundaries, simultaneously affecting a large number of people around the world, due to the sustained transmission in humans. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed in real time the dissemination of different types of information about it and strategies used to contain the rate of virus contamination. Our main goal in this study is to analyze the discursive production of the Brazilian journalistic media about vertical isolation as a supposed scientific strategy, and to demonstrate how that has been used in the denialist approach adopted by the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The research was carried out on the Google platform, using the following descriptors: coronavirus and herd immunity;coronavirus and the Imperial College herd immunity strategy;vertical isolation;Bolsonaro and vertical isolation. Thirty-six articles were selected for a qualitative analysis besides the original article by David L.

ResultsFrom 3,185 initial records, following screening for eligibility, and full-text review of 164 articles, seven studies were identified. There was no research literature outlining the role of family, friends and existing networks; and a real absence of evidence about outcomes and levels of satisfaction for those from an ethnic minority background who receive bereavement care. From the limited literature, the overarching theme for barriers to bereavement care was unfamiliarity and irregularities. Four identified subthemes were lack of awareness; variability in support; type and format of support; and culturally specific beliefs. The overarching theme for facilitators for bereavement care was accessibility with the two subthemes being readily available information and inclusive approaches. Three studies reported on examples of different models of care provision. ConclusionsThis review reveals a stark lack of evidence about bereavement care for ethnic minority populations. In particular, understanding more about the role of family, friends and existing support systems, alongside outcomes and satisfaction will begin to develop the evidence base underpinning current provision. Direct user-representation through proactive engagement and co-design approaches may begin to determine the most appropriate models and format of bereavement care for ethnic minority communities to inform service design and delivery.","Mayland, C.

In this paper, we explore a Digital Twin approach to model the pandemic situation in Catalonia. The Digital Twin is composed of three different dynamic models used to perform the validations by a Model Comparison approach. We detail how we use this approach to obtain knowledge regarding the effects of the nonpharmaceutical interventions and the problems we faced during the modeling process. We use Specification and Description Language (SDL) to represent the compartmental forecasting model for the SARS-CoV-2. Its graphical notation simplifies the different specialists’ understanding of the model hypotheses, which must be validated continuously following a Solution Validation approach. This model allows the successful forecasting of different scenarios for Catalonia. We present some formalization details, discuss the validation process and present some results obtained from the validation model discussion, which becomes a digital twin of the pandemic in Catalonia.","Fonseca i Casas, Pau Garcia i Subirana Joan García i Carrasco Víctor Pi i Palomés Xavier",Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3390/math9141660,413

More specifically, the Platts, the MBIOI, and the Chinese Iron Ore spot prices (CIOPI) are analyzed and compared. Our results show that of the three iron ore price indexes, the Platts is a primary contributor of price spillover and highly comparable with China's steel stock prices. The scrap steel, seaborne transportation, and carbon emission prices incur relatively low price spillovers and moderately link with China's steel stock prices. In addition, the time-varying price spillovers and links are sensitive to economic shocks stemming from China's policy implementation to cut overcapacity in steelmaking and the spread of coronavirus. Our results may suggest that the Platts is still the benchmark spot price in determining China's steel stock prices. The results might also guide market investors to hedge the financial risks in the commodity market and help policymakers design appropriate financialization policies for the iron ore and steel markets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ma, Y.; Wang, J.",Resources Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2021.102254,413
175527,Bringing Simulation Technologies to People with T1D: A Pilot Study,2021,"Given the present-day economic situation, which is characterized by economic destabilization as a result of the pandemic crisis, auditors are facing the issue of establishing materiality, which is partly based on the fact that a certain level of financial misstatement influences the decisions of the involved parties. The aim of the present study is to suggest an econometric model for readjusting significance threshold levels through quick audit tests used on sustainable companies. The main objectives of the study are to emphasize the causal relationship between the manifestation of constant errors in financial reports and the inconsistency of audit opinions, as well as to put into practice the causal relationship that exists between the improvement of the audit function and sustainability itself, given companies’ crisis situation. In this particular context—based on the entire sample of companies listed in the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BVB), Bucharest Exchange Trading Plus category (BET Plus)—we estimated a number of financial indicators between 2009 and 2018 so that we could determine the materiality of accounting errors identified by auditors in order to express an opinion regarding the reliability and accuracy of financial reporting. The study’s key findings show that, given the economic crisis, the significance threshold level is a volatile test and it needs to be reconsidered taking into account the decline in the quality of reporting and, indirectly, the disclosure of financial information. From a holistic point of view, we believe that our study will have a significant impact on both practitioners and regulatory entities by shifting the qualitative approaches of analysis itself towards key prudential regulations stipulated by International Standard on Auditing (ISA) 320, ISA 450 and ISA 700. The study also highlights the process of refining information sources that can impact the significance, understanding and materiality of business decisions.","Grosu, Veronica Mateș Dorel Monica-Laura Zlati Mihaila Svetlana Socoliuc Marian Marius-Sorin Ciubotariu Simona-Maria Tanasă",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12198136,413

Regarding global development, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a step back in the path to attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs most negatively affected by the pandemic are identified here: education, health, and work. Then using the SDGs as a reference, this research explores the new challenges faced by developing countries and the impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) after COVID-19's emergence. IoT solutions carried out in developing countries during the pandemic have been identified and reviewed. Successful Internet of Things for Development (IoT4D) projects, in relation to the SDGs, are highlighted. New social and technical challenges that have emerged for the IoT4D as a consequence of the pandemic are then studied. This work concludes that the future of IoT4D in the wake of COVID-19 should focus on the use of low-cost IoT devices for the SDGs most affected by the pandemic. After an exhaustive study, the Intelligent Internet of Things (IIoT) has been determined to be a key actor in the pandemic's wake, with a leading role in the health sector. The proposed approach includes an extensive study of the new role of the IoT4D for achieving the SDGs in our forever changed world.","Lopez-Vargas, A.; Ledezma, A.; Bott, J.; Sanchis, A.",Ieee Access,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3109338,413
177668,Ferritin levels in critically ill patients with covid-19: A marker of outcome?,2021,"Context. Estradiol is the primary female sex hormone and plays an important role for skeletal health in both sexes. Several enzymes are involved in estradiol metabolism but few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to characterize the genetic contribution to variation in estrogen levels. Objective. Identify genetic loci affecting estradiol levels and estimate causal effect of estradiol on bone mineral density (BMD). Design. We performed GWAS for estradiol in males (N = 147,690) and females (N = 163,985) from UK Biobank (UKB). Estradiol was analyzed as a binary phenotype; above/below detection limit (175 pmol/L). We further estimated the causal effect of estradiol on BMD using Mendelian randomization. Results. We identified 14 independent loci associated (P<5x10-8) with estradiol levels in males, of which one (CYP3A7) was genome-wide and seven nominally (P<0.05) significant in females. In addition, one female specific locus was identified. Most loci contain functionally relevant genes that have not been discussed in relation to estradiol levels in previous GWAS. For example, SRD5A2, which encodes a steroid 5-alpha reductase that is involved in processing androgens, and UGT3A1 and UGT2B7 which encode enzymes likely to be involved in estradiol elimination. The allele that tags the O blood group, at the ABO locus, was associated with higher estradiol levels. We identified a causal effect of high estradiol levels on increased BMD in both males (P=1.58x10-11) and females (P=7.48x10-6). Conclusion. Our findings further support the importance of the body's own estrogen to maintain skeletal health in males and in females.","Schmitz, D.; Ek, W.

178036,Assessment of the level of clinical preparedness amongst EMS professionals in managing life threatening emergencies in suspected COVID 19 patients,2021,"Introduction: The treatment landscape for hematologic malignancies is evolving rapidly, and a range of therapeutic options with differing routes of administration is now available. The shifting dynamics of these novel therapies and increasing total treatment costs highlight the importance of value-based healthcare decisions that take patient, payer, and societal perspectives into account. It is therefore increasingly important to consider both direct and indirect costs when evaluating therapeutic options. Reducing healthcare visits for administration of non-oral therapies (injectable and/or mixed therapies) results in indirect cost savings and is of particular relevance during the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic where there are distinct challenges with respect to visiting hospital settings. However, the indirect cost savings of utilizing oral versus non-oral treatments have yet to be fully assessed from a patient and societal perspective. The objective of this review was to assess the differences in indirect non-treatment-related costs between oral and non-oral therapies for hematologic malignancies. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted by searching the Embase®, MEDLINE®, EconLit, and Health Technology Assessment/National Health Service economic evaluation (HTA/NHS EED) databases from inception to June 2020. Additionally, literature searches of proceedings from the 2018-2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Society of Hematology (ASH), and The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) conferences were performed to capture recent studies not indexed in the main databases. A manual search of the reference list from all included study publications was also performed. Eligibility criteria for study identification were developed using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) framework. Eligible studies included cost models and observational studies reporting indirect costs from a patient and/or societal perspective for oral versus non-oral therapies. Results: A total of 4,012 records were identified by the searches. Following title/abstract screening, the full text of 25 publications was reviewed, and 5 studies conducted in the USA (n = 3), Italy (n = 1), and Finland (n = 1) were identified as eligible and selected for qualitative evidence synthesis (Table). Although the SLR protocol included all hematologic malignancies, only studies including patients with multiple myeloma (MM) were identified. The indirect costs reported across the selected studies varied and included costs such as loss of productivity, transportation, and patient and/or caregiver time. Among all 5 studies, total indirect costs for patients with MM were lower for oral versus non-oral regimens. In the USA-based studies, indirect costs were USD 70-1,202 per month for oral regimens versus USD 432-1,526 per month for non-oral regimens. In Europe-based studies, indirect cost estimates were EUR 1,800 versus EUR 17,000 per year for oral versus non-oral regimens (Italian study), and EUR 114 versus EUR 358 per 28-day cycle for oral versus non-oral regimens (Finnish study;averages calculated from ranges in Table). Conclusions: This SLR demonstrates a paucity of data on the indirect costs to patients and society of oral versus non-oral therapies for hematologic malignancies. The studies included in this review assessed differing types of indirect costs, including loss of productivity, transportation costs, and patient and/or caregiver time;however, all indicated that the administration of oral regimens is associated with lower indirect costs compared with non-oral regimens. This finding is compelling given the current global health crisis due to COVID-19, where prioritizing the concept of “value” means assessing more complex issues, such as indirect costs that may have a meaningful impact on patients and society.

178120,"Estimation of Demographic Parameters of COVID-19 Patients Admitted in a Tertiary Care Hospital, Jaipur",2021,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is becoming more ubiquitous for treatment of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and mode of interval debulking surgery (IDS) has not been adequately evaluated. A minimally invasive surgical (MIS) approach offers several advantages to an open approach (O-IDS), especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic, but data regarding outcomes are limited. We sought to compare the surgical and oncologic outcomes of MIS and O-IDS in patients (pts) with advanced EOC. All consecutive patients with stages III to IV EOC who underwent NAC followed by IDS from 2008-2018 at 3 tertiary care centers were included in this retrospective cohort study. Demographic, clinical, and pathologic factors were abstracted from electronic medical records. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed on a Kaplan-Meier estimator using the log-rank method, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for univariate and multivariate survival analyses. [Display omitted] A total of 415 pts underwent IDS through MIS (n=122;robotic = 78, laparoscopic = 44), or O-IDS (n=293). There were no statistically significant differences between age at diagnosis (O-IDS 63.2, MIS 65.3;p=0.1), stage (p=0.3), and grade (p=0.06). There were also no differences between CA-125 levels measured at diagnosis (O-IDS 3145 U/mL, MIS 2247 U/mL;p=0.2) or after completion of NACT (O-IDS 251.7 U/mL, MIS 179.1 U/mL;p=0.4) between the 2 groups. MIS was completed without conversion in 84 of 122 patients (68.8%), with most conversions occurring in the robotic group. Patients undergoing MIS had significantly fewer complex surgeries, with 81% of the cases categorized as low complexity when scored using the Aletti SCS, compared to 64% of open surgeries (p<0.001). Patients undergoing open surgeries had significantly higher estimated blood loss (EBL;326.2cc vs 181.5cc;p<0.001) and intraoperative transfusion rate (25% vs 4%;p<0.001). These patients also had a longer hospital length of stay (5.9 days vs 2.2 days;p<0.001) as well as 30-day postoperative complication rate (43% vs 20%, p<0.001). There were no observed differences between the 2 groups in terms of operative time (191.1 minutes vs 196.3 minutes;p=0.5) and 30-day hospital readmission rates (10% vs 6%;p=0.2). With regard to surgical cytoreduction, patients undergoing MIS had significantly higher rates of both R0 (66% vs 46%;p<0.001) and optimal, or R0/R1 (93% vs 84%;p=0.02) debulking rates. Patients undergoing open surgery trended towards having a higher rate of recurrence at 24 months after diagnosis, but this difference did not reach significance (70% vs 60%;p=0.06). Finally, there were no differences in the 2 groups in terms of PFS or OS (Figure 2). Median PFS was 15.1 months for O-IDS and 18.2 months for MIS (p=0.051). Median OS was 36.7 months for O-IDS and 40.9 months for MIS (p=0.5). MIS is a feasible and potentially effective mode of IDS after NAC in patients with advanced EOC. Surgical outcomes appear to be advantageous in MIS compared with O-IDS, and oncologic outcomes appear to be no different. Further investigation of robotic MIS compared with laparoscopic MIS for IDS is warranted.

Design: Scoping review Search strategy: We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PTSDpubs for published literature up to March 2020 for any studies that examined the treatment of PTSD in adults who were vulnerably housed. Websites of relevant organizations and other grey literature sources were searched to supplement the electronic database search. The characteristics and effect of the interventions were analyzed. We also explored how the interventions were delivered and the elements of trauma-informed care that were described. Results: 26 studies were included. We identified four types of interventions: (1) trauma focused psychotherapies; (2) non-trauma psychotherapies; (3) housing interventions; and (4) pharmacotherapies. The trauma-informed interventions were small case series and the non-trauma focused therapies included four randomized controlled trials, were generally ineffective. Of the ten studies which described trauma-informed care the most commonly named elements were physical and emotional safety, the experience of feeling heard and understood, and flexibility of choice. The literature also commented on the difficulty of providing care to this population including lack of private space to deliver therapy; the co-occurrence of substance use; and barriers to follow-up including limited length of stay in different shelters and high staff turnover. Conclusions: This scoping review identified a lack of high-quality trials to address PTSD in the vulnerably housed. There is a need to conduct well designed trials that take into account the unique setting of this population and which describe those elements of trauma-informed care that are most important and necessary.","Bennett, A.; Crosse, K.; Ku, M.; Edgar, N.

179954,COVID-19: Considerations for Obstetric Anesthesia and Analgesia,2020,"This study assessed the COVID-19 related disruptions on the food environment in Zimbabwe. Information on disruptions in personal life, changes in food habits, changes at food acquisition points and nutrition information required during the lockdown were collected from 243 adult respondents using online survey. The pandemic disrupted work, social events, food behaviors and habits. Food consumption behaviours changed during the COVID-19 lockdown included panic buying (68%) and stockpiling (60%). The changes in food related habits were associated with a reduction in eating out at restaurants (89%) and ordering fast foods (71%). Temperature checks, physical distancing, hand sanitization and restricted access to food stores when not wearing a mask were the changes made at the point of food acquisition and adhered to by respondents. Respondents required nutrition advice on what type of food to eat (58%), food availability in area (52%), and ways to reduce food wastages (49%). Important policy implications emanate from this study. Retailers should ensure adequate supplies of affordable food commodities. The public and private sector should provide information on nutritious foods, ways to reduce food wastages, and food safety during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. There is scope of using social media as one of the platforms to disseminate such information. Innovative interventions such as online purchasing and home delivery of food supplies should be piloted to reduce human physical contact. This requires improved broadband connectivity and collaboration between mobile network companies and food suppliers to pilot online purchases. © 2021 The Author(s).

One year after implementation of the program, we present the first results.MethodsWe performed a retrospective review of the patients’ clinical profiles included in the OPEN program.ResultsNine patients were included in the program. The most frequent diagnosis was schizophrenia (n=5). By the time of inclusion in the program, 5 patients used cannabis frequently;one patient kept substance use. At the 6th month assessment, 4 in 5 patients showed an improvement in social functioning (Personal and Social Performance Scale;± 16 points), and a decrease in symptom severity in all (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale;± 11 points). Due to COVID-19 pandemics, group interventions were suspended, and some visits were performed by teleconsultation. No patients lost follow-up.ConclusionsWe observed an overall positive result of the first months of this program, regarding both functionality and clinical outcomes. The main obstacle so far is the impossibility of performing group interventions since the start of the contingency measures regarding COVID-19 pandemics.

184173,The Effect of COVID-19 on Israeli Ophthalmology Departments: Directors' Perspectives.,2021-02-01,"Background Genome-wide association and fine-mapping studies have enabled the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other variants that are significantly associated with many autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, many of the SNPs lie in non-coding regions, limiting the identification of mechanisms that contribute to autoimmune disease progression. Methods Autoimmunity results from a failure of immune tolerance, suggesting that regulatory T cells (Treg) are likely a significant point of impact for this genetic risk, as Treg are critical for immune tolerance. Focusing on T1D as a model of defective function of Treg in autoimmunity, we designed a SNPs filtering workflow called 3 Dimensional Functional Annotation of Accessible Cell Type Specific SNPs (3DFAACTS-SNP) that utilises overlapping profiles of Treg-specific epigenomic data (ATAC-seq, Hi-C and FOXP3-ChIP) to identify regulatory elements potentially driving the effect of variants associated with T1D, and the gene(s) that they control. Results Using 3DFAACTS-SNP we identified 36 SNPs with plausible Treg-specific mechanisms of action contributing to T1D from 1,228 T1D fine-mapped variants, identifying 119 novel interacting regions resulting in the identification of 51 candidate target genes. We further demonstrated the utility of the workflow by applying it to three other fine-mapped/meta-analysed SNP autoimmune datasets, identifying 17 Treg-centric candidate variants and 35 interacting genes. Finally, we demonstrate the broad utility of 3DFAACTS-SNP for functional annotation of any genetic variation using all common (>10% allele frequency) variants from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identified 7,900 candidate variants and 3,245 candidate target genes, generating a list of potential sites for future T1D or autoimmune research. Conclusions We demonstrate that it is possible to further prioritise variants that contribute to T1D based on regulatory function and illustrate the power of using cell type specific multi-omics datasets to determine disease mechanisms. The 3DFAACTS-SNP workflow can be customised to any cell type for which the individual datasets for functional annotation have been generated, giving broad applicability and utility.","Liu, Ning; Sadlon, Timothy; Wong, Ying Ying; Pederson, Stephen; Breen, James; Barry, Simon C",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.279554,413

Our results indicate that these computations are either infeasible, in the sense that there are large families of graphs for which smooth sensitivity is unbounded; or impractical, in the sense that even for the cases where smooth sensitivity is bounded, the required amounts of noise result in unacceptably large utility losses.","Laeuchli, Jesse; Ram'irez-Cruz, Yunior; Trujillo-Rasua, Rolando",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03556v1.pdf,413
185464,Clinico-Radiological Evaluation and Correlation of CT Chest Images with Progress of Disease in COVID-19 Patients.,2020-07-01,"Objectives: To examine trends in psychological distress in Australia between 2001 to 2017-18, including analysis by age, sex, and location. Design, setting and participants: Secondary analysis of six successive national health surveys of representative samples of the working age population (18-64 years). Main outcome measures: Prevalence of psychological distress at very-high symptom level (defined by a Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K10] score of 30 or more) and combined high/very-high level (K10 score of 22 or more). Results: The latest survey showed 5.1% of Australians reporting very-high level distress and 14.8% combined high/very-high level - both the largest rates recorded this century. The greatest increase from 2001 to 2017-18 was in women aged 55-64 with very-high distress significantly increasing from 3.5% (95% CI: 2.5-4.5%) to 7.2% (5.9-8.5%), and; high/very-high distress from 12.4% (10.5-14.2%) to 18.7% (16.7-20.7%). Men aged 25-34 had very-high distress increase from 2.1% (1.4-2.8) to 4.0% (2.9-5.1%); and combined high/very-high distress remained stable at 10.6% (9.1-12.1%) to 11.5% (9.7-13.3%). In 2017-18, greatest distress was in women aged 18-24 years (very-high 8.0% (5.9-10.2%); high/very-high 22.1% (18.8-25.3%)). Overall, distress was significantly more prevalent in inner regional Australia than elsewhere (very-high level 4.8% (4.4-5.1%); high/very-high 14.4% (13.8-15%)). Conclusions: Australia's annual mental health expenditure over this period has doubled, yet population level psychological distress has increased. A whole of government approach and targeted strategies focusing on groups with the poorest mental health such as older working aged women, younger people, particularly women, and those outside of major cities are indicated.","Enticott, J.; Dawadi, S.; Shawyer, F.; Inder, B.; Fossey, E.; Teede, H.; Rosenberg, S.; Ozol, I.; Meadows, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.21.21259430v1?rss=1,413

To date, it has affected millions of people, killed thousands and resulted in thousands of deaths around the world. To stop the spread of this virus, isolate the infected people. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is very accurate in revealing the details of the lungs and allows oncologists to detect COVID. However, the analysis of CT scans, which can include hundreds of images, may cause delays in hospitals. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology could help to COVID-19-positive cancer in this manner is the main purpose of the work. Design/methodology/approach: CT scans are a medical imaging procedure that gives a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the lungs for clinical purposes. The volumetric 3D data sets can be regarded as axial, coronal and transverse data sets. By using AI, we can diagnose the virus presence.

186122,Bilateral Infiltrates: Not Only COVID-19.,2020-06-01,"PURPOSE: To explore the role of lithium chloride (LiCl) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) keratitis. METHODS: B6 mice were subconjunctivally injected with LiCl in contrast to appropriate control sodium chloride (NaCl), and then routinely infected with PA. Clinical score, slit-lamp photography, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and bacterial plate counts were used to determine the role of LiCl in PA keratitis. Messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines in PA-challenged mouse corneas and in vitro cultured macrophages and neutrophils were measured with real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Apoptosis of the infiltrating inflammatory cells in the PA-infected murine corneas was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5′-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling staining and propidium iodide staining associated with flow cytometry. In cultured murine macrophages and neutrophils, cell apoptosis was determined with annexin V/propidium iodide double staining associated with flow cytometry and western blot analysis for cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. RESULTS: Treatment with LiCl reduced the severity of corneal disease by reducing corneal inflammatory response and bacterial burden. Moreover, LiCl increased anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 levels, decreased proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α levels, and enhanced apoptosis of infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils in the PA-infected mouse corneas. In vitro studies further confirmed that LiCl elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine expression but reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, as well as promoted cell apoptosis in murine macrophages and neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a protective role of LiCl in PA keratitis. LiCl promotes host resistance against PA infection by suppressing inflammatory responses, enhancing inflammatory cell apoptosis, and promoting bacterial clearance.","Chen, Kang; Wu, Yongjian; Zhu, Min; Deng, Qiuchan; Nie, Xinxin; Li, Meiyu; Wu, Minhao; Huang, Xi",Mol Vis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3716469/,413

186876,Discrepant Results of Molecular RT-PCR Tests in Patients with COVID-19 infection.,2021-03-01,"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an important cause of diarrhoea in calves, winter dysentery in adult cattle and respiratory tract disease in feedlot cattle. Serum, faecal and nasal swab samples were collected from a total of 96 cattle with clinical signs in 29 barns of 23 villages in Northwestern Turkey. The cattle were subdivided into 3 distinct age groups (0-30 days old, 4-12 months old and 2-7 years old). An indirect antigen-capture ELISA and an antibody-detection ELISA as well as geometric mean BCoV antibody titres were used to detect BoCV shed in the faeces and in the nasal secretions, respectively. Relationships between BCoV shedding and age group, seroconversion and clinical signs in cattle were also analysed. The rate of faecal shedding of BoCV was 37.1% (13/35) in 0-30 days old calves, 25.6% (10/39) in 4-12 months old feedlot cattle and 18.2% (4/22) in 2-7 years old cows. The overall rate of BCoV faecal shedding was 28.1% (27/96) in the cattle examined. Only one animal in the 4-12 months old age group was found to shed BoCV nasally. The analysis showed that there was a significant difference (P < 0.0001) with respect to faecal shedding between the clinical signs and the age groups. BCoV antibody titre in 50% of all cattle was < or =100 as detected by ELISA while 27.1% of the cattle had high titres ranging between 1,600 and 25,600. The seroconversion rate was 7.3% (7/96) in animals shedding BoCV in the faeces and 42.7% (41/96) in cattle negative for faecal shedding as detected by ELISA, and 20.8% of cattle with no seroconversion shed BCoV in the faeces. There was no statistically significant association between seroconversion and nasal or faecal BCoV shedding. These findings confirm the presence of BCoV infections in Turkey. Further studies are needed to isolate BCoV strains in Turkey and to investigate their antigenic and genetic properties.","Hasoksuz, M; Kayar, A; Dodurka, T; Ilgaz, A",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15782666/,413
186969,Hemoptysis as an Initial Presentation of COVID-19 - An Observation.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND To explore the pathological features and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to provide evidence for the clinical treatment and prevention of SARS. METHODS Pathological features of 2 cases of full autopsy and 4 cases of needle biopsy tissue samples from the patients who died from SARS were studied by light and electron microscopy. The distribution and quantity of lymphocyte subpopulations in the lungs and immune organs from SARS patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The location and semi-quantitative analysis of SARS coronavirus in the tissue specimens were studied by electron microscopy, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS In total of 6 cases, diffuse alveolar damage and alveolar cell proliferation were common. The major pathological changes of 2 autopsy cases of SARS in lung tissues were acute pulmonary interstitial and alveolar exudative inflammation, and 2 autopsy and one biopsy lung tissues showed alveolar hyaline membrane formation. Terminal bronchiolar and alveolar desquamation of lung tissues in one autopsy and 2 biopsy cases were noted. Among 6 cases, 2 biopsy cases presented early pulmonary fibrosis and alveolar organization. Meanwhile, the immune organs, including lymph nodes and spleens from 2 autopsy cases of SARS whose disease courses were less than 12 days showed extensive hemorrhagic necrosis, reactive macrophage/histocyte proliferation, with relative depression of mononuclear and granulocytic clones in the bone marrows. However, spleen and bone marrow biopsy tissue samples from 4 dead SARS cases whose clinical course lasted from 21 to 40 days presented repairing changes. SARS coronaviruses were mainly identified in type I and II alveolar epithelia, macrophages, and endothelia; meanwhile, some renal tubular epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, mucosal and crypt epithelial cells of gastrointestinal tracts, parenchymal cells in adrenal glands, lymphocytes, testicular epithelial cells and Leydig's cells were also detected by electron microscopy combined with in situ hybridization. The semi-quantitative analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations revealed that the proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes were about 80% of the total infiltrative inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium, with a few CD4+ lymphocytes CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ or CD20+ lymphocyte subpopulations were obviously decreased and there was imbalance in number and proportion, while CD57+, CD68+, S-100+ and HLA-DR+ cells were relatively increased in lymph nodes and spleens. CONCLUSIONS Histologically, the pulmonary changes could be divided into acute inflammatory exudative, terminal bronchiolar and alveolar desquamative and proliferative repair stages or types during the pathological process of SARS. SARS coronavirus was found in multi-target cells in vivo, which means that SARS coronavirus might cause multi-organ damages which were predominant in lungs. There were varying degrees of decrease and imbalance in number and proportion of lymphocyte subpopulations in the immune organs of the patients with SARS. However, these changes may be reversible. It was found that cellular immune responses were predominant in the lungs of SARS cases, which might play an important role in getting rid of coronaviruses in infected cells and inducing immune mediated injury.","Zhao, Jing-min; Zhou, Guang-de; Sun, Yan-ling; Wang, Song-shan; Yang, Jian-fa; Meng, Er-hong; Pan, Deng; Li, Wen-shu; Zhou, Xian-shi; Wang, Ye-dong; Lu, Jiang-yang; Li, Ning; Wang, De-wen; Zhou, Ben-cheng; Zhang, Tai-he",Zhonghua shi yan he lin chuang bing du xue za zhi = Zhonghua shiyan he linchuang bingduxue zazhi = Chinese journal of experimental and clinical virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15340561/,413

187471,Telemedicine with clinical decision support for critical care: a systematic review.,2016,"Viral infection may induce the expression of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, resulting in increased NO formation that has an antiviral effect. NO may be produced by various cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract, and may be detected in the exhaled air. We have studied the levels of exhaled NO in 18 normal subjects during symptomatic upper respiratory tract infections and during recovery 3 weeks later. Exhaled NO was measured using a modified chemiluminescence analyser. At the time of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, the peak exhaled NO values were 315 +/- 57 ppb (mean +/- SEM) and decreased to 87 +/- 9 ppb during recovery. Recovery values of exhaled NO were similar to those reported in age-matched normal control subjects (88 +/- 3 ppb, n = 72). These findings suggest that symptomatic upper respiratory tract infections markedly increase the concentration of NO in exhaled air. This may reflect the induction of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in upper and lower respiratory tract, and may be relevant to viral exacerbations of asthma.","Kharitonov, S A; Yates, D; Barnes, P J",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7538934/,413

The RAAS has become much more complex in recent years with the identification of novel peptides that exhibit biological activity. There are novel pathways of angiotensin II (ANG II) generation independent of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). ANG II bind to at least two different receptors and prorenin/renin also exerts pathophysiological effects through binding to specific receptor. ANG II itself has emerged as a multifunctional cytokine exhibiting many non-hemodynamic properties such as acting as a growth factor and profibrogenic and proinflammatory cytokine. These profibrogenic and proinflammatory effects are mediated by other factors such as transforming growth-factor beta (TGF-beta) and chemoattractants that are induced in the kidney by ANG II. Increased aldosterone levels contribute to renal injury, independent of blood pressure or ANG II. Numerous experimental and clinical studies have shown that ACE-inhibitors as well as AT1-receptor antagonists can prevent glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. This review will highlight some of these novel insights into the RAAS in regards to renal injury.","Wolf, Gunter",Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18508564/,413

Public health efforts to strengthen disease detection, surveillance and control have been intensified. However, clinicians and clinical microbiology laboratories play an important role in the early detection of disease, the identification of the putative agent, and notification of the appropriate authorities. To be effective in this role, laboratories must be specially prepared to handle viral agents safely, and need, among other things, the appropriate rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests. In 1998 the European Network for Diagnostics of 'Imported' Viral Diseases (ENIVD) was established. ENIVD presently comprises, as permanent members, 44 expert laboratories in 21 European Union (EU) member states and 4 non-EU countries and is one of the networks on infectious diseases funded by the European Commission. ENIVD fulfils many of the important tasks required for the surveillance and control of imported, rare and emerging viral infections such as the exchange of expertise and the organisation of external quality assurance (EQA) programmes, both of which are needed to improve diagnostics. Here, we summarise the data generated by recent EQA activities focussed on the diagnostics of infections with hantavirus, dengue virus, filovirus, Lassa virus, orthopox virus and the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). These were carried out between 1999 and 2004 and involved 93 laboratories from 41 countries, including laboratories from additional countries outside of Europe. Particularly the EU-candidate countries and Eastern neighbouring countries will be invited to join the network in the near future.

In its final report, the SARS Commission concluded that a key lesson in worker safety was the precautionary principle. It stated that reasonable actions to reduce risk should not await scientific certainty. As recommended by the SARS Commission, this principle has now been enshrined in the Health Protection and Promotion Act (2007), Ontario's public health legislation and in Ontario's influenza pandemic plan. Another vital lesson for worker safety involves the occupational hygiene concept of a hierarchy of controls. It takes a holistic approach to worker safety, addressing each hazard through control at the source of the hazard, along the path between the worker and the hazard and, lastly, at the worker. Absent such an approach, the SARS Commission said worker safety may focus solely on a particular piece of personal protective equipment, such as an N95 respirator (important as it may be), or on specific policies and procedures, such as fit testing the N95 respirator to the wearer (significant as it may be). In worker safety, said the commission, the integrated whole is greater than the uncoordinated parts. The third and final worker safety lesson of SARS is the importance of having a robust safety culture in the workplace in which workers play an integral role in promoting a safe workplace.","Possamai, Mario A",HealthcarePapers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18030033/,413

The RT-nPCR was targeted to the highly conserved 3'-untranslated region of the viral genome and will detect most, if not all, feline coronaviruses in the field. With the RT-nPCR, FCoV RNA was detected in plasma samples from experimentally infected cats as early as 2 days postinoculation. FCoV RNA was also detected in serum, plasma, or ascitic fluid samples from 14 of 18 cats (78%) with naturally occurring feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). The use of RT-PCR for FIP diagnosis is limited because of the occurrence of apparently healthy FCoV carriers. These asymptomatic cats shed the virus in the feces and, in a number of cases, also had detectable virus in the plasma. Because of the nature of FCoV infections, our RT-PCR assay with plasma or serum cannot be used to establish a definite diagnosis of FIP. However, this assay does provide a new means to identify asymptomatic FCoV carriers. As such, RT-nPCR will be of use to screen cats before their introduction into FCoV-free catteries. Moreover, this assay provides an important tool to study the epidemiology of FCoV.","Herrewegh, A A; de Groot, R J; Cepica, A; Egberink, H F; Horzinek, M C; Rottier, P J",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7751377/,413

AIM The present study investigates the impact of the novel coronavirus on patients undergoing general surgical operations in our clinics during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of all surgeries performed in the general surgery clinics of two 'pandemic hospitals' between March 19 and April 30, 2020 - a period when all elective surgeries were suspended in hospitals within Turkey. Demographic data, comorbidities, choice of anesthesia method, blood parameters, duration of stay in hospital and the intensive care unit and mortality rates were compared statistically with the frequency of postoperative Covid-19 positivity in these patients. RESULTS A total of 275 surgical operations were performed during this period. Covid-19 was identified in seven patients during the postoperative period, and was more commonly diagnosed in those who were elderly and those with comorbidities. (p=0.02, p=0.02). Statistically significant correlations were found between a Covid-19 diagnosis and admission to the intensive care unit, the length of hospital stay and the length of stay in intensive care (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.01). Mortality was observed in two patients who developed Covid-19 postoperatively (p= 0.03).

These cells are characterized in vitro as non-T, non-B, MHC class II+ and CD4+ cells. In this study, NIP cells were analysed in vivo after an intravenous injection of UV-inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus in newborn piglets, which resulted in strong serum IFN-alpha production. Splenocytes, but not PBMC, were the IFN-alpha producers in vivo. Using double immunohistochemical labelling for both IFN-alpha and leukocyte markers, we established that splenic NIP cells were not T or B cells. The majority were MHC class II+ and only a minority expressed a macrophage marker. NIP cells were localized in contact with MHC class II-expressing cells and T cells, which suggested that NIP cells might modulate the antiviral immune response.","Riffault, S; Carrat, C; Besnardeau, L; La Bonnardière, C; Charley, B",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9349468/,413

Rapid antigen (AG) tests provide results within minutes; however, their accuracy has been questioned. The study aims to determine the accuracy and cost of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 AG test compared with RT-PCR. METHODS Individuals 18 years or older with an appointment for a RT-PCR test on 26-31 December 2020 at a public test centre in Copenhagen, Denmark were invited to participate. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR analysis, followed by a nasopharyngeal swab examined by the AG test (SD Biosensor). The diagnostic accuracy of the AG test was calculated with RT-PCR as reference. Costs were evaluated for both tests. RESULTS A total of 4,811 paired conclusive test results were collected (median age: 45 years, female: 53%). The RT-PCR test revealed 221 (4.6%) positive tests. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the AG test were 69.7% and 99.5%, respectively. Viral cycle threshold values were significantly higher in individuals with false negative AG tests than in individuals who were true positives. The RT-PCR test and AG test costs were 67.0 DKK (10.8 USD) and 35.0 DKK (5.7 USD), respectively, per positive case detected at 100,000 daily tests. CONCLUSIONS The AG test enables mass testing and provides immediate results, which is important in SARS-CoV-2 screening.

191159,Misdiagnosed Recurrent Pericardial Effusion in Chronic Type A Aortic Dissection.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Breast cancer (BC) is the most common tumor in women, 523.000 cases were estimated in Europe in 2018 and it remains the third cause of cancer related deaths after lung and colorectal cancer. The incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) in females is higher than in males. METHODS We have retrospectively collected all female patients undergone to surgery for breast or thyroid cancer in 2010The aim of the study was to value the incidence of BC in patients with a personal history of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and conversely, the incidence of DTC in patients with previous BC within 5 years from the diagnosis of the first tumor in 2010. RESULTS Among 76 BC patients, 11 were death and 22 didn't answer the phone call or refused to re-submit to thyroid ultrasound so they were excluded from the study and only 43 BC were further considered. Thyroid ultrasound was performed in 2010 and in 2016 and it described nodules in 13 (30%) patients in 2010 and in 21 (49%) patients in 2016. In 2010 no FNA was needed while in 2016 6 (14%) patients underwent to FNA with a benign response (Thyr 2). Among 61 DTC patients, 11 didn't answer the phone or the questions so 50 patients were included in the study. Breast cancer family history was reported in 14 (28%) patients and thyroid cancer family history in 8 (16%) patients. No relapse was reported during follow up.All patients underwent to mammography in 2015 or in 2016 within screening programs and no breast cancer were diagnosed. CONCLUSION The female predominance of diseases of the thyroid and breast makes difficult the separation of an expected association with a casual linkageThe relationship between the co-occurrence of breast and thyroid cancer remains controversial and inconclusive.

191780,The Smell in COVID-19 Infection: Diagnostic Opportunities.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome is frequently complicated by respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support. We aimed to compare the efficacy of non-invasive ventilation against invasive mechanical ventilation treating respiratory failure in this disease. METHODS Retrospective analysis was conducted on all respiratory failure patients identified from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Database. Intubation rate, mortality and secondary outcome of a hospital utilizing non-invasive ventilation under standard infection control conditions (NIV Hospital) were compared against 13 hospitals using solely invasive ventilation (IMV Hospitals). Multiple logistic regression analyses with adjustments for confounding variables were performed to test for association between outcomes and hospital groups. RESULTS Both hospital groups had comparable demographics and clinical profiles, but NIV Hospital (42 patients) had higher lactate dehydrogenase ratio and worse radiographic score on admission and ribavirin-corticosteroid commencement. Compared to IMV Hospitals (451 patients), NIV Hospital had lower adjusted odds ratios for intubation (0.36, 95% CI 0.164 - 0.791, P = 0.011) and death (0.235, 95% CI 0.077 - 0.716, P = 0.011), and improved earlier after pulsed steroid rescue. There were no instances of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome among health care workers due to the use of non-invasive ventilation. CONCLUSION Compared to invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation as initial ventilatory support for acute respiratory failure in the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome appeared to be associated with reduced intubation need and mortality.","Yam, Loretta Y C; Chan, Alfred Y F; Cheung, Thomas M T; Tsui, Eva L H; Chan, Jane C K; Wong, Vivian C W",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16157043/,413
192266,The Smell in COVID-19 Infection: Diagnostic Opportunities.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Viral upper respiratory infections (URIs) are considered major risk factors for acute otitis media (AOM) in young children. We studied the epidemiology and relative roles of different viruses in respiratory infections in a cohort of 329 Finnish children followed from 2 months to 2 years of age. METHODS A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected whenever the child had signs and/or symptoms of URI and tested for the presence of common respiratory virus antigens or infectivity/nucleic acid (only rhinoviruses). Possible repeated detections of a given virus during a 30-day period were considered to represent a single designated virus-specific episode. AOM and URI episodes were defined in a similar way. RESULTS At least one virus was detected in 837 (41.7%) of the 2005 NPA specimens examined. Rates of URI and virus-specific episodes showed expected seasonal variation with major peak occurrences coinciding with or preceding those of AOM. The proportions of rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3, influenza virus A and adenoviruses were 63.1, 14.7, 6.7, 6.7 and 6.2% of the total of 761 virus-specific episodes. Influenza virus B, PIV1 and PIV2 were each responsible for approximately 1% of the episodes. AOM was diagnosed in 870 URI cases (43.4%) and in 43.3% of cases associated with a virus-positive NPA. The latter figure was clearly higher (57.7%) for RS virus-positive specimens. CONCLUSIONS The seasonal coincidence of URI and AOM demonstrated the obvious role of URI in the pathogenesis of AOM. The occurrence of rhinoviruses and RS virus in URI was strikingly more common than that of any other virus tested. Although rhinoviruses were definitely the most frequently found viruses in NPA specimens, the association of RS virus with concurrent AOM was relatively higher than that of any other virus.","Vesa, S; Kleemola, M; Blomqvist, S; Takala, A; Kilpi, T; Hovi, T",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11419498/,413
192424,Protecting public health in the age of emerging infections.,2014,"AIM To predict the probable genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV by bioinformatics analysis. The derived packaging signal may be used to design antisense RNA and RNA interfere (RNAi) drugs treating SARS. METHODS Based on the studies about the genomic packaging signals of MHV and BCoV, especially the information about primary and secondary structures, the putative genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV were analyzed by using bioinformatic tools. Multi-alignment for the genomic sequences was performed among SARS-CoV, MHV, BCoV, PEDV and HCoV 229E. Secondary structures of RNA sequences were also predicted for the identification of the possible genomic packaging signals. Meanwhile, the N and M proteins of all five viruses were analyzed to study the evolutionary relationship with genomic packaging signals. RESULTS The putative genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV locates at the 3' end of ORF1b near that of MHV and BCoV, where is the most variable region of this gene. The RNA secondary structure of SARS-CoV genomic packaging signal is very similar to that of MHV and BCoV. The same result was also obtained in studying the genomic packaging signals of PEDV and HCoV 229E. Further more, the genomic sequence multi-alignment indicated that the locations of packaging signals of SARS-CoV, PEDV, and HCoV overlaped each other. It seems that the mutation rate of packaging signal sequences is much higher than the N protein, while only subtle variations for the M protein. CONCLUSIONS The probable genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV is analogous to that of MHV and BCoV, with the corresponding secondary RNA structure locating at the similar region of ORF1b. The positions where genomic packaging signals exist have suffered rounds of mutations, which may influence the primary structures of the N and M proteins consequently.","Qin, Lei; Xiong, Bin; Luo, Cheng; Guo, Zong-Ming; Hao, Pei; Su, Jiong; Nan, Peng; Feng, Ying; Shi, Yi-Xiang; Yu, Xiao-Jing; Luo, Xiao-Min; Chen, Kai-Xian; Shen, Xu; Shen, Jian-Hua; Zou, Jian-Ping; Zhao, Guo-Ping; Shi, Tie-Liu; He, Wei-Zhong; Zhong, Yang; Jiang, Hua-Liang; Li, Yi-Xue",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12791173/,413

This was achieved by allowing infected murine cells to settle onto confluent monolayers of non-murine cells in a straightforward infectious center assay. Receptor-independent syncytium formation induced by cells expressing the MHV4 spike (S) from recombinant vaccinia viruses (VV) indicated that spread was mediated by this coronavirus glycoprotein. We conclude that the S protein of MHV4 is so potently fusogenic that it does not require prior binding to a virus-specific surface receptor to induce fusion of closely-opposed plasma membranes.","Gallagher, T M; Buchmeier, M J; Perlman, S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8209743/,413

First there is growing emphasis from health organizations on the need for unbiased evidence about the effectiveness of promoted remedies. Second, as most novel treatments accrue increased costs to society, these need to be evaluated in terms of value for money. Third, there has been confusion and concern about the resolution of conflicting evidence, especially the role of advertising and commercial pressures from a powerful pharmaceutical industry motivated by profit. Fourth, there is concern about research fraud and the ethics of clinical trials. Fifth, there is increasing suspicion of political advice, which sometimes has sought to reassure an anxious public on the basis of complex and possibly inadequate scientific information. Some of these issues are addressed by truly independent and properly constituted data and safety monitoring committees, which are of particular importance when academic investigators or universities have a large financial conflict of interest. This is now more problematic with the current encouragement of investigator-led spin-off companies. These issues are best resolved by independent financial support (from government or other institutions) rather than relying on the commercial sponsor.","Sleight, P",Journal of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14746553/,413

Until now, no helicase activity has been identified which could account for the ability of ribosomes to translate through downstream mRNA secondary structure. Using an oligonucleotide displacement assay, together with a stepwise in vitro translation system made up of purified components, we show that ribosomes are able to disrupt downstream helices, including a perfect 27 base pair helix of predicted T(m) = 70 degrees . Using helices of different lengths and registers, the helicase active site can be localized to the middle of the downstream tunnel, between the head and shoulder of the 30S subunit. Mutation of residues in proteins S3 and S4 that line the entry to the tunnel impairs helicase activity. We conclude that the ribosome itself is an mRNA helicase and that proteins S3 and S4 may play a role in its processivity.","Takyar, Seyedtaghi; Hickerson, Robyn P; Noller, Harry F",Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15652481/,413

In this study, we evaluated the availability of this method as the concomitant procedure for the plasty of organic MR in comparison with the operative results in patients with functional MR. Fifty-six patients who underwent sandwich plasty were reviewed, including 45 functional MR (29 ICM and 16 AVD) patients and 11 organic MR patients. The mean age of patients was 67 years. In the organic MR patients, predominant cardiac diseases were solitary MR in six patients and combined valve diseases including aortic valve stenosis in five. Mitral valve changes included prolapse in six patients and moderate cusp thickening with calcification in five. Two heads of the papillary muscle connecting to the choldae of both the anterior and posterior leaflets are fixed with two teflon-pledgeted 3-0 TiCron™ (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) sutures in order to achieve coaptation of the two leaflets. Prominent MR was observed in a patient with functional MR after surgery, however residual MR was not detected in organic MR patients. The tenting height (coaptation distance) of mitral valve significantly decreased after surgery from 11±1 to 7±2mm in the organic MR patients, which was similar to the results in the functional MR patients (from 12±2 to 7±2 mm). The postoperative mean mitral orifice area in the organic MR patients was 4.3±0.1cm2 without stenosis. Sandwich plasty reduces the distance of choldae connecting to anterior and posterior leaflets and achieves the better coaptation of two leaflets. This procedure is effective in the treatment of both functional and organic MR.","Ishikawa, Susumu; Mishima, Hideki; Matsunaga, Hiroki; Katayama, Yasushi",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25433409/,413

In contrast, at 68 degrees C, the probe reacted only with the homologous strain and did not react even with the strains belonging to the same serotype. The dot-blot hybridization thus appeared serotype-specific at 56 degrees C and strain-specific at 68 degrees C. In addition, it was revealed that the S1 gene has some nucleotide sequence variation even among strains in the same serotype.

A large macrophage population and the efficient trafficking of dendritic cells from sinusoidal blood to lymph promote antigen trapping and T-cell priming, but the local presentation of antigen causes T-cell inactivation, tolerance and apoptosis. These local mechanisms might result from the need to maintain immunological silence to harmless antigenic material in food.

Initially, we investigated IBV isolations from cases of respiratory disease in association with the presence of thymic and/or bursal atrophy in 322 submissions during 1997 to 2002. Arkansas (Ark)-type IBV was most frequently isolated in spite of extensive ArkDPI vaccination in the broiler industry. The number of IBV isolations was consistently higher in broilers aged 27 to 43 days, coinciding with lymphocytic depletion of the bursa and/or thymus, providing circumstantial evidence that immunodeficiency and IBV incidence may be linked. S1 gene sequence analyses, antigenic characterizations, and challenge of susceptible chickens demonstrated that the field IBV isolates tested were closely related to vaccine strains and had low pathogenicity for chickens. We experimentally evaluated the effects of immunodeficiency caused by co-infection with chicken anaemia virus and infectious bursal disease virus on the outcome of IBV infection. Clinical signs and histological lesions were more persistent in immunodeficient chickens. Local specific IgA production was delayed and lower levels were achieved in immunodeficient chickens. At the same time, IBV RNA concentrations in tracheas and lachrymal fluids were higher and more persistent in immunodeficient chickens. Collectively, these results indicate that viral immunodeficiency most probably plays a relevant role in the epidemiology and outcome of IBV infection.","Toro, H; van Santen, V L; Li, L; Lockaby, S B; van Santen, E; Hoerr, F J",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17121734/,413

The majority of episodic exacerbations of asthma are associated with viral infection, in particular with rhinovirus infections. Experimental rhinovirus infection in human volunteers provides a useful model of natural virus-induced asthma. The asthmatic airway is characterized by an infiltrate of eosinophils and T-lymphocytes expressing the type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13. An effective antiviral immune response requires early viral clearance and appropriate termination of the immune response to minimize associated immunopathology and tissue damage. The antiviral immune response is made up of innate (nonspecific) and specific components, and requires the coordinated actions of many different cell types including neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, dendritic cells, epithelial cells, mast cells, natural killer cells and B- and T-lymphocytes. Coordination of this response involves numerous cytokines and chemokines. T-lymphocytes expressing type 1 cytokines including interferon-gamma play a key role. Pre-existing asthmatic inflammation in the lower airway may modify the immune response to viral infection by altering the balance of T-cell cytokine expression from type 1 towards a type 2 in what is always a mixed response. The consequence is delayed viral clearance, persistent virus-induced inflammation and amplification of the allergic inflammation.","Message, S D; Johnston, S L",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11829084/,413
198317,Prevalence of Abnormal Liver Function Tests in COVID-19 Patients at a Tertiary Care Centre.,2020-08-01,"CD147 is a transmembrane protein that plays crucial roles in the development and function of the reproductive, visual, and nervous systems. CD147 also exerts positive and negative actions in T-cells by still obscure mechanisms. In this study, we have analyzed the expression, localization, and function of CD147 during T-cell receptor signaling responses. We show here that CD147 is an integral component of the T-cell immune synapse and that its overexpression leads to the inhibition of NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) activity induced by Vav1, a Rac1 exchange factor. This inhibitory activity is mediated by the CD147 intracellular tail and is totally independent of its extracellular or transmembrane regions. The molecular dissection of the influence of CD147 on the Vav1 pathway indicates that its inhibitory action takes place downstream of Vav1 and Rac1 but upstream of the serine/threonine kinases JNK and Pak1. The interference of CD147 with these pathways is highly specific because the overexpression of CD147 does not affect the activity of other GDP/GTP exchange factors or the stimulation of the ERK cascade. Finally, we show that the CD147 knockdown in Jurkat cells promotes higher levels of NF-AT stimulation and Pak1 phosphorylation upon T-cell receptor cross-linking. Instead, the lack of CD147 does not affect other signaling cascades that participate in the same cellular response. Taken together, these results indicate that CD147, via the selective inhibition of specific downstream elements of the Vav1/Rac1 route, contributes to the negative regulation of T-cell responses.","Ruiz, Sergio; Castro-Castro, Antonio; Bustelo, Xosé R",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18160397/,413

198832,Immune Thrombocytopenia Secondary to COVID-19 Infection.,2021-06-01,"Borna disease virus (BDV) can persistently infect the central nervous system of a broad range of mammalian species. Mice are resistant to infections with primary BDV isolates, but certain laboratory strains can be adapted to replicate in mice. We determined the molecular basis of adaptation by studying mutations acquired by a cDNA-derived BDV strain during one brain passage in rats and three passages in mice. The adapted virus propagated efficiently in mouse brains and induced neurological disease. Its genome contained seven point mutations, three of which caused amino acid changes in the L polymerase (L1116R and N1398D) and in the polymerase cofactor P (R66K). Recombinant BDV carrying these mutations either alone or in combination all showed enhanced multiplication speed in Vero cells, indicating improved intrinsic viral polymerase activity rather than adaptation to a mouse-specific factor. Mutations R66K and L1116R, but not N1398D, conferred replication competence of recombinant BDV in mice if introduced individually. Virus propagation in mouse brains was substantially enhanced if both L mutations were present simultaneously, but infection remained mostly nonsymptomatic. Only if all three amino acid substitutions were combined did BDV replicate vigorously and induce early disease in mice. Interestingly, the virulence-enhancing effect of the R66K mutation in P could be attributed to reduced negative regulation of polymerase activity by the viral X protein. Our data demonstrate that BDV replication competence in mice is mediated by the polymerase complex rather than the viral envelope and suggest that altered regulation of viral gene expression can favor adaptation to new host species.","Ackermann, Andreas; Staeheli, Peter; Schneider, Urs",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17522214/,413

MATERIAL AND METHODS Medical documentation of 97 patients treated during 2001-2006 period for pancreatic cancer was analyzed. The age of patients was 42-90 years (medium 66.04, SD 10.27). There were 47 women (48.45% of group) aged 43-90 (medium 67.89, SD 9.93) and 50 men (51.55%) aged 42-86 (medium 64.31, SD 10.64). RESULTS In analyzed group 87 tumors were located in the head of pancreas, 5 in the corpus and 5 in the cauda. In 13 cases (13.40%) partial resection of pancreas was performed. By passing anastomoses were applied in 45 cases: 26 (26.80% of total group) biliar and gastrointestinal, 19 (19.59%) only biliar anastomoses. Thoracovideoscopic splanchnicectomy was performed 26 times (26.80%) as a method of decreasing pain. 6 patients were treated with bile ducts drainage: endoscopic (4) or percutaneous (2). In 7 cases operations were limited to explorative laparotomy. Complication occurred in 5 (38.46%) cases following resection of the pancreas and 13 cases (15.38%) following paliative operations. Perioperative mortality accomplished 15.38% following pancreatic resection and 4.44% in remaining cases. CONCLUSIONS Pancreatic cancer is a neoplasm connected with unsuccessfull course. In most of cases diagnose is confirmed in clinical stage that disables resection with the aim of curation. Although huge progress in diagnostic methods, operational technique and perioperative care postoperative mortality is high. Videothoracoscopic splanchnicectomy is a worth reccomending method of decreasing pain.","Piskorz, Łukasz; Brocki, Marian; Lesiak, Tomasz; Kutwin, Leszek; Jabłonski, Sławomir; Santorek-Strumiłło, Edyta J; Wcisło, Szymon; Kordiak, Jacek",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17679378/,413
201146,COVID-19 Prevalence and Mortality in Chronic Dialysis Patients,2021,"Prescription opioids are prescribed increasingly for the management of chronic pain, and this has been accompanied by a dramatic rise in opioid-related abuse, addiction, and overdose deaths. Reports of abuse involving nonoral administration (e.g., snorting, injecting) of prescription opioids are increasing, although the epidemiology of oral versus nonoral abuse is not well understood. Available data indicate that oral abuse is far more common,with 72% to 97% of opioid abusers perferring oral administration. Factors associated with nonoral administration include longer duration of opioid abuse, male gender, and rural setting. Extended-release opioids, because of their relatively high drug load, may be attractive to experienced abusers seeking to manipulate the formulation to facilitate a rapid onset of effect. Putative abuse-deterrent formulations have been developed to decrease the likelihood or consequences of nonoral abuse. In addition, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) are now required for prescribed extended-release/long-acting opioids by the US Food and Drug Administration, although their effectiveness in reducing the risk of abuse, addiction, and overdose has not been evaluated. Physicians should remain vigilant when prescribing opioids and should exercise appropriate patient selection, perform risk analysis and stratification, and maintain continuous patient monitoring to ensure the benefits outweigh these important risks.","Kirsh, Kenneth; Peppin, John; Coleman, John",Journal of pain & palliative care pharmacotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23675595/,413

In the past, most traditional models of graduate education in schools of public health have not incorporated the theory and practice of disaster public health into their curricula. This paper describes the development of a curriculum in emergency public health within a US masters program in public health, and provides a description of the courses that comprise an area of specialization in the field. The interdisciplinary nature of the faculty, close ties with public health practitioners, and practical applications of the nine courses in this program are highlighted. The curriculum is presented as one model that can be used to meet the educational needs of professionals who will assume the responsibility for planning for and responding to the public health impacts of mass-populations disasters.","Rottman, Steven J; Shoaf, Kimberley I; Stratton, Samuel J",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20586012/,413

To answer this, we conducted a repeated cross-sectional survey of around 1500 respondents to examine the link between conspiracy-theory beliefs and disease-preventive behaviours across six time-points in the United States from early February to late March 2020. The findings reveal that believing in risk-acceptance conspiracy theories (RA-CTs;e.g., “COVID-19 is a man-made bioweapon”) was linked to more preventive behaviours. However, believing in risk-rejection conspiracy theories (RR-CTs;e.g., “COVID-19 is like influenza and was purposefully exaggerated”) was associated with fewer preventive behaviours. These differential links were mediated by risk perception and negative emotions and modulated by the stage of the outbreak—RA-CTs predicted higher risk perception in the mild stage, whereas RR-CTs predicted lower risk perception in the severe stage.","Hoi-Wing, Chan Chiu Connie Pui-Yee Zuo Shijiang Wang Xue Liu Li Ying-yi Hong",Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications,,413

Material and Methods: We performed this cross-sectional study in a medical faculty hospital located in Turkey’s Eastern Anatolia region. The universe of the survey was composed of all assistant physicians (342 persons) who were taking medical specialty training in this hospital. We aimed to reach the entire universe without selecting a sample. Of the physicians, 264 have been accessed (responsiveness rate 77.2%). In combination with sociodemographic questions, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Test (STAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used. STAI measured state anxiety value, whereas BDI depression findings. Results: Women accounted for 51.9% of the study participants and the mean age of those was 29.7 ± 3.5. Of the physicians, 81.1% thought that the COVID-19 infection influenced themselves spiritually and 84.1% of participants were afraid of getting an infection because of being a healthcare worker, while 98.5% of transmitting the infection to their relatives or environment. The anxiety and depression scores of women were determined to be significantly higher than the scores of men. We found a significant difference between anxiety and depression and regret about choosing a medical profession, thoughts of leaving the assistantship. Discussion: Anxiety and depression levels of female physicians were significantly higher than male physicians. In our study, a large proportion of physicians (84.1%) were found to be afraid of getting infected with COVID-19 and transmitting the infection to any of their relatives (98.5%). In this study, no significant relationship was established between marital status and anxiety and depression levels.","Kurt, Osman; Deveci, Suleyman Erhan; Oguzoncul, Ayse Ferdane",Annals of Clinical and Analytical Medicine,,413
204716,Addressing interpersonal conflict among healthcare workers during the coronavirus pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on health care processes. Precautions such as restrictions imposed on visitors and social distancing have led to multiple challenges, particularly in terms of communication. Using the case of nursing, palliative and hospice care facilities in Germany and drawing on agenda-setting theory, the present study aims to shed light on how health care facilities use their websites to inform (potential) health care users about changes in regulations, new protective measures implemented and about recommendations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The websites of nursing, palliative and hospice care facilities in Germany were examined using qualitative document analysis and qualitative content analysis. A total of 138 websites was analysed in the study. The data gathered includes all information about COVID-19 on these websites published from the beginning of March until August 15, 2020. RESULTS: Facilities show similarities in adhering to the measures taken by the authorities to restrict the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to protect vulnerable patients and employees. All facilities urged the public to avoid paying visits to patients in facilities unless there was an emergency; however, visiting procedures in practice varied by types of facilities. For optimal communication, telephone and especially video calls were the options preferred by health care providers and health care users. Facilities made great efforts to prevent emotional stress and to strengthen resilience among all stakeholders. Transparency was adopted by many facilities in order to build the public's trust. CONCLUSIONS: The agenda of health care facilities has been seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study sheds light on the strategies developed by facilities, their efforts to increase emotional resilience among health care staff and health care users, the ethical guidelines they have adopted regarding privacy policies as well as how these themes are communicated via the facilities' websites. The results can inform other health care facilities about how websites can be used as essential communication tools in times of public health crises.","Ölcer, Sabahat; Idris, Mohamed; Yilmaz-Aslan, Yüce; Brzoska, Patrick",BMC Health Serv Res,,413

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary RE supplementation on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant capacity, intestinal morphology and microbiota of weaning piglets. A total of 192 crossbred weaned piglets [Duroc × (Large White × Landrace)] (initial body weight = 6.65 ± 0.33 kg, weaned days = 23 ± 1 d) were group housed (six pigs per pen; n = 8 pens/treatment). Pigs were fed a corn-soybean meal-based control diet or the basal diet supplemented with 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg RE. Pigs were allowed ad libitum access to fed for 21-d. The growth performance and apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients, and intestinal morphology and antioxidant status were evaluated. The components of the microbial microflora were also determined in the cecal samples. Compared with the control, dietary supplementation with RE increased the final body weight, average daily gain and average daily feed intake (linear, P = 0.038, 0.016, and 0.009, respectively), and decreased the diarrhea ratio in piglets (linear, P < 0.05). The digestibility of crude protein (linear, P = 0.034) and gross energy (linear, P = 0.046) increased with treatment with RE. Piglets fed RE showed longer villus height (linear, P = 0.037 and 0.028, respectively) and villus height/crypt depth (linear, P = 0.004 and 0.012; quadratic, P = 0.023 and 0.036, respectively) in the jejunum and ileum, in addition to a lesser crypt depth in the jejunum (linear, P = 0.019) and ileum (quadratic, P = 0.042). The addition of RE increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (linear, P = 0.035 and 0.008 respectively) and glutathione peroxidase activity (linear, P = 0.027 and 0.039 respectively), and decreased the content of malondialdehyde (linear, P = 0.041 and 0.013; quadratic, P = 0.023 and 0.005 respectively) in the serum and liver. Dietary RE supplementation, compared with the control, increased the number of Bifidobacterium (linear, P = 0.034) and Bacteroidetes (linear, P = 0.029), while decreased Escherichia coli (linear, P = 0.008; quadratic, P = 0.014) in the cecal contents. Thus, dietary RE supplementation can improve growth performance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant capacity, intestinal morphology and the microbiota in weaned piglets, and 200 mg/kg may be considered the optimum dosage.","Yang, Mei; Yin, Yexin; Wang, Fang; Bao, Xuetai; Long, Lina; Tan, Bie; Yin, Yulong; Chen, Jiashun",J. anim. sci,,413

This article review refers to the roles of Ginkgo Biloba to reduce the risk of infection in the respiratory tract, the details on the epidemiology of corona COVID-19 and influenza, and it highlights how the Ginko Biloba could have been used as a novel treatment.Ginkgo Biloba can reduce the risk of infection by several mechanisms; these mechanisms involve Ginkgo Biloba contains quercetin and other constituents, which have anti-inflammatory and immune modulator effects by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines concentrations. Cytokines cause inflammation which have been induced the injuries in lung lining.Some observational studies confirmed that Ginkgo Biloba reduced the risk of asthma, sepsis and another respiratory disease as well as it reduced the risk of cigarette smoking on respiratory symptoms. While other evidences suggested the characters of Ginkgo Biloba as an antivirus agent through several mechanisms. Ginkgolic acid (GA) can inhibit the fusion and synthesis of viral proteins, thus, it inhibit the Herpes Simplex Virus type1 (HSV-1), genome replication in Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and the infections of the Zika Virus (ZIKV). Also, it inhibits the wide spectrum of fusion by inhibiting the three types of proteins that have been induced fusion as (Influenza A Virus [IAV], Epstein Barr Virus [EBV], HIV and Ebola Virus [EBOV]).The secondary mechanism of GA targeting inhibition of the DNA and protein synthesis in virus, greatly have been related to its strong effects, even afterward the beginning of the infection, therefore, it potentially treats the acute viral contaminations like (Measles and Coronavirus COVID-19). Additionally, it has been used topically as an effective agent on vigorous lesions including (varicella-zoster virus [VZV], HSV-1 and HSV-2). Ginkgo Biloba may be useful for treating the infected people with coronavirus COVID-19 through its beneficial effect. To assess those recommendations should be conducted with random control trials and extensive population studies.","Ibrahim, Manal A; Ramadan, Hanan H; Mohammed, Rasha N",J. basic clin. physiol. pharmacol,,413

The relative lengths of the index (2D) and ring (4D) fingers (digit ratio; 2D:4D) is a sexually dimorphic (males < females) proxy of fetal sex steroids (low 2D:4D indicates high prenatal testosterone/low prenatal estrogen). AIM: To examine sex-specific relationships of 2D:4D per nation with national values of COVID-19 CFRs. STUDY DESIGN: COVID-19 CFRs and the percent of male deaths were related to mean national (self-reported) 2D:4D by sex and hand from a large online survey (the BBC Internet Study). SUBJECTS: 103,482 men and 83,366 women. OUTCOME MEASURES: Relationships of mean national 2D:4D with CFRs from 41 countries and with national male death rates from 16 countries. RESULTS: Male right and left hand 2D:4D showed positive relationships with CFR. These relationships remained significant after removing the influence of female 2D:4D. A positive association of male right and left 2D:4D was detected with the percentage of male deaths. CONCLUSIONS: At the national level, high mean 2D:4D (indicating low prenatal testosterone/high prenatal estrogen) is associated with high CFRs and percent male mortality. At the individual level, high 2D:4D may be a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 in males.

It is urgent to study how this group is faring during the pandemic and we focus here on their health-related worries. METHODS: A longitudinal survey at a Swedish hospital starting six months before (16 September 2019) and continuing during the COVID-19 outbreak (until 25 August 2020). 6,941 pregnant women and partners of diverse social backgrounds were recruited. 96 percent of birth-giving women in the city take early ultrasounds where recruitment took place. 62 percent of the women with an appointment and 51 percent of their partners gave consent to participate. RESULTS: Pregnant women experienced dramatically increased worries for their own health, as well as for their partner's and their child's health in the beginning of the pandemic. The worries remained at higher than usual levels throughout the pandemic. Similar, but less dramatic changes, were seen among partners. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for heightened awareness of pregnant women's and partners' health-related worries as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

211437,Investigation of the disease process and drug combinations in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using favipiravir,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Around 9% of India's children under six are diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders. Low-resource, rural communities often lack programmes for early identification and intervention. The Prechtl General Movement Assessment (GMA) is regarded as the best clinical tool to predict cerebral palsy in infants <5 months. In addition, children with developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, late detected genetic disorders or autism spectrum disorder show abnormal general movements (GMs) during infancy. General Movement Assessment in Neonates for Early Identification and Intervention, Social Support and Health Awareness (G.A.N.E.S.H.) aims to (1) provide evidence as to whether community health workers can support the identification of infants at high-risk for neurological and developmental disorders and disabilities, (2) monitor further development in those infants and (3) initiate early and targeted intervention procedures. METHODS: This 3-year observational cohort study will comprise at least 2000 infants born across four districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. Community health workers, certified for GMA, video record and assess the infants' GMs twice, that is, within 2 months after birth and at 3-5 months. In case of abnormal GMs and/or reduced MOSs, infants are further examined by a paediatrician and a neurologist. If necessary, early intervention strategies (treatment as usual) are introduced. After paediatric and neurodevelopmental assessments at 12-24 months, outcomes are categorised as normal or neurological/developmental disorders. Research objective (1): to relate the GMA to the outcome at 12-24 months. Research objective (2): to investigate the impact of predefined exposures. Research objective (3): to evaluate the interscorer agreement of GMA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: G.A.N.E.S.H. received ethics approval from the Indian Government Chief Medical Officers of Varanasi and Mirzapur and from the Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service in Varanasi. GMA is a worldwide used diagnostic tool, approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Graz, Austria (27-388 ex 14/15).

212284,Appraisal of critically III COVID-19 patients at a dedicated COVID hospital,2020,"COVID-19 has been distinguished as a zoonotic coronavirus, like SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus. Tehran metropolis, as the capital of Iran, has a high density of residents that experienced a high incidence and mortality rates which daily increase the number of death and cases. In this study, the IDW (Inverse Distance Weight), Hotspots, and GWR (Geography Weighted Regression) Model are used as methods for analyzing big data COVID-19 in Tehran. The results showed that the majority of patients and deaths were men, but the death rate was higher in women than in men; also was observed a direct relationship between the area of the houses, and the infected rate, to COVID-19. Also, the results showed a disproportionate distribution of patients in Tehran, although in the eastern regions the number of infected people is higher than in other districts; the eastern areas have a high population density as well as residential land use, and there is a high relationship between population density in residential districts and administrative-commercial and the number of COVID-19 cases in all regions. The outputs of local R2 were interesting among patients and underlying disorders; the local R2 between hypertension and neurological diseases was 0.91 and 0.79, respectively, which was higher than other disorders. The highest rates of local R2 for diabetes and heart disease were 0.67 and 0.55, respectively. From this study, it can be concluded the restrictions must be considered especially, in areas densely populated for all people.","Nasiri, R; Akbarpour, S; Zali, A R; Khodakarami, N; Boochani, M H; Noory, A R; Soori, H",GeoJournal,,413

Methods: A mixed-methods design, integrating qualitative and quantitative data analyses, was employed to explore a total of 289 patient satisfaction survey ratings and 421 comments based on care that took place in the ED during the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic. This allowed for comparisons to a more typical time period in the ED along with the emergence of novel categories of influence. Results: The ED census was 31% lower during 2020 (COVID-19) than the previous year, and a significantly greater percentage of patients in 2020 indicated that they would ""definitely recommend"" the ED compared with 2019. Wait time was mentioned in &gt;40% of dissatisfied patient comments in 2019 but &lt;20% of dissatisfied patient comments in 2020. General negative comments were proportionately greater than general positive comments in 2019, whereas in 2020 the reverse pattern held. Other categories did not differ significantly across 2019 and 2020. Conclusions: The general circumstances surrounding the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic included a lower census in the ED and higher reported satisfaction among patients. A comparison of the content of patient comments revealed less concern about wait times and a more positive overall view toward receiving care during the first 3 months of the pandemic.","Grissom, M.

218083,Risk of adverse outcome of COVID-19 among patients in secure psychiatric services: observational cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID 19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by infection by the virus SARS-COV-2 and has been declared as a pandemic whose specific treatment is still not established. One of the options in the treatment is Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy when there is presence of required amount of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma of recovered COVID patients. Our objective was to analyze the challenges and the constraints encountered in motivation of COVID 19 recovered persons to come for the screening procedures and to convince the selected persons to come for Plasma donation voluntarily. MATERIAL & METHODS: The present retrospective observational study was conducted for a period of five and half months. Out of 1515 number of persons contacted telephonically for Plasma donation, 1291 persons came for screening of whom 1028 persons were eligible for donation, 263 cases were deferred and 966 persons finally donated. RESULTS: Maximum number of acceptance cases were from males-(98.7%). Of the accepted cases, (41.73%) were from the 18-30 years' age group. 33.94% were from blood group 'O' Rh D positive giving maximum contribution from any blood group. 38.3% of the accepted cases had resolution of all COVID symptoms within time period of 28-40 days. Maximum number of accepted individuals (39.75%) had suffered from multiple symptoms followed by 39.02% of asymptomatic persons. Highest number of Plasma donation was contributed by Odisha Government Police personnel (51.56%). DISCUSSION: In this global ongoing pandemic, the ""Fear Factor of contracting the disease"" has acted as a major challenge in motivating and convincing a COVID recovered patient for plasma donation. The challenge before the medical professionals was to motivate, educate and convince the potential donors and the society about the likely benefits of convalescent plasma. This could be finally overcome with the help of positive orientation through social and conventional media as well as mass appeal from government side on the benefits of plasma therapy in saving lives in the present pandemic.","Mahapatra, S; Pati, S",Transfus Clin Biol,,413

Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country ""at war"" against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population. The unit responsible for the department of Gironde has been set up quickly, over the weekend of March 21, 2020. The COVIDPSY33 listening unit has thus been created in Bordeaux by the Charles Perrens Hospital with support from the Agence Régionale de Santé Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS). Simultaneously, the PSYCOVID-19 unit was created. This additional unit works in collaboration with the COVIDPSY33 platform and offers psychological assistance to the general population and caregivers in the sectors of Bordeaux Rive Droite, Bordeaux Gare, Rives de Garonne, Rives d'Arcins and Sud Gironde. It thus covers an area equivalent to approximately half of Gironde, the largest department in metropolitan France.

The population has decreased significantly by illegal poaching, environmental perturbation, roadkill, and being captured during human-wildlife conflicts. Forty-five or more individuals were extracted from the wild (four animals captured due to conflict, one death due to canine distemper, one roadkilled, and 39 poached) in the 12 years between 2008-2019. The Malayan tigers are the first wildlife species to test positive for COVID-19 and are subject to the Canine Distemper Virus. These anthropogenic disturbances (poaching and human-tiger conflict) and environmental perturbation (decreasing habitat coverage and quality) have long been identified as impending extinction factors. Roadkill and infectious diseases have emerged recently as new confounding factors threatening Malayan tiger extinction in the near future. Peninsular Malaysia has an existing Malayan tiger conservation management plan;however, to enhance the protection and conservation of Malayan tigers from potential extinction, the authority should reassess the existing legislation, regulation, and management plan and realign them to prevent further population decline, and to better enable preparedness and readiness for the ongoing pandemic and future threats.","Ten, D.

Therefore, in this research, we aimed to investigate the prospective association between anemia and COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients in Iran. METHODS: In this prospective study, the data of 1274 consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 were statistically analyzed. All biomarkers, including hemoglobin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were measured using standard methods. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of less than 13 g/dL and 12 g/dL in males and females, respectively. Assessing the association between anemia and COVID-19 survival in hospitalized patients was our primary endpoint. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 64.43 ± 17.16 years, out of whom 615 (48.27%) were anemic subjects. Patients with anemia were significantly older (P = 0.02) and had a higher frequency of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, kidney disease, diabetes, and cancer (P < 0.05). The frequency of death (anemic: 23.9% vs. nonanemic: 13.8%), ICU admission (anemic: 27.8% vs. nonanemic:14.71%), and ventilator requirement (anemic: 35.93% vs. nonanemic: 20.63%) were significantly higher in anemic patients than in nonanemic patients (P < 0.001). According to the results of regression analysis, after adjusting for significant covariate in the univariable model, anemia was independently associated with mortality (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.57, P = 0.01), ventilator requirement (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.54, P = 0.004), and the risk of ICU admission (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.46, 2.90, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anemia in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was high and was associated with poor outcomes of COVID-19.","Faghih Dinevari, Masood; Somi, Mohammad Hossein; Sadeghi Majd, Elham; Abbasalizad Farhangi, Mahdieh; Nikniaz, Zeinab",BMC Infect Dis,,413

223540,Letter to Editor Response to Covid-19 Endocrinology & Diabetology,2020,"The speed and volume of clinical research to discover effective drug against novel corona virus has been remarkable. To address the unmet medical need, the regulations are made flexible and convenient without any relaxation in drug safety reporting. The pharmacovigilance activities, especially adverse event reporting regardless of clinical trials or clinical practice should continue as usual because patient safety is the priority. The exposure to experimental drugs with limited evidence of risk-benefit makes it more crucial to adapt robust safety monitoring, accuracy in adverse event reporting, and timely assessment. With the current restriction on physical contact, travel and free movements, isolation, quarantine, and huge clinical workload during pandemic, causality assessment will be more challenging. It may not be possible to capture details of all adverse events, thereby affecting completeness and quality of safety reports. A substantial number of COVID 19 patients will receive investigational drugs along with multiple other medications for clinical manifestations and drug therapy for lifestyle diseases. Causality assessment will be a challenge due to overlapping toxicities, multiple confounding, contributory factors, and insufficient data on safety and risk profile of combining drugs. Assessment will be unable to precisely determine the causality as certain or unlikely, although, it will be valuable in categorizing the causal association as 'possible' adverse drug reactions and their scientific basis. Several of these detailed reports, when collated, can identify risk factors for possibilities of prevention or avoid harm. In the current situation of pandemic and uncertainty of experimental new and old repurposed drugs, causation needs to be viewed for the study drug with a public health perspective. After all, this is the best time tested approach to generate evidence and drug evaluation to prevent damage to prospective patients.","Desai, Mira K.",Perspect. Clin. Res.,,413

225773,Clinical course and outcome of patients with COVID-19 in Mumbai City: an observational study,2021,"RATIONAL: Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that primarily affect the respiratory system. Patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pneumonia and respiratory distress often require hospitalization, ICU admission, intubation and/or non-invasive ventilation, and circulatory support. Some experts suggest that the pathophysiology of traditional ARDS and that of the lung disease associated with COVID-19 are different. It is proposed that the severe hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients is the result of hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction and a large burden of microthrombi which result in intrapulmonary shunting. Therefore, COVID-related ARDS-like patterns of disease may not respond to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for early intubation and ARDS Network (ARDSNet) recommendations for FiO2-titrated Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) administration and ventilator support. Given the distinct pathophysiology of COVID-19-related ARDS, higher PEEP may indicate mechanical over-inflation of the alveoli resulting in volume trauma in addition to compromising preload and decreasing cardiac output, worsening the pulmonary hypoperfusion. The aim of this study was to examine the rate of death associated with initial and subsequent (48-hour) PEEP settings of 10cmH2O and higher in COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized that higher PEEP settings may lead to increased mortality. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who presented or were transferred to our facility with COVID-19 and were subsequently intubated from March 1st until April 30th, 2020. Charts were reviewed for initial and 48-hour PEEP settings. Mortality, SARS CoV2 results, clinical data and demographics were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients were included in the review. Of these, 53 patients had initial PEEP setting of &gt;10cmH2O and 46 patients had PEEP settings &gt;10cmH2O 48 hours after intubation. Thirty-seven patients had PEEP settings &gt;10cmH2O both initially and 48 hours later. Thirty-seven patients who had an initial PEEP setting of &gt;10 cmH220 died, (70%). Forty patients who had PEEP settings &gt;10cmH2O at 48hrs died (87%). Twenty-seven patients who had both a PEEP setting &gt;10 cmH2O initially and at 48 hours died (73%). CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be an association in COVID-19 patients between high mortality rates and high PEEP settings. The marked association is strong enough, in our view, to suggest that conventional ventilator settings recommended by ARDSNet may not apply to patients experiencing COVID-19-associated ARDS and in fact, may be leading to worse patient outcomes.","Chicoine, J.; Gonzalez, M.; Meyers, A.; Cardenas, J.

Spain has been the third country with the highest number of reported cases of COVID-19. In the face of the pandemic, the authorities of the Autonomous Community of Madrid led an unprecedented transformation of hospital services by increasing the number of beds available, setting up temporary field hospitals in fairgrounds, and transforming hotels into support centers for patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19. In the light that this crisis will continue to be a real threat for the years to come, our hospital pharmacies need to be better prepared for similar outbreaks in the future. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Hospital Pharmacy of Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón has faced four challenges: an exponential increase in the demand for resources, constant changes to therapeutic protocols and approaches, regulatory changes, and a dramatic impact on hospital staff (strain on human resources and psychological impact). This article is aimed at describing the main organizational changes implemented to the Department of Hospital Pharmacy of Hospital GU Gregorio Marañón and its relationship with other hospital pharmacies of the Community of Madrid. An account is provided of the strategies to be adopted for reorganizing a Department of Hospital Pharmacy and achieve a safe and effective use of medications. Strategies range from the creation of integral hospital task groups (COVID-crisis task group, protocolization task group, research task group) to the adaptation of the internal organization of the Department of Hospital Pharmacy, which encompasses aspects related to management and leadership; a communication plan (internal and external); staff management, and the reorganization and adaptation of processes.

This has caused confusion among both healthcare workers and the general population about what the proper precautions against COVID-19 are. This study investigated attitudes towards misinformation related to protective measures that can be taken against COVID-19. The study was conducted in Saudi Arabia using an online survey questionnaire during the first three months of lockdown responding to the pandemic. The sample size of the study was N = 1294, of which 275 were healthcare workers and 974 were non-healthcare workers. The findings indicate that the Saudi Arabian population has a ""Neutral"" attitude towards COVID-19-related misinformation, meaning that, overall, they neither agree nor disagree with the most common COVID-19-related misinformation. Both healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers displayed a ""Neutral"" attitude towards herbal remedies for COVID-19. The level of agreement regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus remaining in the throat for two days and the BCG vaccine protecting against COVID-19 was low. The findings of this research imply that knowledge dissemination is severely lacking in Saudi Arabia and that the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia should sincerely consider educating healthcare workers better about verified and true information regarding COVID-19.

228015,Epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in diabetic versus non-diabetic patients,2021,"Based on a vast number of US public opinion surveys the article considers the American attitudes towards the activities of President Donald Trump The analysis of public opinion during his presidency shows that many Americans do not approve of President Trump’s approach to the key domestic and foreign issues These public assessments might shape voting decisions during the upcoming elections in November 2020 Americans positively assess Trump’s activities in economy: they point to economic growth, a decrease in unemployment rate and expect positive changes However, many of them emphasize that tax cuts have mainly benefited the rich, whereas the majority of non-white population perceives Trump’s economic policy in a negative way In addition, most of Americans are extremely negative about the radical changes to the ACA (ObamaCare) US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change was one of the first Trump’s environmental initiatives At that time, in 2017, the surveys showed that a large majority of the population was against that (53%), whereas only 30% supported the decision As to immigration policies, Americans have picked a side: they are ready to accept illegal immigrants who came to the country as children;they are opposed to the construction of the US-Mexico border wall and say that the number of migrants should be the same as today or even rise but not go down These assessments go contrary to Trump’s policies Fifty-three percent of the voters consider that “US President Donald Trump did not tell the truth about his policy towards Ukraine”;54% say that “he abused his power regarding Ukraine”;52%, that Trump was impeding congressional investigation into his actions regarding Ukraine And 48% believe that Trump committed crimes as president (44% oppose that) Most Americans are critical of the Trump’s actions during the coronavirus outbreak, especially at a starting stage On the whole, 50% of Americans assess President Trump’s performance in a negative way;40% give positive assessments;10% have no opinion Economy is the only area where positive assessments overweigh the negative ones (50% vs 39%) В статье на основе изучения обширного массива результатов опросов общественного мнения в США рассматриваются отношения американцев к деятельности президента Дональда Трампа Анализ общественного мнения за время его президентства показывает, что многие американцы не разделяет подходы Трампа к ключевым проблемам внутренней и внешней политики На основании этих оценок будут формироваться электоральные намерения американских избирателей на предстоящих президентских выборах в ноябре 2020 года Американцы положительно оценивают действия Трампа в сфере экономики, отмечая экономический рост в стране, снижение безработицы, высказывая положительные прогнозы на будущее В то же время многие отмечают, что от снижения налогов выиграли, прежде всего, богатые слои, при этом среди небелого населения большинство негативно оценивает экономическую политику Трампа Также критически большинство американцев оценивают политику Трампа по отмене, радикальному изменению системы медицинского страхования, принятой при Бараке Обаме («Обамакер») Одним из первых шагов Трампа в области экологии и изменении климата стал выход США из Парижского соглашения по изменению климата Тогда же, в 2017 г , опросы показали, что большинство населения против этого - 53 %, в то время как поддержали этот шаг лишь 30 % По главным вопросам иммигрантской политики Трампа общественное мнение в основном определилось: американцы готовы принять незаконных иммигрантов, приехавших детьми, они против строительства стены на границе с Мексикой и считают, что число иммигрантов должно оставаться таким же, как сегодня, или увеличиться, а не сокращаться Эти оценки идут вразрез политике Трампа 53 % избирателей считают, что «президент США Дональд Трамп не говорил правду о своей политике в отношении Украины»;54 % - что он «злоупотребил своими полномочиями в действиях относительно Украины»;52 % - что Трамп препятствовал конгрессу в расследовании его действий по отношении к Украине И 48 % считают, что Трамп совершал преступления на посту президента, 44 % так не думают Большинство американцев критически оценивают действия президента Трампа во время эпидемии коронавируса, особенно в начальной фазе кризиса В целом деятельность Трампа на посту президента 50 % американцев оценивают отрицательно, 40 % положительно и 10 % не имеют мнения Лишь в области экономики положительные оценки превышают отрицательные - 50 %: 39 %","Popov, N.

228222,Delayed Spontaneous Bilateral Pneumothorax in a Previously Healthy Nonventilated COVID-19 Patient,2021,"We aimed to summarize reliable medical evidence by the meta-analysis of all published retrospective studies that examined data based on the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by clinical symptoms, molecular (RT-PCR) diagnosis, and characteristic CT imaging features in pregnant women. The MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, ClinicalKey, and CINAHL databases were used to select the studies. Then, 384 articles were received, including the studies until 01/May/2020. As a result of the full-text evaluation, 12 retrospective articles covering all the data related were selected. A total of 181 pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infections were included in the meta-analysis within the scope of these articles. According to the results, the incidence of fever was 38.1% (95% CI: 14.2-65%) and cough was 22% (95% CI: 10.8-35.2%) among all clinical features of pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, fever and cough are the most common symptoms in pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 91.8% (95% CI: 76.7-99.9%) of RT-PCR results are positive. Moreover, abnormal CT incidence is 97.9% (95% CI: 94.2-99.9%) positive. No case was death. However, as this virus spreads globally, it should not be overlooked that the incidence will increase in pregnant women and maybe in the risky group. RT-PCR and CT can be used together in an accurate and safe diagnosis. In conclusion, these findings will provide important guidance for current studies regarding the clinical features and correct detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women, as well as whether it will create emergency tables that will require the use of a viral drug.","Uygun-Can, Banu; Acar-Bolat, Bilge",Biomed Res Int,,413

We wanted to describe the effects of the national lockdown on the well-being of a cohort of Italian patients with cerebral palsy (CP) receiving botulinum toxin (BT) therapy and of their caregivers. Twenty-five patients receiving BT therapy were surveyed using the structuralized questionnaire by Dressler and Adib Saberi, while the caregivers were assessed using the Caregiver Burden Scale. The lockdown delayed BT therapy by 9 ± 2.8 months. Around 44% of the selected patients noticed increased muscle cramps, 24% increased muscle pain, and 32% both of them. Due to the lockdown, the patient's quality of life was reduced by 68.4 ± 21.1%. After the lockdown, 100% of patients perceived BT therapy as more important than before. Around 76% of the patients perceived the lockdown as inadequate and felt that their rights were not respected. The overall score of the Caregiver Burden Scale, as regarded before the lockdown, was 29.12 ± 11.63, while the overall score as regarded after the lockdown was 37.44 ± 14.85. The overall score increased, from before the lockdown to after the lockdown, for 92% of caregivers. The BT outpatient clinic's interruption was seen to significantly worsen the psychophysical condition of subjects with CP and the care burden of their caregivers, exposing them to greater stress than before. Therefore, any kind of BT treatment suspension or delay should be avoided.","Tarantino, Domiziano; Gnasso, Rossana; Migliore, Federico; Iommazzo, Irene; Sirico, Felice; Corrado, Bruno",Neurol. sci,,413

Therefore, we conducted this study to estimate the prevalence rate of anxiety and insomnia and identify associated risk factors among healthcare workers in Jilin, China, during the period from January 25 to February 25, 2020. Zung's Self-Reported Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale were used to diagnose anxiety and insomnia, respectively. Associated risk factors were identified through a multivariate logistic regression model. A total of 300 healthcare workers were invited and 236 completed the study. Of them, 234 (99.15%) were medical workers, 197 (83.47%) were working at frontline departments, and 159 (67.37%) were fighting against COVID-19. Fifty-seven respondents (24.15%) had anxiety (SAS index score &#8805;45) and 94 (39.83%) had insomnia (ISI score &#8805;8). Based on the multivariate analysis, contact with people from Hubei province during work (no vs not clear) [OR=0.25, 95%CI: 0.10-0.61] and personal protective equipment (PPE) (not in place vs in place) [OR=6.22, 95%CI: 2.23-17.40] were significantly correlated with anxiety. PPE (not in place vs in place) was the only significant risk factor of insomnia [OR=10.56, 95%CI: 4.00-27.87]. The prevalence of anxiety and insomnia was high in our study, reflecting the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers. The unavailability of PPE in place was a significant risk factor of both anxiety and insomnia.","Dong, Han-shuo; Gao, Jing-jing; Dong, Yu-Xiang; Han, Chun-xia; Sun, Li",Braz. j. med. biol. res,,413

There is an urgent need to search for an agent to treat the disease and control its progression. Boswellia serrata is traditionally used to treat chronic inflammatory diseases of the lung. This review aims to highlight currently published research that has shown evidence of potential therapeutic effects of boswellic acids (BA) and B. serrata extract against COVID-19 and associated conditions. We reviewed the published information up to March 2021. Studies were collected through a search of online electronic databases (academic libraries such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Egyptian Knowledge Bank). Several recent studies reported that BAs and B. serrata extract are safe agents and have multiple beneficial activities in treating similar symptoms experienced by patients with COVID-19. Because of the low oral bioavailability and improvement of buccal/oral cavity hygiene, traditional use by chewing B. serrata gum may be more beneficial than oral use. It is the cheapest option for a lot of poorer people. The promising effect of B. serrata and BA can be attributed to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, cardioprotective, anti-platelet aggregation, antibacterial, antifungal, and broad antiviral activity. B. serrata and BA act by multiple mechanisms. The most common mechanism may be through direct interaction with I&#954;B kinases and inhibiting nuclear factor-&#954;B-regulated gene expression. However, the most recent mechanism proposed that BA not only inhibited the formation of classical 5-lipoxygenase products but also produced anti-inflammatory LOX-isoform-selective modulators. In conclusion a small to moderate dose B. serrata extract may be useful in the enhancing adaptive immune response in mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19. However, large doses of BA may be beneficial in suppressing uncontrolled activation of the innate immune response. More clinical results are required to determine with certainty whether there is sufficient evidence of the benefits against COVID-19.","Gomaa, Adel A; Mohamed, Hamdy S; Abd-Ellatief, Rasha Bakheet; Gomaa, Mohamed A",Inflammopharmacology,,413

Here, we investigated the importance of age in household transmission dynamics. Methods: We enroled 112 households (291 participants) in a case-ascertained study in Bergen, Norway from 28th February to 4th April 2020, collecting demographic and clinical data from index patients and household members. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were measured in sera collected 6-8 weeks after index patient nasopharyngeal testing to define household attack rates. Findings: The overall attack rate was 45% (95% CI 38-53) assessed by serology, and 47% when also including seronegative RT-PCR positives. Serology identified a higher number of infected household members than RT-PCR. Attack rates were equally high in children (48%) and young adults (42%). The attack rate was 16% in asymptomatic household members and 42% in RT-PCR negative contacts. Older adults had higher antibody titres than younger adults. The risk of household transmission was higher when the index patient had fever (aOR 3.31 [95% CI 1.52-7.24]; p = 0.003) or dyspnoea (aOR 2.25 [95% CI 1.80-4.62]; p = 0.027) during acute illness. Interpretation: Serological assays provide more sensitive and robust estimates of household attack rates than RT-PCR. Children are equally susceptible to infection as young adults. Negative RT-PCR or lack of symptoms are not sufficient to rule out infection in household members.

Considering the rapid spread of the infection, all patients in France must be considered as potentially infected by the virus. Nevertheless, patients without clinical or radiological (CT scan) markers of COVID-19, and with negative nasopharyngeal sample within 24h of surgery, are at low risk of being infected. Instructions for personal protection include specific wound dressings and decontamination of all material used. The operating room should be ventilated after each tracheostomy and the pressure of the room should be neutral or negative. Percutaneous tracheostomy is to be preferred over surgical cervicotomy in order to reduce aerosolization and to avoid moving patients from the intensive care unit to the operating room. Ventilation must be optimized during the procedure, to limit patient oxygen desaturation. Drug assisted neuromuscular blockage is advised to reduce coughing during tracheostomy tube insertion. An experienced team is mandatory to secure and accelerate the procedure as well as to reduce risk of contamination.","Schultz, P; Morvan, J-B; Fakhry, N; Morinière, S; Vergez, S; Lacroix, C; Bartier, S; Barry, B; Babin, E; Couloigner, V; Atallah, I",Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,,413

The objective was to determine the frequency and distribution of currently known risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in an MS population. METHODS: Multiple sclerosis patients with at least one complete case report between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 from the Innsbruck MS database were cross-sectionally included. Frequencies of currently estimated COVID-19 mortality risk factors were analyzed, and the cumulative risk was calculated by a recently developed score. For every risk group, the proportions of patients under DMT and immunosuppressive treatment were determined. RESULTS: Of 1931 MS patients, 63.4% had low risk of COVID-19 mortality, 26% had mild risk, 8.8% had a moderate risk, whereas a combined 0.9% had high or very high risk of COVID-19 mortality. Of the patients at high or very high risk, only one patient received DMT and none had an immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based MS cohort, the proportion of patients at high risk of COVID-19 mortality is below 1%. Importantly, the vast majority of these MS patients did not receive any DMT.","Bsteh, G; Bitschnau, C; Hegen, H; Auer, M; Di Pauli, F; Rommer, P; Deisenhammer, F; Berger, T",Eur. j. neurol,,413

245155,COVID-19 mortality among pregnant women in Mexico: A retrospective cohort study,2020,"Producing or sharing Child Sexual Exploitation Material (CSEM) is a serious crime fought vigorously by Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). When an LEA seizes a computer from a potential producer or consumer of CSEM, they need to analyze the suspect's hard disk's files looking for pieces of evidence. However, a manual inspection of the file content looking for CSEM is a time-consuming task. In most cases, it is unfeasible in the amount of time available for the Spanish police using a search warrant. Instead of analyzing its content, another approach that can be used to speed up the process is to identify CSEM by analyzing the file names and their absolute paths. The main challenge for this task lies behind dealing with short text distorted deliberately by the owners of this material using obfuscated words and user-defined naming patterns. This paper presents and compares two approaches based on short text classification to identify CSEM files. The first one employs two independent supervised classifiers, one for the file name and the other for the path, and their outputs are later on fused into a single score. Conversely, the second approach uses only the file name classifier to iterate over the file's absolute path. Both approaches operate at the character n-grams level, while binary and orthographic features enrich the file name representation, and a binary Logistic Regression model is used for classification. The presented file classifier achieved an average class recall of 0.98. This solution could be integrated into forensic tools and services to support Law Enforcement Agencies to identify CSEM without tackling every file's visual content, which is computationally much more highly demanding.","Al-Nabki, Mhd Wesam; Fidalgo, Eduardo; Alegre, Enrique; Alaiz-Rodr'iguez, Roc'io",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01113v2.pdf,413

247654,Needlestick Injuries Among Healthcare Workers Administering COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States,2021,"A comprehensive assessment of smart grids is critical for their development. Existing scientific research testifies to the urgency and complexity of the problem of implementing smart grids effectively, both in terms of a single project performance and from the standpoint of creating a local, and later global, energy system. The multidimensionality of smart grids makes it challenging to assess the effectiveness of their implementation. Difficulties in evaluation arise because it is challenging to consider technical, technological, economic, and other relevant aspects of smart grids’ development within a single evaluation system. There are currently a significant number of smart grid assessment systems. However, it remains debatable how systematically and comprehensively they measure the efficiency of a smart grid. This, in turn, raises the question of whether there is a universal evaluation system that integrally considers all the crucial components of smart grids and is suitable for evaluating smart grid projects of different content. This article analyzes the most well-known approaches to comprehensive assessment of smart grids according to the completeness of their coverage of smart grids’ most critical components. This paper identifies the essential areas for assessing smart grids according to the most cited and authoritative research and regulatory documents of the European Union. As a result, seven groups of indicators were identified. These groups of indicators are the basis for comparative analysis of the comprehensive assessment approaches of smart grids. The results of the study should help determine the appropriateness of applying a particular evaluation system. In addition, the analysis of existing evaluation systems allows the shaping of a universal approach to evaluating smart grids comprehensively and systematically.","Lyulyov, Oleksii Vakulenko Ihor Pimonenko Tetyana Kwilinski Aleksy Dzwigol Henryk Dzwigol-Barosz Mariola",Energies,,413

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is high pathogenic to intestines, causing diarrhea, even death in piglets. To investigate the detailed relationship between PEDV infection and intestinal microbiota, the composition and distribution of intestinal microbiota from pigs were first analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing technology. The results demonstrated that the composition and distribution of microbes in different intestinal segments were quite similar between 1-week-old and 2-week-old piglets but different from 4-week-old (weaned) piglets. Then piglets at different ages were inoculated with PEDV. The results showed that the 1-week-old piglets exhibited the most severe pathogenicity comparing to the other age groups. Further investigations indicated that Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, and Lactococcus in the intestinal microbiota of piglets were significantly changed by PEDV infection. These results strengthen our understanding of viruses influencing intestinal microbes and remind us of the potential association between PEDV and intestinal microbes.","Yang, Shanshan; Li, Yang; Wang, Bin; Yang, Ning; Huang, Xin; Chen, Qingbo; Geng, Shuxian; Zhou, Yawei; Shi, Han; Wang, Leyi; Brugman, Sylvia; Savelkoul, Huub; Liu, Guangliang",Virology,,413

However, the overall fatalities data from the Government's ONS (Office of National Statistics) most recent report on deaths by religion shows that Jews (very few of whom are classified as BAME) have a much higher risk than those of religions (Hindu, Sikh, Muslim) with predominantly BAME people. This apparently contradictory result is, according to the ONS statistical analysis, implicitly explained by age as the report claims that, when 'adjusted for age' Muslims have the highest fatality risk. However, the report fails to provide the raw data to support this. There are many factors other than just age that must be incorporated into any analysis of the observed data before making definitive conclusions about risk based on religion/ethnicity. We propose the need for a causal model for this. If we discount unknown genetic factors, then religion and ethnicity have NO impact at all on a person's Covid19 death risk once we know their age, underlying medical conditions, work/living conditions, and extent of social distancing.","Fenton, Norman",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07083v1.pdf,413

Several studies have shown the therapeutic potential effect of MSC or their derived products. However, the functional heterogeneity of MSC constitutes an important barrier for transferring these capabilities to the clinic. MSC heterogeneity depends on their origin (biological niche) or the conditions of potential donors (age, diseases or unknown factors). It is accepted that many culture conditions of the artificial niche to which they are subjected, such as O2 tension, substrate and extracellular matrix cues, inflammatory stimuli or genetic manipulations can influence their resulting phenotype. Therefore, to attain a more personalized and precise medicine, a correct selection of MSC is mandatory, based on their functional potential, as well as the need to integrate all the existing information to achieve an optimal improvement of MSC features in the artificial niche.","Costa, Luis A; Eiro, Noemi; Fraile, María; Gonzalez, Luis O; Saá, Jorge; Garcia-Portabella, Pablo; Vega, Belén; Schneider, José; Vizoso, Francisco J",Cell. mol. life sci,,413

Viral persistence in the setting of immunosuppression raises concern for viral evolution. MethodsAmplification of sub-genomic transcripts for the E gene (sgE) was done on nasopharyngeal samples over the course of 355 days in a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 who had previously undergone CAR T cell therapy and had persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs. Whole genome sequencing was performed on samples from the patients original presentation and 10 months later. ResultsOver the course of almost a year, the virus accumulated a unique in-frame deletion in the amino-terminal domain of the spike protein, and complete deletion of ORF7b and ORF8, the first report of its kind in an immunocompromised patient. Also, minority variants that were identified in the early samples--reflecting the heterogeneity of the initial infection--were found to be fixed late in the infection. Remdesivir and high-titer convalescent plasma treatment were given, and the infection was eventually cleared after 335 days of infection. ConclusionsThe unique viral mutations found in this study highlight the importance of analyzing viral evolution in protracted SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in immunosuppressed hosts, and the implication of these mutations in the emergence of viral variants. SummaryWe report an immunocompromised patient with persistent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection for 335 days.

The quality of their Mediterranean diet was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index quetsionnaire for children and adolescents. Anthropometric variables were collected through a self-reported questionnaire, and for the calculation of body mass index the Quetelet index (kg/m2) was used. Results: the descriptive analysis showed no differences in the perception of loneliness, happiness, or health, quality of diet, or anthropometric variables (p > 0.005), except for weight (p < 0.005), according to sex. The inferential analysis showed that higher values in quality of diet are correlated with higher scores in perceived happiness and health (p < 0.005). In turn, the linear regression test showed an association between quality of diet and perception of happiness after the model was adjusted for normal weight (R2 = 0.382; p < 0.005). Likewise, it showed a significant association between quality of diet and perception of health after the model was adjusted for overweight schoolchildren (R2 = 0.455; p < 0.005). Conclusion: the association between perceived health and happiness with quality of diet seems to be moderated by weight status.","Carrillo Lopez, Pedro José; Rosa Guillamón, Andrés; Tárraga López, Pedro Juan; García Cantó, Eliseo",Nutr Hosp,,413

The aim of this work is to describe the response of the Mental Health Network of the Salamanca´ Area (Spain) to this crisis and the reorganization of its resources within the first 8 weeks after the state of alarm was declared. The Psychiatry Service applied a contingency plan which included the reorganization of the human resources, the closure of some of the units and the implementation of telemedicine programs along with two specific programs, namely a mental health assistance program in the context of the infection by coronavirus, and another program for homeless people. 9.038 phone interviews were carried out in the outpatients and community mental health programs. The activity in subacute and acute wards, as well as that of the day hospital programs was decreased to 50%. Based on that this real-world response provided we concluded that the usage of telemedicine is promising in patients with any kind of disorder. Its implementation in daily practice will be considered in the future. Research must continue on COVID-19's impact on patients with mental disorders and Psychiatry's necessary adaptations and new approaches to them.","Roncero, Carlos; García-Ullán, Llanyra; de la Iglesia-Larrad, Javier I; Martín, Carmen; Andrés, Pilar; Ojeda, Ana; González-Parra, David; Pérez, Javier; Fombellida, Clara; Álvarez-Navares, Ana; Benito, José Antonio; Dutil, Virginia; Lorenzo, Carolina; Montejo, Ángel Luis",Psychiatry Res,,413

254683,Radiological mimickers of COVID-19 pneumonia: a pictorial review,2020,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to a worldwide shortage of ventilators. This shortage has initiated discussions on how to support multiple patients with a single ventilator (ventilator splitting). Ventilator splitting is incompletely tested, experimental and the effects have not been fully characterised. This study investigated the effect of ventilator splitting on system variables (inspiratory pressure, flow and volume) and the possibility of different ventilation targets for each limb using only standard hospital equipment. Experiments were conducted on two test lungs with different compliances (0.02 l.cmH2 O-1 and 0.04 l.cmH2 O-1 ). The ventilator was used in both pressure and volume control modes and was set to ventilate the low compliance lungs at end-tidal volumes of 500 ± 20 ml. A flow restrictor apparatus consisting of a Hoffman clamp and tracheal tube was connected in series to the inspiratory limb of the high compliance test lungs and the resistance modified to achieve end-tidal volumes of 500 ± 20 ml. The restriction apparatus successfully modified the inspiratory pressure, minute ventilation and volume delivered to the high compliance test lungs in both pressure control (27.3-17.8 cmH2 O, 15.2-8.0 l.min-1 and 980-499 ml, respectively) and volume control (21.0-16.7 cmH2 O, 10.7-7.9 l.min-1 and 659-498 ml, respectively) ventilation modes. Ventilator splitting is not condoned by the authors. However, these experiments demonstrate the capacity to simultaneously ventilate two test lungs of different compliances, and using only standard hospital equipment, modify the delivered pressure, flow and volume in each test lung.","Clarke, A L; Stephens, A F; Liao, S; Byrne, T J; Gregory, S D",Anaesthesia,,413
255187,Comparison of the antiviral effect of Arbidol and Chloroquine in treating COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Due to sedentary lifestyle, not only the risk of many chronic diseases and multimorbidity increase, but older people also lose their functional independency earlier. The first step to design effective interventions aiming to decrease sedentary lifestyle is to explore the factors associated with sedentary lifestyle. AIM: Our aims were to describe the type and duration of sitting activities and to examine the factors associated with sedentary lifestyle, namely 1) sociodemographic factors (i.e., age, gender, education level, marital status); 2) medical factors (chronic diseases, use of walking aids); 3) lifestyle factors (i.e., duration of institutionalization, smoking status) among older people living in nursing homes providing long-term care. METHOD: Data collected with questionnaire from 248 participants were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 159 participants (64.1%) in total who were characterized by sedentary lifestyle. In our sample, the sedentary lifestyle was associated with the smoking status, the number of age-related chronic diseases, the duration of institutionalization, and the use of walking aids. CONCLUSION: The older people who have more chronic diseases, who are smokers and were institutionalized earlier are more likely to be characterised by sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, decision-making graduate health-care professionals should preferably focus their efforts on these older people in order to change the sedentary lifestyle by providing information about risk of this lifestyle, and offering programs relevant to older people's interests and functional status.

Thus, it is essential to undertake COVID-19 research and to identify therapeutic interventions in which computational modeling and virtual screening of lead molecules provide significant insights. The present study aimed to predict the interaction potential of natural lead molecules against prospective protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular modeling, docking, and dynamic simulation. Based on the literature survey and database search, fourteen molecular targets were selected and the three targets which lack the native structures were computationally modeled. The drug-likeliness and pharmacokinetic features of ninety-two natural molecules were predicted. Four lead molecules with ideal drug-likeliness and pharmacokinetic properties were selected and docked against fourteen targets, and their binding energies were compared with the binding energy of the interaction between Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine to their usual targets. The stabilities of selected docked complexes were confirmed by MD simulation and energy calculations. Four natural molecules demonstrated profound binding to most of the prioritized targets, especially, Hyoscyamine and Tamaridone to spike glycoprotein and Rotiorinol-C and Scutifoliamide-A to replicase polyprotein-1ab main protease of SARS-CoV-2 showed better binding energy, conformational and dynamic stabilities compared to the binding energy of Chloroquine and its usual target glutathione-S-transferase. The aforementioned lead molecules can be used to develop novel therapeutic agents towards the protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, and the study provides significant insight for structure-based drug development against COVID-19.","Skariyachan, Sinosh; Gopal, Dharshini; Muddebihalkar, Aditi G; Uttarkar, Akshay; Niranjan, Vidya",Comput Biol Med,,413

The Role of ACE2",2020,"The Guangdong government implemented lockdown measures on January 23, 2020, to ease the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These measures prohibit a series of human activities and lead to a great reduction in anthropogenic emissions. Starting on February 20, all companies resumed work and production, and emissions gradually recovered. To investigate the response of air pollutants in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) to the emission reduction and recovery related to COVID-19 lockdown, we used the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to estimate the changes in air pollutants, including three periods: Period I (January 10 to January 22, 2020), Period II (January 23 to February 19, 2020), Period III (February 20 to March 9, 2020). During Period II, under the concurrent influence of emissions and meteorology, air quality improved significantly with PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 decreased by 52%, 67%, and 25%, respectively. O3 had no obvious changes in most cities, which mainly due to the synergetic effects of emissions and meteorology. In Period III, with the recovery of emissions and the changes in meteorology, the increase of secondary components was faster than that of primary PM2.5 (PPM), which indicated that changes in PPM concentration were more sensitive to emissions reduction. O3 concentration increased as emission and temperature rising. Our findings elucidate that more effective emission control strategies should be implemented in PRD to alleviate the increasingly serious pollution situation.","Wang, Siyu; Zhang, Yanli; Ma, Jinlong; Zhu, Shengqiang; Shen, Juanyong; Wang, Peng; Zhang, Hongliang",Sci Total Environ,,413
258975,The COVID-GRAM Tool for Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 in Europe,2021,"Like all other medical specialties, radiotherapy has been deeply influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had severe influence on the entire patient trajectory in oncology, from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up. Many examples of how to deal with patient and staff safety, shortness of staff and other resources and the quest to continue high-quality, evidence-based treatment have been presented. The use of telemedicine and telehealth is frequently presented as a part of the solution to overcome these challenges. Some of the available presented solutions will only apply in an acute, local setting, whereas others might inspire the community to improve quality and cost-effectiveness of radiotherapy as well as knowledge sharing in the future. Some of the unresolved issues in many of the available technical solutions are related to data security and public regulation, for example, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the EU and HIPAA compliance (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the USA. Using a solution that involves a supplier's server in a non-EU country is problematic within the EU. In this paper we shortly review the influence of COVID-19 on radiotherapy. We describe some of the possible solutions for telehealth in target delineation - a crucial part of high-quality radiotherapy, which often requires multidisciplinary effort, hands-on corporation, and high-quality multimodal imaging. Hereafter, our own technical solution will be presented as a case.","Jensen, Kenneth; Dalby, Rikke Beese; Bouchelouche, Kirsten; Pedersen, Erik Morre; Kalmar, Stefan",Semin. nucl. med,,413

A skewed distribution where few individuals or events are responsible for the majority of transmission can result in explosive, superspreading events, which produce rapid and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or late in epidemics. Anticipating and preventing superspreading events can produce large reductions in overall transmission rates. Here, we present a stochastic compartmental (SEIR) epidemiological model framework for estimating transmission parameters from multiple imperfectly observed data streams, including reported cases, deaths, and mobile phone-based mobility that incorporates individual-level heterogeneity in transmission using previous estimates for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. We parameterize the model for COVID-19 epidemic dynamics by estimating a time-varying transmission rate that incorporates the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies that change over time, in five epidemiologically distinct settings-Los Angeles and Santa Clara Counties, California; Seattle (King County), Washington; Atlanta (Dekalb and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County), Florida. We find that the effective reproduction number (RE) dropped below 1 rapidly in all five locations following social distancing orders in mid-March, 2020, but that gradually increasing mobility starting around mid-April led to an RE once again above 1 in late May (Los Angeles, Miami, and Atlanta) or early June (Santa Clara County and Seattle). However, we find that increased social distancing starting in mid-July in response to epidemic resurgence once again dropped RE below 1 in all locations by August 14. We next used the fitted model to ask: how does truncating the individual-level transmission rate distribution (which removes periods of time with especially high individual transmission rates and thus models superspreading events) affect epidemic dynamics and control? We find that interventions that truncate the transmission rate distribution while partially relaxing social distancing are broadly effective, with impacts on epidemic growth on par with the strongest population-wide social distancing observed in April, 2020.

To describe the importance of age and chronic conditions in predicting COVID-19 related outcomes. METHODS: Search strategies were conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE. Daily alerts were created. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies met our inclusion criteria. Studies varied broadly in sample size (n=21 to more than 17,000,000). Participants mean age ranged from 48 years to 80 years and the proportion of male participants ranged from 44%-82%. The most prevalent underlying conditions in patients with COVID-19 were hypertension (range: 15% - 69%), diabetes (8% - 40%), cardiovascular disease (4% - 61%), chronic pulmonary disease (1% - 33%), and chronic kidney disease (range 1% - 48%).

Its clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcome in kidney transplant recipients are little known. Therefore, we describe 22 kidney transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia. METHODS: All kidney transplant recipients who referred to the Razi Hospital of Rasht with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 20 to 19th of April 2020 have been included in this observational study. RESULTS: We present 22 cases of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients (median age 52 years [interquartile range 40.75-62.75 years]) and baseline eGFR 60 (mL/min/1.73 m2 ) (44.75-86.75). Patients complained of cough (72.7%), dyspnea (63.6%), fever (68.2%), and chill (72.7%) with greater prevalence.

As the circulating common cold coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 share some homologous sequences with SARS-CoV-2, beta-coronavirus cross-reactive T-cell responses could influence the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the course of COVID-19. To investigate the role of beta-coronavirus cross-reactive T-cells, we analyzed the T-cell response against a 15 amino acid long peptide (SCoV-DP15: DLSPRWYFYYLGTGP) from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein sequence with a high homology to the corresponding sequence (QLLPRWYFYYLGTGP) in OC43 and HKU1. SCoV-DP15-specific T-cells were detected in 4 out of 23 (17.4%) SARS-CoV-2-seronegative healthy donors. As HIV-1 infection is a potential risk factor for COVID-19, we also studied a cohort of HIV-1-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. 44 out of these 116 HIV-1-infected patients (37.9%) showed a specific recognition of the SCoV-DP15 peptide or of shorter peptides within SCoV-DP15 by CD4+ T-cells and/or by CD8+ T-cells. We could define several new cross-reactive HLA-I-restricted epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein such as SPRWYFYYL (HLA-B*07, HLA-B*35), DLSPRWYFYY (HLA-A*02), LSPRWYFYY (HLA-A*29), WYFYYLGTGP and WYFYYLGT. Epitope specific CD8+ T-cell lines recognized corresponding epitopes within OC43 and HKU1 to a similar degree or even at lower peptide concentrations suggesting that they were induced by infection with OC43 or HKU1. Our results confirm that SARS-CoV-2-seronegative subjects can target SARS-CoV-2 not only by beta-coronavirus cross-reactive CD4+ T-cells but also by cross-reactive CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (CTL). The delineation of cross-reactive T-cell epitopes contributes to an efficient epitope-specific immunomonitoring of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells. Further prospective studies are needed to prove a protective role of cross-reactive T-cells and their restricting HLA alleles for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The frequent observation of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in HIV-1-infected subjects could be a reason that treated HIV-1 infection does not seem to be a strong risk factor for the development of severe COVID-19.","Schmidt, Katja G; Nganou-Makamdop, Krystelle; Tenbusch, Matthias; El Kenz, Boutaina; Maier, Clara; Lapuente, Dennis; Überla, Klaus; Spriewald, Bernd; Bergmann, Silke; Harrer, Ellen G; Harrer, Thomas",Front Immunol,,413

Since then, the virus has quickly spread worldwide, leading the World Health Organization to declare it as a pandemic; by the end of April 2020, the number of cases exceeded 3 million. Due to the high infectivity rate, SARS-CoV-2 is difficult to contain, making disinfectant protocols vital, especially for essential, highly trafficked areas such as hospitals, grocery stores, and delivery centers. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, best practices to slow the spread rely on good hand hygiene, including proper handwashing practices as well as the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. However, they provide warning against sanitizing products containing benzalkonium chloride (BAC), which has sparked concern in both the scientific community as well as the general public as BAC, a common quaternary ammonium compound (QAC), is ubiquitous in soaps and cleaning wipes as well as hospital sanitation kits. This viewpoint aims to highlight the outdated and incongruous data in the evaluation of BAC against the family of known coronaviruses and points to the need for further evaluation of the efficacy of QACs against coronaviruses.","Schrank, Cassandra L; Minbiole, Kevin P C; Wuest, William M",ACS infect. dis,,413
267581,Comparison of Covid-19 Mitigation and Decompression Strategies among Homeless Shelters: a Prospective Cohort Study,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread globally in a few short months. Substantial evidence now supports preliminary conclusions about transmission that can inform rational, evidence-based policies and reduce misinformation on this critical topic. This article presents a comprehensive review of the evidence on transmission of this virus. Although several experimental studies have cultured live virus from aerosols and surfaces hours after inoculation, the real-world studies that detect viral RNA in the environment report very low levels, and few have isolated viable virus. Strong evidence from case and cluster reports indicates that respiratory transmission is dominant, with proximity and ventilation being key determinants of transmission risk. In the few cases where direct contact or fomite transmission is presumed, respiratory transmission has not been completely excluded. Infectiousness peaks around a day before symptom onset and declines within a week of symptom onset, and no late linked transmissions (after a patient has had symptoms for about a week) have been documented. The virus has heterogeneous transmission dynamics: Most persons do not transmit virus, whereas some cause many secondary cases in transmission clusters called ""superspreading events."" Evidence-based policies and practices should incorporate the accumulating knowledge about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to help educate the public and slow the spread of this virus.","Meyerowitz, Eric A; Richterman, Aaron; Gandhi, Rajesh T; Sax, Paul E",Ann. intern. med,,413
267973,Tocilizumab in Treatment for Patients With COVID-19,2021,"The paper contributes towards deciphering and decoding the misery of the urban poor in light of the COVID-19 scourge. The paper unpacks urban poverty in light of the corona virus. The emergence of the COVID-19 and the lack of any vaccines requires physical distancing as preventative measures to contain and reduce the spread of the virus. Governments across the world, including in Anglophone Sub Saharan Africa have implemented lockdown measures. The COVID-19 pandemic is happening within settlements where the majority of the population lives from hand to mouth. In Anglophone sub-Saharan Africa because of urbanisation and increased urban poverty, COVID-19 scourge has had a huge impact on the urban poor. The COVID-19 is likely to devastate economies and the community. For rapidly growing, densely populated and poorly planned settlements, the situation is tragic for these inhabitants. Nation states lockdown and social and physical distancing in response to the pandemic have escalated their misery. The paper adopts a critical review of literature anchored in case study analysis, document analysis and scanning from reports. Results point to redefining the way humanity has related, functioned and conceptualised realities. There is need to go beyond prevention from infection as majority of urban dwellers are in the informal sector or unemployed. For the urban poor, strategies for social distancing may not be possible or effective. People are being asked to make choices between being hungry and risk of getting infected. The paper recommends planning response at national, regional and local level bearing in mind informal settlements, high densities and forms of overcrowding which have been placed as hotspots for the virus. There is need for rebuilding societies, during and beyond COVID-19 calling for immediate disaster risk planning adaptation and transformation to promote resilience.","Chirisa, Innocent; Mutambisi, Tafadzwa; Chivenge, Marcyline; Mabaso, Elias; Matamanda, Abraham R; Ncube, Roselin",GeoJournal,,413
268330,Influence of thyroxine supplementation on orthodontically-induced tooth movement and/or inflammatory root resorption: a systematic review,2020,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the effect COVID-19 pandemic on the daily urology practice of the level 3 centre located in one of the most affected regions in Turkey. We also aimed to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients whose procedures and surgeries had to be postponed due to COVID-19-related restrictions. METHODS: The number of patients admitted to the outpatient clinic, outpatient procedures, emergency consultation requests, hospitalised patients and the total number of surgeries between March 10, 2020 and June 15, 2020 were evaluated. These numbers were compared with the same period of 2019. Subsequently, patients who could not be operated or whose elective surgeries were postponed between March 10, 2020 and June 15, 2020 were determined(n:96). These patients were asked to fill out Beck Depression Inventory(BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory(STAI). The presence of difference between the baseline anxiety levels and the anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic was investigated. Afterwards, these patients were divided into two groups based on planned procedures as oncological group (group1) and non-oncological group (group2). The presence of a difference between the anxiety and depression levels between the groups was investigated. RESULTS: There was a drastic decline in number of patients in all assessed parameters. The least amount of change was seen in the number of emergency consultations. The evaluation of anxiety and depression scores of the patients showed a significant difference between their STAI-S and STAI-T scores (51.8 ± 9.3, 38.2 ± 7.5, respectively)(P < .001). STAI-S scores of the patients were found to be compatible with severe anxiety. The patients' mean BDI score was found to be 15 ± 8.9, which indicated mild depression. However, the age and STAI-S values were significantly higher in group1. CONCLUSION: We noted that anxiety and depression levels increased in patients whose operations were delayed because of pandemic-related restrictions, especially in oncological patients. We believe that an important contribution can be made to the protection of public health by planning advance psychosocial interventions for high-risk groups during pandemics.","Micoogullari, Uygar; Kisa, Erdem; Yucel, Cem; Ozbilen, Mert Hamza; Karaca, Erkin; Cakici, Mehmet Caglar; Ozcift, Burak; Ilbey, Yusuf Ozlem",Int J Clin Pract,,413

270922,889 Did institutional changes and patient behaviors surrounding COVID-19 affect perinatal outcomes?,2021,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was previously unknown, and we are learning about it day by day, but pandemic-associated ethical dilemmas have been studied and discussed for years. Triage means not only ranking in terms of importance (prioritisation) but also allocation of limited medical resources. Survival, post epidemic-quality of life, and consumption of medical resources required to achieve the set goal are crucial for making triage decisions. The pandemic triage decisions should be based on a protocol, considering the need for medical measures and therapy benefits. The first step is to consider the exclusion criteria and the risk of death. The next step is sequential clinical assessment, repeatable at defined intervals. It seems that the preferable solution is to triage all the patients and give priority to those who would benefit more. A prerequisite for allocating insufficient medical resources is public trust in the criteria for allocation.","Kucewicz-Czech, Ewa; Damps, Maria",Anaesthesiol Intensive Ther,,413

He then underwent tracheotomy, retained the tube for 2 months, then was discharged home on 10 L/O2/min breathing via a tracheostomy collar. We were consulted for tracheostomy tube decannulation. Mechanical insufflation exsufffation was used via the tracheostomy tube to clear secretions, increase vital capacity, and normalize O2 saturation. He practiced nasal and mouthpiece noninvasive ventilatory support (NVS) once a capped fenestrated cuffless tracheostomy tube was placed although he did not need NVS after decannulation. He was decannulated despite O2 dependence. While he required antibiotics for almost 3 months prior to decannulation and after it, he had no further episodes of lung infection for at least the next 4 months from the point of decannulation.","Giménez, Gloria C; Müller-Thies, Marlene; Prado, Francisco J; Bach, John R",Am. j. phys. med. rehabilit,,413
273009,Pharmacological strategies used to manage symptoms of patients dying of COVID-19: A rapid systematic review,2021,"AimsThis systematic review aims to discuss the extent to which the measures undertaken to control the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries have affected those with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). The coronavirus pandemic is still raging on in many countries and its effects will still be felt years from now and previous studies have shown that it has impacted other mental illnesses. AN cases are on the rise and the nature of the illness has deadly consequences, therefore it is paramount to discuss the relationship between the COVID-19 measures and symptomatology of AN to ensure appropriate services are in place to deal with potential outcomes.MethodSystematic search of the PubMed database gave thirty-three total results with seven of these used in this review. These studies met the inclusion criteria;examples include primary studies and use of the English Language. The exclusion criteria involved literature reviews, studies with less than ten participants and studies not separating AN from other eating disorders.ResultMany studies were cross sectional in nature except two longitudinal studies. Anorexic symptomology increased in the majority of papers in this review. Specifically restricting intake has increased compared to before lockdown measures. Physical activity has varied on an individual level in most studies potentially due to compensatory behaviours. Co-morbid psychopathologies were also noted during these studies. There are many factors behind these changes such as food insecurity, the effect of media and social media, uncertainty and the lack of social interaction. A number of participants across the studies were dissatisfied with treatment services during lockdowns. Variability in study results may be due to the differences in measures between countries and the use of self-reported cases compared to those contacted through care services. Limitations of this review are largely due to the how current the topic is and recommendations for the future include reviewing new studies that are published and to review the situation once the full impact of COVID-19 is known.ConclusionPatients with AN have struggled more due to the COVID-19 measures and the true effect of the pandemic is yet to be felt. Further studies and reviews should be conducted. The appropriate services should be put into place to ensure patients are supported effectively.","Mehta, Krishna",BJPsych Open,,413

By utilizing social innovation approach that explores the relationship between causes for human needs and emergence of socially innovative food initiatives, the article examines how the CSA projects emerge and why, what is their innovative role as part of the social economy and what is their transformative potential. Based on qualitative data from four different models of CSA case studies in different regions of Wales, UK, and by using concepts from an alternative model for social innovation (ALMOLIN) as analytical tool, the article demonstrates that the Welsh CSA cases play distinctive roles as part of the social economy. They satisfy the needs for ecologically sound and ethically produced food, grown within communities of like-minded people and they empower individuals and communities at micro level, while at the same time experiment with how to be economically sustainable and resilient on a small scale. The paper argues that in order to become 'workable utopias', the CSA initiatives need to overcome the barriers that prevent them from replicating, participating in policies and decision-making at macro level, and scaling up.","Mert-Cakal, Tezcan; Miele, Mara",Agric Human Values,,413
276631,Cardiac complications during the active phase of COVID-19: review of the current evidence,2021,"COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019 in the Wuhan city of China, and since then it has spread worldwide taking a heavy toll on human life and economy. COVID-19 infection is commonly associated with symptoms like coughing, fever, and shortness of breath, besides, the reports of muscle pain, anosmia, hyposmia, and loss of taste are becoming evident. Recent reports suggest the pathogenic invasion of the SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS, that could thereby result in devastating long term complications, primarily because some of these complications may go unnoticed for a long time. Evidence suggest that the virus could enter the CNS through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, neuronal transport, haematogenous route, and nasal route via olfactory bulb, cribriform plate, and propagates through trans-synaptic signalling, and shows retrograde movement into the CNS along nerve fiber. COVID-19 induces CNS inflammation and neurological degenerative damage through a diverse mechanism which includes ACE-2 receptor damage, cytokine-associated injury or cytokine storm syndrome, secondary hypoxia, demyelination, blood-brain barrier disruption, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Viral invasion into the CNS has been reported to show association with complications like Parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disorder, meningitis, encephalopathy, anosmia, hyposmia, anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, seizures, stroke, etc. This review provides a detailed discussion of the CNS pathogenesis of COVID-19. Authors conclude that the COVID-19 cannot just be considered as a disorder of the pulmonary or peripheral system, rather it has a significant CNS involvement. Therefore, CNS aspects of the COVID-19 should be monitored very closely to prevent long term CNS complications, even after the patient has recovered from COVID-19.","Nagu, Priyanka; Parashar, Arun; Behl, Tapan; Mehta, Vineet",Rev Neurosci,,413

Despite the national goals and the existence of comprehensive testing for the detection of asymptomatic or presymptomatic SARS-CoV­2 infections in all inpatients, no equivalent screening with rapid antigen tests has yet been established for outpatients. The acceptance of such screening with associated waiting times and inconvenience for affected patients has been insufficiently investigated. OBJECTIVE: We performed a self-administered anonymous survey of outpatients on their willingness to comply with the hygiene requirements, to undergo rapid antigen screening tests for asymptomatic/presymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV­2 and to receive SARS-CoV­2 vaccination. RESULTS: From 7 to 15 December 2020, 534 patients completed the survey, 195 (37%) from rheumatism and 339 (63%) from orthopedic outpatient clinics. Most patients accepted wearing a mouth-nose covering (475/534, 89%) and attending clinics without an accompanying person to prevent overcrowding of the waiting areas (450/534, 84%). A large majority (428/534 patients, 80%) accepted mandatory screening with rapid antigen tests and the associated waiting time of 15-20â¯min outside the hospital (449/534, 84%). More than half of the responders reported willingness to receive a SARS-CoV­2 vaccination (yes, immediately 137 (26%), yes, maybe 142 (27%) patients), with significantly (pâ¯<â¯0.05) more male, more rheumatic and more patients older than 60 years indicating a wish to be vaccinated.

Acute respiratory syndrome seems to be the most common manifestation of COVID-19. A high proportion of patients require intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation (MV) to survive. It has been well established that angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) is the primary cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 belongs to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), composed of several peptides, such as angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin (1-7) (Ang-(1-7)). Both peptides regulate muscle mass and function. It has been described that SARS-CoV-2 infection, by direct and indirect mechanisms, affects a broad range of organ systems. In the skeletal muscle, through unbalanced RAS activity, SARS-CoV-2 could induce severe consequences such as loss of muscle mass, strength, and physical function, which will delay and interfere with the recovery process of patients with COVID-19. This article discusses the relationship between RAS, SARS-CoV-2, skeletal muscle, and the potentially harmful consequences for skeletal muscle in patients currently infected with and recovering from COVID-19.","Gonzalez, Andrea; Orozco-Aguilar, Josué; Achiardi, Oscar; Simon, Felipe; Cabello-Verrugio, Claudio",Int. j. mol. sci.

281967,"Letter to the Editor: ""Our Response to COVID-19 as Endocrinologists and Diabetologists""",2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2, different European countries reacted with temporary national lockdowns with the aim to limit the virus transmission in the population. Also Austria started a lockdown of public life in March 2020. OBJECTIVES: In this study we investigated whether the circulation of different respiratory virus infections in Austria, as assessed by the established respiratory virus surveillance system, is affected by these measures as well and may reflect the success of the lockdown in limiting respiratory virus transmission. STUDY DESIGN: Sentinel data obtained for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus cases were analyzed and compared between the season 2019/2020 and the five previous seasons. RESULTS: We observed a rapid and statistically significant reduction of cumulative cases for all these viruses within short time after the lockdown in March 2020, compared to previous seasons (each p < 0.001). Also, sentinel screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections was performed and a decrease of SARS-CoV-2 was seen after the lockdown. While for the seasonally occurring viruses as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus the lockdown led to the end of the annual epidemics, a re-increase of rhinovirus infections was observed after liberalization of numerous lockdown measures. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that occurrence of different respiratory virus infections reflect not only the efficiency of lockdown measures taken against SARS-CoV-2 but it shows also the effects of lockdown releases on the transmission of respiratory viruses.","Redlberger-Fritz, Monika; Kundi, Michael; Aberle, Stephan W; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth",J Clin Virol,,413

284486,Recommendations for Prehospital Airway Management in Patients with Suspected COVID-19 Infection,2020,"RATIONALE: Pathogeny of thrombosis in COVID-19 is related to interaction of SARS-Cov-2 with vascular wall through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. This induces 2 pathways with immunothrombosis from activated endothelium (cytokine storm, leukocyte and platelet recruitment, and activation of coagulation extrinsic pathway), and rise of angiotensin II levels promoting inflammation. While thrombosis is widely described in COVID-19 patients admitted in intensive care unit, cerebrovascular diseases remains rare, in particular cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). PATIENT CONCERNS: We describe 2 cases of women admitted during the spring of 2020 for intracranial hypertension signs, in stroke units in Great-east, a French area particularly affected by COVID-19 pandemia. DIAGNOSES: Cerebral imaging revealed extended CVT in both cases. The first case described was more serious due to right supratentorial venous infarction with hemorrhagic transformation leading to herniation. Both patients presented typical pneumonia due to SARS-Cov-2 infection, confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab in only one. INTERVENTIONS: The first patient had to undergo decompressive craniectomy, and both patients were treated with anticoagulation therapy. OUTCOMES: Favorable outcome was observed for 1 patient. Persistent coma, due to bi thalamic infarction, remained for the other with more serious presentation. LESSONS: CVT, as a serious complication of COVID-19, has to be searched in all patients with intracranial hypertension syndrome. Data about anticoagulation therapy to prevent such serious thrombosis in SARS-Cov-2 infection are lacking, in particular in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19.","Guendouz, Cécile; Quenardelle, Véronique; Riou-Comte, Nolwenn; Welfringer, Pascal; Wolff, Valérie; Zuily, Stéphane; Jager, Lavinia; Humbertjean Selton, Lisa; Mione, Gioia; Pop, Raoul; Gory, Benjamin; Richard, Sébastien",Medicine (Baltimore),,413

286323,"Dynamics and Correlation Among Viral Positivity, Seroconversion, and Disease Severity in COVID-19 : A Retrospective Study",2020,"Introduction: In addition to the effects of coronavirus infection, the Covid-19 pandemic has induced widespread psychosocial distress, which has triggered the onset of anxious and depressive states, reactive to the socio-relational and economic situation induced by the pandemic. Some of our participants showed depressive and anxious attitudes even in the absence of real pictures of depression and anxiety. This phenomenon, combined with mechanisms of emulation and conditioning, can trigger a vicious cycle within interpersonal relationships and promote the administration of unnecessary treatments. Various approaches have been proposed to help populations suffering from psychosocial problems induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, but there is an objective difficulty in treating a large population. Methods: To contain and reduce this widespread psychosocial unease, in this study we used two radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology neuromodulation treatments, neuro postural optimization (NPO) and neuropsychophysical optimization-cervicobrachial (NPPO-CB), aimed at optimizing an individual's response to the effects of environmental stressors. These treatments are quick and easy to administer; therefore, they can be administered to a large cohort of participants in a short time. To evaluate the effects of the REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments, the DASS-21 psychometric test was used because it has already been used to test depression, anxiety, and stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: The results of the study confirm the usefulness of REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments in helping participants to have better coping strategies for the environmental pressures and reduce the neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. Discussion: The results obtained in this study are consistent with previous clinical studies confirming the usefulness of the treatments to face neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by exposome pressure.","Pinheiro Barcessat, Ana Rita; Nolli Bittencourt, Marina; Duarte Ferreira, Larissa; de Souza Neri, Erick; Coelho Pereira, José Alfredo; Bechelli, Fabio; Rinaldi, Arianna",Psychol Res Behav Manag,,413

The present study discusses the main finding in nutrition sciences associated with COVID-19 in the literature. We conducted a consensus critical review using primary sources, scientific articles, and secondary bibliographic indexes, databases, and web pages. The method was a narrative literature review of the available literature regarding nutrition interventions and nutrition-related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main search engines used in the present research were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. We found how the COVID-19 lockdown promoted unhealthy dietary changes and increases in body weight of the population, showing obesity and low physical activity levels as increased risk factors of COVID-19 affection and physiopathology. In addition, hospitalized COVID-19 patients presented malnutrition and deficiencies in vitamin C, D, B12 selenium, iron, omega-3, and medium and long-chain fatty acids highlighting the potential health effect of vitamin C and D interventions. Further investigations are needed to show the complete role and implications of nutrition both in the prevention and in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.","Clemente-Suárez, Vicente Javier; Ramos-Campo, Domingo Jesús; Mielgo-Ayuso, Juan; Dalamitros, Athanasios A; Nikolaidis, Pantelis A; Hormeño-Holgado, Alberto; Tornero-Aguilera, Jose Francisco",Nutrients,,413

In this multidisciplinary study, we consider the question of constructing traditional social networks from OSN data and then present several measurement case studies showing how variations in collected OSN data affects social network analyses. To this end we developed a systematic com parison methodology, which we applied to five pairs of parallel datasets collected from Twitter in four case studies. We found considerable differences in several of the datasets collected with different tools and that these variations significantly alter the results of subsequent analyses.

288097,Tracheal trauma after difficult airway management in morbidly obese patients with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with unique immune-related adverse events (irAEs). As most of the immune checkpoint inhibitors are new to the market, it is important to conduct studies using real-world data sources to investigate their safety profiles. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to develop a framework for signal detection and filtration of novel irAEs for 6 Food and Drug Administration-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors. METHODS: In our framework, we first used the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) standardized in an Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) common data model (CDM) to collect immune checkpoint inhibitor-related event data and conducted irAE signal detection. OHDSI CDM is a standard-driven data model that focuses on transforming different databases into a common format and standardizing medical terms to a common representation. We then filtered those already known irAEs from drug labels and literature by using a customized text-mining pipeline based on clinical text analysis and knowledge extraction system with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) as a dictionary. Finally, we classified the irAE detection results into three different categories to discover potentially new irAE signals. RESULTS: By our text-mining pipeline, 490 irAE terms were identified from drug labels, and 918 terms were identified from the literature. In addition, of the 94 positive signals detected using CDM-based FAERS, 53 signals (56%) were labeled signals, 10 (11%) were unlabeled published signals, and 31 (33%) were potentially new signals. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that our approach is effective for irAE signal detection and filtration. Moreover, our CDM-based framework could facilitate adverse drug events detection and filtration toward the goal of next-generation pharmacovigilance that seamlessly integrates electronic health record data for improved signal detection.","Yu, Yue; Ruddy, Kathryn; Mansfield, Aaron; Zong, Nansu; Wen, Andrew; Tsuji, Shintaro; Huang, Ming; Liu, Hongfang; Shah, Nilay; Jiang, Guoqian",JMIR Med Inform,,413

We report our extended protocol, draft to manage clinical activities in our radiotherapy department, by minimizing contagion risks. METHODS: We used telephonic screening to assess the need for patient admission. A telephonic triage was performed to identify the presence of COVID-19 infection risk factors or symptoms. New treatments were stratified according to priority codes. A reserved entrance to radiotherapy department was assured for patients and staff. Surgical disposable mask was required for patients and caregivers. The activities were distributed during the whole workday, avoiding overlap to reduce aggregation. RESULTS: From 1st February 2020 to 31 March 2020, we reported an increase in the number of first medical examinations and treatments, compared to the same period of the previous year. Outpatients first medical examinations have been spread over the 12 working hours. No COVID-19 cases were detected.

293436,"How to perform tracheal intubation for COVID-19 patients safely and effectively: Experience AND tips from Sichuan, China",2020,"BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive tumour. For patients with inoperable disease, few treatment options are available after first line chemotherapy. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab has recently shown increased survival compared to standard chemotherapy, but most patients do not respond and improvements are called for. Telomerase is expressed in mesothelioma cells, but only sparsely in normal tissues and is therefore an attractive target for therapeutic vaccination. Vaccination against telomerase is tolerable and has shown to induce immune responses associated with increased survival in other cancer types. There is a well-founded scientific rationale for the combination of a telomerase vaccine and checkpoint inhibition to improve treatment response in MPM patients. METHODS: NIPU is a randomized, multi-centre, open-label, phase II study comparing the efficacy and safety of nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without telomerase vaccine in patients with inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Participants (n = 118) are randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms. All participants receive treatment with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of 2 years. Patients randomised to the experimental arm receive 8 intradermal injections of UV1 vaccine during the first three months of treatment. Tumour tissue, blood, urine, faeces and imaging will be collected for biomarker analyses and exploration of mechanisms for response and resistance to therapy. DISCUSSION: Checkpoint inhibition is used for treatment of mesothelioma, but many patients still do not respond. Increasing therapy response to immunotherapy is an important goal. Possible approaches include combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy and other immunotherapeutic agents. Predictive biomarkers are necessary to ensure optimal treatment for each patient and to prevent unnecessary side effects. This trial seeks to improve treatment response by combining checkpoint inhibition with a telomerase vaccine and also to explore mechanisms for treatment response and resistance. Knowledge gained in the NIPU study may be transferred to the first line setting and to other cancers with limited benefit from immunotherapy.

However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.","Mei, Xueyan; Lee, Hao-Chih; Diao, Kai-Yue; Huang, Mingqian; Lin, Bin; Liu, Chenyu; Xie, Zongyu; Ma, Yixuan; Robson, Philip M; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Mani, Venkatesh; Calcagno, Claudia; Li, Kunwei; Li, Shaolin; Shan, Hong; Lv, Jian; Zhao, Tongtong; Xia, Junli; Long, Qihua; Steinberger, Sharon; Jacobi, Adam; Deyer, Timothy; Luksza, Marta; Liu, Fang; Little, Brent P; Fayad, Zahi A; Yang, Yang",Nat Med,,413

295143,Utility of Point of Care and Rapid Diagnostics in Humanitarian Emergencies,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Few cases of arterial thromboembolisms have been reported after novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in case of severe infection or in elderly patients. We report a case of femoral arterial thrombosis in a young patient after nonsevere infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A common femoral artery thrombosis extended in the first third of superficial and profunda femoral arteries associated with tibial posterior and popliteal artery thrombosis was diagnosed in a 24-year-old man complaining of right lower limb pain for one month. The evolution was good after anticoagulation and antiaggregant treatments and thrombectomy. Etiologic assessment was negative except for nonsevere COVID-19. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 accesses host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein, abundant in the lungs, which is also expressed by endothelial cells and is associated with important inflammatory syndrome and coagulopathy, leading to vascular lesions. Thrombosis prevalence is not fully established and seems to be higher in case of major inflammation and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Arterial thromboembolisms are described in many vascular territories, each time in elderly patients, or in case of severe infection. We described a femoral arterial thrombosis in a young patient with negative etiological assessment except nonsevere COVID-19. Treatment consists in anticoagulation and antiaggregant drugs and thrombectomy. Preventing venous thromboembolism treatment is recommended in case of severe infection or in the ICU, but there is no clear recommendation for arterial thromboembolism prevention. This case should lead us to be very careful of the arterial event risk even if the infection is nonsevere and the patient is young.","Veyre, Florian; Poulain-Veyre, Corinne; Esparcieux, Aurélie; Monsarrat, Nicolas; Aouifi, Abdellah; Lapeze, Joel; Chatelard, Philippe",Ann Vasc Surg,,413

295989,SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) has neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound health and social impacts. COVID-19 also affords opportunities to study the emergence of prejudice as a factor in taking protective actions. This study investigated the association of COVID-19 concerns, prejudicial beliefs, and personal actions that involve life disruptions among people not living with and people living with HIV. 338 Black/African American men not living with HIV who reported male sex partners and 148 Black/African American men living with HIV who reported male sex partners completed a confidential survey that measured COVID-19 concern, COVID-19 prejudice, and personal action and institutionally imposed COVID-19 disruptions. Participants reported having experienced multiple social and healthcare disruptions stemming from COVID-19, including reductions in social contacts, canceling medical appointments, and inability to access medications. Mediation analyses demonstrated that COVID-19 concerns and COVID-19 prejudice were associated with personal action disruptions, indicating that these social processes are important for understanding how individuals modified their lives in response to COVID-19. It is imperative that public health efforts combat COVID-19 prejudice as these beliefs undermine investments in developing healthcare infrastructure to address COVID-19 prevention.","Kalichman, Seth C; El-Krab, Renee; Shkembi, Bruno; Kalichman, Moira O; Eaton, Lisa A",Translational behavioral medicine (Internet),,413

To compare maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women with those of non-infected patients. STUDY DESIGN: Through an universal PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 at admission (not symptoms-based), this prospective cohort study enrolled all pregnant women admitted for delivery between 16th of June and the 16th of August 2020 in the West French Guiana Hospital Center. RESULTS: 507 pregnant women were included during the study period, of which 137 (27 %) were infected with SARS-COV-2. On admission, only 34/137 (24.8 %) of these patients presented with clinical symptoms. Among asymptomatic women, 16 /103 (15 %) became symptomatic after diagnosis. Throughout the delivery hospitalization and follow-up, 87/137 (63.5 %) remained always asymptomatic, 45/137 (32.8 %) developed a mild COVID-19 and 5/137 (3.6 %) developed a severe infection. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were more likely to have post-partum hemorrhage >500 mL (14.2 % vs 7.2 %, RR 2.0 [95 %CI 1.1-3.4]), to be transfused (5.5 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.9 [1.5-16.6]), and to be hospitalized in ICU (3.6 % vs 0.8 %, RR 4.5 [95 %CI 1.1-18.6] than uninfected ones. Intra-uterine fetal demises were more common in infected mothers compared to controls (5.1 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.7 [95 % CI 1.4-45.9). Among 108 neonates from infected mothers tested at birth, none tested positive (0/108). When tested between 25 and 42 h after delivery, 4/29 (13.7 %) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women admitted for delivery and diagnosed with a SARS-COV-2 infection through an universal screening were symptomatic in only a quarter of cases. Their risks of post-partum hemorrhage, transfusion and admission to ICU were higher than those of uninfected patients. They also presented a higher risk of intra-uterine fetal demise. There were no other differences in maternal, obstetrical or neonatal outcomes.","Hcini, Najeh; Maamri, Fatma; Picone, Olivier; Carod, Jean-Francois; Lambert, Véronique; Mathieu, Meredith; Carles, Gabriel; Pomar, Léo",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,413

298959,Association of T lymphocytes level and clinical severity in patients of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China,2021,"BACKGROUND: Following the regional outbreak in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world, presenting the healthcare systems with huge challenges worldwide. In Germany the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a slowly growing demand for health care with a sudden occurrence of regional hotspots. This leads to an unpredictable situation for many hospitals, leaving the question of how many bed resources are needed to cope with the surge of COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: In this study we created a simulation-based prognostic tool that provides the management of the University Hospital of Augsburg and the civil protection services with the necessary information to plan and guide the disaster response to the ongoing pandemic. Especially the number of beds needed on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU) are the biggest concerns. The focus should lie not only on the confirmed cases as the patients with suspected COVID-19 are in need of the same resources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the input we used the latest information provided by governmental institutions about the spreading of the disease, with a special focus on the growth rate of the cumulative number of cases. Due to the dynamics of the current situation, these data can be highly variable. To minimize the influence of this variance, we designed distribution functions for the parameters growth rate, length of stay in hospital and the proportion of infected people who need to be hospitalized in our area of responsibility. Using this input, we started a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 runs to predict the range of the number of hospital beds needed within the coming days and compared it with the available resources. RESULTS: Since 2 February 2020 a total of 306 patients were treated with suspected or confirmed COVID-19â¯at this university hospital. Of these 84 needed treatment on the ICU. With the help of several simulation-based forecasts, the required ICU and normal bed capacity at Augsburg University Hospital and the Augsburg ambulance service in the period from 28 March 2020 to 8 June 2020 could be predicted with a high degree of reliability. Simulations that were run before the impact of the restrictions in daily life showed that we would have run out of ICU bed capacity within approximately 1 month. CONCLUSION: Our simulation-based prognosis of the health care capacities needed helps the management of the hospital and the civil protection service to make reasonable decisions and adapt the disaster response to the realistic needs. At the same time the forecasts create the possibility to plan the strategic response days and weeks in advance. The tool presented in this study is, as far as we know, the only one accounting not only for confirmed COVID-19 cases but also for suspected COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the few input parameters used are easy to access and can be easily adapted to other healthcare systems.","Römmele, C; Neidel, T; Heins, J; Heider, S; Otten, V; Ebigbo, A; Weber, T; Müller, M; Spring, O; Braun, G; Wittmann, M; Schoenfelder, J; Heller, A R; Messmann, H; Brunner, J O",Anaesthesist,,413

A discussion about statistical and clinical significance,2021,"Rapid, accurate, reliable, and risk-free tracking of pathogenic microorganisms at the single-cell level is critical to achieve efficient source control and prevent outbreaks of microbial infectious diseases. For the first time, we report a promising approach for integrating the concepts of a remarkably large Stokes shift and dual-recognition into a single matrix to develop a pathogenic microorganism stimuli-responsive ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobe with speed, cost efficiency, stability, ultrahigh specificity, and sensitivity. As a proof-of-concept, we selected the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as the target analyte model, which easily bound to its recognition aptamer and the broad-spectrum glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (Van). To improve the specificity and short sample-to-answer time, we employed classic noncovalent &#960;-&#960; stacking interactions as a driving force to trigger the binding of Van and aptamer dual-functionalized near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent Apt-Van-QDs to the surface of an unreported blue fluorescent &#960;-rich electronic carbon nanoparticles (CNPs), achieving S. aureus stimuli-responsive ratiometric nanoprobe Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs. In the assembly of Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs, the blue CNPs (energy donor) and NIR Apt-Van-QDs (energy acceptor) became close to allow the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, leading to a remarkable blue fluorescence quenching for the CNPs at â¼465 nm and a clear NIR fluorescence enhancement for Apt-Van-QDs at â¼725 nm. In the presence of S. aureus, the FRET process from CNPs to Apt-Van-QDs was disrupted, causing the nanoprobe Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs to display a ratiometric fluorescent response to S. aureus, which exhibited a large Stokes shift of â¼260 nm and rapid sample-to-answer detection time (â¼30.0 min). As expected, the nanoprobe Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs showed an ultrahigh specificity for ratiometric fluorescence detection of S. aureus with a good detection limit of 1.0 CFU/mL, allowing the assay at single-cell level. Moreover, we also carried out the precise analysis of S. aureus in actual samples with acceptable results. We believe that this work offers new insight into the rational design of efficient ratiometric nanoprobes for rapid on-site accurate screening of pathogenic microorganisms at the single-cell level in the early stages, especially during the worldwide spread of COVID-19 today.","Shen, Yizhong; Wu, Tingting; Zhang, Yiyin; Ling, Na; Zheng, Libing; Zhang, Shao-Lin; Sun, Yidan; Wang, Xiaohong; Ye, Yingwang",Anal Chem,,413

301010,Simulation role in preparing for COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) usually focus on middle-aged and older adults. However, younger patients may present with severe COVID-19 with potentially fatal outcomes. For optimized, more specialized therapeutic regimens in this particular patient group, a better understanding of the underlying pathomechanisms is of utmost importance. METHODS: Our study investigated relevant, pre-existing medical conditions, clinical histories, and autopsy findings, together with SARS-CoV-2-RNA, determined by qPCR, and laboratory data in six COVID-19 decedents aged 50 years or younger, who were autopsied at the Charité University Hospital. RESULTS: From a total of 76 COVID-19 patients who underwent an autopsy at our institution, six (7.9%) were 50 years old or younger. Most of these younger COVID-19 decedents presented with pre-existing medical conditions prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These included overweight and obesity, arterial hypertension, asthma, and obstructive sleep apnea, as well as graft-versus-host disease following cancer and bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, clinical histories and autopsy results revealed a disproportionally high prevalence of thromboembolism and ischemic organ damage in this patient cohort. Histopathology and laboratory results indicated coagulopathies, signs of immune dysregulation, and liver damage. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, pre-existing health conditions may increase the risk of severe and fatal COVID-19 in younger patients, who may be especially prone to developing thromboembolic complications, immune dysregulation, and liver damage.","Greuel, Selina; Ihlow, Jana; Dragomir, Mihnea-Paul; Streit, Simon; Corman, Victor Max; Haberbosch, Linus; Winkler, David; Meinhardt, Jenny; Aschman, Tom; Schneider, Julia; Trotsyuk, Iryna; Kunze, Catarina Alisa; Maurer, Lukas; Radbruch, Helena; Heppner, Frank L; Horst, David; Elezkurtaj, Sefer",Int J Infect Dis,,413

DESIGN: An explorative qualitative study comprising two virtual focus group discussions (FGDs) with 12 trial team members and 32 in-depth participant interviews (N=44). Data were collected via telephone calls for in-depth interviews or Zoom for FGDs and manually analysed by inductive content analysis. SETTING: Fourteen private security companies in two Uganda districts. PARTICIPANTS: Members of the clinical trial study team, and men working in private security companies who undertook workplace-based HIV testing. RESULTS: The key themes for participants experiences were: 'challenges in accessing HIV treatment and care, and prevention services', 'misinformation' and 'difficulty participating in research activities'. The effects on HIV treatment and prevention resulted from; repercussions of the COVID-19 restrictions, participants fear of coinfection and negative experiences at health facilities. The difficulty in participating in research activities arose from: fear of infection with COVID-19 for the participants who tested HIV negative, transport difficulties, limited post-test psychosocial support and lack of support to initiate pre-exposure prophylaxis. The key study team reflections focused on the management of the clinical trial, effects of the local regulations and government policies and the need to adhere to ethical principles of research. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the need to organise different forms of HIV support for persons living with HIV during a pandemic. Additionally, the national research regulators and ethics committees or review boards are strongly urged to develop policies and guidelines for the continuity of research and clinical trials in the event of future shocks.

304624,Severity of COVID-19 infection in ACEI/ARB users in specialty hospitals: A retrospective cohort study,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a major pandemic threat that has spread to more than 212 countries with more than 432,902 recorded deaths and 7,898,442 confirmed cases worldwide so far (on June 14, 2020). It is crucial to investigate the spatial drivers to prevent and control the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS: This is the first comprehensive study of COVID-19 in Iran; and it carries out spatial modeling, risk mapping, change detection, and outbreak trend analysis of the disease spread. Four main steps were taken: comparison of Iranian coronavirus data with the global trends, prediction of mortality trends using regression modeling, spatial modeling, risk mapping, and change detection using the random forest (RF) machine learning technique (MLT), and validation of the modeled risk map. RESULTS: The results show that from February 19 to June 14, 2020, the average growth rates (GR) of COVID-19 deaths and the total number of COVID-19 cases in Iran were 1.08 and 1.10, respectively. Based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) data, Iran's fatality rate (deaths/0.1M pop) is 10.53. Other countries' fatality rates were, for comparison, Belgium - 83.32, UK - 61.39, Spain - 58.04, Italy - 56.73, Sweden - 48.28, France - 45.04, USA - 35.52, Canada - 21.49, Brazil - 20.10, Peru - 19.70, Chile - 16.20, Mexico- 12.80, and Germany - 10.58. The fatality rate for China is 0.32 (deaths/0.1M pop). Over time, the heatmap of the infected areas identified two critical time intervals for the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. The provinces were classified in terms of disease and death rates into a large primary group and three provinces that had critical outbreaks were separate from the others. The heatmap of countries of the world shows that China and Italy were distinguished from other countries in terms of nine viral infection-related parameters. The regression models for death cases showed an increasing trend but with some evidence of turning. A polynomial relationship was identified between the coronavirus infection rate and the province population density. Also, a third-degree polynomial regression model for deaths showed an increasing trend recently, indicating that subsequent measures taken to cope with the outbreak have been insufficient and ineffective. The general trend of deaths in Iran is similar to the world's, but Iran's shows lower volatility. Change detection of COVID-19 risk maps with a random forest model for the period from March 11 to March 18 showed an increasing trend of COVID-19 in Iran's provinces. It is worth noting that using the LASSO MLT to evaluate variables' importance, indicated that the most important variables were the distance from bus stations, bakeries, hospitals, mosques, ATMs (automated teller machines), banks, and the minimum temperature of the coldest month. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that this study's risk maps are the primary, fundamental step to take for managing and controlling COVID-19 in Iran and its provinces.","Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza; Pouyan, Soheila; Heidari, Bahram; Farajzadeh, Zakariya; Fallah Shamsi, Seyed Rashid; Babaei, Sedigheh; Khosravi, Rasoul; Etemadi, Mohammad; Ghanbarian, Gholamabbas; Farhadi, Ahmad; Safaeian, Roja; Heidari, Zahra; Tarazkar, Mohammad Hassan; Tiefenbacher, John P; Azmi, Amir; Sadeghian, Faezeh",Int J Infect Dis,,413
305420,"Theory-driven, rapid formative research on quality improvement intervention for critical care of patients with COVID-19 in Argentina",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 has been associated with stroke, particular characteristics of these patients are not fully understood. The adequate management of these patients depends on the comprehension of factors such as temporality, clinical presentation and etiology. We hypothesize there is an important temporal relationship between COVID-19 severity and stroke onset. METHODS: a systematic review of the available literature was conducted using Pubmed and Scopus, studies reporting patients with Coronavirus disease 19 and stroke were included. Clinical, sociodemographic and laboratory characteristics of patients were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies and 176 patients were included, with a mean age of 63.1 years (SD= 16 n=122), most of them were males (63.2% n=171). The most frequent etiology was cryptogenic 40.9% n=66), and a mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 14.4 points was found (SD= 8.6 n=73). Large vessel occlusion was reported in 65.9% patients (n=91) and these patients were younger with greater stroke severity. D-dimer, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase were elevated in most patients with reported findings. Most patients had severe Coronavirus disease 2019. The mean time from onset of respiratory symptoms to stroke was 9 days (SD=9.9), the shortest time was noted in those with mild and moderate disease. CONCLUSIONS: There is a trend between the severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 and time to stroke onset. Also, age and stroke severity were found to be related to the development of large vessel occlusion. Inflammation and hypercoagulability markers are elevated in this disease, we propose to not discard hypercoagulability secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 as an underlying cause of stroke in these patients.","Valencia-Enciso, Natalia; Ortiz-Pereira, Mónica; Zafra-Sierra, María Paula; Espinel-Gómez, Laura; Bayona, Hernan",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,413

Government has approved Law Decree no 18 of 17 march 2020, in which art 15 allows enterprises to produce, import and commercialize surgical masks notwithstanding the current rules of product certification It is just required that the interested enterprises send to the Italian National Institute of Health a selfcertification in which they declare the technical characteristics of the masks and that masks are produced according to the safety requirements In this context, a technical-scientific unit was established at the University of Napoli Federico II to provide interested enterprises with state-of-the-art consultancy, testing and measurement services, adhering to rigorous scientific protocols Characterization tests were carried out on 163 surgical masks and/or materials for their construction and they have enabled the identification of pre-screening criteria to simplify the procedure for evaluating surgical masks using methods for assessing the filtration efficiency of particles and aerosols Based on experimental results, it has been observed that a filtration efficiency for particles with sizes larger that 650 nm (PFE&gt;650) exceeding 35% might guarantees a bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) higher than 95% while BFE values higher than 98% are obtained when the PFE&gt;650 is larger than 40% PFE measurement is extremely simpler with respect to BFE, the latter being time-consuming and requiring specific equipment and methods for its realization Many tested materials have shown the capability to assure high filtration efficiencies but Spundonded-Meltblown-Spunbonded (SMS), that are layers of non-woven fabric with different weights of Meltblown, can simultaneously guarantee high particle filtration efficiencies with pressure drop values (breathability) in the limits to classify the surgical masks as Type II/IIR In fact, the fabric products analyzed so far have not been able to simultaneously guarantee adequate BFE and breathability values On the contrary, Spunbonds of adequate weights can virtually verify both requirements and accredit themselves as possible materials for the production of surgical masks, at least

307465,COVID-19 Pneumonia in Patients With HIV: A Case Series,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a new reality on the delivery of psychotherapeutic services. Therapists have had to rapidly adapt to telehealth therapy using various video conferencing technologies while working from spaces that were not necessarily designed for delivering therapy sessions. While COVID-19 continues to be present in therapists' lives and shapes how they provide services, answering the question of whether to meet with clients in person again is a decision laden with complexity and ambivalence. In this mixed-method study, surveys with 169 therapists and interviews with 17 therapists were used to determine the factors that currently influence their attitudes toward resuming traditional in-person psychotherapy in light of COVID-19. We focused on the therapists' personal and professional characteristics to assess their plans to continue with telepsychotherapy or return to a traditional psychotherapy setting. Our findings suggest that positive attitudes toward telepsychotherapy, the lack of an effective vaccine, clients' satisfaction with telepsychotherapy, insurance reimbursement for telepsychotherapy, and negative attitudes toward wearing masks during sessions influenced therapists' decisions on whether or not to return to traditional in-person psychotherapy in the age of COVID-19.","Shklarski, Liat; Abrams, Allison; Bakst, Elana",J Contemp Psychother,,413

The evolving SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic presents a series of challenges to clinical diagnostic services. Many proprietary PCR platforms deployed outside centralised laboratories have limited capacity to upscale when public health demands increase. We set out to develop and validate an open-platform mobile laboratory for remote area COVID-19 diagnosis, with a subsequent field trial.Gap Statement. In regional Western Australia, molecular diagnostic support is limited to near point-of-care devices. We therefore aimed to demonstrate open-platform capability in a rapidly deployable format within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methodology. We compared, selected and validated components of a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay in order to establish a portable molecular diagnostics laboratory. The optimal combination of PCR assay equipment, reagents and consumables required for operation to national standards in regional laboratories was identified. This comprised RNA extraction and purification (QuickGene-480, Kurabo, Japan), a duplex RT-PCR assay (Logix Smart COVID-19, Co-Diagnostics, USA), a Myra liquid handling robot (Biomolecular Systems, Australia) and a magnetic induction thermal cycler (MIC, Biomolecular Systems).Results The 95 and 99% limits of detection were 1.01 copies µl-1 (5.05 copies per reaction) and 2.80 copies µl-1 (14.00 copies per reaction) respectively. The Co-Diagnostics assay amplified both SARS-CoV-1 and -2 RNA but showed no other cross reactivity. Qualitative results aligned with the reference laboratory SARS-CoV-2 assay (sensitivity 100% [95 % CI 96.48-100%], specificity 100% [95% CI 96.52-100%]). In field trials, the laboratory was operational within an hour of arrival on-site, can process up to 36 samples simultaneously, produces results in two and a half hours from specimen reception, and performed well during six consecutive runs during a 1 week deployment.Conclusion. Our mobile laboratory enables an adaptive response to increased test demand, and unlike many proprietary point-of-care PCR systems, rapid substitution with an alternative assay if gene targets change or reagent supply chains fail. We envisage operation of this RT-PCR assay as a standby capability to meet varying regional test demands under public health emergency operations guidance.","Paton, Teagan F; Marr, Ian; O039,; Keefe, Zoe; Inglis, Timothy J J",J. medical microbiol,,413

Ultrasound, which has become an everyday tool in the ICU, can be very useful during COVID-19 pandemic, since it provides the clinician with information which can be interpreted and integrated within a global assessment during the physical examination. A description of some of the potential applications of ultrasound is depicted in this document, in order to supply the physicians taking care of these patients with an adapted guide to the intensive care setting. Some of its applications since ICU admission include verification of the correct position of the endotracheal tube, contribution to safe cannulation of lines, and identification of complications and thrombotic events. Furthermore, pleural and lung ultrasound can be an alternative diagnostic test to assess the degree of involvement of the lung parenchyma by means of the evaluation of specific ultrasound patterns, identification of pleural effusions and barotrauma.

311305,Life on the frontlines: Treating COVID-19 patients as an internal medicine resident physician in New York City,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic has adversely and disproportionately impacted people suffering from mental health issues and substance use problems. This has been exacerbated by social isolation during the pandemic and the social stigma associated with mental health and substance use disorders, making people reluctant to share their struggles and seek help. Due to the anonymity and privacy they provide, social media emerged as a convenient medium for people to share their experiences about their day to day struggles. Reddit is a well-recognized social media platform that provides focused and structured forums called subreddits, that users subscribe to and discuss their experiences with others. Temporal assessment of the topical correlation between social media postings about mental health/substance use and postings about Coronavirus is crucial to better understand public sentiment on the pandemic and its evolving impact, especially related to vulnerable populations. In this study, we conduct a longitudinal topical analysis of postings between subreddits r/depression, r/Anxiety, r/SuicideWatch, and r/Coronavirus, and postings between subreddits r/opiates, r/OpiatesRecovery, r/addiction, and r/Coronavirus from January 2020 - October 2020. Our results show a high topical correlation between postings in r/depression and r/Coronavirus in September 2020. Further, the topical correlation between postings on substance use disorders and Coronavirus fluctuates, showing the highest correlation in August 2020. By monitoring these trends from platforms such as Reddit, epidemiologists, and mental health professionals can gain insights into the challenges faced by communities for targeted interventions.","Alambo, Amanuel; Padhee, Swati; Banerjee, Tanvi; Thirunarayan, Krishnaprasad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10518v1.pdf,413

Nevertheless, among the most well-studied PTMs can say mainly types of proteins are containing phosphorylation and significant roles in many biological processes. Disorder in this modification can be caused by multiple diseases including neurological disorders and cancers. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the phosphorylation of target residues in an uncharacterized amino acid sequence. Most experimental techniques for predicting phosphorylation are time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. By the way, computational methods have replaced these techniques. These days, a vast amount of phosphorylation data is publicly accessible through many online databases. In this study, at first, all datasets of PTMs that include phosphorylation sites (p-sites) were comprehensively reviewed.

These measures have led to a reduction of anthropogenic air pollutants, providing an opportunity to observe the contribution of human activities to local air pollution. In this study, the control period was divided into four stages:the before, early, middle, and later stages. Based on a variety of data including meteorological, traffic, and industrial manufacturing datasets, statistical methods were combined with spatial analysis to evaluate changes in air pollution and associated human impacts during each stage. In addition, suggestions are made for further regional air pollution control in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. Key results are as follows:â Overall, the AQI and the concentrations of six air pollutants, especially SO2, PM10, and NO2, were lower during control period than during the equivalent period in 2019 (reductions of 26.5%, 24.3%, and 16.9%, respectively). From the before to later stages, pollutants (except O3) showed a downward trend while O3 increased significantly during the before stage (by 76.2%) and the growth rate slowed during the middle and later stages; â¡During the prior stage, Beijing experienced two periods with heavy air pollution days as a result of the local accumulation of pollutants, secondary transformation, and regional transport. The concentration of PM2.5 in February was nearly 60% lower than in February 2014 under similar meteorological conditions in Beijing; â¢ Following an increase in traffic volume and industrial activity, changes in air pollutants tended to be stable or slightly increase during the middle and later stages of the control period. The grey relation coefficients between thermal radiation intensity anomalies and the main pollutants in heavy industrial cities were greater than 0.6, which means that the control of industrial emissions remains key to controlling air pollution.","Zhao, Xue; Shen, Nan-Chi; Li, Ling-Jun; Wu, Gao-Feng; Tao, Jing; Zhao, Wen-Ji",Huan Jing Ke Xue,,413

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the prognostic role of tumor- TILs and its relationship with PD-L1 expression in stage II and III colon cancer. METHODS: Immunohistochemisty was used to assess the densities of CD8+, CD4+, and FOXP3+ cells, and PD-L1 expression in intraepithelial tumor site from 58 stage II and III colon cancers. These were evaluated for association with histopathologic features and overall survival. RESULTS: PD-L1-positive tumors contained a higher number of CD8+ TILs with statistical significance (p = 0.001). CD4+ TILs showed positive correlation with PD-L1 expression (p = 0.034). There were no associations between PD-L1 expression and FOXP3+ TILs. Microsatellite instability (MSI)-high status (p = 0.001; Odd ration 18.0; 95% CI = 4.3-74.8) was the strongest prognostic factor along with mucinous/poor cell differentiation, CD8 and right tumor location was associated with PD-L1 expression (p = 0.024, 0.035 and 0.033, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that PD-L1 expression was associated with MSI-high, increased CD8+ TILs, mucinous and poor cell differentiation, and right-sided tumor location.","Jung, Dong Hae; Park, Hyun Jung; Jang, Ho Hee; Kim, Se-Hee; Jung, YunJae; Lee, Won-Suk",Cancer Invest,,413

We aim to report outcomes for children with LD and LT enrolled in the NASPGHAN/SPLIT SARS-CoV2 registry. METHODS: In this multicenter observational cohort study, we collected data from 91 patients <21âyears (LD 44, LT 47) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection between April 21 and September 17, 2020. RESULTS: Patients with LD were more likely to require admission (70% vs 43% LT, Pâ=â0.007) and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) management (32% vs 4% LT, Pâ=â0.001). Seven LD patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) and 2 patients died; no patients in the LT cohort died or required MV. Four LD patients presented in pediatric acute liver failure (PALF), 2 with concurrent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); all recovered without LT. Two LD patients had MIS-C alone and 1 patient died. Bivariable logistic-regression analysis found that patients with nonalcoholic fatty LD (NAFLD) (odds ratio [OR] 5.6, Pâ=â0.02) and LD (OR 6.1, Pâ=â0.01, vs LT) had higher odds of severe disease (PICU, vasopressor support, MV, renal replacement therapy or death). CONCLUSIONS: Although not directly comparable, LT recipients had lower odds of severe SARS-CoV2 infection (vs LD), despite immunosuppression burden. NAFLD patients reported to the registry had higher odds of severe SARS-CoV2 disease. Future controlled studies are needed to evaluate effective treatments and further stratify LD and LT patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.","Kehar, Mohit; Ebel, Noelle H; Ng, Vicky L; Baquero, Jairo Eduardo Rivera; Leung, Daniel H; Slowik, Voytek; Ovchinsky, Nadia; Shah, Amit A; Arnon, Ronen; Miloh, Tamir; Gupta, Nitika; Mohammad, Saeed; Kogan-Liberman, Debora; Squires, James E; Sanchez, Maria Camila; Hildreth, Amber; Book, Linda; Chu, Christopher; Alrabadi, Leina; Azzam, Ruba; Chepuri, Bhavika; Elisofon, Scott; Falik, Rachel; Gallagher, Lisa; Kader, Howard; Mogul, Douglas; Mujawar, Quais; Namjoshi, Shweta S; Valentino, Pamela L; Vitola, Bernadette; Waheed, Nadia; Zheng, Ming-Hua; Lobritto, Steven; Martinez, Mercedes",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,,413

321213,A Dedicated Path to Emergent Thoracic Surgery in COVID-19 Patients: An Italian Institution Protocol,2020,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones are increasingly used for urban applications like traffic monitoring and construction surveys. Autonomous navigation allows drones to visit waypoints and accomplish activities as part of their mission. A common activity is to hover and observe a location using on-board cameras. Advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) allow such videos to be analyzed for automated decision making. UAVs also host edge computing capability for on-board inferencing by such DNNs. To this end, for a fleet of drones, we propose a novel Mission Scheduling Problem (MSP) that co-schedules the flight routes to visit and record video at waypoints, and their subsequent on-board edge analytics. The proposed schedule maximizes the utility from the activities while meeting activity deadlines as well as energy and computing constraints. We first prove that MSP is NP-hard and then optimally solve it by formulating a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Next, we design two efficient heuristic algorithms, JSC and VRC, that provide fast sub-optimal solutions. Evaluation of these three schedulers using real drone traces demonstrate utility-runtime trade-offs under diverse workloads.","Khochare, Aakash; Simmhan, Yogesh; Sorbelli, Francesco Betti; Das, Sajal K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08768v1.pdf,413

The household direct contacts of the COVID-19 patients are at highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been tried against COVID-19 in the view of its in-vitro virucidal action against SARS-CoV-2, but the role of HCQ as post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is still inconclusive and evolving. METHOD: In this open label control clinical trial asymptomatic individual who had direct contact with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases or had undertaken international travel in last 2 weeks were given the option for taking HCQ prophylaxis and assigned into PEP (N=132) and control groups (N=185). The PEP group received tablet HCQ 800 mg on day one followed by 400 mg once weekly for 3 weeks. Both the groups received standard care of therapy in the form of home quarantine for 2 weeks along with social distancing and personal hygiene and followed up for 4 weeks for new onset COVID-19. RESULTS: Total 50 out of 317 participants (15.8%) had new onset COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly (p=0.033) lower in PEP group [N=14 out of 132, (10.6%)] as compared to the control group [N=36 out of 185, (19.4%)]. Total absolute risk reduction for the incidence of COVID-19 was -8.8% points. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent occurrence of one case of COVID-19 was 12. The overall relative risk was 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.33 to 1.05). The compliance was good and most common ADR was epigastric discomfort with burning sensation, reported by 3 participants and no serious ADR was noted. CONCLUSION: PEP with HCQ has the potential for the prevention of COVID-19 in at-risk individuals. Till definitive therapy is available, continuing PEP with HCQ may be considered in suitable at-risk individuals for the prevention of COVID-19, as endorsed by many national/international health authorities. The present study will encourage the researchers around the globe to reconsider further randomized clinical trials with larger sample size for better evaluation of HCQ as PEP for the prevention of COVID-19.

However, it often suffers two major difficulties in practice: 1) only limited labeled samples are available due to expensive annotation costs over medical images; 2) labeled images may contain considerable label noises (e.g., mislabeling labels) due to diagnostic difficulties. In this paper, we seek to exploit rich labeled data from relevant domains to help the learning in the target task with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Unlike most existing UDA methods which rely on clean labeled data or assume samples are equally transferable, we propose a novel Collaborative Unsupervised Domain Adaptation algorithm to conduct transferability-aware domain adaptation and conquer label noise in a cooperative way.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve during the global transmission with the notable emergence of the spike D614G substitution that enhances infectivity. Some of these viral adaptations may alter not only the infectivity but also viral pathogenesis. Continuous phylogenomic analysis of circulating viral strains and functional investigation of new non-synonymous substitutions may help to understand the evolution of virus, its virulence and transmissibility. Here we describe a loss of an accessory protein orf3b (57 amino acids) in current circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, contributing around 24% of more than 100,000 complete viral genomes analyzed. The loss of 3b is caused by the presence of an early stop codon which is created by an orf3a Q57H substitution. There is an increasing trend in the loss of orf3b which has reached 32% in May 2020. Geographically, loss of 3b is more prevalent in certain countries including Colombia (46%), USA (48%), South Korea (51%), France (66%), Saudi Arabia (72%), Finland (76%) and Egypt (77%). Interestingly, the loss of 3b coincides with the emergence of spike D614G substitution. In addition, we found that truncated orf3b has lost the interferon antagonism compared to the full-length orf3b, suggesting a loss of function by the newly adapted virus. Further investigation of orf3b deletion and spike D614G substitution on virulence and infectivity respectively will provide important insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","Lam, Joy-Yan; Yuen, Chun-Kit; Ip, Jonathan Daniel; Wong, Wan-Man; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Kok, Kin-Hang",Emerg Microbes Infect,,413

A new approach for estimating oxygen service availability, oxygen treatment capacity, and population access to oxygen-ready treatment facilities",2021,"Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is a characteristic histopathologic pattern in most cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe viral pneumonia, such as COVID-19. DAD is characterized by an acute phase with edema, hyaline membranes, and inflammation followed by an organizing phase with pulmonary fibrosis and hyperplasia. The degree of pulmonary fibrosis and surface tension is different in the pathological stages of DAD. The effects of pulmonary fibrosis and surface tension on alveolar sac mechanics in DAD are investigated by using the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method. The human pulmonary alveolus is idealized by a three-dimensional honeycomb-like geometry, with alveolar geometries approximated as closely packed 14-sided polygons. A dynamic compression-relaxation model for surface tension effects is adopted. Compared to a healthy model, DAD models are created by increasing the tissue thickness and decreasing the concentration of the surfactant. The FSI results show that pulmonary fibrosis is more influential than the surface tension on flow rate, volume, P-V loop, and resistance. The lungs of the disease models become stiffer than those of the healthy models. According to the P-V loop results, the surface tension plays a more important role in hysteresis than the material nonlinearity of the lung tissue. Our study demonstrates the differences in air flow and lung function on the alveolar sacs between the healthy and DAD models.","Chen, Long; Tao, Weiwei; Ji, Wei; Lu, Yan; Zhao, Xia",J. biomech. eng,,413

In this study, we aimed to assess this by evaluating the relationship between sP-Selectin level and the clinical severity of COVID-19 infections. METHODS: A total of 80 patients (50 with mild to moderate and 30 with severe COVID-19 pneumonia), and 60 non-symptomatic healthy volunteers participated in the study. Following serum isolation, sP-Selectin levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. RESULTS: The serum sP-Selectin level was 1.7 ng/ml in the control group (1-3.78); 6.24 ng/ml (5.14-7.23) in mild-to-moderate pneumonia group; and 6.72 ng/ml (5.36-8.03) in the severe pneumonia group. Serum sP-Selectin levels in both mild-to-moderate pneumonia and severe pneumonia groups were found to be higher than the control group, with statistical significance (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0001, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) showed greater area under the curve (AUC) for the serum sP-Selectin levels of the COVID-19 patients (AUC = 0.913, 95% CI = 0.857-0.969; p = 0.0001). The serum sP-Selectin level was found to be 97.5% sensitive and 80% specific at 4.125 ng/ml level for diagnosis (p = 0.0001). The serum sP-Selectin level was found to be 76.9% sensitive and 51.9% specific at the level of 6.12 ng/ml (p = 0.005) to predict the need for intensive care treatment. CONCLUSION: This study showed that sP-Selectin can be used as a valuable biomarker in both diagnosing and predicting the need for intensive care treatment of COVID-19 infection.","Karsli, Emre; Sabirli, Ramazan; Altintas, Emel; Canacik, Omer; Sabirli, Gizem Tukenmez; Kaymaz, Buse; Kurt, Özgür; Koseler, Aylin",Life Sci,,413

It is vital to understand what is causing this: worries over potential adversities due to the pandemic, or the toll of experiencing adverse events. METHODS: We used panel data from 41 909 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 1 April 2020 to 12 May 2020 to study the association between adversities and anxiety and depressive symptoms. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. We used fixed-effect regression models to account for time-invariant confounders. RESULTS: Cumulative number of worries and experience of adversities were both related to higher levels of anxiety and depression. A number of worries were associated more with anxiety than depression, but number of experiences were equally related to anxiety and depression. There were clear associations between specific worries and poorer mental health. There was weak evidence that individuals of lower socio-economic position were more negatively affected psychologically by the adverse experiences. CONCLUSION: Measures over the first few weeks of lockdown in the UK appear to have been insufficient at reassuring people given that we see clear associations with mental health and cumulative worries. Interventions are required that seek to prevent adverse events (eg, redundancies) and reassure individuals and support adaptive coping strategies.","Wright, Liam; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,413

Of these, 2020 patients (13.6%) were transferred to intensive care unit, 1165 patients (7.8%) needed mechanical ventilation, and 882 patients (5.9%) died during hospitalization. The prevalence of cTn positivity was 6.9% (n = 1027) in the hospitalized patients. cTn positivity was 5% in those patients alive at 30-day, and 44% in those who died. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model, age, lactate dehydrogenase, and cTn were the strongest predictors of 30-day mortality, irrespective of cTn definition as a continuous, ordinal variable, or dichotomic variables. CONCLUSIONS: A single measurement of cTn at admission in patients with COVID-19 is associated with 30-day all-cause mortality and may have an important prognostic role for optimizing risk stratification.","Tanboga, Ibrahim Halil; Canpolat, Ugur; Özcan Çetin, Elif Hande; Kundi, Harun; Turan, Sema; Celik, Osman; Ata, Naim; Çay, Serkan; Özeke, Özcan; Kaymaz, Cihangir; Topaloglu, Serkan",Atherosclerosis,,413

More importantly, various reports indicate that the number of asymptomatic cases can be several-fold higher than the reported symptomatic cases. In this article, we take the reported cases in India and various states within the country as the specimen to understand the progression of the COVID-19. Employing a modified SEIRD model, we predict the spread of COVID-19 by the symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infectious population. Considering reported infection primarily due to symptomatic we compare the model predicted results with the available data to estimate the dynamics of the asymptomatically infected population. Our data indicate that in the absence of the asymptomatic infectious population, the number of symptomatic cases would have been much less. Therefore, the current progress of the symptomatic infection can be reduced by quarantining the asymptomatically infectious population via extensive or random testing. This study is motivated strictly towards academic pursuit; this theoretical investigation is not meant for influencing policy decisions or public health practices.","Chatterjee, Saptarshi; Sarkar, Apurba; Karmakar, Mintu; Chatterjee, Swarnajit; Paul, Raja",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03034v1.pdf,413

However, vaccine efficacy is not a static measure upon licensing, and the long term population studies are very important to evaluate vaccine performance and impact. COVID-19 vaccines were developed in record time and although the extent of sterilizing immunity is still under evaluation, the currently licensed vaccines are extremely effective against severe disease, with vaccine efficacy significantly higher after the full immunization schedule. We investigate the impact of vaccines which have different efficacies after first dose and after the second dose administration schedule, eventually considering different efficacies against severe disease as opposed to overall infection. As a proof of concept, we model the vaccine performance of hospitalization reduction at the momentary scenario of the Basque Country, Spain, with population in a mixed vaccination setting, giving insights into the population coverage needed to achieve herd immunity in the current vaccination context.","Stollenwerk, Nico; Mar, Javier; Van-Dierdonck, Joseba Bidaurrazaga; Ibarrondo, Oliver; Estadilla, Carlo; Aguiar, Maira",,,413

Considering that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described as important mediators of tissue damage in inflammatory diseases, we investigated whether NETs would be involved in COVID-19 pathophysiology. A cohort of 32 hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and healthy controls were enrolled. The concentration of NETs was augmented in plasma, tracheal aspirate, and lung autopsies tissues from COVID-19 patients, and their neutrophils released higher levels of NETs. Notably, we found that viable SARS-CoV-2 can directly induce the release of NETs by healthy neutrophils. Mechanistically, NETs triggered by SARS-CoV-2 depend on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, serine protease, virus replication, and PAD-4. Finally, NETs released by SARS-CoV-2-activated neutrophils promote lung epithelial cell death in vitro. These results unravel a possible detrimental role of NETs in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Therefore, the inhibition of NETs represents a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.","Veras, Flavio Protasio; Pontelli, Marjorie Cornejo; Silva, Camila Meirelles; Toller-Kawahisa, Juliana E; de Lima, Mikhael; Nascimento, Daniele Carvalho; Schneider, Ayda Henriques; Caetité, Diego; Tavares, Lucas Alves; Paiva, Isadora M; Rosales, Roberta; Colón, David; Martins, Ronaldo; Castro, Italo Araujo; Almeida, Glaucia M; Lopes, Maria Isabel Fernandes; Benatti, Maíra Nilson; Bonjorno, Letícia Pastorelli; Giannini, Marcela Cavichioli; Luppino-Assad, Rodrigo; Almeida, Sérgio Luna; Vilar, Fernando; Santana, Rodrigo; Bollela, Valdes R; Auxiliadora-Martins, Maria; Borges, Marcos; Miranda, Carlos Henrique; Pazin-Filho, Antônio; da Silva, Luis Lamberti P; Cunha, Larissa Dias; Zamboni, Dario S; Dal-Pizzol, Felipe; Leiria, Luiz O; Siyuan, Li; Batah, Sabrina; Fabro, Alexandre; Mauad, Thais; Dolhnikoff, Marisa; Duarte-Neto, Amaro; Saldiva, Paulo; Cunha, Thiago Mattar; Alves-Filho, José Carlos; Arruda, Eurico; Louzada-Junior, Paulo; Oliveira, Renê Donizeti; Cunha, Fernando Queiroz",J. exp. med,,413
336760,COVID-19 and immunocompromised conditions: Ongoing challenging issue,2021,"BACKGROUND: Various online rumors have led to inappropriate behaviors among the public in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in China. These rumors adversely affect people's physical and mental health. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between public emotions and rumors during the epidemic may help generate useful strategies for guiding public emotions and dispelling rumors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore whether public emotions are related to the dissemination of online rumors in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: We used the web-crawling tool Scrapy to gather data published by People's Daily on Sina Weibo, a popular social media platform in China, after January 8, 2020. Netizens' comments under each Weibo post were collected. Nearly 1 million comments thus collected were divided into 5 categories: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and neutral, based on the underlying emotional information identified and extracted from the comments by using a manual identification process. Data on rumors spread online were collected through Tencent's Jiaozhen platform. Time-lagged cross-correlation analyses were performed to examine the relationship between public emotions and rumors. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the angrier the public felt, the more rumors there would likely be (r=0.48, P<.001). Similar results were observed for the relationship between fear and rumors (r=0.51, P<.001) and between sadness and rumors (r=0.47, P<.001). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between happiness and rumors, with happiness lagging the emergence of rumors by 1 day (r=0.56, P<.001). In addition, our data showed a significant positive correlation between fear and fearful rumors (r=0.34, P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that public emotions are related to the rumors spread online in the context of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, these findings provide several suggestions, such as the use of web-based monitoring methods, for relevant authorities and policy makers to guide public emotions and behavior during this public health emergency.","Dong, Wei; Tao, Jinhu; Xia, Xiaolin; Ye, Lin; Xu, Hanli; Jiang, Peiye; Liu, Yangyang",J Med Internet Res,,413
337218,Role of rehabilitation in a COVID-19 survivor with intensive care unit-acquired weakness: A case report,2021,"PURPOSE: Urological service provision has changed dramatically with the advent of the SARS-CoV-2, necessitating restructuring and reorganization. The aim of this study was to review the reorganization of our unit, map the change in volume of departmental activities and discuss potential solutions. METHODS: Departmental activities over the months of April and May 2020 and 2019 were analysed. Details of admissions, operations, diagnostic procedures, outpatient reviews, morbidities and mortalities were recorded. Operations were performed on two sites, with elective operation transferred to an offsite, COVID-free hospital. RESULTS: Seventy-four emergency operations were performed onsite, with 85 elective operations outsourced. A total of 159 operations were performed, compared with 280 in the same period in 2019. Five (5.0%) of 101 admitted patients to the COVID hospital contracted COVID-19. No patients outsourced to the COVID-free hospital were infected there. Outpatient referrals to urology service decreased from 928 to 481. There was a 66% decrease in new cancer diagnoses. A virtual review clinic was established, with remaining outpatients reviewed through a telephone clinic platform. CONCLUSION: Compared with 2019, we performed fewer operations and outpatient procedures, had fewer admissions and diagnosed fewer patients with new cancers. However, outsourcing elective operation to designated non-COVID hospitals prevented the infection of any patient with COVID-19 in the post-operative period. The use of virtual clinic and telephone clinic has had some success in replacing traditional outpatient visits. The overall significant decrease in operative volume will likely precipitate a mismatch between demand and service provision in the coming months, unless capacity is increased.","Collins, Patrick M; Madden, Aideen; O039,; Connell, Clare; Omer, Shawgi Abdelrazig; Shakeel Inder, Mohammud; Casey, Rowan G; Flynn, Robert J; Thomas, Arun Z; Smyth, Lisa G; Manecksha, Rustom P",Ir. j. med. sci,,413

While research has commonly investigated the psychosocial antecedents of digital health information seeking behavior (digital HISB) and social media use (SMU), there has been limited research on the independent effects of emotions and no research on the interactive effects of emotions. In the context of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, this study investigates the affective, personal relevance, and socio-demographic antecedents of digital HISB and SMU, using data from an online survey of U.S. Millennials (N = 1037) in April–May 2020. Linear regression results show the effects of socio-demographic and personal relevance factors. For the independent effects of emotions, fear and sadness were associated with digital HISB;fear, joy, and disgust were associated with high-informational SMU;and joy and disgust were associated with low-informational SMU. Three interactive effects of discrete negative emotions suggest that an increase in one emotion can amplify the effect of another emotion on a measure of digital and social media use. In the fourth interaction of two negative emotions with strong biological regulatory processes, there is evidence that an increase in one emotion can diminish the effect of another emotion. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.","Beaudoin, Christopher E.; Hong, Traci",Computers in Human Behavior,,413
337784,Is pleural effusion in COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia related to in-hospital mortality?,2021,"Coronaviruses share conservative spike protein (S) on their enveloped membrane surface, where S1 subunit recognizes and binds the cellular receptor, and the S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion. This similarity raises the question: does coronaviral infection by one create protection to others? Convalescent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) sera were tested for cross reactivity with peptides from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which shares 74% homology. Our results showed significant cross-reactivity with a peptide of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain of the MERS-CoV spike protein. Sera samples of 47 validated seropositive convalescent COVID-19 patients and 40 sera samples of control patients, collected in pre-COVID time were used to establish cross-bind reactivity with the MERS-CoV peptide. Significantly stronger binding (p < 0.0001) was observed for IgG antibodies in convalescent COVID-19 patients compared to the control group. In ELISA, MERS-CoV peptide helps to discriminate post-COVID-19 populations and non-infected ones by the presence of antibodies in blood samples. This suggests that polyclonal antibodies established during SARS-CoV-2 infection can recognize and probably decrease severity of MERS-CoV and other coronaviral infections. The high homology of the spike protein domain also suggests that the opposite effect can be true: coronaviral infections produce cross-reactive antibodies effective against SARS-CoV-2. The collected data prove that despite the core HR2 region is hidden in the native viral conformation, its exposure during cell entry makes it highly immunogenic. Since inhibitory peptides to this region were previously described, this opens new possibilities in fighting coronaviral infections and developing vaccines effective even after possible viral mutations.","Rabets, Andrii; Bila, Galyna; Grytsko, Roman; Samborskyy, Markian; Rebets, Yuriy; Vari, Sandor G; Pagneux, Quentin; Barras, Alexandre; Boukherroub, Rabah; Szunerits, Sabine; Bilyy, Rostyslav",Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),,413

Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data were analysed using Braun and Clarke's six step procedure for thematic analysis.1ResultThere were 40 responses from mental healthcare professionals of varying grades from different sub-specialties, predominantly from the UK. Compared to before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, there was an increase in usage of telephone (9(22.5% to (29)72.5%) and video consultations (4(10%) to 17(42.5%)). Respondents reported an increase in virtual MDTs (35(87.5%) during the pandemic, 9(22.5%) pre-pandemic).Based on a 5-point Likert scale, the mean technical quality of telephone consultations was 3.56/5 (Range 2-5), with 75% rating telephone consultations as not being as good as face-to-face consultations. The mean technical quality of video consultations was 3.58/5 (Range 2-5), with 63% rating video consultations as not being as good as face-to-face consultations. 25 (62.5%) respondents felt comfortable using telephone consultations during the pandemic, 20(50%) felt comfortable using video consultations. Recurring themes identified from the qualitative data regarding reasons for the technical quality ratings were: connection issues, poor infrastructure and security concerns.Nine (23%) respondents felt that using video conferencing consultations had a detrimental impact on the mental health of patients while 14(35%) felt that telephone consultations had a detrimental impact on patients’ mental health. Recurring themes for health practitioners’ perceived effect of the use of telemedicine on patients’ mental heath were the loss of personal touch and reduced patient engagement.ConclusionThere was a substantial increase in usage of remote consultations during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among mental healthcare professionals. The results reported in the present study suggest there are numerous barriers to the use of telemedicine in psychiatry, which require future exploration, ideally through interview or ethnographic studies.","Khodabux, Nusra Gangadharan Satheesh Tromans Samuel Hiremath Avinash",BJPsych Open,,413

In recent months, our lives have been fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, economic, and social impacts of which are almost invaluable for the time being. In addition to the acute consequences of viral infection, more and more data are proving its effects on the entire population: an increase in the incidence of psychological distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviours. It is also a very important question, how the global crisis is affecting suicide rates. In my paper, I summarize the acute and chronic effects of viral infection and the general and specific psychological-psychopathological consequences of the epidemic based on the most significant psychiatric literature of the recent period, paying special attention to suicidal risk and the most vulnerable groups. Studies suggest that mental troubles and suicidal behaviour resulting from a pandemic are becoming an increasingly important public health problem. Although the treatment of viral infections and slowing the spread of the infection are still the most important goals today, we all need to be prepared for the long-term consequences of the epidemic. In order to prevent and mitigate the expected negative mental health effects of a pandemic, it is necessary to develop and apply general and specific methods. In addition to health care, mental health and community care systems, political and economic decision-makers, civil society organizations and the media must also play a role. Their effective cooperation is key to the implementation of prevention strategies that can be applied at the individual, community and social levels, as this is the only way to prevent the epidemic spread of more serious mental health problems, the ""psychodemia"".

Based on recent reports, the most severely ill patients present with coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like massive intravascular clot formation is frequently seen in this cohort. Therefore, coagulation tests may be considered useful to discriminate severe cases of COVID-19. The clinical presentation of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is organ dysfunction primarily, whereas hemorrhagic events are less frequent. Changes in hemostatic biomarkers represented by increase in D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products indicate the essence of coagulopathy is massive fibrin formation. In comparison with bacterial-sepsis-associated coagulopathy/DIC, prolongation of prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, and decrease in antithrombin activity is less frequent and thrombocytopenia is relatively uncommon in COVID-19. The mechanisms of the coagulopathy are not fully elucidated, however. It is speculated that the dysregulated immune responses orchestrated by inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte cell death, hypoxia, and endothelial damage are involved. Bleeding tendency is uncommon, but the incidence of thrombosis in COVID-19 and the adequacy of current recommendations regarding standard venous thromboembolic dosing are uncertain.","Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H; Levi, Marcel; Thachil, Jecko",J. thromb. haemost,,413

During this emergency period, the restricted human dealings with nature have appeared as blessing for health of the total environment. The variation of atmospheric O3 may modulate the range of UV index (UVI) at any region of the earth. The objective of the study is to examine the variation of UV index over the megacities of India with respect to tropospheric O3 level modification during COVID-19 lockdown. The meteorological or environmental data (temperature in °C, gust in km/h, wind speed km/h, relative humidity in %, air pressure in mb and cloud cover in okta) of four selective megacities of India (Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai) during and pre lockdown period have been obtained to comprehend about the variation of UV index and tropospheric O3. The descriptive statistical applications i.e. standard deviation, standard errors and K-means clustering have been done through standard statistical software. In the present study, t-test has been used to understand level of significance of surface O3 and UVI during pre-lockdown (2019) and lockdown (2020) phase. The result shows that the four major megacities in India namely New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai have experienced the vibrant diminution in terms of the concentration of UV index with slightly increasing the tropospheric O3 level during the lockdown phase. The higher accumulation of O3 during the lockdown in the lower atmosphere of four megacities does not exceed the permissible limit. The excess amount of O3 has remarkably contributed to trap the harmful UV radiation which has lowered the UVI in these worst polluted megacities of India. In the meantime, the prominent reduction of NOx during the lockdown period decreases the titration impact to O3 and this mechanism helps to revitalize the ozone concentration level. The uniqueness of the current study is highlighted the ground reality regarding reduction of UV index and amplification of tropospheric O3 concentration during lockdown phase. This study definitely assists to make new environmental policy, act and law for recover the health of the total environment.","Bera, Biswajit; Bhattacharjee, Sumana; Shit, Pravat Kumar; Sengupta, Nairita; Saha, Soumik",Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess,,413

Two other two forms of CoV were epidemic in 2003 when Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) spread in Hong Kong and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) spread in the Middle East region. This bibliometric study is an attempt to trace the trends of research associated with “Coronavirus” for a period of 50 years using the SCOPUS database. The study was carried out using the keyword Coronavirus and analyzed for annual growth, productive countries, institutes, authors, journals, highly cited papers, and research focus using keywords. There were two peaks when a large number of publications appeared. Most of the research publications were from the USA (31.67%), and the University of Hong Kong was the most productive institute. The Journal of Virology has published the most number of articles on CoV.","Ram, Shri",Sci Technol Libr,,413
341666,Identifying Patients at Greatest Risk of Mortality due to COVID-19: A New England Perspective,2020,"Absent pharmaceutical interventions, social distancing, lock-downs and mobility restrictions remain our prime response in the face of epidemic outbreaks. To ease their potentially devastating socioeconomic consequences, we propose here an alternating quarantine strategy: at every instance, half of the population remains under lockdown while the other half continues to be active - maintaining a routine of weekly succession between activity and quarantine. This regime minimizes infectious interactions, as it allows only half of the population to interact for just half of the time. As a result it provides a dramatic reduction in transmission, comparable to that achieved by a population-wide lockdown, despite sustaining socioeconomic continuity at ~50% capacity. The weekly alternations also help address the specific challenge of COVID-19, as their periodicity synchronizes with the natural SARS-CoV-2 disease time-scales, allowing to effectively isolate the majority of infected individuals precisely at the time of their peak infection.","Meidan, Dror; Schulmann, Nava; Cohen, Reuven; Haber, Simcha; Yaniv, Eyal; Sarid, Ronit; Barzel, Baruch",Nat Commun,,413

Update as of July 31st, 2020",2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel pathogen recently introduced to the human population. It may be characterised by the rapid epidemic transmissions due to lack of the herd immunity and notable mortality, increasing with age and among patients with comorbidities. Outbreak forecasting and modelling suggest that infection numbers will continue to rise globally in the forthcoming months. Upon investigation of the disease patterns differences in mortality between south-European and north-European countries became striking with mortality in Italy and Spain exceeding 10% and <5% in Germany and Poland so far. It is unknown if this difference is associated with the higher virulence of the viral strains, differences in host genomics, access to medical resources or other unknown variables. Little is also known about SARS CoV-2 evolutionary and transmission patterns as limited number of the large-scale sequence and phylogenetic analyses have been performed so far. In this review, we aim to provide concise data on the SARS CoV-2 genomics, molecular evolution and variability with special consideration of the disease course.","Parczewski, Milosz; Ciechanowicz, Andrzej",Pol.

342414,Patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia at a sub-acute admissions unit exhibit profound muscular weakness,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The China American Psychoanalytic Alliance (CAPA) has been offering psychoanalytic psychotherapy training and treatment to Chinese mental health professionals entirely over the Internet since 2006. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, most practitioners worldwide had to turn to teletherapy. US psychoanalytic practitioners were more negative towards teletherapy than those from other theoretical orientations. We predicted that CAPA practitioners as compared to US psychoanalytic practitioners would be more prepared for teletherapy services during the pandemic, since they their training and treatment had been on-line. METHOD: We compared survey results from 164 CAPA practitioners with 165 US psychoanalytic practitioners (matched for age) who had recently psychoanalytically treated a patient on-line. CAPA participants were recruited from CAPA email lists and the US sample were recruited from the Society for Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Psychology of the American Psychological Association, the American Psychoanalytic Association and International Psychotherapy Institute. RESULTS: CAPA practitioners as compared to US psychoanalytic practitioners had more positive opinions about teletherapy before the pandemic; had more positive opinions about teletherapy during the pandemic; and had more positive opinions about the effectiveness of teletherapy in working with transference, relational issues and resistance. The CAPA practitioners were more prepared to do psychoanalytic psychotherapy during the pandemic than the US psychoanalytic practitioners. DISCUSSION: Xiubing Wang discusses these findings in terms of her own experience as a CAPA graduate and treater before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic in China.","Wang, Xiubing; Gordon, Robert M; Snyder, Elise W",Asia Pac Psychiatry,,413

343919,Outcomes Among HIV-Positive Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19,2020,"An urgent learning problem in the Covid 19 pandemic is the unavailability of IT-based teaching materials that support online learning. In addition, in learning physics there are also fundamental problems, namely students’ low understanding of concepts. Misconceptions often occur in learning physics, especially in the concept of motion. Therefore it is necessary to know the problems and supporting factors of learning, especially in motion material, so that the right solution can be found. This study aims to determine students’ understanding of the concept of motion and to determine the conditions of learning in one of the high schools in Padang Pariaman Indonesia. This type of research is descriptive research, in the form of survey research. The instrument used was a concept test of motion taken from the FCI (Force Concept Inventory), this test is equipped with questions of belief and answers to the students’ reasons. Another instrument is a student and teacher questionnaire. The sample consisted of 31 superior class students and 3 physics teachers. The results showed that 36% of students had misconceptions, 34% of students did not understand the concept and only 30% of students understood the concept even though they had studied the topic being tested. Teacher learning is also lacking in identifying misconceptions (50%), less experimental activities (50%), discussions (58%) and other activities that actively involve students. Meanwhile students want learning that involves them actively even in the conditions of online learning during the current Covid19 era.","Puspitasari, R.; Mufit, F.; Asrizal,",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,,413
345039,Could a mannequin simplify rhinopharyngeal swab collection in COVID 19 patients?,2020,"This study assessed if Chinese consumer attitudes towards a range of lamb attributes (such as origin, food safety, appearance, taste, price), and their opinions of New Zealand lamb (9- and 7-point Likert scales, respectively), had changed since the outbreak COVID-19. The same survey was carried out in Shanghai and Beijing pre (December 2018) and post COVID-19 (November 2020), ~9 months after China’s initial outbreak, with 500 and 523 consumers, respectively. From December 2018 to November 2020, there was an increase in the proportion of Chinese consumers purchasing red meat online or from a butcher, and cooking their lamb well-done. In contrast, there were minimal differences in Chinese consumer ratings between December 2018 and November 2020 for different lamb attributes and opinions of New Zealand lamb. Cluster analysis revealed that many consumers (140 in December 2018/376 in November 2020) used only a small portion of the high end of the scale when rating lamb attributes, resulting in little differences between the attributes. This study suggests COVID-19 has enhanced some food safety related behaviors but had little effect on Chinese opinions and preferences for New Zealand lamb attributes. It also highlights that survey design should be carefully considered when collecting responses from Chinese consumers.","Hutchings, Scott C.; Guerrero, Luis Mirosa Miranda Bremer Phil Mather Damien Pavan Enrique Hicks Talia M.; Day, Li Realini Carolina E.",Foods,,413

We treat the cumulative daily number of deaths in a specific region as a curve (functional data) such that the data comprise of a set of curves over a cross-section of locations. We start by using clustering methods for functional data to identify potential heterogeneity in the curves and their functional derivatives. This first stage is an unconditional descriptive analysis, as we do not use any covariate to estimate the clusters. The estimated clusters are analyzed as""levels of alert""to identify cities in a possible critical situation. In the second and final stage, we propose a functional quantile regression model of the death curves on a number of scalar socioeconomic and demographic indicators in order to investigate their functional effects at different levels of the cumulative number of deaths over time. The proposed model showed a superior predictive capacity by providing better curve fit at different levels of the cumulative number of deaths compared to the functional regression model based on ordinary least squares.","Collazos, Julian A.

Material and methods: We searched YouTube using the terms ""pericardiocentesis, cardiac tamponade, pericardial effusion, pericardial effusion drainage, pericardial tamponade"" for uploaded videos. We scored every video according to the questions we prepared using the guidelines about pericardiocentesis. We used the HONcode score, GQS score, and RELIABILITY score to assess the quality of videos. Two physicians independently and blindly classified videos as useful or misleading and rated them. Results: A total of 168 videos were examined. After the application of exclusion criteria, 38 videos were evaluated. The pericardiocentesis checklist average score was 10.45 ±2.56. According to sources of videos, the average score for university or research hospital videos was 13.1 ±1.5, and videos whose source could not be identified had an average score of 7.5 ±2.0.

352677,Glucocorticoid excess and COVID-19 disease,2020,"Pharmacists listen to and dispel medication misinformation daily. Because of their accessibility, pharmacists have the opportunity during pharmacist-patient interactions to begin a dialogue with their patients and provide critical education to improve patient safety and public health. Current examples of pharmacists intervening with medication misinformation include addressing the antivaccination community, educating on the safety of generic drugs, and using evidence-based medicine for antimicrobial stewardship. However, combating medication misinformation in pharmacy practice with patients takes on many forms and can pose a number of challenges. Most recently during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a concurrent infodemic has led to claims of pharmacotherapeutic superiority and efficacy unsubstantiated by scientific evidence. Misinformation and partisan politics have also created a distrust in COVID-19 vaccine development. In addition, rogue Internet pharmacies and companies have marketed new and unverified COVID-19 treatments and tests. Pharmacists must actively combat these instances of medication misinformation and educate their patients on how not to fall victim to convincing marketing and misinformation schemes. Pharmacists can help patients recognize misinformation by vetting sources of information and communicating how negative emotional information circulates. In addition, pharmacists combat misinformation with patients by providing accurate alternative explanations in patient-friendly language. Although it is easier to stay silent and let misinformation circulate, pharmacists must work with their health care team members to actively reject misinformation pertaining to medications, COVID-19 pharmacotherapy and vaccinations, and in any future public health crisis.","Marwitz, Kathryn K",,,413

353805,"Outcomes of seizures, status epilepticus, and EEG findings in critically ill patient with COVID-19",2021,"Bacteria participate in a wide diversity of symbiotic associations with eukaryotic hosts that require precise interactions for bacterial recognition and persistence. Most commonly, host-associated bacteria interfere with host gene expression to modulate the immune response to the infection. However, many of these bacteria also interfere with host cellular differentiation pathways to create a hospitable niche, resulting in the formation of novel cell types, tissues, and organs. In both of these situations, bacterial symbionts must interact with eukaryotic regulatory pathways. Here, we detail what is known about how bacterial symbionts, from pathogens to mutualists, control host cellular differentiation across the central dogma, from epigenetic chromatin modifications, to transcription and mRNA processing, to translation and protein modifications. We identify four main trends from this survey. First, mechanisms for controlling host gene expression appear to evolve from symbionts co-opting cross-talk between host signaling pathways. Second, symbiont regulatory capacity is constrained by the processes that drive reductive genome evolution in host-associated bacteria. Third, the regulatory mechanisms symbionts exhibit correlate with the cost/benefit nature of the association. And, fourth, symbiont mechanisms for interacting with host genetic regulatory elements are not bound by native bacterial capabilities. Using this knowledge, we explore how the ubiquitous intracellular Wolbachia symbiont of arthropods and nematodes may modulate host cellular differentiation to manipulate host reproduction. Our survey of the literature on how infection alters gene expression in Wolbachia and its hosts revealed that, despite their intermediate-sized genomes, different strains appear capable of a wide diversity of regulatory manipulations. Given this and Wolbachia's diversity of phenotypes and eukaryotic-like proteins, we expect that many symbiont-induced host differentiation mechanisms will be discovered in this system.","Russell, Shelbi L; Castillo, Jennie Ruelas",Results Probl Cell Differ,,413

We offer a brief review of governmental policy responses in four OECD countries and how they may impact the disconnect YYA within those countries. METHODS: Literature was reviewed utilizing Cochrane Library, ERIC, PsychINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science to outline existing inequities among disconnected YYA and COVID-19 economic and health impacts. Government responses to COVID-19 from four OECD countries were reviewed. Using the social protection model, we highlighted significant policy changes and developments that influence the protection of vulnerable populations and evaluated the potential effect of long-term economic dislocations prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Disconnected YYA suffered significant financial and health burdens with no social protection floor in place. Lessons learned prior to and during the pandemic indicate that initiatives aimed at improving health and well-being among vulnerable YYA and their communities must be adequately funded, flexible, and comprehensive. Attempts to connect or reconnect YYA who were disconnected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will require a re-envisioning of policy. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, governments must invest in social safety net programs that focus on supporting those most at-risk. A concentrated focus on job creation, education and training, and paid work experience, investments in early childhood care and education, housing, health and mental health care is necessary to not only offset the pandemic's effects but also support thriving in the future for YYA.","Palmer, Ashley N; Small, Eusebius",Scand J Public Health,,413

357233,Impact of low dose tocilizumab on mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia,2020,"Introduction: Since December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has affected almost every country in the world, including Iran. General awareness and commitment to recommendations made by health officials have important role in control of the outbreak. The aim of the current study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of Iranians concerning COVID-19 after Nowruz (Persian New Year Holiday) in Iran and identifying its determining demographic and socioeconomic factors. Method: A cross-sectional study was designed. We translated and culturally adopted Zhong's questionnaire to Persian, which is designed to assess people's knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19. We used online Google forms to send the questionnaire via social platforms throughout the country. A total of 1015 Iranians participated in the study. Results: The mean knowledge score among our participants was 10.60, with an overall correct response rate of 88.35%. Higher knowledge score was associated with higher education, being a professor, and residing in cities. Lower knowledge score was associated with being unemployed, marital status other than single or married, and living in rural areas. Almost all of our participants had favorable attitudes and practices toward COVID-19. Conclusion: Overall, Iranians showed a satisfactory KAP towards COVID-19. We suggest more attention to informing people living in rural areas and unemployed, as they were related to more risky behaviors and had lower knowledge scores regarding COVID-19.","Nakhostin-Ansari, Amin; Aghajani, Faezeh; Khonji, Mohammad Saeid; Aghajani, Reyhaneh; Pirayandeh, Pendar; Allahbeigi, Rashad; Hosami Rudsari, Hadiseh",J Prev Med Hyg,,413

359608,Lipid emulsion treatment as an antidote for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity,2021,"Proteins function in the crowded cellular environments with high salt concentrations, thus facing tremendous challenges of misfolding/aggregation which represents a pathological hallmark of aging and an increasing spectrum of human diseases. Recently, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) were recognized to drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a common principle for organizing cellular membraneless organelles (MLOs). ATP, the universal energy currency for all living cells, mysteriously has concentrations of 2-12 mM, much higher than required for its previously-known functions. Only recently, ATP was decoded to behave as a biological hydrotrope to inhibit protein LLPS and aggregation at mM. We further revealed that ATP also acts as a bivalent binder, which not only biphasically modulates LLPS driven by IDRs of human and viral proteins, but also bind to the conserved nucleic-acid-binding surfaces of the folded proteins. Most unexpectedly, ATP appears to act as a hydration mediator to antagonize the crowding-induced destabilization as well as to enhance folding of proteins without significant binding. Here, this review focuses on summarizing the results of these biophysical studies and discussing their implications in an evolutionary context. By linking triphosphate with unique hydration property to adenosine, ATP appears to couple the ability for establishing hydrophobic, &#960;-&#960;, &#960;-cation and electrostatic interactions to the capacity in mediating hydration of proteins, which is at the heart of folding, dynamics, stability, phase separation and aggregation. Consequently, ATP acquired a category of functions at ~mM to energy-independently control protein homeostasis with diverse mechanisms, thus implying a link between cellular ATP concentrations and protein-aggregation diseases.","Song, Jianxing",Protein Sci,,413

360219,Hospitalised COVID-19 patients of the Mount Sinai Health System: a retrospective observational study using the electronic medical records,2020,"The rapid global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of significant health concern, highlighting the immediate need for antivirals. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir. This study highlights the importance of considering the balance between incorporation and excision properties of NAs between the RdRp and ExoN.","Shannon, Ashleigh; Le, Nhung Thi-Tuyet; Selisko, Barbara; Eydoux, Cecilia; Alvarez, Karine; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; Decroly, Etienne; Peersen, Olve; Ferron, Francois; Canard, Bruno",Antiviral Res,,413

The structural variety of the studied compounds, that include 3 different forms of the N-N-C(S)-N skeleton and combinations of 13 different substituents alongside the extensive length of the interface, resulted in the failure of the QSAR analysis, since different molecules were binding to different parts of the interface. Subsequently, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) analysis on all studied compounds, followed by a toxicity analysis using statistical models for selected compounds, was carried out to evaluate their potential use as lead compounds for drug design. Combined, these studies highlighted two molecules among the studied compounds, i.e., 5-(pyrrol-2-yl)-2-(2-methoxyphenylamino)-1,3,4-thiadiazole and 1-(cyclopentanoyl)-4-(3-iodophenyl)-thiosemicarbazide, as the best candidates for the development of future drugs.","Plonka, Wojciech; Paneth, Agata; Paneth, Piotr",Molecules (Basel),,413

365496,"Epidemiological Characteristics of COVID-19 Outbreak at Fitness Centers in Cheonan, Korea",2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus is highly transmissible among individuals through both droplets and aerosol leading to determine severe pneumonia. Among the various factors that can influence both the onset of disease and the severity of its complications, the microbiome composition has also been investigated. Recent evidence showed the possible relationship between gut, lung, nasopharyngeal, or oral microbiome and COVID-19, but very little is known about it. Therefore, we aimed to verify the relationships between nasopharyngeal microbiome and the development of either COVID-19 or the severity of symptoms. To this purpose, we analyzed, by next generation sequencing, the hypervariable V1-V2-V3 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (n=18) and control (CO) individuals (n=12) using Microbiota solution A (Arrow Diagnostics). We found a significant lower abundance of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria in COVID-19 patients in respect to CO (p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively) from the phylum up to the genus (p<0.001). The Fusobacterium periodonticum (FP) resulted as the most significantly reduced species in COVID-19 patients respect to CO. FP is reported as being able to perform the surface sialylation. Noteworthy, some sialic acids residues on the cell surface could work as additional S protein of SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 could use sialic acids as receptors to bind to the epithelium of the respiratory tract, promoting its clustering and the disease development. We can therefore speculate that the significant reduction of FP in COVID-19 patients could be directly or indirectly linked to the modulation of sialic acid metabolism. Finally, viral or environmental factors capable of interfering with sialic metabolism could determine a fall in the individual protection from SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are necessary to clarify the precise role of FP in COVID-19.","Nardelli, Carmela; Gentile, Ivan; Setaro, Mario; Di Domenico, Carmela; Pinchera, Biagio; Buonomo, Antonio Riccardo; Zappulo, Emanuela; Scotto, Riccardo; Scaglione, Giovanni Luca; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Capoluongo, Ettore",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,413

The prevalence of co-infection and secondary infection in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. AIMS: To investigate the role of co-infections and secondary infections in disease severity of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out between 11 January 2020 and 1 March 2020 among 408 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients in China. These patients were divided into three groups based on disease severity: mild or moderate, severe, or critically ill. Microbiological pathogens in blood, urine, and respiratory tract specimens were detected by the combination of culture, serology, polymerase chain reaction, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). RESULTS: The median age of participants was 48 years (IQR 34-60 years). Fifty-two patients (12.7%) had at least one additional pathogen, 8.1% were co-infected, and 5.1% had a secondary infection. There were 13 Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, 8 Haemophilus influenzae cases, 8 respiratory viruses, and 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae cases, primarily detected in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. Hospital-acquired infection pathogens were more common in critically ill patients. Compared to those without additional pathogens, patients with co-infections and/or secondary infections were more likely to receive antibiotics (p < 0.001) and have elevated levels of d-dimer (p = 0.0012), interleukin-6 (p = 0.0027), and procalcitonin (p = 0.0002). The performance of conventional culture was comparable with that of mNGS in diagnosis of secondary infections.

368160,COVID-19 Pandemic and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Management Protocol From a British Cardiac Centre,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed severe restrictions on people’s behavior worldwide with school closures in many countries These closures have shifted education from the classroom to the home This change is unprecedented, and home-schooling has placed substantial stress on families across the world As of 9 April 2020, 1 57 billion children were being educated by families that had little or no experience of protracted home-schooling An essential but neglected issue related to COVID-19 is the psychological impact of home-schooling on family wellbeing, especially considering the other stressors they are experiencing including social isolation, fears of infection, frustration, boredom, inadequate information, and financial stress This study explores the impact of home-schooling on family psychological wellbeing during COVID-19 These findings will help develop supports and interventions for this population Methods: An exploratory qualitative study will be conducted using semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of families (at least one parent and one child) Participants will be recruited using social media outlets, contacts of academic members and snowball sampling Interviews will take place using Microsoft Teams and via telephone and recorded for transcription purposes These transcripts will be analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) Ethical approval has been granted by the Social Research Ethics Subcommittee (SRESC) Maynooth University (2407411) The Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) has funded the research with the COVID-19 rapid response grant The dissemination of findings will be through open access journal publications, distribution of lay summaries, press release and policy papers Discussion: The research findings will discuss the impact that home-schooling has had on family psychological wellbeing It will examine how parents are managing their children’s education and learning while handling the other stresses associated with COVID-19 A deeper understanding of the impact of school closures and home-schooling on family processes is essential if the psychological wellbeing of families is to be protected and supported during challenging times such as health-related disasters © The Author(s) 2020","O’Sullivan, K.; McGrane, A.; Clark, S.; Marshall, K.",International Journal of Qualitative Methods,,413
369142,Evaluation and Management of Pediatric Concussion in the Acute Setting,2021,"OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2)-related pneumonia, referred to as COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 19), is a public health emergency as it carries high morbidity, mortality, and has no approved specific pharmacological treatments. In this case series, we aimed to report preliminary data obtained with anti-complement C5 therapy with eculizumab in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of ASL Napoli 2 Nord. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a case series of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection and severe pneumonia or ARDS who were treated with up to 4 infusions of eculizumab as an off-label agent. Patients were also treated with anticoagulant therapy with Enoxaparin 4000 IU/day via subcutaneous injection, antiviral therapy with Lopinavir 800 mg/day + Ritonavir 200 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV, vitamine C 6 g/day for 4 days, and were on Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). RESULTS: We treated four COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe pneumonia or ARDS. All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab. Eculizumab induced a drop in inflammatory markers. Mean C Reactive Protein levels dropped from 14.6 mg/dl to 3.5 mg/dl and the mean duration of the disease was 12.8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. Our results support eculizumab use as an off-label treatment of COVID-19, pending confirmation from the ongoing SOLID-C19 trial.","Diurno, F; Numis, F G; Porta, G; Cirillo, F; Maddaluno, S; Ragozzino, A; De Negri, P; Di Gennaro, C; Pagano, A; Allegorico, E; Bressy, L; Bosso, G; Ferrara, A; Serra, C; Montisci, A; D039,; Amico, M; Schiano Lo Morello, S; Di Costanzo, G; Tucci, A G; Marchetti, P; Di Vincenzo, U; Sorrentino, I; Casciotta, A; Fusco, M; Buonerba, C; Berretta, M; Ceccarelli, M; Nunnari, G; Diessa, Y; Cicala, S; Facchini, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,413

METHODS: A systematic research was performed on the major international online databases; Thirty-five articles were selected. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction in testosterone levels and sperm quality in subjects with COVID-19 has been highlighted in several papers; however, in many cases the tests have been conducted in patients with active disease and long-term consequences are still not known. Some studies have confirmed the presence of the virus in the testis in a low percentage of patients; viral presence in sperm has only been found in one study. Testicular discomfort, which could indicate viral orchitis, was highlighted in several works, with an incidence of up to 19% percent of patients. The presence of inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrates, IgG and inflammatory cytokines have been documented in several works; pathological signs of inflammation were found in 60.9% of testicular biopsies performed in one study. The entry of the virus into the testis cells, both stromal and seminal cells appeared to be Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) mediated, as it also occurs in other tissues. DNA fragmentation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, autoantibody production and ACE2 mediated effect have all been hypothesized as cause of cellular damage. CONCLUSIONS: The results on effects of COVID-19 infection on the male reproductive system are currently insufficient as they are based on a small number of patients and therefore are often contradictory.Certain mechanisms of testicular damage are still to be assessed, as any risk categories like age, ethnicity, or others. As for the transmission of the virus through sperm, there is insufficient evidence to ensure that this cannot happen.","Delle Fave, Rocco Francesco; Polisini, Giordano; Giglioni, Gianluca; Parlavecchio, Arnaldo; Dell039,; Atti, Lucio; Galosi, Andrea Benedetto",Arch Ital Urol Androl,,413

Online resources and virtual care broaden Foundry's reach. Its online platform - foundrybc.ca - offers information and resources on topics such as mental health, sexual wellness, life skills, and other content suggested by youth and young adults. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant and unique challenges to the youth and their families/caregivers served by Foundry. Disruptions to school, access to essential healthcare services such as counselling, familial financial security and related consequences has left young people with heightened anxiety. The Foundry team mobilized to respond to these extenuating circumstances and support BC youth and their families/caregivers during this hard time through three goals: (1) to amplify (and translate for young people and their families/caregivers) key messages released by government to support public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) to develop content that supports the needs of young people and their families/caregivers that existed before COVID-19 and are likely to be exacerbated as a result of this pandemic; and (3) to develop and host opportunities through social media and website articles to engage young people and their families/caregivers by creating a sense of community and promoting togetherness and social connection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each goal and plan integrated the leadership, feedback and needs of youth and their families through engagement with Foundry's provincial youth and family advisory committees. Our study evaluated Foundry's media response to the COVID-19 pandemic by recording/measuring (1) the website/social content created, including emerged thematic topic areas; (2) the process of topic identification through engagement with youth and young adults; (3) the social and website analytics of the created content; and (4) the constant, critical team-reflection of our response to the pandemic.

373522,Cutaneous Manifestations of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Analysis of Individual Patient-Level Data (preprint),2020,"Over the last 50 years, the Indian population aged 50 years and above (older adults) has quadrupled and is expected to comprise 404 million people in 2036, representing 27% of the country's projected population. Consequently, the contribution of chronic disease to older adults' total burden of diseases in India is likely to escalate. Disease burden is notably amplified by immunosenescence, a deterioration of the immune system that develops with age, leading to increasing susceptibility to infectious diseases and other comorbidities. Older adults with infectious diseases have a higher incidence and likelihood of life-threatening comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, stroke, myocardial infarction, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Therefore, immunization of older adults through vaccination might greatly reduce the burden imposed by vaccine preventable infectious diseases in this population. Here, we review evidence relevant to the disease burden among adults aged &#8805; 50 years in India, and existing vaccination recommendations. Furthermore, we suggest a set of routine vaccinations for healthy older adults in India. There is a clear mandate to recognize the contributions of older adults to society and embrace strategies promoting healthy aging, which is described by the World Health Organization as the process of developing and maintaining functional ability and well-being in older age. Increasing vaccination awareness and coverage among older adults is an important step in that direction for India.","Vora, Agam; Di Pasquale, Alberta; Kolhapure, Shafi; Agrawal, Ashish",Drugs Aging,,413

A number of scholars have called for more in-depth critical research on COVID-19 and health inequalities to produce a strong empirical evidence based on these issues. There are also justifiable concerns about the scarcity of health-equity actions oriented analyses of the situation and calls for more empirical evidence on COVID-19 and health inequalities. A preliminary condition to establish this type of information is strong capacity to conduct health inequalities research. Worldwide, however, this type of capacity is limited, which, alongside other challenges, will likely hinder capacities of many countries to develop comprehensive equity-oriented COVID-19 analyses, and adequate responses to present and future crises. The current pandemic reinforces the pending need to invest in and strengthen these research capacities. These capacities must be supported by widespread recognition and concern, cognitive social capital, and greater commitment to coordinated, transparent action, and responsibility.

Preliminary findings showed that mortality was reduced in those who consume metformin compared to those who did not, and given its low cost and widespread availability; metformin is an attractive and potential agent to mitigate excessive risk in diabetic populations. METHODS: Several medical databases (Pubmed, EuropePMC, EBSCOhost, Proquest, Cochrane library) and two health-science preprint servers (preprint.org and Medrxiv) were systematically searched for relevant literature. RESULTS: Nine studies with 10,233 subjects were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis. Meta-analysis showed that metformin is associated with lower mortality in pooled non-adjusted model (OR 0.45 [0.25, 0.81], p = 0.008; I2: 63.9%, p = 0.026) and pooled adjusted model (OR 0.64 [0.43, 0.97], p = 0.035; I2: 52.1%, p = 0.064).

375607,Neurological Manifestation of COVID-19 and the Enhanced Role of Physiatrists,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and hand hygiene have been the primary means of reducing transmission in the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, but understanding of their determinants is limited. This study aimed to investigate knowledge and socio-cognitive perceptions, and their associations with such protective behaviours, in UK university students. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of 293 students was undertaken on 13 May 2020. Survey questions addressed demographics, knowledge of the disease and effectiveness of the protective measures, risk perception, socio-cognitive perceptions (e.g. attitude, social support, and self-efficacy), habit, time factors and trust, as well as the hand hygiene and social distancing behaviours. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the strongest associations of potential determinants with behaviour. RESULTS: Participants reported high levels of social distancing with 88.9% answering ""Mostly"" or ""Always"" for every activity, but only 42.0% reporting the same for all hand hygiene activities. Knowledge of the effectiveness of each activity in preventing transmission was high, with 90.7% and 93.5% respectively identifying at least 7 of 8 hand hygiene or 9 of 10 social distancing activities correctly. Habit (ß = 0.39, p = 0.001) and time factors (ß = 0.28, p = 0.001) were the greatest contributors to unique variance in hand hygiene behaviour, followed by ethnicity (ß = - 0.13, p = 0.014) and risk perception (ß = 0.13, p = 0.016). For social distancing behaviour, the determinants were self-efficacy (ß = 0.25, p < 0.001), perceived advantages (ß = 0.15, p = 0.022), trust in policy (ß = 0.14, p = 0.026) and gender (ß = - 0.14, p = 0.016). Regression models explained 40% hand hygiene and 25% social distancing variance. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that communications about effectiveness of hand hygiene and social distancing behaviours had been effective in terms of knowledge acquisition. However, in the light of likely second waves of COVID-19, attention to maintaining social distancing behaviour and improving hand hygiene behaviour may need to address more difficult areas of changing habits, overcoming time factors and building trust, as well as interventions to increase self-efficacy and address risk perception concerns.","Barrett, Christine; Cheung, Kei Long",BMC Public Health,,413

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six experienced laryngologists performed laryngoscopic examinations in 30 patients in a closed-chamber examination unit. The physicians and patients were asked to compare all domains with their previous standard laryngoscopic examination experience using a 10-point visual analog scale (0, poor performance; 10, good performance), including effectiveness of communication, difficulty of examination, perception of safety against airborne transmission of COVID-19, applicability of the unit for future examinations, perception of protective environment, and overall comfort. RESULTS: All laryngoscopic examinations were performed successfully. Effectiveness of communication, difficulty of examination, perception of protective environment, and overall comfort did not differ between physicians and patients (P > .05 for all comparisons). However, both physicians and patients found the examination to be difficult. While physicians evaluated the system as safe against airborne transmission of COVID-19, patients were not confident that the system was safe (8.70 ± 1.93 vs 2.87 ± 2.37, respectively, P = .001). Physicians also gave a higher score to future applicability of the unit for examinations than patients (8.90 ± 1.42 vs 7.10 ± 2.62, respectively, P = .001). CONCLUSION: Physically separating the physician and patient is a feasible method of physical examination in aerosol-contaminated environments.","Sayin, Ibrahim; Yazici, Zahide Mine; Abakay, Mehmet Akif; Gülüstan, Filiz; Devecioglu, Ibrahim; Akgül, Ahmet",Ear Nose Throat J,,413

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce a novel risk-stratified SIR-HCD model that introduces new variables to model the dynamics of low-contact (e.g., work from home) and high-contact (e.g., work on-site) subpopulations while sharing parameters to control their respective R0(t) over time. We test our model on data of daily reported hospitalizations and cumulative mortality of COVID-19 in Harris County, Texas, from May 1, 2020, until October 4, 2020, collected from multiple sources (USA FACTS, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council COVID-19 report, TMC daily news, and Johns Hopkins University county-level mortality reporting). RESULTS: We evaluated our model's forecasting accuracy in Harris County, TX (the most populated county in the Greater Houston area) during Phase-I and Phase-II reopening. Not only does our model outperform other competing models, but it also supports counterfactual analysis to simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique among existing approaches. DISCUSSION: Mortality and hospitalization rates are significantly impacted by local quarantine and reopening policies. Existing models do not directly account for the effect of these policies on infection, hospitalization, and death rates in an explicit and explainable manner.

378197,Addendum to Systematic Review of Remdesivir for the Treatment of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severity of disease and outcomes in patient with COVID-19 has been associated with several risk factors tied to the metabolic syndrome. AIMS: We conducted a study with the objective of describing the association between the baseline Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 among patients at risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with at least two risk factors for metabolic syndrome diagnosed with COVID-19. The main exposure of interest was FIB-4 index prior to infection, categorized into three previously validated age-specific levels. The main outcomes of interest were disease requiring hospitalization and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: We included 373 patients [median age, 62 years; 194 male (52%); median number of metabolic syndrome risk factors, 3]. The median FIB-4 index was 1.10 (interquartile range 0.78-1.61). In models adjusting for diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, patients with intermediate FIB-4 index had 67% higher odds of hospitalization compared to those in the low category {odds ratio (OR) 1.67 [(95% CI 1.06-2.64); p = 0.03]} and patients with high FIB-4 index had higher odds of mortality compared to intermediate and low category with an OR 2.22 (95% CI 1.20-4.12; p = 0.01). However, when we evaluated components of FIB-4 (age and AST/ALT ratio), we found that age alone was the best predictor of hospitalization and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients at risk of NAFLD with COVID-19 infection, elevated pre-infection FIB-4 index was associated with worsened clinical outcomes, but age was the strongest predictor.","Elfeki, Mohamed A; Robles, Julian; Akhtar, Zaheer; Ullah, Fauzia; Ganapathiraju, Ice; Tran, Calvin; Inman, Casey; Collin, Simon M; Rosa, Rossana",Dig. dis. sci,,413

As a result, COVID-19-positive Solid Organ Transplant (SOT) recipients are increasingly being managed by local healthcare providers. It is crucial for community providers to understand disease severity and know if COVID-19-impacted SOT recipients have a different clinical course compared with COVID-19-negative SOT recipients with a similar presentation. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis on SOT recipients suspected to have COVID-19 infection tested during March 14, 2020-April 30, 2020. Patients were followed from time of testing to May 31, 2020. Results: One hundred sixty SOT recipients underwent testing: 22 COVID-19 positive and 138 COVID-19 negative. COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to have rapid progression of symptoms (median 3 vs 6 d, P = 0.002), greater hospitalizations (78% vs 64%, P < 0.017), and need for intensive care unit care (45% vs 17%, P < 0.001) Severe COVID-19 infection was not observed in patients on Belatacept for immunosuppression (30% vs 87%,P = 0.001). COVID- 19 positive patients in the intensive care unit were more likely to have multifocal opacities on radiological imaging in comparison to those admitted to the medical floor (90% vs 11%). Survival probability was similar in both cohorts. Conclusion: COVID-19-infected SOT recipients have a propensity for rapid clinical decompensation. Local providers need to be work closely with transplant centers to appropriately triage and manage COVID-19 SOT recipients in the community.","Basu, Arpita; Patzer, Rachel; Hosein, Darya; Wang, Zhensheng; Sharma, Nitika; Franch, Harold; Rahbari Oskoui, Frederic; Gupta, Divya; Subramanian, Ram; Sridharan, Lakshmi; Allison, Wanda; Pastan, Stephen; Larsen, Christian",Transplant Direct,,413

Comment on Br J Anaesth 2020; 125: e239-e241,2020,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently spread causing millions of individuals affected globally. The raising mortality rate highlighted the necessity to identify the most susceptible populations, such as pregnant women and their fetuses, in order to protect them. Few studies have been conducted trying to identify maternal-neonatal outcomes among pregnant patients affected by COVID 19. In this scenario, this study aims to analyse poor maternal-neonatal outcomes in pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This was a double-centre, 5 months retrospective analysis conducted in Italy. The study population consisted of pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed by Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: 145 pregnant women affected by confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Among them, 116 (80%) were symptomatic and 29 (20%) were asymptomatic. Up to half of the patients (n = 111; 76.5%) had a past history of respiratory disease. The mean gestational age at delivery was 36 weeks ± 5 days, while the mean maternal age was 31.5 ± 5.63. Reactive C protein (CRP) serum levels were higher than the normal range corresponding to a mean value of 56.93 ± 49.57 mg/L. The mean interval between the diagnosis of maternal COVID-19 infection and the delivery was 8.5 days. With regard to the type of delivery, the percentage of patients who delivered vaginally was higher than those who experienced a caesarean section. (74.4% vs 25.6%). The percentage of term birth was higher than preterm one (62% vs 38%). Finally, the percentages of maternal and neonatal death were found to be 5% and 6%, respectively; similarly, the percentage of the infection vertical transmission was 5%. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in pregnant women seems to negatively affect both maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, it is important to emphasize that most of the cases of maternal death occurred in patients with severe symptoms and highly altered parameters related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the future, larger studies are warranted in order to validate these findings.","Di Guardo, Federica; Di Grazia, Flavia Maria; Di Gregorio, Luisa Maria; Zambrotta, Elisa; Carrara, Grazia; Gulino, Ferdinando Antonio; Tuscano, Attilio; Palumbo, Marco",Arch. gynecol. obstet,,413

386773,"Application of microlecture teaching methods in standardized residency training during COVID-19 in Wuhan: a randomized, controlled study",2021,"BACKGROUND: To avoid misuse of personal protective equipment (PPE), ensure health care workers' safety, and avoid shortages, effective communication of up-to-date infection control guidelines is essential. As prehospital teams are particularly at risk of contamination given their challenging work environment, a specific gamified electronic learning (e-learning) module targeting this audience might provide significant advantages as it requires neither the presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a gamified e-learning module could improve the rate of adequate PPE choice by prehospital personnel in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This was an individual-level randomized, controlled, quadruple-blind (investigators, participants, outcome assessors, and data analysts) closed web-based trial. All emergency prehospital personnel working in Geneva, Switzerland, were eligible for inclusion, and were invited to participate by email in April 2020. Participants were informed that the study aim was to assess their knowledge regarding PPE, and that they would be presented with both the guidelines and the e-learning module, though they were unaware that there were two different study paths. All participants first answered a preintervention quiz designed to establish their profile and baseline knowledge. The control group then accessed the guidelines before answering a second set of questions, and were then granted access to the e-learning module. The e-learning group was shown the e-learning module right after the guidelines and before answering the second set of questions. RESULTS: Of the 291 randomized participants, 176 (60.5%) completed the trial. There was no significant difference in baseline knowledge between groups. Though the baseline proportion of adequate PPE choice was high (75%, IQR 50%-75%), participants' description of the donning sequence was in most cases incorrect. After either intervention, adequate choice of PPE increased significantly in both groups (P<.001). Though the median of the difference in the proportion of correct answers was slightly higher in the e-learning group (17%, IQR 8%-33% versus 8%, IQR 8%-33%), the difference was not statistically significant (P=.27). Confidence in the ability to use PPE was maintained in the e-learning group (P=.27) but significantly decreased in the control group (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Among prehospital personnel with an already relatively high knowledge of and experience with PPE use, both web-based study paths increased the rate of adequate choice of PPE. There was no major added value of the gamified e-learning module apart from preserving participants' confidence in their ability to correctly use PPE.","Suppan, Laurent; Abbas, Mohamed; Stuby, Loric; Cottet, Philippe; Larribau, Robert; Golay, Eric; Iten, Anne; Harbarth, Stephan; Gartner, Birgit; Suppan, Mélanie",J Med Internet Res,,413

States developed different policies to mitigate the COVID-19 risks at nursing homes, including limiting nursing home visitation and mandating staff screening. The purpose of this study is to examine whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to the nursing home reported quality. DESIGN: We combined the COVID-19 data reported by the California Department of Public Health, quality ratings provided by Nursing Home Compare, and patient racial information from Long-Term Care Focus to examine the association between nursing home reported quality and COVID-19 cases and deaths. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional data from 1223 California skilled nursing facilities with reported quality and longitudinal data of COVID-19 cases were used. METHODS: The dependent variable is COVID-19 residents' cases and deaths. The main independent variable is nursing home reported quality. Nursing home ownership, size, years of operation, and patient race composition are also included. RESULTS: Nursing home star ratings and greater percentage of residents from different racial and ethnicity groups were significantly (P < .01) related to increased probability of having a COVID-19 residents' case or death.

389022,Cardiothoracic Surgical Advocacy in a Time of COVID-19,2020,"ObjectivesãThe COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly across the globe during the first half of 2020. In Japan, a state of emergency was declared on April 7, 2020, which had a significant impact on the life of citizens. This study focused on behaviors like avoiding going out or coming in contact with others and frequent hand-washing to prevent the infection and the spread of COVID-19 among people living in Tokyo. We also examined the factors associated with these behaviors during the declaration of emergency.MethodsãAn online survey was conducted from April 26 to 29, 2020, approximately 20 days after the declaration of the emergency, among men and women aged 20-69 years living in Tokyo. The study framework was based on the protection motivation theory, which explains the risk-reducing behaviors, and focus theory of normative conduct, which explains the effect of others' behavior on one's own behavior. The frequency of behaviors like avoiding going out or coming in contact with others and frequent hand-washing, as well as the perception of the risk of COVID-19 during the week preceding the survey, were assessed. Each preventive action was evaluated based on the following factors: perceived effectiveness (response efficacy), perceived practicability (self-efficacy), necessary cost (response cost), and perceptions of how much should be done (injunctive norm) and how well others are doing it (descriptive norm). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis with these behaviors as outcomes were performed.ResultsãThis study included 1,034 participants (50.3% male, mean age 44.82 years, standard deviation 14.00 years). The analyses of the frequency of avoiding going out or coming in contact with others showed that the injunctive norm was positively associated with the behavior (standardized partial regression coefficient (ß)=0.343, P<0.001), while the descriptive norm was negatively associated with the behavior (ß=-0.074, P=0.010). Furthermore, the two-way interaction between risk perception, response efficacy, and self-efficacy was significant (ß=0.129, P<0.001), indicating that risk perception was positively associated with the behavior only when either response efficacy or self-efficacy was low. A similar analysis conducted for hand-washing behavior revealed that injunctive norm (ß=0.256, P<0.001) and response efficacy (ß=0.132, P<0.001) were positively associated with the behavior, while the response cost (ß=-0.193, P<0.001) was negatively associated with the behavior.ConclusionãSome variables in the protection motivation theory and the focus theory of normative conduct were related to the behavior for the prevention of COVID-19. The results suggest that the application of these theories is useful in future studies.","Higuchi, Masataka; Arai, Hirokazu; Ito, Taku; Nakamura, Nanako; Kai, Yuko",Nippon koshu eisei zasshi,,413
389416,PRS35 What IF WE HAD Achieved a More Restrictive Social Isolation? Human and Economic IMPACT,2020,"Background: In the wake of the worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus and the resultant restrictive measures, mental health has become a crucial issue. Physical health is not the only aspect of humans that is at risk. Globally, the rates and severity of mental illness are being significantly impacted by this pandemic. Two scales have been validated to measure the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the levels of anxiety and obsessional thinking in clinical and non-clinical populations. The present study was designed to investigate the levels of anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19 in the general public of Lahore, Pakistan. Materials and Methods: Data were collected via snowball sampling from May 9 to May 19. An online survey consisting of a demographic profile and two scales, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS), was sent through email, WhatsApp, and Facebook groups to adults (18 years and above) of Lahore, Pakistan. Results: A total of 240 individuals (20% men and 80% women) recorded their responses. The majority belonged to a nuclear family system (60%), and their education level ranged from high school to Ph.D. The cut-off score for probable dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety and obsession levels was not met within this sample (CAS, M = 3.24, SD = 4.21; OCS, M = 4.14, SD = 3.15), suggesting that the general population of Lahore, Pakistan is not suffering from dysfunctional anxiety or obsessions related to COVID-19. Forty-seven participants' score on OCS and 35 participants' scores on CAS were above the cut-off, i.e., &#8805;7 and &#8805;9, respectively. The results of the correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship (** p < 0.619) between anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19. Conclusion: One important, yet surprising, conclusion of this study is that the average adult in Lahore does not show much anxiety or obsessions related to COVID-19. Other studies around the world using these measurement tools have indicated significantly high levels of both anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19. These findings may demonstrate the resilience of Pakistanis or perhaps the lack of understanding of the seriousness of the situation.","Majeed, Saima; Schwaiger, Elizabeth Maria; Nazim, Abia; Samuel, Ivan Suneel",Front Public Health,,413
390410,"Letter to the Editor: ""Our Response to COVID-19 as Endocrinologists and Diabetologists""",2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has increased the demand for inpatient healthcare resources; however, approximately 80% of patients with COVID-19 have a mild clinical presentation and can be managed at home. Objective: This study aimed to describe the feasibility and clinical and process outcomes associated with a multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model to triage and manage obstetrical patients with known exposures and symptoms of COVID-19. Study Design: We implemented a multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model with obstetrical physicians and nurses to standardize ambulatory care for obstetrical patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 based on the symptoms or exposures at an urban academic tertiary care center with multiple hospital-affiliated and community-based practices. All pregnant or postpartum patients with COVID-19 symptoms, exposures, or hospitalization were eligible for inclusion in the program. Patients were assessed by means of regular nursing phone calls and were managed according to illness severity. Patient characteristics and clinical and process outcomes were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Results: A total of 135 patients were enrolled in the multidisciplinary telemedicine model from March 17 to April 19, 2020, of whom 130 were pregnant and 5 were recently postpartum. In this study, 116 of 135 patients (86%) were managed solely in the outpatient setting and did not require an in-person evaluation; 9 patients were ultimately admitted after ambulatory or urgent evaluations, and 10 patients were observed after hospital discharge. Although only 50% of the patients were tested secondary to limitations in ambulatory testing, 1 in 3 of those patients received positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (N=22, 16% of entire cohort). Patients were enrolled in the telemedicine model for a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 4-8) and averaged 1 phone call daily, resulting in 891 nursing calls and 20 physician calls over 1 month. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model for outpatient management of obstetrical patients with COVID-19 symptoms and exposures is feasible and resulted in rates of ambulatory management similar to those seen in nonpregnant patients. A centralized model for telemedicine surveillance of obstetrical patients with COVID-19 symptoms may preserve inpatient resources and prevent avoidable staff and patient exposures, particularly in centers with multiple ambulatory practice settings.","Reforma, Liberty G; Duffy, Cassandra; Collier, Ai-Ris Y; Wylie, Blair J; Shainker, Scott A; Golen, Toni H; Herlihy, Mary; Lydeard, Aisling; Zera, Chloe A",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,413

Although early therapies such as prophylactic antibodies and vaccines show great promise, there are concerns about the long-term efficacy and universal applicability of these therapies as the virus continues to mutate. Thus, protein-based immunogens that can quickly respond to viral changes remain of continued interest. The Spike protein, the main immunogen of this virus, displays a highly dynamic trimeric structure that presents a challenge for therapeutic development. Here, guided by the structure of the Spike trimer, we rationally design new Spike constructs that show a uniquely high stability profile while simultaneously remaining locked into the immunogen-desirable prefusion state. Furthermore, our approach emphasizes the relationship between the highly conserved S2 region and structurally dynamic Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) to enable vaccine development as well as the generation of antibodies able to resist viral mutation.","Riley, Timothy P; Chou, Hui-Ting; Hu, Ruozhen; Bzymek, Krzysztof P; Correia, Ana R; Partin, Alexander C; Li, Danqing; Gong, Danyang; Wang, Zhulun; Yu, Xinchao; Manzanillo, Paolo; Garces, Fernando",Front Immunol,,413

It proposes that both learning and action planning involve processes minimizing prediction errors encoded by dopaminergic neurons. In this framework, dopaminergic neurons projecting to different parts of the striatum encode errors in predictions made by the corresponding systems within the basal ganglia. The dopaminergic neurons encode differences between rewards and expectations in the goal-directed system, and differences between the chosen and habitual actions in the habit system. These prediction errors trigger learning about rewards and habit formation, respectively. Additionally, dopaminergic neurons in the goal-directed system play a key role in action planning: They compute the difference between an available reward and the reward expected from the current motor plan, and they facilitate action planning until this difference diminishes. Presented models account for dopaminergic responses during movements, effects of dopamine depletion on behaviour, and make several experimental predictions.","Bogacz, Rafal",eLife (Cambridge),,413

392205,"Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients With Digestive Symptoms in Hubei, China: A Descriptive, Cross-Sectional, Multicenter Study",2020,"Background and aims: Previous studies suggest that attentional bias and disengagement may vary as a function of Body Mass Index (BMI), most notably in a palatable food related context. Though this could indeed represent a food context specific effect, it could also represent a general reward related context effect. In addition, though mindfulness and stress have both been reported to affect attention, it is not yet clear whether these moderate the relationship between BMI and attention as a function of reward context. In the current study we addressed these questions. It was hypothesized that BMI would be positively associated with bias in a food context and money context relative to a neutral context. The inverse was expected for disengagement. It was expected that mindfulness would decrease these relationships and for stress the inverse was expected. Methods: In the current online study, eighty-seven participants (24 males and 63 females; age: M = 30.1, SD = 8.3; BMI: M = 24.2, SD = 4.67), filled out questionnaires and completed a visuospatial cueing task measuring attention and disengagement of attention in a neutral, food-related, and money-related condition. Results: There was no association between BMI and attentional bias. Higher BMI was associated with faster responses to money pictures presented opposite to a cued location as compared to money pictures that did not follow a predictive cue. Our results do not support a clear moderating role of mindfulness and stress. Discussion and conclusion: Our results imply faster processing and associated quicker responding to unanticipated reward-related stimuli in individuals with overweight or obesity.","Tsegaye, Afework; Bjørne, Joachim; Winther, Anita; Kökönyei, Gyöngyi; Cserjési, Renáta; Logemann, H N Alexander",J Behav Addict,,413

392853,Endotracheal Intubation of COVID-19 Patients,2020,"Historically, the professional structure of higher education has provided restricted employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women. This is exacerbated where there is an intersection between gender and race, culture, religion, or age. Women continue to be underrepresented in senior leadership positions across a range of disciplines, and this lack of representation of women within the professional structure of higher education itself acts as a barrier for more women reaching senior levels within institutions. More women are needed in higher positions to increase representation and visibility, and to encourage and mentor others to then aspire to follow a similar path. This critical review examines gender equity across the major career benchmarks of the academy in light of the impact of the personal contexts of women, systemic processes, and cultural barriers that hinder career progression. Research-based systemic solutions that work towards improved gender equity for women are discussed. The findings from this critical review highlight the need for global systemic change in higher education to create ethical equities in the employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women.","Allen, Kelly-Ann Butler-Henderson Kerryn Reupert Andrea Longmuir Fiona Finefter-Rosenbluh Ilana Berger Emily Grove Christine Heffernan Amanda Freeman Nerelie Kewalramani Sarika Krebs Shiri Dsouza Levita Mackie Grace Chapman Denise Fleer Marilyn",Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice,,413
393158,COVID-19 in patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases in East London: a single-centre cohort study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The hemostatic balance in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to be shifted toward a hypercoagulable state. The aim of the current study was to assess the associated coagulation alterations by point-of-care-diagnostics, focusing on details of clot formation and lysis in these severely affected patients. METHODS: The authors' prospective monocentric observational study included critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Demographics and biochemical data were recorded. To assess the comprehensive hemostatic profile of this patient population, aggregometric (Multiplate) and viscoelastometric (CloPro) measures were performed in the intensive care unit of a university hospital at a single occasion. Coagulation analysis and assessment of coagulation factors were performed. Data were compared to healthy controls. RESULTS: In total, 27 patients (21 male; mean age, 60 yr) were included. Impedance aggregometry displayed no greater platelet aggregability in COVID-19 in comparison with healthy controls (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC] in adenosine diphosphate test, 68 ± 37 U vs. 91 ± 29 U [Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, -27 (-48 to -1); P = 0.043]; AUC in arachidonic acid test, 102 ± 54 U vs. 115 ± 26 U [Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, -21 (-51 to 21); P = 0.374]; AUC in thrombin receptor activating peptide 6 test, 114 ± 61 U vs. 144 ± 31 U [Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, -31 (-69 to -7); P = 0.113]). Comparing the thromboelastometric results of COVID-19 patients to healthy controls, the authors observed significant differences in maximum clot firmness in fibrin contribution to maximum clot firmness assay (37 ± 11 mm vs. 15 ± 4 mm [Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, 21 (17 to 26); P < 0.001]) and lysis time in extrinsic activation and activation of fibrinolysis by tissue plasminogen activator assay (530 ± 327 s vs. 211 ± 80 s [Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI, 238 (160 to 326); P < 0.001]). CONCLUSIONS: Thromboelastometry in COVID-19 patients revealed greater fibrinolysis resistance. The authors did not find a greater platelet aggregability based on impedance aggregometric tests. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the hypercoagulable state of critically ill patients with COVID-19.Editor's Perspective. WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Although critically ill patients with COVID-19 are at an increased risk for thromboembolic complications, the details of hemostatic balance regarding clot lysis and platelet contribution to clot formation are not well understood. WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: Despite increases in von Willebrand factor, platelet aggregability based on impedance aggregometry testing was not increased in critically ill COVID-19, although viscoelastometric testing noted fibrinolysis resistance. These findings contribute to our understanding of the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 and may have important considerations for management strategies.","Heinz, Christoph; Miesbach, Wolfgang; Herrmann, Eva; Sonntagbauer, Michael; Raimann, Florian; Zacharowski, Kai; Weber, Christian F; Adam, Elisabeth H",Anesthesiology,,413

397114,Analysis of COVID deaths: A single centre experience in Mumbai medical college,2021,"OBJECTIVES: An increased prevalence of periodontitis and perturbation of the oral microbiome has been identified in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis may cause local citrullination of proteins, potentially triggering anti-citrullinated protein antibody production. However, it is not known if oral dysbiosis precedes the onset of clinical arthritis. This study comprehensively characterised the oral microbiome in anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) positive at-risk individuals without clinical synovitis (CCP+at risk). METHODS: Subgingival plaque was collected from periodontally healthy and diseased sites in 48 CCP+at risk, 26 early RA and 32 asymptomatic healthy control (HC) individuals. DNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform. Taxonomic profile and functional capability of the subgingival microbiome were compared between groups. RESULTS: At periodontally healthy sites, CCP+at risk individuals had significantly lower microbial richness compared with HC and early RA groups (p=0.004 and 0.021). Microbial community alterations were found at phylum, genus and species levels. A large proportion of the community differed significantly in membership (523 species; 35.6%) and structure (575 species; 39.1%) comparing CCP+at risk and HC groups. Certain core species, including P. gingivalis, had higher relative abundance in the CCP+at risk group. Seventeen clusters of orthologous gene functional units were significantly over-represented in the CCP+at risk group compared with HC (adjusted p value <0.05). CONCLUSION: Anti-CCP positive at-risk individuals have dysbiotic subgingival microbiomes and increased abundance of P. gingivalis compared with controls. This supports the hypothesis that the oral microbiome and specifically P. gingivalis are important in RA initiation.","Cheng, Zijian; Do, Thuy; Mankia, Kulveer; Meade, Josephine; Hunt, Laura; Clerehugh, Val; Speirs, Alastair; Tugnait, Aradhna; Emery, Paul; Devine, Deirdre",Ann. rheum. dis,,413
397456,Advocacy Considerations for the Pediatric Pulmonologist in the Era of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The success of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) mostly depends on regular injections. Our aim was to investigate adherence to SCIT with aeroallergens during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrate clinical consequences of treatment disruptions in real life. METHODS: Visual analogue scale for quality of life (VAS-QoL), VAS for symptom scores (VAS-symptom), medication scores (MSs), and total symptom scores (TSS-6) were recorded during the pandemic in 327 adult allergic rhinitis and/or asthmatic patients receiving maintenance SCIT, and these scores were compared with the pre-pandemic data. Patients were grouped according to SCIT administration intervals; no delay (Group 1), <2 months (Group 2), and &#8805;2-month intervals (Group 3). RESULTS: A total of 104 (31.8%) patients (Group 3) were considered as nonadherent which was mostly related to receiving SCIT with HDMs and using public transportation for reaching the hospital. Median MS, VAS-symptom, and TSS-6 scores of Group 3 patients during the pandemic were higher than the pre-pandemic scores (p = 0.005, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), whereas median VAS-QoL scores of Group 3 during the pandemic were lower than the pre-pandemic scores (p < 0.001). Median TSS-6 and VAS-symptom scores were the highest in Group 3 compared with other groups (p < 0.001 for each comparison). Median VAS-QoL scores were the lowest in Group 3 compared with Group 1 and Group 2 (p < 0.001, p = 0.043, respectively). CONCLUSION: When precautions in allergy clinics are carefully applied, adherence to SCIT can be high during a pandemic. Patients must be encouraged to regularly adhere to SCIT injections since delays in SCIT administration can deteriorate clinical symptoms.","Yegit, Osman Ozan; Demir, Semra; Ünal, Derya; Olgaç, Müge; Terzioglu, Kadriye; Eyice Karabacak, Deniz; Tüzer, Can; Ayhan, Vehbi; Çolakoglu, Bahattin; Büyüköztürk, Suna; Gelincik, Asli",Allergy,,413
397617,Study of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in New York City - Authors' reply,2020,"Epidemiological studies have yielded conflicting results regarding climate and incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, and seasonality of infection rates is debated. Moreover, few studies have focused on COVD-19 deaths. We studied the association of average ambient temperature with subsequent COVID-19 mortality in the OECD countries and the individual United States (US), while accounting for other important meteorological and non-meteorological co-variates. The exposure of interest was average temperature and other weather conditions, measured at 25 days prior and 25 days after the first reported COVID-19 death was collected in the OECD countries and US states. The outcome of interest was cumulative COVID-19 mortality, assessed for each region at 25, 30, 35, and 40 days after the first reported death. Analyses were performed with negative binomial regression and adjusted for other weather conditions, particulate matter, sociodemographic factors, smoking, obesity, ICU beds, and social distancing. A 1 °C increase in ambient temperature was associated with 6% lower COVID-19 mortality at 30 days following the first reported death (multivariate-adjusted mortality rate ratio: 0.94, 95% CI 0.90, 0.99, p = 0.016). The results were robust for COVID-19 mortality at 25, 35 and 40 days after the first death, as well as other sensitivity analyses. The results provide consistent evidence across various models of an inverse association between higher average temperatures and subsequent COVID-19 mortality rates after accounting for other meteorological variables and predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection or death. This suggests potentially decreased viral transmission in warmer regions and during the summer season.","Christophi, Costas A; Sotos-Prieto, Mercedes; Lan, Fan-Yun; Delgado-Velandia, Mario; Efthymiou, Vasilis; Gaviola, Gabriel C; Hadjivasilis, Alexandros; Hsu, Yu-Tien; Kyprianou, Aikaterini; Lidoriki, Irene; Wei, Chih-Fu; Rodriguez-Artalejo, Fernando; Kales, Stefanos N",Sci Rep,,413

Here we report that suramin, a 100-year-old drug, is a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and acts by blocking the binding of RNA to the enzyme. In biochemical assays, suramin and its derivatives are at least 20-fold more potent than remdesivir, the currently approved nucleotide drug for treatment of COVID-19. The 2.6 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the viral RdRp bound to suramin reveals two binding sites. One site directly blocks the binding of the RNA template strand and the other site clashes with the RNA primer strand near the RdRp catalytic site, thus inhibiting RdRp activity. Suramin blocks viral replication in Vero E6 cells, although the reasons underlying this effect are likely various.

A randomized controlled trial follow-up study,2021,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), one of the oldest drugs used in rheumatology, came recently into attention as one of the potential therapies tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 disease treatment. Used initially as an antimalarial, then translated to rheumatic diseases, HCQ has been used in a wide range of pathologies, including infectious diseases, immune disorders, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or neoplasia. Regarding systemic diseases, HCQ is the mainstay treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where, according to last European guidelines, it is proposed to all SLE patients unless contraindicated or with side effects. HCQ proved positive impact in SLE on robust outcomes, such as accrual damage, disease activity and survival, but also pleiomorphic effects, including decrease in the need for glucocorticoids, reduction in the risk of neonatal lupus, lower fasting glucose and protection against diabetes, thrombotic risk, dyslipidemia, infections, etc. Moreover, HCQ can be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Besides SLE, the role for HCQ in the anti-phospholipid syndrome and Sjögren's disease is still under debate. On the contrary, recent advances showed only limited interest for rheumatoid arthritis, especially due the lack of structural damage prevention. There are still no strong data to sustain the HCQ use in other systemic diseases. In this review, we summarised the utility and efficacy of HCQ in different clinical conditions relevant for rheumatology practice.","Dima, Alina; Jurcut, Ciprian; Arnaud, Laurent",Joint Bone Spine,,413

Previous studies confirmed the effectiveness of social support in mitigating anxiety, so offering social support should be of high priority in COVID-19, especially in quarantine. However, various coping strategies against the pandemic may explain the link between social support and anxiety. The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations of social support, coping strategy against COVID-19, and anxiety, identifying the potential mediating effect of coping strategy between social support and anxiety during the COVID-19 quarantine. Home-quarantined Chinese university students (N = 2640;68.79% female) completed online ratings of social support, coping, and anxiety from February 21st to 24th, 2020, when they had been confined to their homes in the peak of the pandemic. Sex and academic attainment being covariates, path analysis with parallel mediation were conducted using “lavaan” package in R environment. Anxiety was significantly negatively related to subjective support and counselor support, while family support did not demonstrate substantive associations with anxiety. The mediating role of cognitive coping was found between all the three social support sources and anxiety. Emotional coping and behavioral coping were found to partially mediate the relationship between subjective support and anxiety, fully mediate the associations of family support and anxiety. However, the impact of counselor support on anxiety was not found to be mediated by emotional coping and behavioral coping. This large-scale online study provides initial evidence that various coping strategies may mediate the relationship between three sources of social support and anxiety in quarantine to some extent. Given that coping against COVID-19 is a valuable reasearch goal upon the global ongoing challenge, the findings will shed more light on the mechanism in the link between coping, social support, and anxiety.","Li, Yue Peng Jun Tao Yanqiang","Current psychology (New Brunswick, N.J.)",,413

405970,Efficacy and safety of a self-developed home-based enhanced knee flexion exercise program compared with standard supervised physiotherapy to improve mobility and quality of life after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized control study,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, as a newly-emerged viral infection has now spread all over the world after originating in Wuhan, China. Pneumonia is the hallmark of the disease, with dyspnea in half of the patients and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in up to one -third of the cases. Pulmonary edema, neutrophilic infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine release are the pathologic signs of this disease. The anti-inflammatory effect of the photobiomodulation (PBM) has been confirmed in many previous studies. Therefore, this review study was conducted to evaluate the direct effect of PBM on the acute lung inflammation or ARDS and also accelerating the regeneration of the damaged tissues. The indirect effects of PBM on modulation of the immune system, increasing the blood flow and oxygenation in other tissues were also considered. METHODOLOGY: The databases of PubMed, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar were searched to find the relevant studies. Keywords included the PBM and related terms, lung inflammation, and COVID-19 -related signs. Studies were categorized with respect to the target tissue, laser parameters, and their results. RESULTS: Seventeen related papers were included in this review. All of them were in animal models. They showed that the PBM could significantly decrease the pulmonary edema, neutrophil influx, and generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1ß), interleukin 6 (IL-6), intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), reactive oxygen species (ROS), isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2)). CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that the PBM could be helpful in reducing the lung inflammation and promoting the regeneration of the damaged tissue. PBM can increase the oxygenation indirectly in order to rehabilitate the affected organs. Thus, the infra-red lasers or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are recommended in this regard.","Nejatifard, Marzieh; Asefi, Sohrab; Jamali, Raika; Hamblin, Michael R; Fekrazad, Reza",Cytokine,,413

The majority of the disease burden occurs in low-income countries, where access to diagnostics and tailored treatment remains problematic. The current COVID-19 pandemic further threatens to impact global TB control by diverting resources, reducing notifications and hence significantly increasing deaths attributable to TB (World Health Organization, 2020). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming increasingly accessible, and has particular value in the diagnosis and management of TB disease (Cabibbe et al., 2018; Meehan et al., 2019). Not only does it have the potential to give more rapid and complete information on drug-resistance, but the high discriminatory power it offers allows detection of clusters and transmission pathways, as well as likely contamination events, mixed infections and to differentiate between re-infection and relapse with much greater confidence than previous typing methods.","Kizny Gordon, Alice; Marais, Ben; Walker, Timothy M; Sintchenko, Vitali",Int. j. infect. dis,,413

409080,"Clinico-radiological Presentation of COVID-19 Patients at a Tertiary Care Center at Bhilwara Rajasthan, India",2020,"An outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. In late January 2020, the Chinese government implemented strict quarantine measures across Hubei Province and other parts of the country to limit the transmission of COVID-19. An effect of these quarantine measures was the reduction in economic activity and associated emissions that contribute to air pollution. In this study, we quantify the spatial extent and magnitude of changes in air pollution concentrations across China by comparing complementary satellite, ground-based, and modeled data from the first two months of 2019 and 2020. We find a 48% reduction in satellite-derived average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in eastern China during a three-week period after the Lunar New Year (LNY) in 2020 compared to 2019, which follows significant declines in the pre-LNY period. We also observe a 49% and 11% decline in post-LNY satellite tropospheric column concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). These satellite-based results are in general agreement with data collected from ground monitoring stations across the country, which show a decline in post-LNY PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 concentrations. Our modeling analysis suggests that these observed air quality improvements are driven primarily by the reduction in NO2 emissions, which indicate reductions in transportation and industrial pollution sources during COVID-19, but unfavorable meteorological conditions weaken the role of emissions reduction. Finally, we estimate a reduction by 5%, 14%, and 18% of days in the post-LNY period for 2020 that exceed national PM2.5 air quality targets for the entire country, eastern China, and Hubei Province. As more information becomes available on population characteristics and air pollution exposure patterns, this analysis can be extended to quantify human health related impacts to sudden changes in air pollution in China and other locations around the world.","Marlier, M.

409255,Comparing the impact of Hydroxychloroquine based regimens and standard treatment on COVID-19 patient outcomes: A retrospective cohort study,2020,"Immune thrombocytopenia, also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), has been reported as an important complication related to COVID-19.We present a 49-year-old male patient with systemic lupus erythematosus with lupus nephritis, antiphospholipid syndrome and history of ITP who developed an ITP flare in the context of COVID-19. He had no bleeding manifestations and had a good response to prednisone treatment.We review the characteristics of the cases reported to date in the literature, with an analysis of 57 patients. Mean age was 56 years (±19.6 SD), and 50.9% were male. This was the first episode of ITP in most of the patients (86.05%), with SARS-CoV-2 acting as the initial trigger. We found that ITP flares may appear in both mild and severe COVID-19 cases. They also appeared at any time during the course of the disease, 48.2% of patients developed it during hospitalization, while it was diagnosed at admission in the rest of the cases. Platelet counts were significantly lower than other ITP series, with a median nadir platelet count of 8 × 109/L (IQR 2-17.75 × 109/L). These patients show a higher bleeding rate (61.4%) compared with other ITP series. They also show a better response to treatment, with good response to the first line therapies in 76.9% of them. The most common first-line treatment was intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), used alone or combined with corticosteroids in 40.4% and 32.7% of cases respectively, while 25% of patients received only corticosteroids.Our review suggests that COVID-19-related ITP can be seen even in previously healthy patients. Clinicians must be aware that ITP may appear both in mild and severe COVID-19, at any time during its course. Given that this kind of ITP seems to be associated with a higher bleeding risk, its diagnosis in a clinical scenario such as COVID-19, where anticoagulant therapy is frequently used, may be critical. Treatment with IVIG and/or corticoids is often effective.","Alonso-Beato, Rubén; Morales-Ortega, Alejandro; Fernández, Francisco Javier De la Hera; Morón, Ana Isabel Parejo; Ríos-Fernández, Raquel; Rubio, José Luis Callejas; Centeno, Norberto Ortego",Lupus,,413
409288,The Next Wave of Health Care Strain Related to COVID-19: Heart Failure Patients Coming Back in Force-We Must Not Fail Them,2020,"The main goal of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the COVID Stress Scales (CSS) in the Palestinian context and the factorial structure of the instrument. The CSS, a newly emerging internationally standardized measure of stress related to being exposed to or contracting COVID-19, was translated and validated for a Palestinian context to ensure that it can be used to measure COVID-19 stress. The sample of the study consisted of 860 Palestinian adults living in the West Bank of Palestine. Participants' age ranged from 20 to 48 years old (M = 34.7, SD =13.46). They were all recruited from online advertisements, e-mail campaigns, blogs, social media, and SMS campaigns. The CSS was found to be valid in the Arabic language within a Palestinian context. The confirmatory factor analysis yielded six factors: (1) Fears about the dangerousness of COVID-19, (2) fears about the personal social, and economic consequences of COVID-19, fears of disruption in the supply chain, fears of looting or rioting, (3) COVID-19-xenophobia, fears that foreigners are sources of COVID-19, (4) fears about sources of COVID-19-related contamination,(5) traumatic stress symptoms related to COVID-19, and (6) COVID-19-related checking which is consisting with the ordinal structure the scale. The CSS demonstrated a high level of validity and reliability in a Palestinian context and therefore can be considered for future studies as the COVID-19 pandemic persists. Further investigations using the Arabic Language of CSS may have far-reaching implications for measuring and combating the stress of COVID-19 at a personal and societal level for uniquely at-risk populations such as in the occupied territories of Palestine.","Mahamid, Fayez Azez; Veronese, Guido; Bdier, Dana; Pancake, Rachel",Curr Psychol,,413

The objective of this study was to assess the safety of targeted lesion examination (TLE) compared with FSE in our Pigmented Lesion Clinic (PLC). Patients attending the PLC were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to FSE (intervention) or TLE (standard care). Demographic details and risk factors were documented, and the time taken to perform FSE and TLE was noted. Of 763 participants, 520 were assigned to FSE and 243 were assigned to TLE. On average, FSE took 4.02 min and TLE took 30 s to perform. Of the 520 participants assigned to FSE, 37 (7.1%) had incidental findings, of whom 12 patients (2.3%) had additional lesions biopsied. No additional melanomas were detected that would have been missed by use of the standard protocol. This study suggests that in low-risk patients referred to a PLC with a lesion of concern, the possibility of missing incidental cutaneous malignancies using lesion-directed examination is low.","O039,; Connor, C; Gallagher, C; Connell, M; Bourke, J; Murphy, M; Bennett, M",Clin Exp Dermatol,,413

412285,Immunity and Coagulation/Fibrinolytic Processes may Reduce the Risk of Severe Illness in Pregnant Women with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care arterial blood gas (ABG) is a blood measurement test and a useful diagnostic tool that assists with treatment and therefore improves clinical outcomes. However, numerically reported test results make rapid interpretation difficult or open to interpretation. The arterial blood gas algorithm (ABG-a) is a new digital diagnostics solution that can provide clinicians with real-time interpretation of preliminary data on safety features, oxygenation, acid-base disturbances and renal profile. The main aim of this study was to clinically validate the algorithm against senior experienced clinicians, for acid-base interpretation, in a clinical context. METHODS: We conducted a prospective international multicentre observational cross-sectional study. 346 sample sets and 64 inpatients eligible for ABG met strict sampling criteria. Agreement was evaluated using Cohen's kappa index, diagnostic accuracy was evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, efficiency or global accuracy and positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for the prevalence in the study population. RESULTS: The concordance rates between the interpretations of the clinicians and the ABG-a for acid-base disorders were an observed global agreement of 84,3% with a Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.81; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.86; p < 0.001. For detecting accuracy normal acid-base status the algorithm has a sensitivity of 90.0% (95% CI 79.9 to 95.3), a specificity 97.2% (95% CI 94.5 to 98.6) and a global accuracy of 95.9% (95% CI 93.3 to 97.6). For the four simple acid-base disorders, respiratory alkalosis: sensitivity of 91.2 (77.0 to 97.0), a specificity 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 99.1 (97.5 to 99.7); respiratory acidosis: sensitivity of 61.1 (38.6 to 79.7), a specificity of 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 98.0 (95.9 to 99.0); metabolic acidosis: sensitivity of 75.8 (59.0 to 87.2), a specificity of 99.7 (98.2 to 99.9) and a global accuracy of 97.4 (95.1 to 98.6); metabolic alkalosis sensitivity of 72.2 (56.0 to 84.2), a specificity of 95.5 (92.5 to 97.3) and a global accuracy of 93.0 (88.8 to 95.3); the four complex acid-base disorders, respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, the sensitivity, specificity and global accuracy was also high. For normal acid-base status the algorithm has PPV 87.1 (95% CI 76.6 to 93.3) %, and NPV 97.9 (95% CI 95.4 to 99.0) for a prevalence of 17.4 (95% CI 13.8 to 21.8). For the four-simple acid-base disorders and the four complex acid-base disorders the PPV and NPV were also statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The ABG-a showed very high agreement and diagnostic accuracy with experienced senior clinicians in the acid-base disorders in a clinical context. The method also provides refinement and deep complex analysis at the point-of-care that a clinician could have at the bedside on a day-to-day basis. The ABG-a method could also have the potential to reduce human errors by checking for imminent life-threatening situations, analysing the internal consistency of the results, the oxygenation and renal status of the patient.","Rodríguez-Villar, Sancho; Poza-Hernández, Paloma; Freigang, Sascha; Zubizarreta-Ormazabal, Idoia; Paz-Martín, Daniel; Holl, Etienne; Pérez-Pardo, Osvaldo Ceferino; Tovar-Doncel, María Sherezade; Wissa, Sonja Maria; Cimadevilla-Calvo, Bonifacio; Tejón-Pérez, Guillermo; Moreno-Fernández, Ismael; Escario-Méndez, Alejandro; Arévalo-Serrano, Juan; Valentín, Antonio; Do-Vale, Bruno Manuel; Fletcher, Helen Marie; Lorenzo-Fernández, Jesús Medardo",PLoS One,,413

A total of 611 full-length genomes from different states of India were extracted from the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative on 6 June, 2020. Their alignment with the reference sequence (Wuhan, NCBI accession number NC_045512.2) uncovered 270 parsimony informative sites. Furthermore, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups. The network revealed the core haplogroup as that of reference sequence NC_045512.2 (Haplogroup A1) with 157 identical sequences present across 16 states. Remaining haplogroups had <10 identical sequences across a maximum of three states. Some states with fewer samples had more haplogroups. Forty-one haplogroups were localized exclusively to any one state. The two most common lineages are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in India.

Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 and associated social restrictions has radically transformed ridership behavior in urban areas. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is that low-income and historically marginalized groups are not only the most susceptible to economic shifts but are also most reliant on public transportation. As revenue decreases, transit agencies are tasked with providing adequate public transportation services in an increasingly hostile economic environment. Transit agencies therefore have two primary concerns. First, how has COVID-19 impacted ridership and what is the new post-COVID normal? Second, how has ridership varied spatio-temporally and between socio-economic groups? In this work we provide a data-driven analysis of COVID-19's affect on public transit operations and identify temporal variation in ridership change. We then combine spatial distributions of ridership decline with local economic data to identify variation between socio-economic groups. We find that in Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, fixed-line bus ridership dropped by 66.9% and 65.1% from 2019 baselines before stabilizing at 48.4% and 42.8% declines respectively. The largest declines were during morning and evening commute time. Additionally, there was a significant difference in ridership decline between the highest-income areas and lowest-income areas (77% vs 58%) in Nashville.","Wilbur, Michael; Ayman, Afiya; Ouyang, Anna; Poon, Vincent; Kabir, Riyan; Vadali, Abhiram; Pugliese, Philip; Freudberg, Daniel; Laszka, Aron; Dubey, Abhishek",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02413v1.pdf,413

418028,Thorax CT findings of temporal changes in a case with COVID-19 pneumonia,2021,"BACKGROUND: Conventional diagnosis of COVID-19 with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (hereafter, PCR) is associated with prolonged time to diagnosis and significant costs to run the test. The SARS-CoV-2 virus might lead to characteristic patterns in the results of widely available, routine blood tests that could be identified with machine learning methodologies. Machine learning modalities integrating findings from these common laboratory test results might accelerate ruling out COVID-19 in emergency department patients. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop (ie, train and internally validate with cross-validation techniques) and externally validate a machine learning model to rule out COVID 19 using only routine blood tests among adults in emergency departments. METHODS: Using clinical data from emergency departments (EDs) from 66 US hospitals before the pandemic (before the end of December 2019) or during the pandemic (March-July 2020), we included patients aged &#8805;20 years in the study time frame. We excluded those with missing laboratory results. Model training used 2183 PCR-confirmed cases from 43 hospitals during the pandemic; negative controls were 10,000 prepandemic patients from the same hospitals. External validation used 23 hospitals with 1020 PCR-confirmed cases and 171,734 prepandemic negative controls. The main outcome was COVID 19 status predicted using same-day routine laboratory results. Model performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve as well as sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: Of 192,779 patients included in the training, external validation, and sensitivity data sets (median age decile 50 [IQR 30-60] years, 40.5% male [78,249/192,779]), AUROC for training and external validation was 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.92). Using a risk score cutoff of 1.0 (out of 100) in the external validation data set, the model achieved sensitivity of 95.9% and specificity of 41.7%; with a cutoff of 2.0, sensitivity was 92.6% and specificity was 59.9%. At the cutoff of 2.0, the NPVs at a prevalence of 1%, 10%, and 20% were 99.9%, 98.6%, and 97%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning model developed with multicenter clinical data integrating commonly collected ED laboratory data demonstrated high rule-out accuracy for COVID-19 status, and might inform selective use of PCR-based testing.","Plante, Timothy B; Blau, Aaron M; Berg, Adrian N; Weinberg, Aaron S; Jun, Ik C; Tapson, Victor F; Kanigan, Tanya S; Adib, Artur B",J Med Internet Res,,413

418193,Psychological impact of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on nurses,2021,"Recent Coronavirus (COVID-19) is one of the respiratory diseases, and it is known as fast infectious ability. This dissemination can be decelerated by diagnosing and quarantining patients with COVID-19 at early stages, thereby saving numerous lives. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is known as one of the primary diagnostic tools. However, RT-PCR tests are costly and time-consuming; it also requires specific materials, equipment, and instruments. Moreover, most countries are suffering from a lack of testing kits because of limitations on budget and techniques. Thus, this standard method is not suitable to meet the requirements of fast detection and tracking during the COVID-19 pandemic, which motived to employ deep learning (DL)/convolutional neural networks (CNNs) technology with X-ray and CT scans for efficient analysis and diagnostic. This study provides insight about the literature that discussed the deep learning technology and its various techniques that are recently developed to combat the dissemination of COVID-19 disease.","Alsharif, M H; Alsharif, Y H; Yahya, K; Alomari, O A; Albreem, M A; Jahid, A",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,413

Iran was among the first countries with a major outbreak outside China. METHODS: We constructed a globally representative sample of 802 genomes, including 46 samples from patients inside or with a travel history to Iran. We then performed a phylogenetic analysis to identify clades related to samples from Iran and estimated the start of the epidemic and early doubling times in cases. We leveraged air travel data from 36 exported cases of COVID-19 to estimate the point-prevalence and the basic reproductive number across the country. We also analysed the province-level all-cause mortality data during winter and spring 2020 to estimate under-reporting of COVID-19-related deaths. Finally, we use this information in an SEIR model to reconstruct the early outbreak dynamics and assess the effectiveness of intervention measures in Iran. RESULTS: By identifying the most basal clade that contained genomes from Iran, our phylogenetic analysis showed that the age of the root is placed on 2019-12-21 (95 % HPD: 2019-09-07 - 2020-02-14). This date coincides with our estimated epidemic start date on 2019-12-25 (95 %CI: 2019-12-11 - 2020-02-24) based air travel data from exported cases with an early doubling time of 4.0 (95 %CI: 1.4-6.7) days in cases. Our analysis of all-cause mortality showed 21.9 (95 % CI: 16.7-27.2) thousand excess deaths by the end of summer. Our model forecasted the second epidemic peak and suggested that by 2020-08-31 a total of 15.0 (95 %CI: 4.9-25.0) million individuals recovered from the disease across the country. CONCLUSION: These findings have profound implications for assessing the stage of the epidemic in Iran despite significant levels of under-reporting. Moreover, the results shed light on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in Iran and central Asia. They also suggest that in the absence of border screening, there is a high risk of introduction from travellers from areas with active outbreaks. Finally, they show both that well-informed epidemic models are able to forecast episodes of resurgence following a relaxation of interventions, and that NPIs are key to controlling ongoing epidemics.","Ghafari, Mahan; Hejazi, Bardia; Karshenas, Arman; Dascalu, Stefan; Kadvidar, Alireza; Khosravi, Mohammad A; Abbasalipour, Maryam; Heydari, Majid; Zeinali, Sirous; Ferretti, Luca; Ledda, Alice; Katzourakis, Aris",Epidemics,,413

Vaccine trials are already underway, but there remains an urgent need to find other therapeutic approaches to either target SARS-CoV-2 or the complications arising from viral infection, particularly the dysregulated immune response and systemic complications which have been associated with progression to severe COVID-19. At the time of writing, in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described using macaques, cats, ferrets, hamsters, and transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). These infection models have already been useful for studies of transmission and immunity, but to date only partially model the mechanisms implicated in human severe COVID-19. There is therefore an urgent need for development of animal models for improved evaluation of efficacy of drugs identified as having potential in the treatment of severe COVID-19. These models need to recapitulate key mechanisms of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and reproduce the immunopathology and systemic sequelae associated with this disease. Here, we review the current models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related disease mechanisms and suggest ways in which animal models can be adapted to increase their usefulness in research into COVID-19 pathogenesis and for assessing potential treatments.","Cleary, Simon J; Pitchford, Simon C; Amison, Richard T; Carrington, Robert; Robaina Cabrera, C Lorena; Magnen, Mélia; Looney, Mark R; Gray, Elaine; Page, Clive P",Br. j. pharmacol,,413

Almost all medical attention and focus is on this infection. Nonetheless, prior to this pandemic NCDs and the increasing prevalence of multimorbidity dominated the global landscape. The aim of this paper is to explore the effect of COVID-19 on NCDs and multimorbidity populations while proposing recommendations to protect this vulnerable population. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed and Google scholar was performed using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""Vulnerable population"", ""Non-communicable diseases"" and ""Multimorbidity"". Articles found relevant to the scope of the article were considered. RESULTS: Instituted restrictive measures to curb the viral spread led to constraints on wellbeing of the NCDs and multimorbidity population. There was also disruption to access to essential services and screening programmes, and the reduction or cancellation of planned appointments. These individuals have been reported to have a higher risk of a COVID-19 infection and premature mortality. It was also observed that the relaxation of COVID measures led to the spill off of infections among this vulnerable population with a spike in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in COVID-19 policies so as to resuscitate economies are crucial. However, it is paramount that measures to ensure adequate care and protection of the NCDs population are instituted, especially on the eve of the seasonal influenza season. Strategies are recommended to plan for surveillance, risk assessments, follow-ups and prevention of the twofold burden of non-communicable and communicable diseases.","Cuschieri, Sarah; Grech, Victor",Early Hum Dev,,413

422323,Sex Differences in Case Fatality Rate of COVID-19: Insights From a Multinational Registry,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic radically impacts our lives, while the transmission/infection and recovery dynamics of COVID-19 remain obscure. A time-dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of COVID-19 evolution observed in the last three months (till 3/22/2020) in various provinces and metropolises in China. The model results revealed the space dependent transmission/infection rate and the significant spatiotemporal variation in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city lockdowns in China. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict COVID-19 evolution in United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea which have responded differently to monitoring and mitigating COVID-19 so far, although these predictions contain high uncertainty due to the intrinsic change of the maximum infected population and the infection/recovery rates within the different countries. In addition, a stochastic model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction model, was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread. Preliminary tests using the stochastic model showed that self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing COVID-19 spread, if not all of the infected people can be promptly diagnosed and quarantined.","Zhang, Yong; Yu, Xiangnan; Sun, HongGuang; Tick, Geoffrey R.; Wei, Wei; Jin, Bin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13901v1.pdf,413

We examined associations of COVID-19 information sources and information overload with psychological distress symptoms and explored the mediating effect of information overload in Hong Kong. A random sample of Chinese adults (N = 1501; 52.6% females; 55.0% aged 30-59) from dual landline and online surveys in April 2020 reported frequency of using traditional media, internet websites, social networking sites, instant messaging, and online discussion forums as COVID-19 information sources. Psychological distress symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 4-item ([PHQ-4]; 0-12). Information overload defined as a perception of being overwhelmed was measured (1-6). Linear regressions were performed to analyze the associations, and the mediating effect of information overload was examined. Greater PHQ-4 score was observed for frequent use of internet websites (adjusted b = 0.58, 95% CI 0.29, 0.87, adjusted ß = 0.12) and online discussion forums (adjusted b = 0.39, 95% CI 0.08, 0.70, adjusted ß = 0.08) and information overload (adjusted b = 0.54, 95% CI 0.44, 0.63, adjusted ß = 0.28). Information overload mediated 44.9% and 36.9% of associations of frequent use of internet websites and online discussion forums with PHQ-4 score, respectively. Frequent use of social networking sites was associated with lower PHQ-4 score (adjusted b = -0.37, 95% CI -0.69, -0.04, adjusted ß = -0.07) partially through lower information overload (37.5%). Psychological distress symptoms were associated with frequent use of internet websites and online discussion forums as COVID-19 information sources, which were mediated through information overload.","Guo, Ningyuan; Zhao, Sheng Zhi; Weng, Xue; Wu, Yongda; Luk, Tzu Tsun; Wong, Janet Yuen Ha; Lam, Tai Hing; Wang, Man Ping",Transl Behav Med,,413

METHODS: Retrospective consecutive case series of 183 patients attending Birmingham and Midlands Eye Centre undergoing primary retinopexy (cryotherapy and laser) between March 23rd to June 30th in 2019 (Group 1) and 2020 (Group 2). RESULTS: In total we reviewed 183 retinopexies, 122 in Group 1 and 61 in Group 2, a reduction of 50%. In Group 2 compared to Group 1, we showed a significant difference in characteristics of patients having primary retinopexy with an increase in proportion of male patients from 50 (41.0%) to 39 (63.9%) (p = 0.005), increase in high myopes from 1 (0.8%) to 4 (6.6%) (p = 0.043), more slit lamp laser retinopexy from 83 (68.0%) to 52 (85.2%) (p = 0.013) and less cryopexy from 21 (17.2%) to 2 (3.3%) (p = 0.008). In Group 2, primary retinopexy resulted in significantly more 3-month RRD rate 1 (0.8%) to 5 (8.2%) (p = 0.016). There were no changes in number of patients requiring further retinopexy (p = 1.000).

Mostly individual teletherapy has been offered and studied, although group therapy is often offered in clinics. In fact, little is known regarding group therapy's acceptability, feasibility, and potential impact when offered via videoconferencing. METHODS: This pilot study offered group cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis via videoconferencing to 14 individuals with early psychosis either living in remote areas or confined during the pandemic. RESULTS: The rate of consenting to the study (79%) and actual participation rates were acceptable (18.5 sessions out of 24). Although some technological obstacles were encountered, solutions offered allowed the videoconferencing group to be considered feasible for most participants and therapists. Prepost results on symptoms and self-esteem were comparable to those of other studies using the same group treatment but in-person. Alliance scores seemed similar as well. CONCLUSIONS: More studies are warranted on the efficacy of group therapy via videoconferencing. This pilot study does offer promising results, suggesting that a wider range of people with early psychosis can be reached and benefit from the advantages of receiving an evidence-based group intervention.","Lecomte, Tania; Abdel-Baki, Amal; Francoeur, Audrey; Cloutier, Briana; Leboeuf, Amélie; Abadie, Pascale; Villeneuve, Marie; Guay, Stephane",Early intervention in psychiatry (Online),,413

Although the alterations of cancer treatment maintenance were evaluated, the difference in physicians' side was not determined. In this survey study, we tried to assess the alteration of Turkish oncologists' daily practice. Methods: An online survey was prepared via Google forms and sent to oncologists registered to the Turkish Society of Medical Oncology. One hundred twenty-eight oncologists answered the online survey. Results: Twenty-three percent of the oncologists moved their facilities to another place in the hospital after the pandemic, which was resulted in nearly 90% of worse patient services. Seventy percent of the oncologists did not receive any duties on COVID-19 services after Turkey's first case. Thirty-one percent of the oncologists stated their oncology practice was disturbed by working in the COVID-19 services. Three oncologists accepted they were responsible for cross-infection to oncology patients. Eighty-five percent of the oncologists declared oncology practice was disturbed by the other specialists' assignment in COVID-19 services. The leading areas were general surgery, pulmonary diseases, and ENT, according to oncologists. Twenty-two percent of the oncologists needed to send their patients to other oncology clinics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Although oncologists tolerated oncological patient management alterations, the prolonged pandemic situation may harm oncology practice via the loss of oncologists' motivation and incomplete multi-disciplinary patient management.

Initial data, collected a few months into the pandemic, showed that families, particularly those experiencing food insecurity, reported detrimental changes to their home food environment and parent feeding practices, compared to before COVID-19. Objective: This follow-up study obtained longitudinal data from a sample of parents in the United States to quantify changes in food security status, the home food environment, and parent feeding practices, from before to across COVID-19 as the pandemic continued to persist. Methods: Parents (N = 433) completed online surveys May (T1) and September (T2) 2020 during COVID-19. Food security, home food environment, and parent feeding practices were reported at each timepoint. At T1, parents also retrospectively reported on these factors pertaining to before COVID-19. Chi square analyses and repeated measure mixed models examined associations among study variables. Results: Low or very low food security increased from before COVID-19 (37%) to T1 (54%) and decreased by T2 (45%). About 30% of families who became food insecure, and 44% who stayed food insecure from T1 to T2, reported a decrease in total food in their home; only 3%-6% who became/stayed food secure reported this decrease. Parents' concern for child overweight and use of monitoring increased from before COVID-19 to T1, and decreased by T2, but remained elevated above pre-COVID-19 values. Conclusion: Rates of food insecurity remain high as this pandemic persists. Continued assessment of nutrition-related factors and increased economic supports are critical for families to endure COVID-19 and prevent long-term obesity and health risks.","Adams, Elizabeth L; Caccavale, Laura J; Smith, Danyel; Bean, Melanie K",,,413

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a systematic review to identify reports published from November 1, 2019, until June 15, 2020, on laboratory-confirmed community-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants younger than 3 months of age. We excluded studies reporting neonates with perinatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure and diagnosis before hospital discharge and hospital-onset disease, as well as clinically diagnosed cases without confirmation. Two independent reviewers performed study screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment. Variables of interest included patient age, exposure to COVID-19, medical history, clinical symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing, laboratory findings, clinical course, and disposition. RESULTS: In total, 38 publications met inclusion criteria, including 23 single case reports, 14 case series, and 1 cohort study, describing 63 infants younger than 3 months of age with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most cases were mild to moderate. Fever, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and neurologic findings were reported. Laboratory abnormalities included neutropenia, lymphopenia, and elevated serum levels of inflammatory markers and aminotransferases. Fifty-eight (92%) infants were hospitalized, 13 (21%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 2 (3%) required mechanical ventilation. No death was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Among young infants with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, most cases were mild to moderate and improved with supportive care. Our results demonstrate a need for a high index of suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection in young infants presenting with generalized symptoms such as fever or decreased feeding, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms.","Mark, Elyse G; Golden, W Christopher; Gilmore, Maureen M; Sick-Samuels, Anna; Curless, Melanie S; Nogee, Lawrence M; Milstone, Aaron M; Johnson, Julia",J. pediatr.

We wanted to examine correlations between a selection of sociodemographic variables and infection rates in Oslo's districts. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Aggregated data on districts obtained from Oslo City Government's statistics database were collated with cumulative figures for PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 as of 3 December 2020. We selected some variables from the living conditions indicators that showed a strong correlation with infection rates. The composite variable 'socioeconomic status' included income, education and labour market attachment. 'Household density' included the proportion of people in cramped living conditions and multi-family households. We performed an unadjusted and adjusted standard multiple linear regression analysis of the impact of immigrant ratio, socioeconomic status and household density on infection rates. RESULTS: Immigrant ratio, socioeconomic status and household density were all associated with infection rates in the districts. Pearson's correlation coefficients (95 % CI) were 0.97 (0.93 to 0.99), -0.93 (-0.97 to -0.86) and 0.88 (0.77 to 0.98) respectively, all with p <0.001. In the adjusted model, immigrant ratio was still associated with the infection rate, B = 3.95 (2.16 to 5.73), p <0.001, however there was no longer a statistically significant association between socioeconomic status or household density and infection rates. INTERPRETATION: Immigrant ratio seems to be an important risk factor for infection in Oslo. Our analysis suggests that the correlation may be due to factors other than low socioeconomic status and high household density.","Søegaard, Erik Ganesh Iyer; Kan, Zhanna",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,,413

429604,The impact of fear and anxiety of Covid-19 on life satisfaction: Psychological distress and sleep disturbance as mediators,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study is to compare excess mortality (EM) patterns and spatial correlation between the first and second wave of the pandemic in Lombardy, the Italian region that paid an extremely high COVID-19-related mortality toll in March and April 2020. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a longitudinal study using municipality-level mortality data. METHODS: We investigated the patterns and spatial correlation of EM of men aged &#8805;75 years during the first two pandemic waves (March-April 2020 vs November 2020) of COVID-19, using the mortality data released by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. EM was estimated at the municipality level to accurately detect the critical areas within the region. RESULTS: The areas that were mostly hit during the first wave of COVID-19 were generally spared by the second wave: EM of men aged &#8805;75 years in the municipality of Bergamo plummeted from +472% in March and April to -13% in November, and in Cremona the variation was from +344% to -19%. Conversely, in November 2020 EM was higher in some areas that had been protected in the first wave of the pandemic. Spatial correlation widely corroborates these findings, as large sections of the hot spots of EM detected in the first wave of the pandemic changed into cold spots in the second wave, and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the specular distribution of EM between the first and second wave of the pandemic, which may entail the consequences of social distancing measures and individual behaviors, local management strategies, 'harvesting' of the frailer population and, possibly, acquired immune protection. In conclusion, our findings support the need for continuous monitoring and analysis of mortality data using detailed spatial resolution.","Golinelli, D; Lenzi, J; Adja, K Y C; Reno, C; Sanmarchi, F; Fantini, M P; Gibertoni, D",Public Health,,413

In order to meet the growing demand in laboratories for RT-PCR testing for viral genome detection, rapid tests detecting a SARS-CoV-2 protein (antigenic rapid test) have been developed. In this review, we present for different SARS-CoV-2 antigenic rapid tests authorized in France: legislation, technological principle, and analytical and clinical performances. Data bellow are those provided by the manufacturer/distributor. From the list of tests authorized by the French Ministry of Health, we have selected 25 for which the distributors/manufacturers have provided the technical data essential to their comparative analysis. The kits use immunochromatography technology, with detection of the nucleocapsid protein (n = 24) or the spike protein (n = 1). The matrix used is a nasopharyngeal (n = 23), oropharyngeal (n = 9) or nasal (n = 3) swab. According to the test, the reading of the result is done from 15 to 30 minutes after it is performed. The clinical sensitivity, for the more performant tests is conversely linked to the Ct of RT-PCR, ranging from 80.2% to 98.4%, according to the quantity of virus present in the sample. This percentage is inversely proportional to the Ct obtained using RT-PCR. The limit of detection ranges from 31.55 to 7200 TCID50/mL. The clinical specificity, compared to a negative result of RT-PCR, is between 99.2% and 100%. Analytical specificity evaluated on other microorganisms is 100%, except for 3 kits that show cross-reactivities with SARS-CoV-1 (n = 3) and MERS-CoV (n = 1). Positive and negative predictive values range from 96.3% to 100% and 95% to 99.4%, respectively.","Lim, Isabelle; Gautheret-Dejean, Agnès",Ann Biol Clin (Paris),,413

431700,BET 1: Lopinavir-ritonavir and COVID-19,2020,"Estimation of the undocumented cases of COVID-19 is critical for understanding the epidemic potential of the disease and informing pandemic response. The COVID-19 pandemic originated from a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that was formerly identified in 2003. The contagiousness, dynamics of the pathogen, and mobility of the general population incurred the occurrence of underestimation of infection (i.e., the unidentified cases and the gap with the identified cases) that was potentially substantial in magnitude, which was supposed to connect with subsequent cyclical outbreaks in practice. We employed a Susceptible-Infected-Removed-Contained (SIR-C) mathematical model to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with COVID-19, then asymptotically simulated the peak sizes and peak dates of the identified and unidentified cases, the underestimation, and the dynamics of the gap. The simulation outcomes indicated that unidentified peak dates in practice could predate the reported peak dates for a variable period of weeks or months. In comparison, the saturation sizes of infection remained at commensurate levels. The curve of the initial exponential-like outbreak for the undocumented cases would flatten when the gap between concurrent identified cases and unidentified cases decreased. The rate of non-pharmaceutical containment could impact the trend of disease transmission ceteris paribus, and the greater the rate the larger reduction of infections. When the rate reached a certain level of threshold, the undocumented curve would shift from flattening effect to decaying effect. A similar trend was observed when it applied to the rate of pharmaceutical containment measures ceteris paribus. The results were sensitive to the duration of infection (DOI), it manifested that greater values of DOI were associated with greater peak sizes and greater peak dates for both documented and undocumented cases. Conditional on assumptions, calibration of DOI from 8 days to 18 days would increase the unidentified peak size by nearly 56% and the peak date by almost 18 days.","Nakamoto, Ichiro; Zhang, Jilin",Results Phys,,413

Despite the shutdown measures being in place, northern China still suffered severe haze episodes (HE) that are not yet fully understood, particularly how the source emissions changed. Thus, the meteorological conditions and source emissions in processing five HEs occurred in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area were investigated by analyzing a comprehensive real-time measurement dataset including air quality data, particle physics, optical properties, chemistry, aerosol lidar remote sensing, and meteorology. Three HEs recorded before the shutdown began were related to accumulated primary pollutants and secondary aerosol formation under unfavorable dispersion conditions. The common ""business as usual"" emissions from local primary sources in this highly polluted area exceeded the wintertime atmospheric diffusive capacity to disperse them. Thus, an intensive haze formed under these adverse meteorological conditions such as in the first HE, with coal combustion to be the predominant source. Positive responses to the shutdown measures were demonstrated by reduced contributions from traffic and dust during the final two HEs that overlapped the Spring and Lantern Festivals, respectively. Local meteorological dispersion during the Spring Festival was the poorest among the five HEs. Increased residential burning plus fireworks emissions contributed to the elevated PM2.5 with the potential of enhancing the HEs. Our results highlight that reductions from shutdown measures alone do not prevent the occurrence of HEs. To further reduce air pollution and thus improve public health, abatement strategies with an emphasis on residential burning are needed.","Dai, Qili; Ding, Jing; Hou, Linlu; Li, Linxuan; Cai, Ziying; Liu, Baoshuang; Song, Congbo; Bi, Xiaohui; Wu, Jianhui; Zhang, Yufen; Feng, Yinchang; Hopke, Philip K",Environ Pollut,,413

This study aimed at assess the status of occupational stress in the three occupational groups of nurses, physicians and hospital cleaning crew facing COVID-19 patients in hospitals of Kerman province in Iran. Methodology: : This cross-sectional descriptive analytical study was performed on 290 medical staffs including nurses, physicians and cleaning crew facing COVID-19 patients working in different hospitals in Iran in 2020. Demographic information form and occupational Stress Questionnaire (HSE tool indicator) were used to collect data. The health and safety executive (HSE) questionnaire has 35 questions and 7 areas, which was developed in the 1990s by the UK Health and Safety Institute to measure occupational stress. Results: The mean score of total dimensions among HCWs was 2.93. Communications, Manager support, Changes and Demand factors with scores of 2.76, 2.77, 2.83 and 2.87 had the greatest impact on participants' stress levels, respectively. Also, Colleague support factor with a score of 3.38 had the least effect on stress levels. Also, according to the results, 87% of nurses, 79% of cleaning crew and 67% of physicians had a partial to high levels of stress that, on average, 77.5% of the HCWs participating in this study had at least a small amount of stress. Conclusions: The mean stress score among the participants of the present study was between high stress level and moderate stress level. Factors such as communications, manager support, change and demand had the greatest impact on employee stress levels. Therefore, by improving the communication between people working in hospitals, increasing managers' support for staff, and reducing workplace demands such as reducing workload and improving workplace environment, the stress level of staff in hospitals during the outbreak of COVID-19 can be reduced.","Zare, Sajad; Mohammadi Dameneh, Moslem; Esmaeili, Reza; Kazemi, Reza; Naseri, Sahar; Panahi, Davoud",Heliyon,,413
441397,"The first case of COVID-19 infection in a 75-day-old infant in Jahrom City, south of Iran",2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 was declared pandemic due to the rapid increase of cases around the world, including the number of pregnant women. Data about vertical transmission of Covid-19 are still limited and controversial: in most cases, although a positive mother, the virus could not be isolated in amniotic fluid, cord blood, breast milk or neonatal throat swab in these patients. No data have been published about possible intrauterine sonographic signs of infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A pregnant woman was diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 at 35+5 weeks of gestation and managed conservatively at home. At transabdominal ultrasound at 38+3 weeks, fetal bowel and gallbladder calcifications were noted. CMV and other infectious agents were ruled out; an iterative Caesarean Section was performed at 38+5 weeks without complications. Placenta resulted negative for SARS-CoV-2; the umbilical cord blood sample was IgG positive and IgM negative as per maternal infection. The baby developed respiratory distress syndrome requiring endotracheal surfactant administration and nasal-CPAP for one day but nasopharyngeal swabs at birth and after 48 hours were SARS-Cov2 negative. Neonatal abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver, acalculous gallbladder with mild parietal thickening. The baby was discharged in good conditions. CONCLUSIONS: although gallbladder calcifications and echogenic bowel are highly suspicious of viral infection and were thought to be due to the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, these findings were not corroborated by the results of our diagnostic tests; these sonographic findings might represent a false positive of fetal infection in mother affected by COVID-19 since vertical transmission appears to be rare.","Sileo, Filomena G; Tramontano, Anna L; Leone, Chiara; Meacci, Marisa; Gennari, William; Ternelli, Giliana; La Marca, Antonio; Lugli, Licia; Berardi, Alberto; Facchinetti, Fabio; Bertucci, Emma",Minerva ginecol,,413

However, the molecular basis of these symptoms remains unclear. SARS-CoV-1 E protein interferes with control of cell polarity and cell-cell junction integrity in human epithelial cells by binding to the PALS1 PDZ domain, a key component of the Crumbs polarity complex. We show that C-terminal PDZ binding motifs of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 E proteins bind the PALS1 PDZ domain with 29.6 and 22.8 µM affinity, whereas the related sequence from MERS-CoV did not bind. We then determined crystal structures of PALS1 PDZ domain bound to both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 E protein PDZ binding motifs. Our findings establish the structural basis for SARS-CoV-1/2 mediated subversion of Crumbs polarity signalling and serve as a platform for the development of small molecule inhibitors to suppress SARS-CoV-1/2 mediated disruption of polarity signalling in epithelial cells.","Javorsky, Airah; Humbert, Patrick O; Kvansakul, Marc",Commun Biol,,413

ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04411576. RESULTS: Subjects with high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus, as indicated by the Cycle threshold (Ct) value in the PCR, had the highest risk for sick leave in the two weeks after testing (OR 11.97 (CI 95% 6.29-22.80)) whereas subjects with low amounts of virus had the highest risk for sick leave in the past three weeks before testing (OR 6.31 (4.38-9.08)). Only 2.5% of employees were SARS-CoV-2 positive while 10.5% were positive by serology and 1.2% were positive in both tests. Serology-positive subjects were not at excess risk for future sick leave (OR 1.06 (95% CI, 0.71-1.57)). CONCLUSIONS: High amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus, as determined using PCR Ct values, associates with development of sickness in the next few weeks. The results support the concept that PCR Ct may be informative when testing for SARS-CoV-2 is performed.","Dillner, Joakim; Elfström, K Miriam; Blomqvist, Jonas; Engstrand, Lars; Uhlén, Mathias; Eklund, Carina; Boulund, Fredrik; Lagheden, Camilla; Hamsten, Marica; Nordqvist-Kleppe, Sara; Seifert, Maike; Hellström, Cecilia; Olofsson, Jennie; Andersson, Eni; Falk, August Jernbom; Bergström, Sofia; Hultin, Emilie; Pin, Elisa; Pimenoff, Ville N; Hassan, Sadaf; Månberg, Anna; Nilsson, Peter; Hedhammar, My; Hober, Sophia; Mattsson, Johan; Mühr, Laila Sara Arroyo; Lundgren, Kalle Conneryd",J. infect. dis,,413

We used the parental triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 (231) cells and their brain colonizing counterpart (231Br) to ascertain phenotypic differences in response to AZA. We observed that 231Br cells have higher metastatic potential compared to 231 cells. With regard to therapeutic value, the AZA IC50 value in 231Br cells is significantly lower than that in parental cells (Pâ¯<â¯.01). AZA treatment increased apoptosis and inhibited the Wnt signaling transduction pathway, angiogenesis, and cell metastatic capacity to a significantly higher extent in the 231Br line. AZA treatment in mice with experimental brain metastases significantly reduced tumor burden (Pâ¯=â¯.0112) and increased survival (Pâ¯=â¯.0026) compared to vehicle.

(Special Issue: Mayo clinic strategies for COVID-19.),2020,"BACKGROUND: Surgeons urgently need guidance on how to deliver surgical services safely and effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim was to identify the key domains that should be considered when developing pandemic preparedness plans for surgical services. METHODS: A scoping search was conducted to identify published articles relating to management of surgical patients during pandemics. Key informant interviews were conducted with surgeons and anaesthetists with direct experience of working during infectious disease outbreaks, in order to identify key challenges and solutions to delivering effective surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Thirteen articles were identified from the scoping search, and surgeons and anaesthetists representing 11 territories were interviewed. To mount an effective response to COVID-19, a pandemic response plan for surgical services should be developed in advance. Key domains that should be included are: provision of staff training (such as patient transfers, donning and doffing personal protection equipment, recognizing and managing COVID-19 infection); support for the overall hospital response to COVID-19 (reduction in non-urgent activities such as clinics, endoscopy, non-urgent elective surgery); establishment of a team-based approach for running emergency services; and recognition and management of COVID-19 infection in patients treated as an emergency and those who have had surgery. A backlog of procedures after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is inevitable, and hospitals should plan how to address this effectively to ensure that patients having elective treatment have the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSION: Hospitals should prepare detailed context-specific pandemic preparedness plans addressing the identified domains. Specific guidance should be updated continuously to reflect emerging evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,Br. j. surg,,413

446568,Can prognostic nutritional index and systemic immune-inflammatory index predict disease severity in COVID-19?,2021,"The prevalence of asthma has increased worldwide. Asthma exacerbations triggered by upper respiratory tract viral infections remain a major clinical problem and account for hospital admissions and time lost from work. Virus-induced asthma exacerbations cause airway inflammation, resulting in worsening asthma and deterioration in the patients' quality of life, which may require systemic corticosteroid therapy. Despite recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbations, current therapeutic modalities are inadequate for complete prevention and treatment of these episodes. The pathological role of cellular senescence, especially that involving the silent information regulator 2 homolog sirtuin (SIRT) protein family, has recently been demonstrated in stable and exacerbated chronic respiratory disease states. This review discusses the role of SIRT1 in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. It also discusses the role of SIRT1 in inflammatory cells that play an important role in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Recent studies have hypothesized that SIRT1 is one of major contributors to cellular senescence. SIRT1 levels decrease in Th2 and non-Th2-related airway inflammation, indicating the role of SIRT1 in several endotypes and phenotypes of asthma. Moreover, several models have demonstrated relationships between viral infection and SIRT1. Therefore, targeting SIRT1 is a novel strategy that may be effective for treating virus-induced asthma exacerbations in the future.","Fukuda, Yosuke; Akimoto, Kaho; Homma, Tetsuya; Baker, Jonathan R; Ito, Kazuhiro; Barnes, Peter J; Sagara, Hironori",,,413

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,2020,"Botulinum neurotoxins are considered as one of the most potent toxins and are produced by Clostridium botulinum. It is crucial to have a rapid and sensitive method to detect the bacterium Clostridium botulinum in food. In this study, a rapid detection assay of C. botulinum in food using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology was developed. The optimal primers were identified among three sets of primers designed specifically based on the partial ntnh gene encoding nontoxic-nonhaemagglutinin (NTNH) for rapid detection of the target DNA in plasmids. The optimal temperature and reaction time of the LAMP assay were determined to be 64 °C and 60 min, respectively. The chemical kit could be assembled based on these optimized reaction conditions for quick, initial high-throughput screening of C. botulinum in food samples. The established LAMP assay showed high specificity and sensitivity in detecting the target DNA with a limit of 0.0001 pg/ul (i.e., ten times more sensitive than that of the PCR method) and an accuracy rate of 100%. This study demonstrated a potentially rapid, cost-effective, and easy-operating method to detect C. botulinum in food and clinical samples based on LAMP technology.","Chen, Yufei; Li, Hao; Yang, Liu; Wang, Lei; Sun, Ruyi; Shearer, Julia E S; Sun, Fengjie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,413

Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 include saliva, nasopharyngeal swabs, and lower respiratory tract-derived materials such as sputum. Initially, nasopharyngeal swab specimens were applied mainly to the PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. There was a risk of infection to healthcare workers due to coughing or sneezing by the subjects at the time of sample collection. In contrast, saliva specimens have a low risk of droplet infection and are easy to collect, and their application to PCR testing has been promoted. In this study, we have determined the detection limit of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples and examined the effects of storage temperature and storage time of saliva samples on the PCR detection results. As a result, 5 × 103 copies of SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline, whereas 5 × 104 copies of SARS-CoV-2 were needed in 1 mL saliva to detect the virus by real-time one-step PCR. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 (5 × 103 copies/mL) could be detected in saliva supplemented with an RNase inhibitor. Concerning the saliva samples supplemented with an RNase inhibitor, the optimal temperature for sample storage was -20 °C, and PCR detection was maintained within 48 h without problems under these conditions. These finding suggest that RNase in the saliva can affect the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR using saliva samples.","Nishibata, Yuka; Koshimoto, Shota; Ogaki, Kenta; Ishikawa, Erika; Wada, Kosuke; Yoshinari, Miku; Tamura, Yuto; Uozumi, Ryo; Masuda, Sakiko; Tomaru, Utano; Ishizu, Akihiro",Pathol Res Pract,,413

Despite the prevailing pandemic, there are no recommendations available as yet for testing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as part of blood screening. OBJECTIVE: To determine the seroprevalence of SAR-CoV-2 antibodies, its clinical significance and to identify if total antibodies(IgA, IgM, IgG) should be tested or just the specific IgG antibodies only. METHOD: Consecutive blood donors donated were screened for standard serological panel of HbsAg, Anti-HCV, Anti-HIV and Syphilis using Cobas-411 analyser and Malaria. All seronegative donors were then screened for COVID serology using the same instrument. These results were compared with the blood donors' seroprevalence checked in a cohort in the first week of June 2020. Pre-COVID-19 period (October 2019) blood donors' archived samples were also compared. Donors who were positive on ECLIA were then tested for specific antibodies (IgM or IgG) by ELISA. RESULTS: A total of 380 healthy blood donors were included. All were males with the mean age being 30.6 ± 6.3 years. Ten pre-pandemic samples did not show COVID-19 antibodies, whereas out of 70 samples in the 3rd week of June, only 15 (21.4 %) were positive. However, in July out of the 300 blood donors, 113 (37.7 %) were found to be reactive. To reconfirm our findings, these 113 donors were then tested on ELISA for presence of IgG specifically. Out of these 128 samples, 81 were IgG positive, 23 were borderline positive and 24 were negative. CONCLUSION: Almost 40 % of blood donors are now seroconverted for COVID-19. This is a reflection of widespread seroprevalence in the adult male population.","Younas, Amber; Waheed, Samra; Khawaja, Shabnum; Imam, Mehjabeen; Borhany, Munira; Shamsi, Tahir",Transfus Apher Sci,,413

A multitude of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection assays with disparate gene targets, including automated high-throughput platforms, are available. Varying concordance and interpretation of diagnostic results in this setting can result in significant reporting delays, leading to suboptimal disease management. This article reports the development of a novel ORF1a-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay - Viroselect - that shows high concordance with conventional assays and the ability to resolve inconclusive results generated during the peak of the epidemic in Mumbai, India. METHODS: A unique target region within SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a - the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) region - was used to design and develop the assay. This hypervariable region (1923-3956) between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was utilized to design the primers and probes for the RT-PCR assay. The concordance of this assay with commonly used emergency use authorization (US Food and Drug Administration) manual kits and an automated high-throughput testing platform was evaluated. Further, a retrospective analysis was carried out using Viroselect on samples reported as 'inconclusive' between April and October 2020. RESULTS: In total, 701 samples were tested. Concordance analysis of 477 samples demonstrated high overall agreement of Viroselect with both manual (87.6%) and automated (84.7%) assays. Also, in the retrospective analysis of 224 additional samples reported as 'inconclusive', Viroselect was able to resolve 100% (19/19) and 93.7% (192/205) of samples which had inconclusive results on manual and automated high-throughput platforms, respectively. CONCLUSION: Viroselect had high concordance with conventional assays, both manual and automated, and has potential to resolve inconclusive samples.","Jawade, Ketki; Sinha, Akhauri Yash; Bhagat, Sharad; Bhowmick, Shilpa; Chauhan, Bhagyashree; Kaginkar, Snehal; Palav, Harsha; Kasarpalkar, Nandini; Devadiga, Pratik; Karandikar, Kalyani; Agrawal, Sachee; Shastri, Jayanthi; Munne, Kiran; Bhor, Vikrant M; Mahale, Smita D; Bhowmik, Subhanjan; Jagtap, Dhanashree; Patel, Vainav",Int J Infect Dis,,413

However, no study has examined closed POD recruitment strategies or approaches to determine best practices, such as how to select or recruit an agency, group, or business to become a closed POD site once a potential partner has been identified. We conducted qualitative interviews with US disaster planners to identify their approaches and challenges to recruiting closed POD sites. In total, 16 disaster planners participated. Recruitment considerations related to selecting sites, paperwork needed, and challenges faced in recruiting closed POD sites. Important selection criteria for sites included size, agencies or businesses with vulnerable or confined populations who lack access or ability to get to or through open POD sites, and critical infrastructure organizations. Major challenges to recruitment included difficulty convincing sites of closed POD importance, obstacles with recruiting sites that can administer mass vaccination, and fear of legal repercussions related to medical countermeasure dispensing or administration. Closed POD recruitment is a frequently challenging but highly necessary process both before and during the current pandemic. These recommendations can be used by other disaster planners intending to start or expand their closed POD network. Public health agencies should continue working toward improved distribution plans for medical countermeasures, both oral and vaccine, to minimize morbidity and mortality during mass casualty events.","Rebmann, Terri; Foerst, Kyle; Charney, Rachel L; Sandcork, Jessica; Mazzara, Rachel L",Health Secur,,413

Unequivocally, there are dangers to health care workers (and by extension, their patients, colleagues, and communities) if not enough equipment is donned to safeguard them. And yet, there are also dangers to patients, colleagues, and the community if resources are overconsumed and result in hoarding, shortages, and inequitable distribution, all of which are occurring as the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues.Research to ascertain the precise PPE required to defend specifically against SARS-CoV-2 encompasses an area of active investigation that will likely remain unresolved for some time. While awaiting more definitive conclusions, we must look to past evidence to provide a reasonable basis on which protocols and policies might be refined. What follows is a narrative review of PPE efficacy and how existing evidence might apply to protecting health care workers against COVID-19. Findings are extrapolated from investigations in 4 general domains: early investigations into SARS-CoV-2, retrospective studies about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1, prospective studies of influenza and other common respiratory viruses, and laboratory PPE studies.Available evidence suggests that contact and droplet precautions, in addition to eye protection and standard hygiene measures, should be adequate in the vast majority of clinical settings when caring for patients with SARS-CoV-2.

Being a parent in this situation was not easy for anyone, much less for parents of children with special needs. The shutting down of special education systems meant that parents lost a vital support network and had to be the sole full-time caregivers despite often lacking the skills to cope with this new and daunting situation. We interviewed parents and learned that the main difficulties faced by homebound autistic children stemmed from the change in routine, lack of special education services, limited physical space, and food- and sleep-related issues. Some children experienced worsening in behavioral, social, and developmental domains, yet others seemed to not only overcome the challenges of changing conditions but even benefit from them. The children's success or failure was directly related to how their parents coped. The key factors that enabled successful coping were the parents' ability to accommodate to the child's needs, their own creativeness and resourcefulness, and a generally positive outlook. The results of this analysis revealed that the best way to benefit autistic children caught up in drastic changes in their routine lifestyle is to invest in a strong support system for their parents.","Tokatly Latzer, Itay; Leitner, Yael; Karnieli-Miller, Orit",Autism,,413

Cumulative studies reported that the airway microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 leverage each other and determine the pathogen-microbiota-host responses. Cigarette smoking can disrupt microbiota abundance. The composition and diversification of intestinal microbiota influence the airway microbiota and the innate and adaptive immunity, which require supports from the balance of macro- and micronutrients from the diet. Colorful vegetables supplied fermentable prebiotics and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant phytonutrients. Fermented foods and beverages support intestinal microbiota. In sensitive individuals, the avoidance of the high immunoreactive food antigens contributes to antiviral immunity.

Clinical leaders and informatics specialists partnered to rapidly develop an electronic health record (EHR) template for primary care staff to screen Veterans at Veterans Affairs (VA) Puget Sound. The template prompts categorization of patients by stability and suspicion for COVID-19, and provides just-in-time triaging advice for clinic staff. Each category is a discrete data element and this information was used by leadership to track screening and testing volumes. We found that a brief, practical EHR note template can be quickly adopted to inform guideline-based screening, direct patient care, and conserve resources.","Deeds, Stefanie A; Hagan, Scott L; Geyer, John R; Vanderwarker, Christopher; Grandjean, Marcus W; Reddy, Ashok; Nelson, Karin M",Healthc (Amst),,413

This study was designed to describe residents' knowledge, attitudes, and practice behaviors (KAP) during the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire was randomly administrated to residents in mainland China between Mar 7 and Mar 16, 2020. Residents' responses to KAP were quantified by descriptive and stratified analyses. A Multiple Logistic Regression model was employed to identify risk factors associated with KAP scores. Results: A total of 10,195 participants were enrolled from 32 provinces of China. Participants of the &#8805;61 years group had higher KAP scores [adjusted Odds Ratio (ORadj) = 4.8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.0-7.7, P < 0.0001], and the married participants and those in low-income families had higher scores of KAP (ORadj = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3; ORadj = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.6-2.2, respectively, both P < 0.0001). The participants living with more than two family members had higher scores in an increasing ORs when the family members increased (ORadj = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6, P = 0.013; ORadj = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6, P = 0.003; ORadj = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0-1.6, P = 0.02; for groups of 2, 3-4 and &#8805;5, respectively). Conclusions: Out of the enrolled participants who completed the survey, 85.5% responded positively toward the mandatory public health interventions implemented nationwide by the Chinese authorities. These effective practices seem to be related to a proper attitude generated by the increased knowledge and better awareness of the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent need for safe and responsible behavior.","Xu, Yuan; Lin, Guofu; Spada, Claudio; Zhao, Huifen; Wang, Shuo; Chen, Xiaoyang; Chen, Yunfeng; Zhang, Yixiang; Marraro, Giuseppe A; Zeng, Xiaohong; Ye, Xiangjia; Zhang, Li; Zeng, Yiming",Front Public Health,,413

Materials and Methods: Lectin-modified macromolecular lipid magnetic spheres were prepared by thin-film hydration method using lentil lectin derivatives (LCA-HQ) and cholesterol as raw materials. Alpha-fetoprotein variants (AFP-L3) in serum from healthy people, liver disease and liver cancer patients were isolated using the prepared lectin-modified macromolecular lipid magnetic spheres, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and AFP-L3 were detected by fully automatic time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. Results: The lectin polymer lipid magnetic sphere prepared in this study was superparamagnetic and encapsulated by a lectin derivative. There was no significant difference in the recovery rate of AFP-L3 between avidin magnetic ball-automatic time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay and manual micro-affinity column method (p>0.05). We found that AFP-L3 can be used as a differential indicator between liver cancer and liver disease. The positive rate of AFP and AFP-L3 in liver cancer patients was higher than that in healthy people and liver disease patients (p<0.001). The AUC (95% CI) of AFP and AFP-L3 were 0.743 ± 0.031 and 0.850 ± 0.024, respectively. AFP-L3 AUC value is greater than AFP; therefore, AFP-L3 distinguishes liver cancer more accurately, and the difference is statistically different, p<0.05. Conclusion: We proposed a novel method for integration of the lectin polymer lipid magnetic spheres and time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay that enables simple, accurate and rapid determination of AFP-L3 in clinical samples. To be noted, fully automatic time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay compared with the commonly used techniques in clinical practice, the measurement procedure is simple and is expected to be used for the detection and accurate diagnosis of liver cancer.","Wang, Kai; Li, Yuzhong; Wang, Xiaowei; Jiao, Jianpeng; Li, Ying; Gu, Wenyue; Liang, Xiaofei",Int J Nanomedicine,,413

We aim to establish a common PANSS factor structure from a large multi-ethnic sample and validate it against a meta-analysis of existing PANSS models. Schizophrenia participants (N = 3511) included in the current study were part of the Singapore Translational and Clinical Research Program (STCRP) and the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials for Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify the factor structure of PANSS and validated with a meta-analysis (N = 16,171) of existing PANSS models. Temporal stability of the PANSS model and generalizability to individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) of psychosis were evaluated. A five-factor solution best fit the PANSS data. These were the i) Positive, ii) Negative, iii) Cognitive/disorganization, iv) Depression/anxiety and v) Hostility factors. Convergence of PANSS symptom architecture between EFA model and meta-analysis was observed. Modest longitudinal reliability was observed. The schizophrenia derived PANSS factor model fit the UHR population, but not vice versa. We found that two other domains, Social Amotivation (SA) and Diminished Expression (DE), were nested within the negative symptoms factor. Here, we report one of the largest transethnic factorial structures of PANSS symptom domains (N = 19,682). Evidence reported here serves as crucial consolidation of a common PANSS structure that could aid in furthering our understanding of schizophrenia.","Lim, Keane; Peh, Oon-Him; Yang, Zixu; Rekhi, Gurpreet; Rapisarda, Attilio; See, Yuen-Mei; Rashid, Nur Amirah Abdul; Ang, Mei-San; Lee, Sara-Ann; Sim, Kang; Huang, Hailiang; Lencz, Todd; Lee, Jimmy; Lam, Max",Asian J Psychiatr,,413

Advanced age appears to be the most important risk factor. The receptor for advanced glycation end-product (RAGE) pathway is considered to play important roles in the physiological aging and pathogenesis of lung diseases. This study aims to investigate the possible relationship between COVID-19 and RAGE pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 23 asymptomatic patients and 35 patients with lung involvement who were diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as 22 healthy volunteers. Lung involvement was determined using computed-tomography. Serum soluble-RAGE (sRAGE) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The sRAGE levels were significantly higher in the asymptomatic group than in the control group. Age, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and ferritin levels were higher and the sRAGE level was lower in the patients with lung involvement than in the asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, patients with high sRAGE levels were younger and had asymptomatic COVID-19. Patients with low sRAGE levels were elderly patients with lung involvement, which indicates that the RAGE pathway plays an important role in the aggravation of COVID-19.","Yalcin Kehribar, Demet; Cihangiroglu, Mustafa; Sehmen, Emine; Avci, Bahattin; Capraz, Aylin; Yildirim Bilgin, Ayse; Gunaydin, Caner; Ozgen, Metin",Biomarkers,,413

Methods: 1028 chest CT image of patients with positive swab were segmented automatically for lung extraction. A Gaussian model developed in Python language was applied to calculate quantitative metrics (QM) describing well-aerated and ill portions of the lungs from the histogram distribution of lung CT numbers in both lungs of each image and in four geometrical subdivision. Furthermore, radiomic features (RF) of first and second order were extracted from bilateral lungs using PyRadiomic tools. QM and RF were used to develop 4 different Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier to discriminate images of patients with COVID (n=646) and non-COVID (n=382) viral pneumonia. Results: The Gaussian model applied to lung CT histogram correctly described healthy parenchyma 94% of the patients. The resulting accuracy of the models for COVID diagnosis were in the range 0.76-0.87, as the integral of the receiver operating curve. The best diagnostic performances were associated to the model based on RF of first and second order, with 21 relevant features after LASSO regression and an accuracy of 0.81$\pm$0.02 after 4-fold cross validation Conclusions: Despite these results were obtained with CT images from a single center, a platform for extracting useful quantitative metrics from CT images was developed and optimized.

This study determined the effect of CHO MR on low-load resistance exercise capacity completed in a fed but glycogen-lowered state. Twelve resistance-trained men (age: 22±4 years; height: 1.79±0.05m; weight: 78.7±7.8kg; bench press 1-RM: 87±21kg; squat 1-RM: 123±19kg) completed two fed-state resistance exercise bouts consisting of 6 sets of bench press and 6 sets of squat to failure at 40% 1-RM. Each bout was preceded by glycogen-depleting cycling the evening before, with feeding controlled to create acute energy deficit and maintain low muscle glycogen. During resistance exercise, participants rinsed with either a 6% CHO MR solution or a taste-matched placebo (PLA) between sets. Total volume workload was greater with CHO MR (9354±2051kg vs. 8525±1911kg, p=0.010). Total number of repetitions of squat were greater with CHO MR (107±26 vs. 92±16, p=0.017); the number of repetitions of bench press were not significantly different (CHO MR: 120±24 vs. PLA: 115±22, p=0.146). This was independent of differences in feeling or arousal. CHO MR may be an effective ergogenic aid for athletes completing resistance exercise when in energy deficit and with low carbohydrate availability. Novelty â¢ CHO MR can increase low-load resistance exercise capacity undertaken in a glycogen-lowered but fed state. â¢ This effect was driven by a greater number of repetitions-to-failure in the squat - using muscles lowered in glycogen content with exhaustive cycling on the evening prior to resistance exercise - but not bench press.","Durkin, Matthew; Akeroyd, Harriet; Holliday, Adrian",Appl. physiol. nutr. metab,,413

474230,Contributions of dermatologists to COVID-19 research: A brief systematic review,2020,"Owing the epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), chest X-ray computed tomography imaging is being used for effectively screening COVID-19 patients. The development of computer-aided systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an advanced open source to rapidly and accurately detect COVID-19 cases because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in number, forms a bottleneck for screening. However, thus far, the vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although realistic and high-risk attacks using universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), a single (input image agnostic) perturbation that can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks, are available. Thus, we focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs. We consider non-targeted UAPs, which cause a task failure, resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs, which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to non-targeted and targeted UAPs, even in the case of small UAPs. In particular, the 2% norm of the UAPs to the average norm of an image in the image dataset achieves >85% and >90% success rates for the non-targeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Owing to the non-targeted UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The targeted UAPs allow the DNN models to classify most chest X-ray images into a specified target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example, we show that iterative fine-tuning of DNN models using UAPs improves the robustness of DNN models against UAPs.","Hirano, Hokuto; Koga, Kazuki; Takemoto, Kazuhiro",PLoS One,,413
474735,Functional outcomes and post-discharge care sought by patients with COVID-19 compared to matched controls after completing inpatient acute rehabilitation,2021,"The pandemic of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented global public health crisis, and most countries in the world are running out of the healthcare resources A fine-grained COVID-19 vulnerability map will be essential to track the number of people with covid-like symptoms, so that the the potential outbreak communities can be identified and the valuable healthcare resources can proactively and dynamically be allocated Mobile crowdsourcing based symptom reporting is a promising and convenient option to construct such a map, while it may compromise the location privacy of crowdsourcing participants In this work, we propose a novel approach to establish the COVID-19 vulnerability map based on the crowdsourced reporting without disclosing the participants' location privacy to a semi-honest crowdsourcing aggregator Briefly, based on the differentially private geo-indistinguishability, the mobile participants are able to locally perturb their geographic data With the masked geographic information, we employ the best linear unbiased prediction estimator with spatial smoothing to obtain the reliable vulnerability estimates in the areas of interest and construct the map Given the fast spreading nature of coronavirus, we integrate the vulnerability estimates with a susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model to build up a future trend map Extensive simulations based on real-world data verify the effectiveness of the proposed method © 2020 IEEE","Chen, R.; Li, L.; Chen, J.

The goal of the present study was to examine the role of vascular smooth muscle membrane Na+-K+-ATPase enzyme activity as well as nitric oxide synthase inhibition on the contractile responses induced by sickle erythrocyte constituents. 2 mm ring segments of rabbit carotid arterial ring preparations were placed in 20 ml organ baths containing physiological salt solution (PSS) bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2, at 37oC and pH 7.4 and isometric contractions recorded, under an initial load of 2g. Arterial rings were exposed to 50 µl of each erythrocyte constituent at an adjusted haematocrit of 0.6. The magnitude of K+-induced relaxation of 10-7 M phenylephrine (PE)-precontracted rings exposed for 30 minutes to K+-free PSS (which inhibits Na+-K+ pump) was estimated in the absence (control) or presence of RBC constituents (ghosts, erythrocytes or haemoglobin solution) from Hb SS subjects. Secondly, the influence of 20-minute exposure of the rings to SS GHOSTS on acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation of 10-7 M PE phenylephrine-precontraction (in the absence or presence of L-NAME) was evaluated. Our results show that K+-induced relaxation was significantly and differentially attenuated by erythrocyte constituents (p<0.05) in the order: SS GHOST > SS HBS > SS RBC. NO synthase inhibition with L-NAME further potentiated the enhanced PE contractions induced by SS GHOSTS and caused a greater attenuation of Ach-induced relaxation (compared with SS GHOSTS alone). The results suggest that SS erythrocyte GHOSTS induce enhancement of vascular smooth muscle tone via impairment of vascular Na+-K+ ATPase enzyme activity as well as attenuate endothelium-dependent relaxation. These functional changes in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial function may contribute to the pathophysiology of vaso-occlusive crisis of sickle cell disease.","Azubuike-Osu, Sharon; Uche, Ogechukwu K; Ajayi, Ifedayo O; Ebeigbe, Anthony B",Niger J Physiol Sci,,413

Technological advances from the past two decades have enabled the rapid expansion of our ability to characterize the human microbiome in depth, highlighting its previously underappreciated role in contributing to multifactorial diseases including those with unknown etiology. Consequently, there is growing evidence that the microbiome could be utilized in medical diagnosis and patient stratification. Moreover, multiple gut microbes and their metabolic products may be bioactive, thereby serving as future potential microbiome-targeting or -associated therapeutics. Such therapies could include new generation probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantations, postbiotics, and dietary modulators. However, microbiome research has also been associated with significant limitations, technical and conceptual challenges, and, at times, ""over-hyped"" expectations that microbiome research will produce quick solutions to chronic and mechanistically complex human disorders. Herein, we summarize these challenges and also discuss some of the realistic promises associated with microbiome research and its applicability into clinical application.","Federici, Sara; Suez, Jotham; Elinav, Eran",Results Probl Cell Differ,,413
478135,Cardiorespiratory Fitness Attenuates the Impact of Risk Factors Associated With COVID-19 Hospitalization,2021,"Hemostasis disorders play an important role in the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and outcome of COVID-19. First of all, the hemostasis system suffers due to a complicated and severe course of COVID-19. A significant number of COVID-19 patients develop signs of hypercoagulability, thrombocytopenia, and hyperfibrinolysis. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a tendency toward thrombotic complications in the venous and arterial systems, which is the leading cause of death in this disease. Despite the success achieved in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the search for new effective anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and fibrinolytics, as well as their optimal dose strategies, continues to be relevant. The wide therapeutic potential of seaweed sulfated polysaccharides (PSs), including anticoagulant, thrombolytic, and fibrinolytic activities, opens up new possibilities for their study in experimental and clinical trials. These natural compounds can be important complementary drugs for the recovery from hemostasis disorders due to their natural origin, safety, and low cost compared to synthetic drugs. In this review, the authors analyze possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the hemostasis disorders observed in the pathological progression of COVID-19, and also focus the attention of researchers on seaweed PSs as potential drugs aimed to correction these disorders in COVID-19 patients. Modern literature data on the anticoagulant, antithrombotic, and fibrinolytic activities of seaweed PSs are presented, depending on their structural features (content and position of sulfate groups on the main chain of PSs, molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and type of glycosidic bonds, the degree of PS chain branching, etc.). The mechanisms of PS action on the hemostasis system and the issues of oral bioavailability of PSs, important for their clinical use as oral anticoagulant and antithrombotic agents, are considered. The combination of the anticoagulant, thrombolytic, and fibrinolytic properties, along with low toxicity and relative cheapness of production, open up prospects for the clinical use of PSs as alternative sources of new anticoagulant and antithrombotic compounds. However, further investigation and clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy.","Kuznetsova, Tatyana A; Andryukov, Boris G; Makarenkova, Ilona D; Zaporozhets, Tatyana S; Besednova, Natalya N; Fedyanina, Ludmila N; Kryzhanovsky, Sergey P; Shchelkanov, Mikhail Yu",Molecules (Basel),,413

478510,Male balding as a major risk factor for severe COVID-19: A possible role for targeting androgens and transmembrane protease serine 2 to protect vulnerable individuals,2020,"Fear, anxiety and even paranoia can proliferate during a pandemic. Such conditions, even when subclinical, tend to be a product of personal and predispositional factors, as well as shared cultural influences, including religious, literary, film, and gaming, all of which can lead to emotional and less than rational responses. They can render people vulnerable to engage in implausible conspiracy theories about the causes of illness and governmental responses to it. They can also lead people to give credence to simplistic and unscientific misrepresentations about medications and devices which are claimed to prevent, treat or cure disease. In turn such vulnerability creates predatory opportunities for the unscrupulous. This article notes the eruption of quackery during the 1889-1892 Russian Flu and the 1918-1920 Spanish Flu and the emergence during 2020 of spurious claims during the COVID-19 pandemic. It identifies consumer protection strategies and interventions formulated during the 2020 pandemic. Using examples from the United States, Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom, it argues that during a pandemic there is a need for three responses by government to the risks posed by conspiracy theories and false representations: calm, scientifically-based messaging from public health authorities; cease and desist warnings directed toward those making extravagant or inappropriate claims; and the taking of assertive and well publicised legal action against individuals and entities that make false representations in order to protect consumers rendered vulnerable by their emotional responses to the phenomenology of the pandemic.","Freckelton Qc, Ian",Int J Law Psychiatry,,413

479630,COVID-19 Disruption in Cardiothoracic Surgical Training: An Opportunity to Enhance Education,2020,"COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first documented in late 2019, but within months, a worldwide pandemic was declared due to the easily transmissible nature of the virus. Research to date on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has focused largely on conventional B and T lymphocytes. This review examines the emerging role of unconventional T cell subsets, including Î³Î´ T cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in human SARS-CoV-2 infection.Some of these T cell subsets have been shown to play protective roles in anti-viral immunity by suppressing viral replication and opsonising virions of SARS-CoV. Here, we explore whether unconventional T cells play a protective role in SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. Unconventional T cells are already under investigation as cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. We discuss the potential use of these cells as therapeutic agents in the COVID-19 setting. Due to the rapidly evolving situation presented by COVID-19, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of this disease and the mechanisms underlying its immune response. Through this, we may be able to better help those with severe cases and lower the mortality rate by devising more effective vaccines and novel treatment strategies.","Orumaa, Kristen; Dunne, Margaret R",Ir. j. med. sci,,413

479836,Postacute Sequelae of COVID-19 Infection and Development of a Physiatry-Led Recovery Clinic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Surgeons in practice have limited opportunities to learn new techniques and procedures. Traditionally, in-person hands-on courses have been the most common means for surgeons to gain exposure to new techniques and procedures. The COVID19 pandemic caused a cessation in these courses and left surgeons with limited opportunities to continue their professional development. Thus, SAGES elected to create an innovative hands-on course that could be completed at home in order to provide surgeons with opportunities to learn new procedures during the pandemic. METHODS: This course was initially planned to be taught as an in-person hands-on course utilizing the Acquisition of Data for Outcomes and Procedure Transfer(ADOPT) method 1. We identified a virtual telementoring platform, Proximie Ltd(London, UK), and a company that could create a model of an abdominal wall in order to perform a Transversus Abdominis Release, KindHeart&#8482;(Chapel Hill, NC, USA). The course consisted of pre-course lectures and videos to be reviewed by participants, a pre-course call to set learning goals, the hands-on telementoring session from home, and monthly webinars for a year. RESULTS: The ADOPT hands-on hernia course at home was successfully completed on October 23rd of 2020. All participants and faculty were successfully able to set up their model and utilize the telementoring platform, but 15% required assistance. Post course-surveys showed that participants felt that the course was successful in meeting their educational goals and felt similar to prior in-person courses. CONCLUSIONS: SAGES was successfully able to transition and in-person hands-on course to a virtual at-home format. This innovative approach to continuing professional development will be necessary during the times of the COVID19 pandemic, but may be a helpful option for rural surgeons and others with travel restrictions in the future to continue their professional development without the need to travel away from their practice.","Greenberg, Jacob A; Schwarz, Erin; Paige, John; Dort, Jonathan; Bachman, Sharon",Surg Endosc,,413

481165,"The 2019 coronavirus: Learning curves, lessons, and the weakest link",2020,"This book is an extraordinarily timely and highly practical book addressing health care professional burnout, its prevention and effective management in the time of COVID- 19. It should be a crucial addition to the library of every medical professional because it provides important advice on how to avoid the secondary stress of being a health professional, its emotional and moral distress. The authors' show that a great deal can be done to counter the harmful effects of secondary stress in medical and nursing practice. It makes use of vignettes, provides instructive tables and personalized self-care protocols that by altering perspectives away from the reflexive ones, health care practitioners can reduce reactivity, anger, moral, and emotional distress. The authors provide techniques for accomplishing this including mindfulness practices that are associated with Buddhism or Christianity as well as making use of humor, participating in a weekend spiritual retreat, engaging with loved ones, exercise, journaling, and many more techniques. Such features as the Secondary Stress Self-Awareness Questionnaire help personalize the material for the reader and make the recommendations all that more useful. This book is written for those who practice medicine (physicians and physician assistants) and those who practice nursing. This second edition is designed to alert those who practice medicine and nursing to the sources, acuity, and chronicity of secondary stress (the pressures experienced in reaching out to others) in the clinical environment;to the context in which secondary stressors are most likely to occur;to environmental conditions that provoke secondary stress;and to ways that strengthen the inner lives and overall health of those in the healing professions. This book is also written for leaders and administrators who can initiate the changes in health care systems needed to manage stress and prevent burnout among direct care clinicians.

Clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood.METHODSPotential convalescent plasma donors with virologically documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for serum IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain and against nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb.RESULTSAmong 250 consecutive persons, including 27 (11%) requiring hospitalization, who were studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 97% were seropositive on 1 or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers &#8805;1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titers included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03 per year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. nAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range 77-120) apart (P < 0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses.CONCLUSIONnAb titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing.

482207,COVID-19 and diabetes: Insulin requirements parallel illness severity in critically unwell patients,2020,"AIMS: This study was aimed to investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) would increase the secretion of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) from injured spinal cord tissue, and, if so, whether the increased NT-3 would promote the survival, differentiation, and migration of grafted tyrosine kinase C (TrkC)-modified mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived neural network cells. We next sought to determine if the latter would integrate with the host spinal cord neural circuit to improve the neurological function of injured spinal cord. METHODS: After NT-3-modified Schwann cells (SCs) and TrkC-modified MSCs were co-cultured in a gelatin sponge scaffold for 14 days, the MSCs differentiated into neuron-like cells that formed a MSC-derived neural network (MN) implant. On this basis, we combined the MN implantation with EA in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI) and performed immunohistochemical staining, neural tracing, electrophysiology, and behavioral testing after 8 weeks. RESULTS: Electroacupuncture application enhanced the production of endogenous NT-3 in damaged spinal cord tissues. The increase in local NT-3 production promoted the survival, migration, and maintenance of the grafted MN, which expressed NT-3 high-affinity TrkC. The combination of MN implantation and EA application improved cortical motor-evoked potential relay and facilitated the locomotor performance of the paralyzed hindlimb compared with those of controls. These results suggest that the MN was better integrated into the host spinal cord neural network after EA treatment compared with control treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Electroacupuncture as an adjuvant therapy for TrkC-modified MSC-derived MN, acted by increasing the local production of NT-3, which accelerated neural network reconstruction and restoration of spinal cord function following SCI.","Yang, Yang; Xu, Hao-Yu; Deng, Qing-Wen; Wu, Guo-Hui; Zeng, Xiang; Jin, Hui; Wang, Lai-Jian; Lai, Bi-Qin; Li, Ge; Ma, Yuan-Huan; Jiang, Bin; Ruan, Jing-Wen; Wang, Ya-Qiong; Ding, Ying; Zeng, Yuan-Shan",CNS neurosc. ther.

As a result, thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is universally recommended for hospitalized patients based on multiple guidelines. However, ethnic differences with respect to thrombogenicity have been reported and the incidence of thromboembolic events is considered to be lower in the Asian population. Despite the importance of thromboprophylaxis, bleeding is also a side effect that should be considered. We examine the data relating to potential ethnic differences in thrombosis and bleeding in COVID-19. Although sufficient data is not yet available, current evidence does not oppose routine anticoagulant use and thromboprophylaxis using a standard dose of LMWH for admitted patients regardless of ethnicity based on our review.","Iba, Toshiaki; Connors, Jean Marie; Spyropoulos, Alex C; Wada, Hideo; Levy, Jerrold H",Int J Hematol,,413

485450,Beau's Lines and Leukonychia in a COVID-19 Patient,2020,"Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPD), a multi-component herbal formula, has been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. However, its active compounds and mechanisms of action are still unknown. Firstly, we divided QFPD into five functional units (FUs) according to the compatibility theory of traditional Chinese medicine. The corresponding common targets of the five FUs were all significantly enriched in Go Ontology (oxidoreductase activity, lipid metabolic process, homeostatic process, etc.), KEGG pathways (steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, etc.), TTD diseases (chronic inflammatory diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary Disease, etc.), miRNA (MIR183), kinase (CDK7) and TF (LXR). QFPD contained 257 specific targets in addition to HCoV, pneumonia and ACE2 co-expression proteins. Then, network topology analysis of the five components-target-pathway-disease networks yielded 67 active ingredients. In addition, ADMET estimations showed that 20 compounds passed the stringent lead-like criteria and in silico drug-likeness test with high gastrointestinal absorption and the median lethal dose (LD50 > 1600 mg/kg). Moreover, 4 specific ingredients (M3, S1, X2 and O2) and 5 common ingredients (MS1, MX16, SX1, WO1 and XO1) of QFPD presented good molecular docking score for 2019-nCov structure and non-structure proteins. Finally, drug perturbation of COVID-19 network robustness showed that all five FUs may protect COVID-19 independently, and target 8 specifically expressed drug-attacked nodes which were related to the bacterial and viral responses, immune system, signaling transduction, etc. In conclusion, our new FUNP analysis showed that QFPD had a protection effect on COVID-19 by regulating a complex molecular network with safety and efficacy. Part of the mechanism was associated with the regulation of anti-viral, anti-inflammatory activity and metabolic programming.","Chen, Jian; Wang, Yong-Kui; Gao, Yuan; Hu, Ling-San; Yang, Jiang-Wei; Wang, Jian-Ru; Sun, Wen-Jie; Liang, Zhi-Qiang; Cao, Ye-Min; Cao, Yong-Bing",Biomed Pharmacother,,413

We investigate the asymmetrical interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics, each occurring on its own layer, by focusing on the two fundamental quantities underlying any spreading process: epidemic threshold and the final infection ratio. We find that an epidemic outbreak on the contact layer can induce an outbreak on the communication layer, and information spreading can effectively raise the epidemic threshold. When structural correlation exists between the two layers, the information threshold remains unchanged but the epidemic threshold can be enhanced, making the contact layer more resilient to epidemic outbreak. We develop a physical theory to understand the intricate interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics.","Wang, Wei; Tang, Ming; Yang, Hui; Do, Younghae; Lai, Ying-Cheng; Lee, GyuWon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.1905v1.pdf,413

This paper reports on a cross-national comparison of four countries (Norway, UK, USA and Australia) and examines the differences in mental health between those individuals employed and those not employed during the social distancing implementation. Methods: Participants (N = 3,810) were recruited through social media in April/May 2020 and were invited to complete a self-administered electronic survey over a 3-week period. Differences between those employed and those not employed with regard to their sociodemographic characteristics and mental health were investigated with chi-square tests, independent t tests, and one-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs). Results: Compared with their counterparts, participants who were employed reported lower levels of mental health distress (p < 0.001), higher levels of psychosocial well-being (p < 0.001), better overall quality of life (p < 0.001), and lower levels of overall loneliness, social loneliness, and emotional loneliness (p < 0.001). Small to medium but consistent differences (Cohen's d = 0.23-0.67) in mental health favor those with employment or those who were retired. Conclusion: Further study is needed to assess mental health over time as the COVID-19 pandemic and employment uncertainty continues.","Ruffolo, Mary; Price, Daicia; Schoultz, Mariyana; Leung, Janni; Bonsaksen, Tore; Thygesen, Hilde; Geirdal, Amy Østertun",Glob Soc Welf,,413
485689,Increasing emergency department utilization of brain imaging in patients with primary brain cancer,2020,"BACKGROUND: There has been a longstanding debate about the role of folate in the etiology of orofacial clefts (OFCs). Studies of different measures of nutritional intake or folate status have been done to investigate the possible role of folate in the prevention of OFC. Only one knowledge synthesis has attempted to bring together different types of evidence. The aim of the present work was to update it. METHODS: Evidence for associations between OFC and dietary folate, supplement use, folic acid fortification, biomarkers of folate status, and variants of MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) were included. Potentially eligible articles were systematically identified from PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science (2007-2020) and combined using random-effects meta-analysis when appropriate. Quality assessments were conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Cochrane's risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Sixty-four studies published since the previous knowledge synthesis were identified, with eight of these identified through a supplementary search from October, 2018 to August, 2020. There was an inverse association between folic acid-containing supplement use before or during pregnancy and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.51-0.69), with considerable between-study heterogeneity. The prevalence of CL/P showed a small decline post-folic acid fortification in seven studies (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.02). No association was found between OFC and genetic markers of folate status. The coronavirus-19 pandemic has threatened food availability globally and therefore there is a need to maintain and even enhance surveillance concerning maternal intake of folate and related vitamins. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of non-syndromic OFC was reduced among pregnant women with folic acid-containing supplements during the etiologically relevant period. However, high heterogeneity between included studies, incomplete reporting of population characteristics and variation in timing of exposure and supplement types mean that conclusions should be drawn with caution.","Zhou, Yulai; Sinnathamby, Vigigah; Yu, Yamei; Sikora, Lindsey; Johnson, Candice Y; Mossey, Peter; Little, Julian",Birth Defects Res,,413

The association between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system has been well described. We sought to systematically review the current published literature on the different cardiac manifestations and the use of cardiac-specific biomarkers in terms of their prognostic value in determining clinical outcomes and correlation to disease severity. METHODS: A systematic literature review across PubMed, Cochrane database, Embase, Google Scholar, and Ovid was performed according to PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant articles that discussed risk factors for cardiovascular manifestations, cardiac manifestations in COVID-19 patients, and cardiac-specific biomarkers with their clinical implications on COVID-19. RESULTS: Sixty-one relevant articles were identified which described risk factors for cardiovascular manifestations, cardiac manifestations (including heart failure, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmia, and myocarditis among others) and cardiac-specific biomarkers (including CK-MB, CK, myoglobin, troponin, and NT-proBNP). Cardiovascular risk factors can play a crucial role in identifying patients vulnerable to developing cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 and thus help to save lives. A wide array of cardiac manifestations is associated with the interaction between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. Cardiac-specific biomarkers provide a useful prognostic tool in helping identify patients with the severe disease early and allowing for escalation of treatment in a timely fashion. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is an evolving pandemic with predominate respiratory manifestations, however, due to the interaction with the cardiovascular system; cardiac manifestations/complications feature heavily in this disease, with cardiac biomarkers providing important prognostic information.","Shafi, Ahmed M A; Shaikh, Safwan A; Shirke, Manasi M; Iddawela, Sashini; Harky, Amer",J Card Surg,,413

It also assessed the impact of social distancing on pathologies presenting to ENT and reviewed the usefulness of telephone consultations in semi-urgent presentations. METHOD: A retrospective review was conducted of 97 instances of patient care carried out in the rapid access ENT clinic at a large district general hospital. RESULTS: Otitis externa and foreign bodies represented 25 per cent and 13 per cent of consultations respectively. Tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess were uncommon, representing 6 per cent of total consultations. Telephone appointments represented only 28 per cent of total consultations; however, they appeared to reduce the number of physical appointments required. CONCLUSION: Otitis externa and foreign bodies continue to be common during the pandemic. Social distancing measures reduced the number of tonsillitis and quinsy presentations. Telephone consultations are effective for certain urgent presentations to ENT, most noticeably nasal trauma and follow up of non-serious pathologies.","Stubington, T J; Morrison, B; Sevilla, C; Judd, O",J Laryngol Otol,,413

We present two computational-experimental approaches aimed at analyzing a potential link between heme-related and COVID-19 pathophysiologies. Herein, we performed a detailed analysis of the common pathways induced by heme and SARS-CoV-2 by superimposition of knowledge graphs covering heme biology and COVID-19 pathophysiology. Focus was laid on inflammatory pathways and distinct biomarkers as the linking elements. In a second approach, four COVID-19-related proteins, the host cell proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as well as the viral proteins 7a and S protein were computationally analyzed as potential heme-binding proteins with an experimental validation. The results contribute to the understanding of the progression of COVID-19 infections in patients with different clinical backgrounds and may allow for a more individual diagnosis and therapy in the future.","Hopp, Marie-Thérèse; Domingo-Fernández, Daniel; Gadiya, Yojana; Detzel, Milena S; Graf, Regina; Schmalohr, Benjamin F; Kodamullil, Alpha T; Imhof, Diana; Hofmann-Apitius, Martin",Biomolecules,,413
488618,Modified tracheal extubation for patients with COVID-19,2020,"A review of the data on the modulatory action of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), the main co-transmitter with acetylcholine, and adenosine, the final ATP metabolite in the synaptic cleft, on neuromuscular transmission is presented. The effects of these endogenous modulators on pre- and post-synaptic processes are discussed. The contribution of purines to the processes of quantal and non-quantal secretion of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, as well as the influence of the postsynaptic effects of ATP and adenosine on the functioning of cholinergic receptors, are evaluated. As usual, the P2-receptor-mediated influence is minimal under physiological conditions, but it becomes very important in some pathophysiological situations such as hypothermia, stress, or ischemia. There are some data demonstrating the same in neuromuscular transmission. It is suggested that the role of endogenous purines is primarily to provide a safety factor for the efficiency of cholinergic neuromuscular transmission.","Ziganshin, Ayrat U; Khairullin, Adel E; Hoyle, Charles H V; Grishin, Sergey N",,,413
488619,Modified tracheal extubation for patients with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND Up to 47% of pregnant women with COVID-19 have preterm deliveries. A severe, symptomatic COVID-19 infection in close-to-term pregnancies can have a poor prognosis. Early identification of COVID-19 in pregnant women can prevent the progression of the disease. Currently, there is very little guidance on treating pregnant close-to-term women with COVID-19; this case report suggests changes to current management to maximize positive maternal and fetal outcomes. CASE REPORT A pregnant woman (37 weeks of gestation) presented to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of fever with an associated cough for 2 days. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Emergency Department, and discharged in a stable condition. She returned 5 days later in preterm labor with severe respiratory distress. After an emergency cesarean section, she remained intubated in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit; she was persistently hypotensive and hypoxic despite maximal ventilator and medical treatment. She died after a cardiac arrest and unsuccessful resuscitation, 15 days after the delivery. We discuss the possible benefit of a planned C-section for close-to-term pregnancies prior to the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The patient's next of kin gave informed consent for this case report. Approval from the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Review Board was not required as this is a case report. CONCLUSIONS Currently, asymptomatic pregnant women are not tested for COVID-19 infection until hospitalization for delivery. It could be beneficial to have a protocol in place to screen asymptomatic pregnant women so they can be identified early and monitored, as COVID-19 symptoms can escalate quickly.","Patel, Priya; Kulkarni, Sayali; Guerrero, Manrique; Persaud, Clive; Zuberi, Jamshed; Rebein, Benjamin",Am J Case Rep,,413

People's responses to COVID-19 range from asymptomatic to severe, and the disease is sometimes fatal. Its severity is affected by different factors and comorbidities of the infected patients. Living at a high altitude could be another factor that affects the severity of the disease in infected patients. Methods: In the present study, we have analyzed the clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings of COVID-19-infected patients in Taif, a high-altitude region of Saudi Arabia. In addition, we compared matched diseased subjects to those living at sea level. We hypothesized that people living in high-altitude locations are prone to develop a more severe form of COVID-19 than those living at sea level. Results: Age and a high Charlson comorbidity score were associated with increased numbers of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality among COVID-19 patients. These ICU admissions and fatalities were found mainly in patients with comorbidities. Rates of leukocytosis, neutrophilia, higher D-dimer, ferritin, and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in ICU patients. CRP was the most independent of the laboratory biomarkers found to be potential predictors of death. COVID-19 patients who live at higher altitude developed a less severe form of the disease and had a lower mortality rate, in comparison to matched subjects living at sea level. Conclusion: CRP and Charlson comorbidity scores can be considered predictive of disease severity. People living at higher altitudes developed less severe forms of COVID-19 disease than those living at sea level, due to a not-yet-known mechanism.","Abdelsalam, M.; Althaqafi, R. M. M.; Assiri, S.

In fact, today more than ever, people favor the use of passenger vehicles over public transport to avoid contact with coronavirus. Carbon savings made across the sectors during the global lockdown to control the spread of the novel COVID-19 virus are therefore at a great threat. This necessitates the need for sustainable transition to an ultra-low carbon transportation system. Although, electric vehicles enablement continues to aid with transition, the sustainability of the fuel poses greater risks for pollution shifting.

Studies showed that the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms increased in these conditions. This systematic-review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence of PTSD related symptoms in coronavirus outbreaks. METHODS: Systematic search of literature was conducted in Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science. Google Scholar and Grey literature including conference proceedings were also checked. Published articles from November 1, 2012 until May 18, 2020 were searched. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were also conducted to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: We found 38 articles with 19,428 individuals met the eligibility criteria. Of these papers, 35 studies were included in meta-analysis. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was estimated to be about 18% (95%CI: 15% to 20%). These symptoms were more frequent in cohort studies (29%) compared to cross-sectional (15%) and case-control (11%) studies. Prevalence rates of PTSD symptoms in MERS (36%) outbreaks were higher than SARS (18%) and COVID-19 (9%) outbreaks. Meta-regression showed that the geographical location of study was the source of heterogeneity (R2: 19.8%, P-value: 0.003). Meta-analysis reported that about three in every ten survivors of coronavirus infection, about two in every ten healthcare workers, and about one in every ten individuals of general population experienced PTSD symptoms in outbreaks. LIMITATIONS: PTSD cannot be objectively assessed and this can lead to information bias of included studies. CONCLUSION: PTSD symptoms are shown to be common in coronavirus outbreaks. Mental care should be, therefore, considered in the present COVID-19 pandemic.","Salehi, Mona; Amanat, Man; Mohammadi, Mohammadreza; Salmanian, Maryam; Rezaei, Nima; Saghazadeh, Amene; Garakani, Amir",J Affect Disord,,413
496541,The consequences of COVID-19 outbreak on outpatient rehabilitation services: a single-centre experience in Slovenia,2021,"Public health policies to contain the spread of COVID-19 rely mainly on non-pharmacological measures. Those measures, especially social distancing, are a challenge for developing countries, such as Brazil. In São Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil (45 million inhabitants), most COVID-19 cases up to April 18th were reported in the Capital and metropolitan area. However, the inner municipalities, where 20 million people live, are also at risk. As governmental authorities discuss the loosening of measures for restricting population mobility, it is urgent to analyze the routes of dispersion of COVID-19 in São Paulo territory. We hypothesize that urban hierarchy is the main responsible for the disease spreading, and we identify the hotspots and the main routes of virus movement from the metropolis to the inner state. In this ecological study, we use geographic models of population mobility to check for patterns for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identify two patterns based on surveillance data: one by contiguous diffusion from the capital metropolitan area, and the other hierarchical with long-distance spread through major highways that connects São Paulo city with cities of regional relevance. This knowledge can provide real-time responses to support public health strategies, optimizing the use of resources in order to minimize disease impact on population and economy.","Fortaleza, Carlos Magno Castelo Branco; Guimarães, Raul Borges; Catão, Rafael de Castro; Ferreira, Cláudia Pio; Berg de Almeida, Gabriel; Nogueira Vilches, Thomas; Pugliesi, Edmur",PLoS One,,413

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the lockdown on eating habits and lifestyle behaviors among residents of the UAE. A cross-sectional study among adults in the UAE was conducted using an online questionnaire between April and May 2020. A total of 1012 subjects participated in the study. During the pandemic, 31% reported weight gain and 72.2% had less than eight cups of water per day. Furthermore, the dietary habits of the participants were distanced from the Mediterranean diet principles and closer to ""unhealthy"" dietary patterns. Moreover, 38.5% did not engage in physical activity and 36.2% spent over five hours per day on screens for entertainment. A significantly higher percentage of participants reported physical exhaustion, emotional exhaustion, irritability, and tension ""all the time"" during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic (p < 0.001). Sleep disturbances were prevalent among 60.8% of the participants during the pandemic.

500806,Percutaneous and Open Tracheostomy in Patients with COVID-19: Comparison and Outcomes of an Institutional Series in New York City,2020,"Epidemic models are being used by governments to inform public health strategies to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. They simulate potential scenarios by manipulating model parameters that control processes of disease transmission and recovery. However, the validity of these parameters is challenged by the uncertainty of the impact of public health interventions on disease transmission, and the forecasting accuracy of these models is rarely investigated during an outbreak. We fitted a stochastic transmission model on reported cases, recoveries and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection across 101 countries. The dynamics of disease transmission was represented in terms of the daily effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]). The relationship between public health interventions and [Formula: see text] was explored, firstly using a hierarchical clustering algorithm on initial [Formula: see text] patterns, and secondly computing the time-lagged cross correlation among the daily number of policies implemented, [Formula: see text], and daily incidence counts in subsequent months. The impact of updating [Formula: see text] every time a prediction is made on the forecasting accuracy of the model was investigated. We identified 5 groups of countries with distinct transmission patterns during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Early adoption of social distancing measures and a shorter gap between interventions were associated with a reduction on the duration of outbreaks. The lagged correlation analysis revealed that increased policy volume was associated with lower future [Formula: see text] (75 days lag), while a lower [Formula: see text] was associated with lower future policy volume (102 days lag). Lastly, the outbreak prediction accuracy of the model using dynamically updated [Formula: see text] produced an average AUROC of 0.72 (0.708, 0.723) compared to 0.56 (0.555, 0.568) when [Formula: see text] was kept constant. Monitoring the evolution of [Formula: see text] during an epidemic is an important complementary piece of information to reported daily counts, recoveries and deaths, since it provides an early signal of the efficacy of containment measures. Using updated [Formula: see text] values produces significantly better predictions of future outbreaks. Our results found variation in the effect of early public health interventions on the evolution of [Formula: see text] over time and across countries, which could not be explained solely by the timing and number of the adopted interventions.","Zhu, Jie; Gallego, Blanca",Sci Rep,,413

The fundamental effect appears when two independent and indistinguishable photons are superimposed on a beam splitter, which achieves a complete suppression of coincidences between the two output ports. Much less studied, however, is when the fields share coherence (continuous-wave lasers) or mode envelope properties (pulsed lasers). In this case, we expect the existence of two distinct and concurrent HOM interference regimes: the traditional HOM dip on the coherence length time scale, and a structured HOM interference pattern on the pulse length scale. We develop a theoretical framework that describes HOM interference for laser fields having arbitrary temporal waveforms and only partial overlap in time. We observe structured HOM interference from a continuous-wave laser via fast polarization modulation and time-resolved single photon detection fast enough to resolve these structured HOM dips.","Agne, Sascha; Jin, Jeongwan; Kuntz, Katanya B.; Miatto, Filippo M.; Bourgoin, Jean-Philippe; Jennewein, Thomas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11259v1.pdf,413

To date, there has been no examination of trust in the WHO. Yet the global nature of the pandemic necessitates expanding our scholarship to international health organizations. We test the effects of partisanship, ideology, the cooperative internationalist foreign policy orientation, and nationalism on trust in the WHO and subsequently examine how this trust relates to preventive health behavior. Methods: Multivariate analysis of original survey data from a representative sample of Americans. Results: Democrats, liberals, and those with a strong cooperative internationalist foreign policy orientation are more likely to trust the WHO's competence and integrity in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic while Republicans, conservatives, and nationalists are less likely. Even though trust in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has the largest impact on preventive health behaviors, trust in the competence of the WHO is also an important factor. These results remain robust after controlling for other covariates. Conclusion: Pandemic politics in the United States is polarized along party and ideological lines. However, our results show that a fuller understanding Americans' political trust and health behaviors during COVID-19 requires taking the international dimensions of the pandemic seriously.","Bayram, A Burcu; Shields, Todd",Social science quarterly,,413

In addition to causing serious respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and lung failure, there have been conflicting reports about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the semen of patients who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 and possible implications for the male reproductive tract. OBJECTIVE: The goal for the present study was to review the current status of the literature concerning COVID-19 and male reproduction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic literature search was done by using PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Relevant papers, concerning SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19 and male reproduction, published between January 2020 and December 2020 were selected, analyzed and eventually included in the present literature review. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 may infect any cell type expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), including reproductive cells. Besides the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the expression of host proteases, such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), is needed to cleave the viral S protein, allowing permanent fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Here, we aimed to review the current status of the literature concerning COVID-19 and male reproduction. The lack of co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the testis suggests that sperm cells may not be at increased risk of viral entry and spread. However, the presence of orchitis in COVID-19-confirmed patients and compromised sex-related hormonal balance among these patients intrigues reproductive medicine. DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 may use alternate receptors to enter certain cell types, or the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may not be detected in healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 challenges all medical areas, including reproductive medicine. It is not yet clear what effects, if any, the COVID-19 pandemic will have on male reproduction. Further research is needed to understand the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function.","Borges, Edson; Setti, Amanda Souza; Iaconelli, Assumpto; Braga, Daniela Paes de Almeida Ferreira",Andrology,,413

A convolutional neural network classifier is first trained on 553 sequences from the National Genomics Data Center repository, separating the genome of different virus strains from the Coronavirus family with 98.73% accuracy. The network's behavior is then analyzed, to discover sequences used by the model to identify SARS-CoV-2, ultimately uncovering sequences exclusive to it. The discovered sequences are validated on samples from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data repositories, and are proven to be able to separate SARS-CoV-2 from different virus strains with near-perfect accuracy. Next, one of the sequences is selected to generate a primer set, and tested against other state-of-the-art primer sets, obtaining competitive results. Finally, the primer is synthesized and tested on patient samples (n = 6 previously tested positive), delivering a sensitivity similar to routine diagnostic methods, and 100% specificity. The proposed methodology has a substantial added value over existing methods, as it is able to both automatically identify promising primer sets for a virus from a limited amount of data, and deliver effective results in a minimal amount of time. Considering the possibility of future pandemics, these characteristics are invaluable to promptly create specific detection methods for diagnostics.","Lopez-Rincon, Alejandro; Tonda, Alberto; Mendoza-Maldonado, Lucero; Mulders, Daphne G J C; Molenkamp, Richard; Perez-Romero, Carmina A; Claassen, Eric; Garssen, Johan; Kraneveld, Aletta D",Sci Rep,,413

We sought to determine the age-specific rates of COVID-19 mortality at the population level. METHODS: We obtained information regarding the total number of COVID-19 reported deaths for six consecutive weeks beginning at the 50th recorded death, among 16 countries that reported a relatively high number of COVID-19 cases as of April 12, 2020. We performed an ecological study to model COVID-19 mortality rates per week by age group (54 years or younger, 55-64 years, and 65 years or older) and sex using a Poisson mixed effects regression model. RESULTS: Over the six-week period of data, there were 178,568 COVID-19 deaths from a total population of approximately 2.4 billion people. Age and sex were associated with COVID-19 mortality. Compared with individuals ages 54 years or younger, the incident rate ratio (IRR) was 8.1, indicating that the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 8.1 times higher (95%CI = 7.7, 8.5) among those 55 to 64 years, and more than 62 times higher (IRR = 62.1; 95%CI = 59.7, 64.7) among those ages 65 or older. Mortality rates from COVID-19 were 77% higher in men than in women (IRR = 1.77, 95%CI = 1.74, 1.79). CONCLUSIONS: In the 16 countries examined, persons age 65 years or older had strikingly higher COVID-19 mortality rates compared to younger individuals, and men had a higher risk of COVID-19 death than women.","Yanez, N David; Weiss, Noel S; Romand, Jacques-André; Treggiari, Miriam M",BMC Public Health,,413

Many synthetic compounds and FDA-approved drugs have been significantly inhibitory against the virus, but no SARS-CoV-2 solution has been identified. However, small molecule fragment-based derivatives of potent phytocompounds may serve as promising inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. In the pursuit of exploring novel SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, we generated small molecule fragment derivatives from potent phytocompounds using neural networking and machine learning-based tools, which can cover unexplored regions of the chemical space that still retain lead-like properties. Out of 300 derivative molecules from withaferin-A, hesperidin, and baicalin, 30 were screened out with synthetic accessibility scores > 4 having the best ADME properties. The withaferin-A derivative molecules 61 and 64 exhibited a significant binding affinity of - 7.84 kcal/mol and - 7.94 kcal/mol. The docking study reveals that withaferin-A mol 61 forms 5 polar H-bonds with the Mpro where amino acids involved are GLU166, THR190, CYS145, MET165, and GLN152 and upon QSAR analysis showed a minimal predicted IC50 value of 7762.47 nM. Furthermore, the in silico cytotoxicity predictions, pharmacophore modeling, and molecular dynamics simulation studies have resulted in predicting the highly potent small molecule derivative from withaferin-A (phytocompound from Withania somnifera) to be the potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV 2 protease (Mpro) and a promising future lead candidate against COVID-19. The rationale of choosing withaferin-A from Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) was propelled by the innumerous applications of Ashwagandha for the treatment of various antiviral diseases, common cold, and fever since time immemorial.

517297,"Reply: Comment on ""From Air Pollution to the Anthropocene and Planetary Health. Implications for Clinicians, Researchers, and Society""",2020,"Around the end of December 2019, a new beta-coronavirus from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China began to spread rapidly. The new virus, called SARS-CoV-2, which could be transmitted through respiratory droplets, had a range of mild to severe symptoms, from simple cold in some cases to death in others. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19 by WHO and has so far killed more people than SARS and MERS. Following the widespread global outbreak of COVID-19, with more than 132758 confirmed cases and 4955 deaths worldwide, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic disease in January 2020. Earlier studies on viral pneumonia epidemics has shown that pregnant women are at greater risk than others. During pregnancy, the pregnant woman is more prone to infectious diseases. Research on both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are pathologically similar to SARS-CoV-2, has shown that being infected with these viruses during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal death, stillbirth, intrauterine growth retardation and, preterm delivery. With the exponential increase in cases of COVID-19 throughout the world, there is a need to understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the health of pregnant women, through extrapolation of earlier studies that have been conducted on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. There is an urgent need to understand the chance of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus and the possibility of the virus crossing the placental barrier. Additionally, since some viral diseases and antiviral drugs may have a negative impact on the mother and fetus, in which case, pregnant women need special attention for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.","Fathi, Mobina; Vakili, Kimia; Deravi, Niloofar; Yaghoobpoor, Shirin; Ahsan, Elahe; Mokhtari, Melika; Moshfeghi, Maryam; Vaezjalali, Maryam",Przegl Epidemiol,,413

518406,Maternal outcomes based on asymptomatic versus symptomatic COVID-19 disease in the DC region,2021,"BACKGROUND: Information pertaining to the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa remains sparse. In Nigeria, it is limited to few isolated reports and case series confined to the early phase of the outbreak. The objective of this study is to describe the presenting characteristics, co-morbidities and outcomes of Nigerian patients managed over a 3-month period in a tertiary hospital. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving the total population of patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Nigeria from March 31 to June 30, 2020. Data was collected using a review of patients' records. Analysis was by IBM SPSS version 25.0. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients with mean age (SD) 50.7± 20.1 years were managed. One hundred and five (60.7%) were males and the commonest age group was 20-39 years (34.7%). The commonest presenting symptoms were fever, cough and malaise found in 103 (71.5%), 101 (70.1%) and 63 (43.8%) patients respectively. Twenty-five (14.5%) patients had severe disease; 60 (34.7%) had underlying medical conditions mostly hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Outcome analyses showed 117 (67.6%) discharges, 45 (26.0%) deaths, 10 (5.8%) discharges against medical advice, and 1 (0.6%) transfer to another facility. Male sex (p=0.044), increasing age (p<0.001), presence of symptoms (p=0.010), presence of co-morbidities (p=0.010) and non-healthcare worker status (p< 0.001) were significantly associated with mortality.

518407,669 Maternal outcomes based on asymptomatic versus symptomatic COVID-19 disease in the DC region,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a systemic entity that frequently implies neurologic features at presentation and complications during the disease course. We aimed to describe the characteristics and predictors for developing in-hospital neurologic manifestations in a large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Mexico City. METHODS: We analyzed records from consecutive adult patients hospitalized from March 15 to June 30, 2020, with moderate to severe COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Neurologic syndromes were actively searched by a standardized structured questionnaire and physical examination, confirmed by neuroimaging, neurophysiology of laboratory analyses, as applicable. RESULTS: We studied 1,072 cases (65% men, mean age 53.2±13 years), 71 patients had pre-existing neurologic diseases (diabetic neuropathy: 17, epilepsy: 15, history of ischemic stroke: eight, migraine: six, multiple sclerosis: one, Parkinson disease: one), and 163 (15.2%) developed a new neurologic complication. Headache (41.7%), myalgia (38.5%), dysgeusia (8%), and anosmia (7%) were the most common neurologic symptoms at hospital presentation. Delirium (13.1%), objective limb weakness (5.1%), and delayed recovery of mental status after sedation withdrawal (2.5%), were the most common new neurologic syndromes. Age, headache at presentation, preexisting neurologic disease, invasive mechanical ventilation, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio &#8805;9 were independent predictors of new in-hospital neurologic complications. CONCLUSIONS: Even after excluding initial clinical features and pre-existing comorbidities, new neurologic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are frequent and can be predicted from clinical information at hospital admission.","Flores-Silva, Fernando Daniel; García-Grimshaw, Miguel; Valdés-Ferrer, Sergio Iván; Vigueras-Hernández, Alma Poema; Domínguez-Moreno, Rogelio; Tristán-Samaniego, Dioselina Panamá; Michel-Chávez, Anaclara; González-Duarte, Alejandra; Vega-Boada, Felipe A; Reyes-Melo, Isael; Jiménez-Ruiz, Amado; Chávez-Martínez, Oswaldo Alan; Rebolledo-García, Daniel; Marché-Fernández, Osvaldo Alexis; Sánchez-Torres, Samantha; García-Ramos, Guillermo; Cantú-Brito, Carlos; Chiquete, Erwin",PLoS One,,413

The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted among five patients with COVID-19. Peripheral inflammatory markers were also collected in patients, both at baseline and within ± three days of completing the on-line survey. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P < 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of ""Perceived Helplessness"", the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = 0.37, P = 0.003, Spearman's correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.","Guo, Qian; Zheng, Yuchen; Shi, Jia; Wang, Jijun; Li, Guanjun; Li, Chunbo; Fromson, John A; Xu, Yong; Liu, Xiaohua; Xu, Hua; Zhang, Tianhong; Lu, Yunfei; Chen, Xiaorong; Hu, Hao; Tang, Yingying; Yang, Shuwen; Zhou, Han; Wang, Xiaoliang; Chen, Haiying; Wang, Zhen; Yang, Zongguo",Brain behav. immun,,413

519536,Delirium and Adverse Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on health care systems and economies around the globe. Clinical evidences demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection produces detrimental levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and significant systemic organ damage. Currently, there is no definitive therapy for COVID-19 or associated complications, and with the hope of a safe and effective vaccine in the distant future, the search for an answer is paramount. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide a viable option due to their immunomodulatory effects and tissue repair and regeneration abilities. Studies have demonstrated that compassionate use of MSCs can reduce symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminate fluid buildup, and act as a regenerative technique for alveolar damage; all in a safe and effective way. With multiple autologous sources available for MSCs, each with their own respective limitations, allogenic umbilical cord (UC) and/or UC-derived Wharton's jelly (WJ) seem to be best positioned source to harvest MSCs to treat COVID-19 and associated symptoms. As an allogenic source, UC is readily available, easily obtainable, and is rich in immunomodulatory and regenerative factors. In this manuscript, we reviewed the current evidences and explored the potential therapeutic use of allogenic UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. Although, preliminary preclinical and clinical studies indicate that their use is safe and potentially effective, more multi-center, randomized, controlled trials are needed to adequately assess the safety and efficacy of UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19.","Rodriguez, Hugo C; Gupta, Manu; Cavazos-Escobar, Emilio; El-Amin, Saadiq F; Gupta, Ashim",Hum. cell,,413

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, is the etiologic agent responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. The productive SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on the virus entry into cells expressing the Angiotensin-Converting enzyme 2, ACE2. Indeed, viral entry into cells is mostly mediated by the early interaction between the viral spike protein, S, and its ACE2 receptor. The S/ACE2 complex is, thus, the first contact point between the incoming virus and its cellular target and it has been consequently considered an attractive therapeutic target. In order to characterize further this interaction and the cellular processes engaged in the entry step of the viruswehave set up various in silico, in vitro and in cellula systems allowing to specifically monitor the S/ACE2 association based on the expertise of our team in virus/host interactions. We perform computational modelization of the SARS-CoV-2 S/ACE2 complex as well as its biochemical and biophysic monitoring using pull down, alphaLISA and bilayer interferometry (BLI). This led us to determine the kinetic parameters of the S/ACE2 association and dissociation steps. In parallel to these in vitro approaches we developed in cellula transduction assays using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral vector and HEK293TACE2cell lines generated in collaboration with theVect'UB platform. This led us to recapitulate the early replication stage of the infection mediated by S/ACE2 interaction as well as to detect cell fusion induced by the interaction. Finally, a cell imaging system has been setup to directly monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in a cellular context and a flux cytometry assay has been developed to quantify this association at the surface of the cells. All these different approaches are now available for both fundamental and therapeutic purpose aiming to characterize the entry step of the initial SARS-CoV-2 strain and its variants. They could also be used for investigating the possible chemical modulation of this interaction and, thus, identifying newantiviral agent as well as newchemical tools for dissecting this entry step.","Lapaillerie, D.; Charlier, C.; Souza, S.; Lesbats, P.; Weigel, P.; Favereaux, A.; Guyonnet-Dupérat, V.; Parissi, V.",Virologie,,413
519979,COVID-19 Infection in an Immunosuppressed Patient with Arthritis,2020,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses an enormous challenge to the medical system, especially the lack of safe and effective COVID-19 treatment methods, forcing people to look for drugs that may have therapeutic effects as soon as possible. Some old drugs have shown clinical benefits after a few small clinical trials that attracted great attention. Clinically, however, many drugs, including those currently used in COVID-19, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir, may cause cardiotoxicity by acting on cardiac potassium channels, especially hERG channel through their off-target effects. The blocking of the hERG channel prolongs QT intervals on electrocardiograms; thus, it might induce severe ventricular arrhythmias and even sudden cardiac death. Therefore, while focusing on the efficacy of COVID-19 drugs, the fact that they block hERG channels to cause arrhythmias cannot be ignored. To develop safer and more effective drugs, it is necessary to understand the interactions between drugs and the hERG channel and the molecular mechanism behind this high affinity. In this review, we focus on the biochemical and molecular mechanistic aspects of drug-related blockade of the hERG channel to provide insights into QT prolongation caused by off-label use of related drugs in COVID-19, and hope to weigh the risks and benefits when using these drugs.","Zequn, Zheng; Yujia, Wu; Dingding, Qian; Jiangfang, Lian",Eur J Pharmacol,,413

A UK observational cohort study and trials registry analysis,2020,"The importance of vaccination and the logistics involved in the procurement, storage and distribution of vaccines across their cold chain has come to the forefront during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we present a decision support framework for optimizing multiple aspects of vaccine distribution across a multi-tier cold chain network. We propose two multi-period optimization formulations within this framework: first to minimize inventory, ordering, transportation, personnel and shortage costs associated with a single vaccine; the second being an extension of the first for the case when multiple vaccines with differing efficacies and costs are available for the same disease. Vaccine transportation and administration lead times are also incorporated within the models. We use the case of the Indian state of Bihar and COVID-19 vaccines to illustrate the implementation of the framework. We present computational experiments to demonstrate: (a) the organization of the model outputs; (b) how the models can be used to assess the impact of storage capacities (at the cold chain points, transportation vehicle capacities) and manufacturer capacities on the optimal vaccine distribution pattern; and (c) the impact of vaccine efficacies and associated costs such as ordering and transportation costs on the vaccine selection decision informed by the model. We then consider the computational expense of the framework for realistic problem instances, and suggest multiple preprocessing techniques to reduce their computational burden. Our study presents public health authorities and other stakeholders with a vaccine distribution and capacity planning tool for multi-tier cold chain networks.","Sripada, Shanmukhi; Jain, Ayush; Ramamoorthy, Prasanna; Ramamohan, Varun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04204v2.pdf,413

We carried out a cross-sectional survey of the knowledge, behaviors related to COVID-19, and mental health in a probability sample of 3001 community residents in 30 provinces or districts across China from February 16–23, 2020. Convenience sampling and a snowball sampling were adopted. We used General Anxiety Disorder (GAD), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and knowledge and behaviors questionnaire of community residents regarding COVID-19 designed by us to investigate the psychological status, disease-related knowledge, and the behavior of Chinese urban and rural residents during the pandemic. The average score of anxiety and depression among urban residents was 9.15 and 11.25, respectively, while the figures in rural areas were 8.69 and 10.57, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the levels of anxiety (P < .01) and depression (P < .01). Urban participants reported significantly higher levels of knowledge regarding COVID-19 in all aspects (transmission, prevention measures, symptoms of infection, treatment, and prognosis) (P < .01), compared to their rural counterparts. While a majority of respondents in urban areas obtained knowledge through WeChat, other apps, and the Internet (P < .01), residents in rural areas accessed information through interactions with the community (P < .01). Urban residents fared well in exchanging knowledge about COVID-19 and advising others to take preventive measures (P < .01), but fared poorly in advising people to visit a hospital if they displayed symptoms of the disease, compared to rural residents (P < .01).

591945,Epidemiological pattern of orthopaedic fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-12-30,"Conditional ligands have enabled the high-throughput production of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) libraries that present defined peptides. Immunomonitoring platforms typically concentrate on restriction elements associated with European ancestry, and such tools are scarce for Asian HLA variants. We report 30 novel irradiation-sensitive ligands, specifically targeting South East Asian populations, which provide 93, 63, and 79% coverage for HLA-A, -B, and -C, respectively. Unique ligands for all 16 HLA types were constructed to provide the desired soluble HLA product in sufficient yield. Peptide exchange was accomplished for all variants as demonstrated by an ELISA-based MHC stability assay. HLA tetramers with redirected specificity could detect antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses against human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B (HBV), dengue virus (DENV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections. The potential of this population-centric HLA library was demonstrated with the characterization of seven novel T-cell epitopes from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, HBV, and DENV. Posthoc analysis revealed that the majority of responses would be more readily identified by our unbiased discovery approach than through the application of state-of-the-art epitope prediction. This flow cytometry-based technology therefore holds considerable promise for monitoring clinically relevant antigen-specific T-cell responses in populations of distinct ethnicity.","Chang, Cynthia X L; Tan, Anthony T; Or, Ming Yan; Toh, Kai Yee; Lim, Pei Yiing; Chia, Adeline S E; Froesig, Thomas M; Nadua, Karen D; Oh, Hsueh-Ling J; Leong, Hoe Nam; Hadrup, Sine R; Gehring, Adam J; Tan, Yee-Joo; Bertoletti, Antonio; Grotenbreg, Gijsbert M",Eur J Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201243088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23280567/,413

In this study, an RVA strain designated RVA/Dog-tc/CHN/SCCD-A/2017/G9P[23] was isolated in cell culture from a pet dog stool sample with acute diarrhea, and its whole genome was sequenced. The genotype constellation of SCCD-A was G9-P[23]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1. All genome segments except the VP1 gene were closely related to the genes from porcine RVA strains or porcine-like human RVA strains. On the other hand, the VP1 gene clustered in a distinct lineage only with that of a G5P[6] porcine-like human RVA, preventing the identification of the exact host species origin, but very unlikely to be originated from human RVA. In addition, phylogenetic analysis showed that the G9 VP7 gene of SCCD-A clustered into a novel sublineage within the lineage III of G9. This first isolation of a G9P[23] RVA from a pet dog may justify the exploration of the role dogs play in the interaction of RVA circulating in pigs and humans.","Yan, Nan; Tang, Cheng; Kan, Ruici; Feng, Fan; Yue, Hua.",Infect Genet Evol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.02.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818309584; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818309584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796978/,413
592582,6 Lung Ultrasound versus Chest X-ray for the Diagnosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia,2020-10-31,"As in other European countries, specialised psychiatric hospitals were established throughout France during the 19th Century. The construction of these hospitals can be considered as the concrete expression of a therapeutic innovation which recognized insanity as an illness that could be treated in such specialised institutions. The spatial diffusion of these innovative institutions through 19th and 20th century France is analysed and we explore how far this can be understood through theories of diffusion of innovations including geographical models of hierarchical and expansion diffusion (or whether other conceptual models are more appropriate). The research reported here particularly focuses on the period 1800–1961. It involved the construction of an original historical database of both psychiatric hospitals and information on the cities where these institutions were located. This was used to examine and interpret the different phases of development of psychiatric institutions and the parts of the country and types of geographical setting where they were concentrated. A multiple correspondence analysis was then performed to examine the connections between different aspects of the diffusion process. The study shows the limitations of classical models of spatial diffusion, which are found to be consistent with some, but not all aspects of the development of psychiatric institutions in France. An alternative political ecology approach seems more appropriate to conceptualise the various processes involved; national policies, social representations, medicalisation of care of mental illness, and urban and economic growth all seem to be associated with the emergence of a variable and complex pattern. This paper also opens a large field of research. Compared with other western countries, the geography of French psychiatric care is relatively under-researched, although there has been a strong spatial dimension to mental health policy in the country. This analysis provides a context for studies of more contemporary processes of French deinstitutionalisation, which is strongly structured by the past heritage of these large asylum facilities.","Coldefy, Magali; Curtis, Sarah E.",Soc Sci Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953610006921; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953610006921; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.09.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21055855/,413

593966,Early mobilization in hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2020-05-18,"INTRODUCTION: In March 2020 the Government of Spain imposed a strict national closure to suppress the COVID-19 outbreak. The implementation of various measures during the different phases of confinement and de-escalating, led to a significant decrease in public mobility, modifying the daily life and activities of citizens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out including patients evaluated and diagnosed in the Traumatology Emergency Department of our centre during that period, and compared with 2019. The profile of the patients and the injuries treated based on the established diagnoses were analyzed. The weeks considered were divided into total confinement, de-escalation phase 0, 1, 2 and 3. 8511 patients were reviewed. RESULTS: The measures established during the first wave of the Covid-19 outbreak showed a tremendous impact on the activity of the Traumatology Emergency Department. The number of patients cared for decreased by 59% in 2020. Despite a significant reduction compared to the previous year, the only fractures that remained constant were those of the femur. The cases of minor trauma and pain that do not necessarily require access to an emergency room are progressively reduced to 71% and 61%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings could help in future pandemics to formulate a protocol for patient management, identify areas for improvement and resource planning. It is important to understand which presentations are less common during a state of emergency and which presentations occur with it, or even more frequently.","Lanuza Lagunilla, L; Suárez-Anta Rodríguez, P; Camblor Valladares, A; Meneses Gutiérrez, A; García Arias, A; Cabria Fernández, J; Riera Campillo, M; García Cuello, L",Br J Surg,https://doi.org/10.1093/bjs/znab160.066,413
594118,"Demographic and Clinical Characteristics Associated With Severity, Clinical Outcomes, and Mortality of COVID-19 Infection in Gabon",2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND: Recently, it has been shown that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has caused a pandemic since December 2019, can be accompanied by some neurological disorders. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of the most common neurological symptoms and comorbidities and systematically review the literature regarding the most prevalent neurological complications of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: All relevant studies had been collected from PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases. All extracted data were analyzed using Stata version 11.2. The I2 index was applied, and a random-effects model or a fixed-effects model was used for pooled estimation to assess the heterogeneity of studies. Furthermore, Egger and Beeg's tests were used to evaluate the publication bias. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies (26 observational and 31 case reports) were included (including 6,597 COVID-19 patients). The most prevalent general symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea with 84.6% (95% CI: 75.3–92.1; I2 = 98.7%), 61.3% (95% CI: 55.3–67.0; I2 = 94.6%), and 34.2% (95% CI: 25.6–43.4; I2 = 97.7%), respectively. Neurological symptoms observed among COVID-19 patients were fatigue, gustatory dysfunction, anorexia, olfactory dysfunction, headache, dizziness, and nausea with 42.9% (95% CI: 36.7–49.3; I2 = 92.8%), 35.4% (95% CI: 11.2–64.4; I2 = 99.2%), 28.9% (95% CI: 19.9–38.8; I2 = 96.3%), 25.3% (95% CI: 1.6–63.4; I2 = 99.6%), 10.1% (95% CI: 2.7–21.0; I2 = 99.1%), 6.7% (95% CI: 3.7–10.5; I2 = 87.5%), and 5.9% (95% CI: 3.1–9.5; I2 = 94.5%). The most prevalent neurological comorbidity in COVID-19 was cerebrovascular disease with 4.3% (95% CI: 2.7–6.3; I2 = 78.7%). CONCLUSION: The most prevalent neurological manifestations of COVID-19 include fatigue, gustatory dysfunction, anorexia, olfactory dysfunction, headache, dizziness, and nausea. Cerebrovascular disorders can either act as a risk factor for poorer prognosis in COVID-19 patients or occur as a critical complication in these patients. Guillain-Barre syndrome, encephalitis, and meningitis have also been reported as complications of COVID-19.","Vakili, Kimia; Fathi, Mobina; Hajiesmaeili, Mohammadreza; Salari, Melika; Saluja, Diksha; Tafakhori, Abbas; Sayehmiri, Fatemeh; Rezaei-Tavirani, Mostafa",Eur Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1159/000516258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044408/,413
594508,The importance of early detection of ENT symptoms in mild-to-moderate COVID-19,2021-05-14,"We describe the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of 3 critically ill patients with COVID-19 who developed severe encephalopathy. The first patient did not regain consciousness when sedation was removed at the end of 2 weeks of intensive care. He had received treatment with convalescent plasma. His clinical examination was remarkable for intact brainstem reflexes, roving eye movements, later transient ocular flutter; and then what appeared to be slow ocular dipping. He had no coherent volitional response to the environment. The second patient recovered with measurable cognitive deficits after a prolonged period of encephalopathy. He had received combination treatment with interferon beta 1b and lopinavir/ritonavir. The third patient remained in persistent, severe agitated delirium and died 3 months into his illness. The MRI of the 3 patients showed multifocal abnormalities predominantly in the cerebral white matter, with varying involvement of the grey matter, brainstem and spinal cord. Case 1's MRI changes were consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The patients also displayed blood markers, to varying degree, of autoimmunity and hypercoagulability. We were not able to convincingly show, from microbiological as well as immunological evaluation, if the effects of COVID-19 on these patients' nervous system were a direct consequence of the virus, proinflammatory-thrombotic state or a combination. Patient 1 responded partially to empirical, albeit delayed, therapy with intravenous immunoglobulins. Patient 2 recovered with no specific treatment. These cases illustrate the need to understand the full spectrum of encephalopathy associated with COVID-19 so as to better guide its management.","Umapathi, Thirugnanam; Jason, Quek Wei Ming; Min, Yen Jia; Wai, Khin Hnin Su; Yuan, Mah Yun; Yee, Joel Chan Chee; Min, Ling Li; Wai-Yung, Yu",eNeurologicalSci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240565022030054X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32984561/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S240565022030054X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensci.2020.100275,413

595311,Acute Coronary Syndrome Admissions and Outcome during COVID-19 Pandemic–Report from Large Tertiary Centre in India,2020-09-18,"BACKGROUND: In the majority of China, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) at the county level provides both clinical and public health care for TB cases, with hospitals and other health facilities referring suspected TB cases to the CDC. In recent years, an integrated model has emerged, where the CDC remains the basic management unit for TB control, while a general hospital is designated to provide clinical care for TB patients. This study aims to explore the factors that influence the integration of TB services in general hospitals and generate knowledge to aid the scale-up of integration of TB services in China. METHODS: This study adopted a qualitative approach using interviews from sites in East and West China. Analysis was conducted using a thematic framework approach. RESULTS: The more prosperous site in East China was more coordinated and thus had a better method of resource allocation and more patient-orientated service, compared with the poorer site in the West. The development of public health organizations appeared to influence how effectively integration occurred. An understanding from staff that hospitals had better capacity to treat TB patients than CDCs was a strong rationale for integration. However, the economic and political interests might act as a barrier to effective integration. Both sites shared the same challenges of attracting and retaining a skilled workforce for the TB services. The role of the health bureau was more directive in the Western site, while a more participatory and collaborative approach was adopted in the Eastern site. CONCLUSION: The process of integration identifies similarities and differences between sites in more affluent East China and poorer West China. Integration of TB services in the hospitals needs to address the challenges of stakeholder motivations and resource allocation. Effective inter-organizational collaboration could help to improve the efficiency and quality of TB service. Key words: TB control, service delivery, integration, hospitals, China.","Zou, Guanyang; Wei, Xiaolin; Walley, John D; Yin, Jia; Sun, Qiang",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22276746/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-12-21,413

The study investigated the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypic resistance profile in 1803 nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)‐experienced Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection. Serum HBV DNA was extracted, and the reverse transcriptase region was analysed by a high‐sensitive direct PCR sequencing and verified by clonal sequencing if necessary. Drug‐resistant mutations were detected in 560 of the 1803 patients, including 214 of 490 patients who received lamivudine (LAM), 35 of 428 patients who received adefovir (ADV), five of 18 patients who received telbivudine and 306 of 794 patients who received various sequential/combined NA therapies. ADV‐resistant mutations were detected in 36 of 381 patients who received LAM and then switched‐to ADV in contrast to one of 82 patients who received ADV add‐on LAM. Entecavir (ETV)‐resistant mutations were detected not only in LAM‐ and ETV‐treated patients but also in LAM‐treated ETV‐naïve patients. Double mutations rtM204I and rtL180M were detected more frequently in genotype C than in genotype B virus, and patients infected with this mutant had higher alanine transaminase levels than those infected with mutant containing the rtM204I substitution alone. Multidrug‐resistant HBV strains were identified in eight patients, including two novel strains with mutational patterns rtL180M + A181V + S202G + M204V + N236T and rtL180M + S202G + M204V + N236T. The results provide new information on HBV genotypic resistance profiles in a large cohort of Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection and may have important clinical implication for HBV drug resistance management in China.","Liu, Y.; Wang, C.; Zhong, Y.; Li, X.; Dai, J.; Ren, X.; Xu, Z.; Li, L.; Yao, Z.; Ji, D.; Wang, L.; Zhang, L.; Wong, V.

The CSS, a newly emerging internationally standardized measure of stress related to being exposed to or contracting COVID-19, was translated and validated for a Palestinian context to ensure that it can be used to measure COVID-19 stress. The sample of the study consisted of 860 Palestinian adults living in the West Bank of Palestine. Participants’ age ranged from 20 to 48 years old (M = 34.7, SD =13.46). They were all recruited from online advertisements, e-mail campaigns, blogs, social media, and SMS campaigns. The CSS was found to be valid in the Arabic language within a Palestinian context. The confirmatory factor analysis yielded six factors: (1) Fears about the dangerousness of COVID-19, (2) fears about the personal social, and economic consequences of COVID-19, fears of disruption in the supply chain, fears of looting or rioting, (3) COVID-19-xenophobia, fears that foreigners are sources of COVID-19, (4) fears about sources of COVID-19-related contamination,(5) traumatic stress symptoms related to COVID-19, and (6) COVID-19-related checking which is consisting with the ordinal structure the scale. The CSS demonstrated a high level of validity and reliability in a Palestinian context and therefore can be considered for future studies as the COVID-19 pandemic persists.

METHODS Telemedicine options - virtual visits and teleconferencing - were introduced in July 2020. Both radiation oncologist and neurosurgeon were simultaneously present for the telemedicine visit. Descriptive patient demographics, survey responses, and travel time and distance calculations were analyzed. Satisfaction score was compared to previously published data. RESULTS A total of twenty-five telemedicine visits (n=22 video; n=3 phone) were completed since July 2020. Patient demographics are as follows: mean age was 59 years (range=22-81), women (9) and men (16), repeat telemedicine visits n=10, malignant CNS disease (17) and benign disease (5). Mean one-way distance traveled was 165.07 miles (median=114; range=0.8-358). Mean roundtrip travel time was estimated at 5h 5min. Mean telemedicine visit duration was 15.3 mins (range=4-46). Mean patient satisfaction score for telemedicine visits was 4.84. CONCLUSION Patients who opted for the telemedicine visits found them just as effective as in-person visits, saving time and travel costs as well as ensuring patient safety during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

We developed and evaluated an interactive web tool providing transparent and reliable information on the benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: The most recent scientific data at the time of the study were implemented into an interactive web tool offering individualized information on the risks of COVID-19 infection-related events versus vaccination-related serious adverse events. The tool was evaluated during a before-and-after impact study nested in ComPaRe, a French e-cohort of adult patients with chronic conditions. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients intending to receive vaccination after using the tool, among those not intending to receive it at baseline. RESULTS: Between January 8 and 14, 2021, we enrolled 3152 patients in the study [mean age 55.2 (SD: 16.9), 52.9% women and 63% with ≥ 2 chronic conditions]. Before consulting the tool, 961 (30.5%) refused to be vaccinated until further data on efficacy/safety was obtained and 239 (7.5%) outright refused vaccination. Among these 1200 patients, 96 (8.0%, number needed to treat: 12.5) changed their mind after consulting the tool and would subsequently accept vaccination.

601836,Metformin Use Is Associated With Reduced Mortality in a Diverse Population With COVID-19 and Diabetes,2021-01-13,"Various conspiracy theories have accompanied COVID-19 since its initial outbreak. Based on a nationwide survey in China, this study probes the health consequences of beliefs in different COVID-19 conspiracy theories in China. The research found that believing the coronavirus has a foreign natural origin was associated with increased rather than decreased intention to adopt protective behaviors. Nonetheless, believing that the source of the pandemic was a Chinese lab or that it is a foreign biological weapon was related to reduced intentions to protect one's health. In addition, measured as national pride and satisfaction with China's pandemic control effort, people's level of nationalism was strongly associated with their intention to adopt protective behaviors, which moderates the health consequences of believing in false conspiracy theories. Scientific literacy was also associated with an increased likelihood of adopting preventive measures. Despite revealing the diversified health consequences of conspiracy beliefs, this study demonstrates the importance of examining collectivist sociopolitical constructs in health communication.","Jia, Hepeng; Luo, Xi",Health Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34353184/; https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1958982,413

Design(s): Literature review. Setting(s): Multidisciplinary medical institution Participants: None. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): None. Result(s): The long-term sequelae in COVID-19 survivors is largely unknown and emerging studies have begun to identify cognitive and psychiatric symptoms as consequences in some individuals. Cognitive abilities most adversely impacted include attention, memory and executive functioning. Survivors of life-threatening illnesses, especially individuals with a history of lengthy ICU stays, are known to exhibit significant psychiatric sequelae, including elevated anxiety, depression, and symptoms of PTSD;all of which are known to exacerbate existing cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions have been utilized in a variety of neurological populations with similar concomitant cognitive and psychiatric symptoms noted in the limited extant literature describing survivors of COVID-19. Integrated use of these evidenced-based CR and CBT interventions is necessary to address the interplay of cognitive and emotional symptomatology that can impede functional recovery in these patients. Conclusion(s): An integrated treatment approach that incorporates both CR and CBT interventions can be used to address the cognitive, behavioral, and psychological manifestations observed in patients with COVID-19 in order to maximize a survivor's level of daily functioning and facilitate re-integration into daily activities. Until further research assessing treatment efficacy in this population can be conducted, rehabilitation specialists should adapt known CR/CBT protocols that are used in disorders that present with similar pathology, as well as neurocognitive and emotional challenges as those in this novel disease.

603234,Persistent symptoms and disability after COVID-19 hospitalization: data from a comprehensive telerehabilitation program,2021-03-10,"The present study examined the multiple micro- and macro-level factors that affect individuals’ financial behaviour under economic strain. The following sociodemographic and economic factors that predict financial behaviour were analysed: age group, year of data gathering, and attitudes towards consumption (economical, deprived, and hedonistic). Subjective financial situations and demographic characteristics were controlled for. Finnish time series data that consisted of five cross-sectional nationally representative surveys were used (n = 10 043). The analyses revealed four types of financial behaviour: cutting expenses, borrowing, increasing income, and gambling. Young adults aged 18–25 reported the lowest frequency of borrowing and gambling and the highest frequency of increasing income (together with young adults aged 26–35). Participants aged 66–75 scored the lowest in cutting expenses and increasing income in comparison to all other age groups. Financial behaviour under economic strain in 2019 can be characterized by lower instances of borrowing than in 2004 and 2009 and higher frequencies in increasing income in comparison to all other years of data gathering. Finally, strong attitudes towards saving were related to lower frequency of borrowing and gambling, whereas stronger hedonistic attitudes were related to lower frequency of cutting expenses and more frequent borrowing. The research results provide tools for consumer policy, consumer education, and consumer regulation.","Silinskas, G.; Ranta, M.; Wilska, T.-A.",J Consum Policy (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10603-021-09480-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723468/,413
603388,Deploying Randomized Controlled Trials during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Reason and Bayesian Designs,2020-08-11,"BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) have been working on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic with high risks of viral exposure, infection, and transmission. Standard COVID-19 testing is insufficient to protect HCWs from these risks and prevent the spread of disease. Continuous monitoring of physiological data with wearable sensors, self-monitoring of symptoms, and asymptomatic COVID-19 testing may aid in the early detection of COVID-19 in HCWs and may help reduce further transmission among HCWs, patients, and families. OBJECTIVE: By using wearable sensors, smartphone-based symptom logging, and biospecimens, this project aims to assist HCWs in self-monitoring COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study of HCWs at a single institution. The study duration was 1 year, wherein participants were instructed on the continuous use of two wearable sensors (Fitbit Charge 3 smartwatch and TempTraq temperature patches) for up to 30 days. Participants consented to provide biospecimens (ie, nasal swabs, saliva swabs, and blood) for up to 1 year from study entry. Using a smartphone app called Roadmap 2.0, participants entered a daily mood score, submitted daily COVID-19 symptoms, and completed demographic and health-related quality of life surveys at study entry and 30 days later. Semistructured qualitative interviews were also conducted at the end of the 30-day period, following completion of daily mood and symptoms reporting as well as continuous wearable sensor use. RESULTS: A total of 226 HCWs were enrolled between April 28 and December 7, 2020. The last participant completed the 30-day study procedures on January 16, 2021. Data collection will continue through January 2023, and data analyses are ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Using wearable sensors, smartphone-based symptom logging and survey completion, and biospecimen collections, this study will potentially provide data on the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among HCWs at a single institution. The study will also assess the feasibility of leveraging wearable sensors and self-monitoring of symptoms in an HCW population.

603912,Trends in COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality: lessons learned from nationwide samples,2021-02-15,"BACKGROUND: A pooling test is a useful tool for mass screening of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the pandemic era. We aimed to optimize a simple two-step pooling test by estimating the optimal pool size using experimental and mathematical validation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental pools were created by mixing one positive respiratory sample with various numbers of negative samples. We selected positive samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values greater than 32 to validate the efficiency of the pooling test assuming a high likelihood of false-negative results due to low viral loads. The positivities of the experimental pools were investigated with a single reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the U-TOP™ COVID-19 Detection Kit Plus (Seasun Biomaterials, Daejeon, Korea). We used the Dorfman equation to calculate the optimal size of a pooling test mathematically. RESULTS: Viral RNA could be detected in a pool with a size up to 11, even if the Ct value of a positive sample was about 35. The Dorfman equation showed that the optimal number of samples in a pool was 11 when the prevalence was assumed to be 0.66% based on the test positivity in Daejeon, Korea from April 1, 2020 to November 10, 2020. The efficiency of the pooling test was 6.2, which can save 83.9 of 100 individual tests. CONCLUSION: Eleven samples in a pool were validated optimal experimentally assuming a prevalence of 0.66%. The pool size needs modification as the pandemic progresses; thus, the prevalence should be carefully estimated before pooling tests are conducted.","Jeong, Hyeongseok; Lee, Jooyeon; Cheon, Shinhye; Sohn, Kyung Mok; Kim, Jungok; Kym, Sungmin; Kim, Yeon-Sook",Infect Chemother,https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2021.0005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409785/,413

To describe the Covid-19 associated coagulopathy in Indian population and to correlate it with the disease severity and survivor status. A cross sectional descriptive study of 391 confirmed Covid-19 cases was carried out over a period of 1.5 months. Patients were categorised as mild to moderate, severe and very severe and also labelled as survivors and non survivors. Prothrombin time (PT), International normalised ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time, D dimer, Fibrin degradation products (FDP), fibrinogen and thrombin time and platelet counts were investigated among the subgroups. Mean age was higher in patients with severe disease (57.62 ± 13.08) and among the non survivors (56.54 ± 12.78). Statistically significant differences in D dimer, FDP, PT, INR and age were seen among the 3 subgroups and survivors. Strong significant positive correlation was noted between D dimer and FDP (r = 0.838, p < .001), PT and INR (r = 0.986, p < 0.001). D dimer was the best single coagulation parameter as per the area under curve (AUC: 0.762, p < 0.001) and D dimer + FDP was the best combination parameter (AUC: 0.764, p = 0) to differentiate mild moderate from severe disease.

Despite recent vaccination efforts and the end of the COVID-19 pandemic in sight, problems related to the long-term effects of COVID-19 will continue to persist, including impacts on patients suffering from AKI and other chronic renal conditions. Therefore, the dual-targeted blended polymeric NP developed in this study to treat concurrent COVID-19 infection and AKI is a useful proof-of-concept nanoplatform for future treatments of these complications.","Surnar, Bapurao; Shah, Anuj S.; Guin, Subham; Kolishetti, Nagesh; Fornoni, Alessia; Dhar, Shanta",Biomacromolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34492195/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c00799,413

Yet health advocacy requires alternative methods to reach key stakeholders to drive change. The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of social media and public narrative for advocacy in matters of firearm-related injury and death. STUDY DESIGN: The movement This Is Our Lane was evaluated through the #ThisIsOurLane and #ThisIsMyLane hashtags. Sources were assessed from November 2018 through March 2019. Analyses specifically examined message volume, time course, global engagement, and content across Twitter, scientific literature, and mass media. Twitter data were analyzed via Symplur Signals. Scientific literature reviews were performed using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Mass media was compiled using Access World News/Newsbank, Newspaper Source, and Google. RESULTS: A total of 507,813 tweets were shared using #ThisIsOurLane, #ThisIsMyLane, or both (co-occurrence 21–39%). Fifteen scientific items and n = 358 mass media publications were published during the study period; the latter included articles, blogs, television interviews, petitions, press releases, and audio interviews/podcasts. Peak messaging appeared first on Twitter on November 10(th), followed by mass media on November 12(th) and 20(th), and scientific publications during December. CONCLUSIONS: Social media enables clinicians to quickly disseminate information about a complex public health issue like firearms to the mainstream media, scientific community, and general public alike. Humanized data resonates with people and has the ability to transcend the barriers of language, culture, and geography. Showing society the reality of caring for firearm-related injuries through healthcare worker stories via digital media appears to be effective in shaping the public agenda and influencing real-world events.","Boeck, Marissa A.; Juillard, Catherine J.; Dicker, Rochelle A.; Joseph, Bellal A.; Sakran, Joseph V.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914809/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250875,413
604384,Clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcome of medical staff infected with COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia: A retrospective single-center study,2020-12-11,"Abstract The helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) encoded by potyviruses functions to cleave the viral polyprotein by an autoproteolytic mechanism at the HC-Pro C-terminus. This protein belongs to a group of viral cysteine-type proteinases and has been shown previously to catalyze proteolysis between a Gly-Gly dipeptide. The amino acid sequence requirements surrounding the HC-Pro C-terminal cleavage site of the tobacco etch virus polyprotein have been investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro expression systems. A total of 51 polyprotein derivatives, each differing by the substitution of a single amino acid between the P5 and P2′ positions, were tested for autoproteolytic activity. Substitutions of Tyr (P4), Val (P2), Gly (P1), and Gly (P1′) were found to eliminate or nearly eliminate proteolysis. Substitutions of Thr (P5), Asn (P3), and Met (P2′), on the other hand, were permissive for proteolysis, although the apparent processing rates of some polyproteins containing these alterations were reduced. These results suggest that auto-recognition by HC-Pro involves the interaction of the enzymatic binding site with four amino acids surrounding the cleavage site. Comparison of the homologous sequences of five potyviral polyproteins revealed that the residues essential for processing are strictly conserved, whereas the nonessential residues are divergent. The relationship between HC-Pro and other viral and cellular cysteine-type proteinases is discussed.","Carrington, James C.; Herndon, Kerri L.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1736533/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290319K; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290319K,413

Viral load was determined by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 576 plasma and 576 throat swabs were collected from 191 COVID-19 patients. Antibody titers related to adverse outcome and clinical improvement were analysed. Multivariable adjusted generalized linear mixed model for random effects were developed RESULTS: After day 28 post symptoms onset, the rate of antibody positivity reached 100% for RBD-IgM, 97.8% for S-IgM, 100% for N-IgG, 100% for RBD-IgG, 91.1% for N-IgM and 91.1% for NAbs. The NAbs titers increased over time in both survivors and non-survivors and correlated to IgG antibodies against N, S and RBD, while its presence showed no statistical correlation with death.

This study aims to apply a compartmental model for predicting the variations of epidemiological parameters in Sri Lanka. We used a dynamic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated (SEIRV) model, and simulated for potential vaccine strategies under a range of epidemic conditions. The predictions were based on different vaccination coverages (5% to 90%), vaccination-rates (1%, 2%, 5%) and vaccine-efficacies (40%, 60%, 80%) under different R0 (2,4,6). We observed how the above dynamics influenced the SEIRV model without COVID-19 vaccination at different R0 values, and estimated the duration, exposed and infected populations. When the R0 was increased, the days of reduction of susceptibility and the days to reach the peak of the infection were reduced gradually. At least 45% vaccine coverage is required for reducing the infected population as early as possible. The results revealed that when R0 is increased in the SEIRV model along with the increase of vaccination efficacy and vaccination rate, the population to be vaccinated is reducing. Thus, the vaccination offers greater benefits to the local population by reducing the time to reach the peak, exposed and infected population through flattening the curves.","Rajapaksha, R. M. N.

However, after incorporating the spatial and temporal variation, the data do not necessarily have equal mean and variance, suggesting either over- or under-dispersion. In this paper, we propose the Spatio-temporal Conway Maxwell Poisson model. The advantage of Conway Maxwell Poisson distribution is its ability to handle both under- and over-dispersion through controlling one special parameter in the distribution, which makes it more flexible than Poisson distribution. We consider data from the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 2019 (COVID-19) that has threatened people all over the world. Understanding the spatio-temporal pattern of the disease is of great importance. We apply a spatio-temporal Conway Maxwell Poisson model to data on the COVID-19 deaths and find that this model achieves better performance than commonly used spatio-temporal Poisson model.","Li, Xiaomeng; Dey, Dipak K.",Spat Stat,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221167532100052X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221167532100052X,413

Multiple lines of evidence, including documented expression of receptor proteins on gastrointestinal epithelial cells, in vivo viral replication in gastrointestinal epithelial cell lines, extended fecal shedding of respiratory viruses, and the ability to remain infectious in food environments for extended periods of time raises the theoretical ability of some human respiratory viruses, particularly human coronaviruses and AVI, to spread via food.

608595,Use of sit-to-stand test to assess the physical capacity and exertional desaturation in patients post COVID-19,2021-02-27,"INTRODUCTION: Sleep is critical to children’s health and recovery, but pediatric inpatient sleep is often disrupted by nonessential overnight interruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated social distancing policies which minimized contact with low-risk patients. These policies have the potential to decrease overnight disruptions and improve sleep for hospitalized patients. METHODS: This cohort study compared sleep disruptions for pediatric inpatients admitted prior to (Sep 2018 – Feb 2020) and during (Apr 2020 – Aug 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic at a single site, urban academic medical center. Objective disruptions were measured as room entries detected by hand hygiene sensors for occupied rooms pre-pandemic (n_average=56) and during the pandemic (n_average=48) for 69 and 154 nights, respectively. Subjective reports of overnight disruptions, sleep quantity, and caregiver mood were measured by surveys adopted from validated tools: the Karolinska Sleep Log, Potential Hospital Sleep Disruptions and Noises Questionnaire, and Visual Analog Mood Scale. Caregivers of a convenience sample of pediatric general medicine inpatients completed surveys. Caregivers pre-pandemic were surveyed in person, and during the pandemic, surveys were conducted over the phone. RESULTS: 293 pre-pandemic (age_patients=4.1±4.4 years) and 154 pandemic (age_patients=8.7±5.6 years) surveys were collected from caregivers. The majority (71% pre-pandemic and 52% pandemic) of the study population identified as Black/African American. Nighttime room entries initially decreased 36% (95% CI: 30%, 42%, p<0.001), then returned towards pre-pandemic levels as the COVID-19 hospital caseload decreased. Despite this, caregivers reported more disrupted patient sleep (p<0.001) due to tests (21% vs. 38%) as well as stress (30% vs. 49%), anxiety (23% vs. 41%), and pain (23% vs. 48%). Caregivers also reported children slept 61 minutes less (95% CI: 12 min, 110 min, p<0.001) and had more awakenings. Caregivers self-reported feeling more sad and weary, less calm, and worse overall (p<0.001 for all). CONCLUSION: Despite fewer objective room entries, caregivers reported increased sleep disruptions and an hour less nighttime sleep with more awakenings during the pandemic for pediatric patients. Caregivers also self-reported worse mood. This highlights the importance of addressing subjective perceptions and experiences of hospitalized children and their caregivers during hospitalization.

608920,Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors of Respiratory Failure in a Cohort of Young Patients Requiring Hospital Admission with SARS-CoV2 Infection in Spain: Results of the Multicenter SEMI-COVID-19 Registry,2021-08-11,"COVID-19 patients who are critically ill develop vascular complications characterized by thrombosis of small, medium and large vessels. Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 vasculopathy. Although initial reports suggested that endothelial injury was caused directly by the virus, recent studies indicate that endothelial cells do not express ACE2 – the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to gain entry into cells – or express it at low levels and are resistant to the infection. These new findings, together with the observation that COVID-19 triggers a cytokine storm capable of injuring the endothelium and disrupting its antithrombogenic properties, favor an indirect mechanism of endothelial injury mediated, locally, by an augmented inflammatory reaction to infected nonendothelial cells such as the bronchial and alveolar epithelium and, systemically, by the excessive immune response to infection. Here we review the vascular pathology of COVID-19 and critically discuss the potential mechanisms of endothelial injury in this disease.","Nicosia, Roberto F.; Ligresti, Giovanni; Caporarello, Nunzia; Akilesh, Shreeram; Ribatti, Domenico",Am J Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34033751/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944021002108; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944021002108?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.05.007,413

A position paper of the ESC Council for Cardiology Practice,2021-06-25,"Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) quickly surged the whole world and affected people’s physical, mental, and social health thereby upsetting their quality of life. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the quality of life (QoL) of COVID-19 positive patients after recovery in Bangladesh. This was a study of adult (aged ≥18 years) COVID-19 individuals from eight divisions of Bangladesh diagnosed and confirmed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) from June 2020 to November 2020. Given a response rate of 60% in a pilot study, a random list of 6400 COVID-19 patients was generated to recruit approximately 3200 patients from eight divisions of Bangladesh and finally a total of 3244 participants could be recruited for the current study. The validated Bangla version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to assess the QoL. Data were analyzed by STATA (Version 16.1) and R (Version 4.0.0). All the procedures were conducted following ethical approval and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The mean scores of QoL were highest for the physical domain (68.25±14.45) followed by social (65.10±15.78), psychological (63.28±15.48), and environmental domain (62.77±13.07). Psychological and physical domain scores among females were significantly lower than the males (p<0.001). The overall quality of life was lower in persons having a chronic disease. Participants over 45 years of age were 52% less likely to enjoy good physical health than the participants aged below 26 years (AOR: 0.48, CI: 0.28–0.82). The quality of life of employed participants was found 1.8 times higher than the unemployed (AOR: 1.80, CI: 1.11–2.91). Those who were admitted to hospitals during infection had a low QoL score in physical, psychological, and socials domains. However, QoL improved in all aspect except the psychological domain for each day passed after the diagnosis. These findings call for a focus on the quality of life of the COVID-19 affected population, with special emphasis given to females, older adults, unemployed, and people with comorbidities.","Hawlader, Mohammad Delwer Hossain; Rashid, Md.

609564,Proportions of Surgical Patients Discharged Home the Same or the Next Day Are Sufficient Data to Assess Cases’ Contributions to Hospital Occupancy,2021-03-11,"The LightUp(®) Probe technology has now matured and reached the phase where it has been implemented in commercial reagent kits, i.e. the ReSSQ(®) product line. Several properties of the LightUp(®) probes make them particularly suitable for clinical settings. For instance, extraordinary shelf life and a chemical stability that allows convenient fridge storage. The origin of the higher stability of LightUp(®) probe kits compared to others, based on alternative probe technologies, is partly the relatively good stability of cyanine dyes but also the resistance towards nucleases and proteases of the synthetic DNA analogue peptide nucleic acid that is used as the sequence recognizing element in LightUp probes. It is clear from recent trends in the PCR amplification hardware technology that the instrumentation is becoming more flexible and less adapted for dedicated probe chemistries. This will pave the way for increased standardization in the field of DNA diagnostics and the development of cross-platform assays. In the present review the LightUp technology will briefly be presented and discussed. The utility of the technology will be illustrated by examples from cytomegalovirus quantification and monitoring of the viral load of the SARS Coronavirus.

STUDY DESIGN: National cross-sectional study. METHODS: One thousand two hundred and eighty-one respondents were selected at random from provincial and prefectural CDCs. The survey used a self-administered, structured questionnaire with an online data collection tool that integrated data quality control and user management. The questionnaire was divided into seven main categories. Score percentage of satisfaction and proportion in each part were calculated. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data, stratifying by country region, CDC level, job role and educational level. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty staff from provincial CDCs and 1121 staff from prefectural CDCs were selected. Only 7.4% (33/445) of prefectural CDCs were not involved in this survey, due to lack of PHI practitioners. CDC staff in the eastern region were predominantly aged 30–39 years (39.5%), which was much younger compared with the other regions (P = 0.0012). Only 34 respondents (2.7%) had academic majors in both health and information technology. More staff had Master's degrees and a higher level of education (18.7%) in the eastern region compared with the other regions (P < 0.0001). Staff in the eastern region in high-level positions and with a higher level of education were more knowledgeable about PHI strategy. Prefectural CDC staff were more satisfied with their work and training than provincial CDC staff. In the eastern region, 34.9% of staff were hired through competitive recruitment, and 57.8% of staff had received a job description with detailed information about their responsibilities, which was higher than in the other regions. Staff in the western region were more likely to leave if a better job became available (37.7%) compared with staff in the other regions (P = 0.0116). CONCLUSION: This study found regional disparities in PHI workforce development, possibly related to disparities in overall regional development. Findings showed a severe shortage of staff with a background in PHI, and occupational development paths were clearly lacking. Based on this study of current workforce issues, a comprehensive strategy for PHI workforce development in China has been described.","Qi, X.; Wang, Y.; Xia, L.; Meng, Y.; Li, Y.; Yu, S.; Su, X.; Jin, S.; Li, Y.; Ge, H.; Zhang, Y.; Zhuang, D.; Ma, J.",Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25904003/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350615001109; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2015.03.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350615001109,413

The urgent need for a vaccine has led to the development of various immunization approaches. mRNA vaccines represent a cell-free, simple and rapid platform for immunization, and therefore have been employed in recent studies towards the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this study, we present the design of a lipid nanoparticles (LNP)-encapsulated receptor binding domain (RBD) mRNA vaccine. Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulation have been chosen for the subsequent RBD mRNA vaccine experiment. Intramuscular administration of LNP RBD mRNA elicited robust humoral response, high level of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased cellular response in BALB/c mice. These novel lipids open new avenues for mRNA vaccines in general and for a COVID19 vaccine in particular.","Elia, Uri; Ramishetti, Srinivas; Dammes, Niels; Bar-Haim, Erez; Naidu, Gonna Somu; Makdasi, Efi; Cohen, Ofer; Peer, Dan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.341537,413

Current therapeutic options are limited, with no direct acting antivirals available for treatment. This study screened a panel of 19 compounds for potential antiviral activity against FCV strain F9 and recent field isolates in vitro. Using a resazurin-based cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay, mefloquine demonstrated a marked inhibitory effect on FCV induced CPE, albeit with a relatively low selectivity index. Orthogonal assays confirmed inhibition of CPE was associated with a significant reduction in viral replication. Mefloquine exhibited a strong inhibitory effect against a panel of seven recent FCV isolates from Australia, with calculated IC50 values for the field isolates approximately 50% lower than against the reference strain FCV F9. In vitro combination therapy with recombinant feline interferon-ω, a biological response modifier currently registered for the treatment of FCV, demonstrated additive effects with a concurrent reduction in the IC50 of mefloquine. These results are the first report of antiviral effects of mefloquine against a calicivirus and support further in vitro and in vivo evaluation of this compound as an antiviral therapeutic for FCV.","McDonagh, Phillip; Sheehy, Paul A.; Fawcett, Anne; Norris, Jacqueline M.",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.02.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515000620; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515000620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25746684/,413
611827,Patients’ Responses to the Sudden Interruption of Chemotherapy During the Outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021-01-13,"Immunotherapy is now commonly prescribed to cancer patients, but autoimmune-related adverse events are considerable. For severe, life-threatening side effects, cessation of therapy seems unavoidable, let alone intensive medical care required for patching up the adverse events. Even without serious adverse events, the response rates are too low and various combinatory regimens have been tried. However, toxicities are also added on, unless the adjuvant agents have remarkably few side effects. Actually, micronutrients are usually taken by a majority of cancer patients as nutritional support or to boost the immune function, let alone hoping to counteract treatment side effects. Recent studies have shown that combinations of micronutrients exert pleiotropic effects in controlling tumor growth and metastasis by modulating the tumor microenvironment, enhancing gut microbiota immune functions, and providing adjunct nutritional support to micronutrient deficient cancer patients. A higher than recommended dietary allowance micronutrient dose is proposed to reduce the toxic free radicals generated as a result of immunotherapy and tumor metabolism. This is not only helpful for managing treatment side effects but also enhancing treatment efficacy. As micronutrient supplementation is also useful to improve patients’ quality of life, prolong survival, and sustain compliance to immunotherapy, further investigations are mandatory.","Yuen, Raymond C-F; Tsao, Shiu-Ying",World J Clin Oncol,https://doi.org/10.5306/wjco.v12.i9.712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34631438/,413

Here, we focus on monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and a protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha) to investigate how host migration affects infectious disease processes. Previous work showed that parasite prevalence was lower among migratory than nonmigratory monarch populations; two explanations for this pattern are that (1) migration allows animals to periodically escape contaminated habitats (i.e., migratory escape), and (2) long‐distance migration weeds out infected animals (i.e., migratory culling). We combined field‐sampling and analysis of citizen science data to examine spatiotemporal trends of parasite prevalence and evaluate evidence for these two mechanisms. Analysis of within‐breeding‐season variation in eastern North America showed that parasite prevalence increased from early to late in the breeding season, consistent with the hypothesis of migratory escape. Prevalence was also positively related to monarch breeding activity, as indexed by larval density. Among adult monarchs captured at different points along the east coast fall migratory flyway, parasite prevalence declined as monarchs progressed southward, consistent with the hypothesis of migratory culling. Parasite prevalence was also lower among monarchs sampled at two overwintering sites in Mexico than among monarchs sampled during the summer breeding period. Collectively, these results indicate that seasonal migration can affect parasite transmission in wild animal populations, with implications for predicting disease risks for species with threatened migrations.","Bartel, Rebecca A.; Oberhauser, Karen S.; de Roode, Jacobus C.; Altizer, Sonia M.",Ecology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21618914/,413
613349,Implications of COVID-19 infections in sickle cell disease,2020-06-09,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes to in-office orthopedic care, with a rapid shift to telemedicine. Institutions’ lack of established infrastructure for these types of visits has posed challenges requiring attention to confidentiality, safety, and patient satisfaction. Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility of telemedicine in orthopedics during the pandemic and its effect on efficiency and patient satisfaction. Methods: Patients seen by the Emory University Department of Orthopaedics Sports Medicine and Upper Extremity Divisions via telemedicine from March 23 to April 24, 2020, were contacted by telephone. Each patient was asked to respond to questions on satisfaction, ease of use, and potential future use; satisfaction with telemedicine and previous clinical visits were measured using a modified 5-point Likert scale. Results: Of the 762 patients seen, 346 (45.4%) completed the telemedicine questionnaire. Satisfaction varied by visit type, with average scores of 4.88/5 for in-office clinic visits versus 4.61/5 for telemedicine visits. There was no significant difference among age groups for satisfaction ratings. Patients 65 years old or older reported significantly longer visit times and decreased ease of use with the telemedicine platform. Conclusion: Telemedicine in a large orthopedics department was successfully implemented without compromising patient satisfaction. The use of telemedicine allows many patients to be seen quickly and efficiently without diminishing their musculoskeletal clinical experience.","Greenfield, Paul T.; Manz, Wesley J.; DeMaio, Emily L.; Duddleston, Sage H.; Xerogeanes, John W.; Scott Maughon, T.; Spencer, Corey C.; Dawes, Alexander; Boden, Scott D.; Hammond, Kyle E.; Wagner, Eric R.; Gottschalk, Michael B.; Daly, Charles A.; Pombo, Mathew W.",HSS J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967640/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1556331620977171,413
613841,The True Challenges of the Covid-19 Epidemics: The Need for Essential Levels of Care for All,2020-03-16,"Background Available national public data are often too incomplete and noisy to be used directly to interpret the evolution of epidemics over time, which is essential for making timely and appropriate decisions. The use of compartment models can be a worthwhile and attractive approach to address this problem. The present study proposes a model compartmentalized by sex and age groups that allows for more complete information on the evolution of the CoViD-19 pandemic in Italy. Material and methods Italian public data on CoViD-19 were pre-treated with a 7-day moving average filter to reduce noise. A time-varying susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased (SIRD) model distributed by age and sex groups was then proposed. Recovered and infected individuals distributed by groups were reconstructed through the SIRD model, which was also used to simulate and identify optimal scenarios of pandemic containment by vaccination. The simulation started from realistic initial conditions based on the SIRD model parameters, estimated from filtered and reconstructed Italian data, at different pandemic times and phases. The following three objective functions, accounting for total infections, total deaths, and total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, were minimized by optimizing the percentages of vaccinated individuals in five different age groups. Results The developed SIRD model clearly highlighted those pandemic phases in which younger people, who had more contacts and lower mortality, infected older people, characterized by a significantly higher mortality, especially in males. Optimizing vaccination strategies yielded different results depending on the cost function used. As expected, to reduce total deaths, the suggested strategy was to vaccinate the older age groups, whatever the baseline scenario. In contrast, for QALYs lost and total infections, the optimal vaccine solutions strongly depended on the initial pandemic conditions: during phases of high virus diffusion, the model suggested to vaccinate mainly younger groups with a higher contact rate. Conclusion Because of the poor quality and insufficient availability of stratified public pandemic data, ad hoc information filtering and reconstruction procedures proved essential. The time-varying SIRD model, stratified by age and sex groups, provided insights and additional information on the dynamics of CoViD-19 infection in Italy, also supporting decision making for containment strategies such as vaccination.","Cartocci, Alessandra; Cevenini, Gabriele; Barbini, Paolo",J Biomed Inform,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103793; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421001222?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33901696/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046421001222,413

Axial coding was applied to data from the interviews, and all data were analyzed using the constant comparison technique. RESULTS: Twelve of the 141 COVID-19 risk communication messages directly targeted the vulnerable. All participants were aware of the relevant risk communication and largely complied. Barriers to messaging awareness and compliance included inappropriate message medium for the deaf and blind, rural location, lack of Internet service or digital devices, limited technology skills, and limited connection to agencies that serve the vulnerable.

We derived concordance, agreement and assay performance as well as using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to redefine the assay threshold of the Abbott assay. Result concordance between the Abbott and TBS was 66%. Discrepant samples were analysed using the Roche assay which showed 100% agreement with the TBS assay. In samples analysed >58 days post-PCR, the sensitivity of Abbott and Roche was 100%. In samples analysed >100 days post-PCR the sensitivity of the Abbott assay dropped to 77.2% but remained at 100% for the Roche assay. A redefined Abbott threshold of 0.64 increased the sensitivity to 90% giving results similar to the Roche and TBS assays. In conclusion, this study demonstrated Abbott assay had a lower sensitivity in comparison to TBS and Roche. This study established TBS can be implemented as a viable alternative for SARS-CoV-2 serology testing where high-throughput assays are not available on site. Furthermore, anti-spike assays, such as TBS, could be used to monitor vaccination responses to deduce SARS-CoV-2 population-immunity.

615663,Our Experience of Trauma Management During Novel Coronovirus 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic in a Busy Trauma Center in Southern Iran,2020-07-11,"Neural precursor cells (NPCs), derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), with their unique ability to generate multiple neuronal and glial cell types are extremely useful for understanding biological mechanisms in normal and diseased states. However, generation of specific neuronal subtypes (mature) from NPCs in large numbers adequate for cell therapy is challenging due to lack of a thorough understanding of the cues that govern their differentiation. Interestingly, neural stem cells (NSCs) themselves are in consideration for therapy given their potency to form different neural cell types, release of trophic factors, and immunomodulatory effects that confer neuroprotection. With the recent COVID-19 outbreak and its accompanying neurological indications, the immunomodulatory role of NSCs may gain additional significance in the prevention disease progression in vulnerable populations. In this regard, small-molecule mediated NPC generation from PSCs via NSC formation has become an important strategy that ensures consistency and robustness of the process. The development of the mammalian brain occurs along the rostro-caudal axis, and the establishment of anterior identity is an early event. Wnt signaling, along with fibroblast growth factor and retinoic acid, acts as a caudalization signal. Further, the increasing amount of epigenetic data available from human fetal brain development has enhanced both our understanding of and ability to experimentally manipulate these developmental regulatory programs in vitro. However, the impact on homing and engraftment after transplantation and subsequently on therapeutic efficacy of NPCs based on their derivation strategy is not yet clear. Another formidable challenge in cell replacement therapy for neurodegenerative disorders is the mode of delivery. In this Perspective, we discuss these core ideas with insights from our preliminary studies exploring the role of PSC-derived NPCs in rat models of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease following intranasal injections.","Nandakumar, Swapna; Shahani, Pradnya; Datta, Indrani; Pal, Rajarshi",ACS chemical neuroscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628850/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00525,413

They are able to achieve this by virtue of their ability to multiply very rapidly, coupled with their extraordinary degree of genetic heterogeneity. RNA viruses exist not as single genotypes, but as a swarm of related variants, and this genomic diversity is an essential feature of their biology. RNA viruses have a variety of mechanisms that act in combination to determine their genetic heterogeneity. These include polymerase fidelity, error-mitigation mechanisms, genomic recombination, and different modes of genome replication. RNA viruses can vary in their ability to tolerate mutations, or “genetic robustness,” and several factors contribute to this. Finally, there is evidence that some RNA viruses exist close to a threshold where polymerase error rate has evolved to maximize the possible sequence space available, while avoiding the accumulation of a lethal load of deleterious mutations. We speculate that different viruses have evolved different error rates to complement the different “life-styles” they possess.","Barr, J.N.; Fearns, R.",Genome Stability,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128033098000021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128033098000021,413

615847,"COVID 19 in-hospital mortality, body mass index and obesity related conditions",2021-09-28,"The experience of residential relocation can affect children and adolescents in various ways. It often affects their close social relationships, and this is especially true when these individuals are no longer in close proximity to their family members and friends. Although face-to-face communication may be limited after relocation, computer-mediated communication can assist in maintaining and developing existing relationships. It may even help individuals initiate new social relationships. In the present study, we investigated the role of communication behavior with friends for perceived friendship quality among children and adolescents who recently experienced residential relocation. Based on a representative survey study of families in Germany, we selected parents having moved with their child (8 to 14 years) to another village or town within the last 24 months. In total, 57 parents who had recently moved – majority of whom were mothers – allowed their child to participate in the phone interview. These participants were, on average, 11 years of age, and 58% of them were male. The children answered questions about their communication behavior and the friendships they had with their three current best friends. Using multilevel analysis, we found that children and adolescents who more often communicated face-to-face with their friends also more intensively used computer-mediated technologies to stay in touch. However, the findings further revealed that computer-mediated communication has the potential to remove limitations in existing friendships in the event of relocation.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to test whether adverse RV remodeling (dysfunction/dilation) predicts COVID-19 prognosis independent of clinical and biomarker risk stratification. METHODS: Consecutive COVID-19 inpatients undergoing clinical transthoracic echocardiography at 3 New York City hospitals were studied; images were analyzed by a central core laboratory blinded to clinical and biomarker data. RESULTS: In total, 510 patients (age 64 ± 14 years, 66% men) were studied; RV dilation and dysfunction were present in 35% and 15%, respectively. RV dysfunction increased stepwise in relation to RV chamber size (p = 0.007). During inpatient follow-up (median 20 days), 77% of patients had a study-related endpoint (death 32%, discharge 45%).

RV indices provided additional risk stratification beyond biomarker strata; risk for death was greatest among patients with adverse RV remodeling and positive biomarkers and was lesser among patients with isolated biomarker elevations (p ≤ 0.001). In multivariate analysis, adverse RV remodeling conferred a >2-fold increase in mortality risk, which remained significant (p < 0.01) when controlling for age and biomarker elevations; the predictive value of adverse RV remodeling was similar irrespective of whether analyses were performed using troponin, D-dimer, or ferritin. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse RV remodeling predicts mortality in COVID-19 independent of standard clinical and biomarker-based assessment.","Kim, Jiwon; Volodarskiy, Alexander; Sultana, Razia; Pollie, Meridith P.; Yum, Brian; Nambiar, Lakshmi; Tafreshi, Romina; Mitlak, Hannah W.; RoyChoudhury, Arindam; Horn, Evelyn M.; Hriljac, Ingrid; Narula, Nupoor; Kim, Sijun; Ndhlovu, Lishomwa; Goyal, Parag; Safford, Monika M.; Shaw, Leslee; Devereux, Richard B.; Weinsaft, Jonathan W.",J Am Coll Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092732/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.08.066; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735109720365505; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109720365505,413

However, its impact on customer decision-making behavior is unknown. Focusing on technology innovation for reducing guest interaction with employees and enhancing cleanliness, the purpose of this research was to examine the impact of expected interaction and expected cleanliness on perceived health risk and hotel booking intention. Three experimental studies were conducted using online consumer samples. The studies found that low levels of expected interaction through technology-mediated systems lead to low levels of perceived health risk. Perceived health risk mediates the relationship between expected interaction and hotel booking intention. In addition, high levels of expected cleanliness through advanced cleaning technologies moderate the impacts of expected interaction on perceived health risk. Importantly, the proposed perceived risk mechanism was effective in post-pandemic scenarios. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Shin, Hakseung; Kang, Juhyun",Int J Hosp Manag,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278431920302164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921871/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431920302164; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102664,413

In the majority of patients the most active virus replication seems to be found in the upper respiratory tract, severe cases however suffer from SARS-like disease associated with virus replication in lung tissues. Due to the current lack of suitable anti-viral drugs the induction of protective immunity such as neutralizing antibodies in the lung is the key aim of the only alternative approach—the development and application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, past experience from experimental animals, livestock, and humans showed that induction of immunity in the lung is limited following application of vaccines at peripheral sides such as skin or muscles. Based on several considerations we therefore propose here to consider the application of a Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine to mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract as a favorable approach to combat COVID-19.","Förster, Reinhold; Fleige, Henrike; Sutter, Gerd",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32849655/,413

Surgical resection is generally the first line of treatment with neck dissection, radiation, and chemotherapy decided based on clinical, radiological, and histological parameters. We present a case of a Secretory Carcinoma presenting in the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. CASE: A 39-year-old male presented with left nasal obstruction and chronic rhinosinusitis beginning after surgical repair of the mandible and maxilla due to facial trauma. A CT scan of the head showed soft tissue density in the left maxillary sinus extending through the ethmoid sinus and posterior nasal cavity. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) was performed to remove the obstructing lesion. Biopsy was analysed and the main differential diagnosis was between a non-intestinal type adenocarcinoma of nasal origin and a salivary carcinoma. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, there have only been two cases of Secretory Carcinoma reported in the sinuses: one case in the ethmoid sinus and the other in the maxillary sinus. This is the first to report follow up at 1 year. CONCLUSION: Both MRI and exam showed no evidence of recurrent disease at one year follow up. This report aims to further the understanding of Secretory Carcinoma tumours in the sinuses. Our report could be used to further understand diagnostic criteria for Secretory Carcinoma in the sinuses as well as treatment outcomes for surgical resection without adjuvant treatment.","Willis, Kurt; Bullock, Martin; Rigby, Matthew H.",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.105750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743245/,413

METHODS: We applied an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach to elicit the impact of NPIs on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate R(0) in Germany. Effectiveness was defined as the product of efficacy and compliance. A discrete, deterministic SEIR model with time step of 1 day, a latency period of 1.8 days, duration of infectiousness of 5 days, and a share of the total population of 15% assumed to be protected by immunity was developed in order to estimate the impact of selected NPI measures on the course of the pandemic. The model was populated with the Delphi-panel results and varied in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Efficacy and compliance estimates for the three most effective NPIs were as follows: test and isolate 49% (efficacy)/78% (compliance), keeping distance 42%/74%, personal protection masks (cloth masks or other face masks) 33%/79%. Applying all NPI effectiveness estimates to the SEIR model resulted in a valid replication of reported occurrence of the German SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A combination of four NPIs at consented compliance rates might curb the CoViD-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Employing an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach can support SARS-CoV-2 modelling. Future curbing scenarios require a combination of NPIs. A Delphi-panel-based NPI assessment and modelling might support public health policy decision making by informing sequence and number of needed public health measures.

Yet despite its extensive use, it has not drawn much philosophical attention. In this paper, I question the common understanding of recovery, show how the concept is inadequate, and introduce new and much needed terminology. I argue that recovery glosses over important distinctions and even misrepresents the process of moving away from malady as ""going back"" to a former state of health. It does not invite important nuances needed to distinguish between biomedical, phenomenological, and social perspectives. In addition, I claim that there are many conditions where we are making use of the concept of recovery, although the person recovered from the condition in question, has not regained the same degree of soundness. I show how the concept of recovery leads to conceptual discrepancies that can result in worsening patients' conditions. To gain a fuller understanding, I propose to rethink the direction of the process in question. I define the process of moving away from malady as a move forward towards a new state of soundness. I also suggest three terms, corresponding to different perspectives, to describe this movement forward: 'curing' (biomedical perspective), 'healing' (first-person perspective), and 'habilitating' (social perspective). This new terminology provides a more nuanced understanding of the states of both malady and soundness and an attentiveness as to how they differ and relate.","Friedman, Yael",Med Health Care Philos,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11019-021-10014-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33811591/,413

In this study, based on the conserved p72 gene sequence of ASFV, we combined the Cas12a-based assay with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and a fluorophore-quencher (FQ)-labeled reporter assay for rapid and visible detection. Five crRNAs designed for Cas12a-based assay showed specificity with remarkable fluorescence intensity under visual inspection. Within 20 minutes, with an initial concentration of two copies of DNA, the assay can produce significant differences between experimental and negative groups, indicating the high sensitivity and rapidity of the method.

There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date.

A limited number of studies assessed the adherence to stroke performance measures during the pandemic. We examined rates of stroke hospitalization and adherence to stroke quality-of-care measures before and during the early phase of pandemic. METHODS: We identified hospitalizations with a clinical diagnosis of acute stroke or transient ischemic attack among 406 hospitals who contributed data to the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program. We used 10 performance measures to examine the effect of the pandemic on stroke quality of care. We compared data from 2 periods: pre–COVID-19 (week 11–24 in 2019) and COVID-19 (week 11–24 in 2020). We used χ(2) tests for differences in categorical variables and the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney rank test or Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous variables. RESULTS: We identified 64,461 hospitalizations. We observed a 20.2% reduction in stroke hospitalizations (from 35,851 to 28,610) from the pre–COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period. Hospitalizations among patients aged 85 or older, women, and non-Hispanic White patients declined the most. A greater percentage of patients aged 18 to 64 were hospitalized with ischemic stroke during COVID-19 than during pre–COVID-19 (34.4% vs 32.5%, P < .001). Stroke severity was higher during COVID-19 than during pre–COVID-19 for both hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke, and in-hospital death among patients with ischemic stroke increased from 4.3% to 5.0% (P = .003) during the study period. We found no differences in rates of receiving care across stroke type during the study period. CONCLUSION: Despite a significant reduction in stroke hospitalizations, more severe stroke among hospitalized patients, and an increase in in-hospital death during the pandemic period, we found no differences in adherence to quality of stroke care measures.","Tong, Xin; King, Sallyann M.

623664,Addendum to Systematic Review of Remdesivir for the Treatment of COVID-19,2020-05-22,"Empathy is a concept associated with various positive outcomes. However, to measure such a multifaceted concept, valid and reliable tools are needed. Negatively worded items (NWIs) are suspected to decrease some psychometric parameters of assessment instruments, which complicates the research of empathy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the factor structure and validity of the TEQ on the Czech population, including the influence of the NWIs. Data were collected from three surveys. In total, 2239 Czech participants were included in our study. Along with socio-demographic information, we measured empathy, neuroticism, spirituality, self-esteem, compassion and social desirability. NWI in general yielded low communalities, factor loadings and decreased internal consistency. Therefore, in the next steps, we tested the model consisting of their positively reformulated versions. A higher empathy was found in females, married and religious individuals. We further found positive associations between empathy, compassion and spirituality. After the sample was split in half, exploratory factor analysis of the model with reformulated items was followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which supported a unidimensional solution with good internal consistency: Cronbach’s α = 0.85 and McDonald’s ω = 0.85. The CFA indicated an acceptable fit χ(2) (14) = 83.630; p < 0.001; CFI = 0.997; TLI = 0.995; RMSEA = 0.070; SRMR = 0.037. The Czech version of the TEQ is a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of empathy. The use of NWIs in Czech or in a similar language environment seems to be questionable and their rewording may represent a more reliable approach.","Novak, Lukas; Malinakova, Klara; Mikoska, Petr; van Dijk, Jitse P.; Dechterenko, Filip; Ptacek, Radek; Tavel, Peter",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067852/,413

On microscopic fluid review, abnormal immature cells with bilobed nuclear contours were identified, similar in morphology to those seen on the diagnostic blood smear review, amidst background alveolar-type macrophages. Subsequent flow cytometric analysis showed these cells to be abnormal promyelocytes; however, they differed from the blood flow cytometry study performed prior to initiation of ATRA by showing maturational immunophenotypic changes. While the leukemic promyelocytes on bronchoalveolar lavage were morphologically immature, these immunophenotypic changes somewhat recapitulated those seen in normal granulocyte maturation and were thus suggestive of so-called differentiation syndrome. Unfortunately, the patient passed away during induction chemotherapy due to complications from diffuse intravascular coagulation and differentiation syndrome. Important pathobiological information can be gathered from fluid review and concomitant flow cytometric analysis.","Seifert, Robert P.; Gregory, Scott",J Hematop,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12308-020-00428-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33488839/,413

Several studies of severe COVID-19 patients regard convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion as an effective therapy. However, there are no significant improvements in the randomized clinical trial of CP treatment. Until now, the data of mild COVID-19 patients transfused CP were lack. This study recruited 8 mild COVID-19 patients received at least one dose of CP transfusion. After CP therapy, all patients improved the clinical symptoms. The level of lymphocyte counts tended to increase, meanwhile LDH, CK and AST tended to decrease. However, CRP of 3 patients increased transiently. The median time that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid of the patients turned to negative was 2.5d after CP transfusion. The study shows the potential benefits of CP. Meanwhile, CP probably enhances the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 temporarily in the patients with insufficient antiviral immunity. However, the effects of CP are not permanent.","Ji, Fang; Liu, Wen; Hao, Da-ang; Cheng, Juan; Tong, Xue-cheng; Hao, Jun-gui; Wang, Li-ping; Li, Chun-yang; Dai, Ming-jia; Yan, Xue-bing",New Microbes New Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204428/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297520301669?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2052297520301669; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100814,413

Thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1) is used in the management of COVID-19, because it is known to restore the homeostasis of the immune system during infections and cancers. We aim to observe the longitudinal changes in T lymphocyte subsets and to evaluate the efficacy of Tα1 for COVID-19. A retrospective study was conducted in 275 COVID-19 patients admitted to Shanghai public health clinical center. The clinical and laboratory characteristics between patients with different T lymphocyte phenotypes and those who were and were not treated with Tα1 were compared. Among the 275 patients, 137 (49.8%) were males, and the median age was 51 years [interquartile range (IQR): 37-64]. A total of 126 patients received Tα1 therapy and 149 patients did not. There were 158 (57.5%) patients with normal baseline CD4 counts (median:631/μL, IQR: 501~762) and 117 patients (42.5%) with decreased baseline CD4 counts (median:271/μL, IQR: 201~335). In those with decreased baseline CD4 counts, more patients were older (p<0.001), presented as critically ill (p=0.032) and had hypertension (p=0.008) compared with those with normal CD4 counts. There was no statistical difference in the duration of virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract between the two groups (p=0.214). In both the normal (14 vs 11, p=0.028) and the decreased baseline CD4 counts group (15 vs 11, p=0.008), duration of virus clearance in the patients with Tα1 therapy was significantly longer than that in those without Tα1 therapy. There was no significant difference in the increase of CD4+ (286 vs 326, p=0.851) and CD8+ T cell (154 vs 170, p=0.842) counts in the recovery period between the two groups with or without Tα1 therapy. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that severity of illness (p<0.001) and Tα1 therapy (p=0.001) were associated with virus clearance. In conclusion, reduction of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell counts were observed in COVID-19 patients. Tα1 may have no benefit on restoring CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts or on the virus clearance. The use of Tα1 for COVID-19 need to be more fully investigated.","Wang, Zhenyan; Chen, Jun; Zhu, Cuiyun; Liu, Li; Qi, Tangkai; Shen, Yinzhong; Zhang, Yuyi; Xu, Lie; Li, Tao; Qian, Zhiping; Steinhart, Corklin R.; Lu, Hongzhou",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.568789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149679/,413

The county is bracing the third wave at a time when challenges like continuous conflict, illiteracy, poverty, inadequate healthcare personnel and service coverage, inadequate testing capacity, shortage of laboratory kits and reagents, lower public awareness and lower public trust on the government have brought it to its knees. All stakeholders including government, healthcare workers, civil societies, the public and the international community should combine their efforts to combat such a devastating situation. Although the inception of vaccination program against COVID-19 seems relieving, but it may take several months until a significant proportion of the people get vaccinated to reach the herd immunity. Thus, non-pharmaceutical intervention should be followed strictly. Moreover, awareness campaigns should also be continued to educate people and keep them supportive of the government plans and policies.

626347,Reduction of IBD healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide retrospective cohort study,2020-10-22,"COVID‐19 has infected millions of patients and impacted healthcare workers worldwide. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is a key component of protecting frontline clinicians against infection. The benefits of PPE far outweigh the risks, nonetheless, many clinicians are exhibiting skin injury caused by PPE worn incorrectly. These skin injuries, ranging from lesions to open wounds are concerning because they increase the susceptibility of viral infection and transmission to other individuals. Early into the COVID‐19 pandemic (April 2020), the U.S. National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP) developed a series of position statements to improve wear‐ability of PPE and protect healthcare professionals and their patients as safe from harm as possible under the circumstances. The NPIAP positions, which were formed by conducting a systematic review of what was known at the time, include: (1) Prepare skin before and after wearing PPE with skin sealants, barrier creams and moisturizers; (2) Frequent PPE offloading to relieve pressure and shear applied to skin; (3) treat visible skin injuries immediately caused by PPE to minimize future infection; (4) non‐porous dressings may provide additional skin protection, but lack evidence; (5) health systems should take care to educate clinicians about placement and personal hygiene related to handling PPE. Throughout all of these practices, handwashing remains a top priority to handle PPE. These NPIAP positions provided early guidance to reduce the risk of skin injury caused by PPE based on available research regarding PPE injuries, a cautious application of evidence‐based recommendations on prevention of device related pressure injuries in patients and the expert opinion of the NPIAP Board of Directors. Clinicians who adhere to these recommendations reduce the prospects of skin damage and long‐term effects (e.g. scarring). These simple steps to minimize the risk of skin injury and reduce the risk of coronavirus infection from PPE can help.","Padula, William V.; Cuddigan, Janet; Ruotsi, Lee; Black, Joyce M.; Brienza, David; Capasso, Virginia; Cox, Jill; Delmore, Barbara; Holden‐Mount, Sarah; Munoz, Nancy; Nie, Ann Marie; Pittman, Joyce; Sonenblum, Sharon; Tescher, Ann",J Clin Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534939/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15682,413

The reported results were controversial, so the objective of the present study is to assess the relationship between different blood groups and the onset and mortality of COVID-19 infection using meta-analysis method. Methods We searched the databases using appropriate MeSH terms. We screened articles on the basis of titles, abstracts, and full texts, and the articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Quality assessment was done with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale checklist. The estimated frequency of COVID-19 infection and death in terms of ABO blood group and the overall estimate of the odd ratio between blood group with COVID-19 infection and death was done with 95% confidence interval. Results The pooled frequency of blood groups A, B, O, and AB among COVID-19 infected individuals was estimated as 36.22%, 24.99%, 29.67%, and 9.29% respectively. The frequency of blood groups A, B, O, and AB among the dead cases due to COVID-19 infection was estimated as 40%, 23%, 29%, and 8% respectively. The odd ratio of COVID-19 infection for blood group A versus the other blood groups was estimated 1.16 (CI 95%: 1.02-1.33). The corresponding figures for blood groups O and AB versus other blood groups were estimated as 0.73 (CI 95%: 0.60-0.88) and 1.25(CI 95%: 0.84-1.86) respectively. Conclusion This meta-analysis showed that individuals with blood group A are at higher risk for COVID-19 infection while those with blood group O are at lower risk. Although the odds ratio of death for AB blood group was non-significant, it was considerable.","Pourali, Fatemeh; Afshari, Mahdi; Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza; Javidnia, Javad; Moosazadeh, Mahmood; Hessami, Amirhossein",New Microbes New Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297520300950?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837730/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2052297520300950; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100743,413

627371,The specialty-variation effect on the utilization of outpatient service at the COVID-contained hospitals in Taiwan,2021-05-06,"OBJECTIVES: Measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are collected throughout healthcare systems and used in clinical, economic, and outcomes studies to direct patient-centered care and inform health policy. Studies have demonstrated increases in stressors unique to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, their effect on HRQOL is unknown. Our study aimed to assess the change in self-reported global health during the pandemic for patients receiving care in a large healthcare system compared with 1 year earlier. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study of 2 periods was conducted including adult patients who had a healthcare appointment and completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health (PROMIS GH) as standard care during the COVID-19 pandemic and a year earlier. The effect of time on PROMIS global mental health (GMH) and global physical health (GPH) was evaluated through multiple statistical methods. RESULTS: There were 38 037 patients (mean age 56.1 ± 16.6 years; 61% female; 87% white) who completed the PROMIS GH during the pandemic (August 2020) and 33 080 (age 56.7 ± 16.5 years; 61% female; 86% white) who had completed it 1 year earlier (August 2019). GMH was significantly worse, whereas GPH was similar during the pandemic compared with a year earlier (adjusted estimate [standard error]: −1.21 (0.08) and 0.11 (0.08) T-score points, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study found modest, nonclinically meaningful decreases in GMH and similar GPH during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with a year earlier in patients cared for in a large healthcare system. Nevertheless, healthcare systems are likely seeing a biased sample of patients during these times. Findings from our study have implications for the interpretation of HRQOL during this pandemic.","Lapin, Brittany R.; Tang, Wai Hong Wilson; Honomichl, Ryan; Hogue, Olivia; Katzan, Irene L.",Value Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301521016119; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301521016119; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.06.009,413

OBJECTIVE: To determine the viral etiology and epidemiology of ILI in households. STUDY DESIGN: ILI was detected by active case finding amongst a cohort of 263 northern Vietnam households between 2008 and 2013. Health workers collected nose and throat swabs for virus detection by multiplex real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: ILI was detected at least once in 219 (23.7%) of 945 household members. 271 (62.3%) of 435 nose/throat swabs were positive for at least one of the 15 viruses tested. Six viruses predominated amongst positive swabs: Rhinovirus (28%), Influenza virus (17%), Coronavirus (8%), Enterovirus (5%), Respiratory syncytial virus (3%), Metapneumovirus virus (2.5%) and Parainfluenza virus 3 (1.8%). There was no clear seasonality, but 78% of episodes occurred in Winter/Spring for Influenza compared to 32% for Rhinovirus. Participants, on average, suffered 0.49 ILI, and 0.29 virus-positive ILI episodes, with no significant effects of gender, age, or household size. In contrast to US and Australian community studies, the frequency of ILI decreased as the number of household members aged below 5 years increased (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the need for tailored ILI control strategies, and for better understanding of how local childcare practices and seasonality may influence transmission and the role of children.","Nguyen, Diep Ngoc Thi; Mai, Le Quynh; Bryant, Juliet E.; Hang, Nguyen Le Khanh; Hoa, Le Nguyen Minh; Nadjm, Behzad; Thai, Pham Quang; Duong, Tran Nhu; Anh, Dang Duc; Horby, Peter; van Doorn, H.

Frequent points of mutations and recombination events in the S1 gene region, result in the emergence of new IBVs variants circulating in the form of several serotypes/genotypes that can be partially or poorly neutralized by current vaccines. IBV is well studied worldwide, nevertheless in African countries epidemiological and scientific data are poor and not updated. This review aims to give a current overview of IBV situation, to establish evolutionary relationship between the African variants and to list some of the potential measures to control IBV in Africa. Three S1 gene hypervariable regions were studied and compared to the reference genotypes/serotypes that found emerging in African regions. This comparison was based on phylogenetic trees, nucleotide and amino-acid sequence analysis. It clearly appears that IBV variants reported in Africa, display a low genetic relationship between them and with the majority of the reference strains emerging in neighboring countries, except the case of variants from Libya and Egypt that show a high relatedness. Also the Massachusetts serotypes were the most prevalent co-circulating with both serotypes, Italy02 type in Morocco and Qx-like genotype in South part of the African continent. In order to control the IBV variants in African regions, an efficient vaccination strategy program should be implemented.","Khataby, Khadija; Souiri, Amal; Kasmi, Yassine; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Ennaji, My Mustapha",J Basic Appl Zool,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288944/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2090989616300200; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090989616300200; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobaz.2016.08.002,413

Chest computed tomography (CT) images of patients who are infected with COVID-19 can offer early diagnosis and efficient forecast monitoring at a low cost. The diagnosis of COVID-19 on CT in an automated way can speed up many tasks and the application of medical treatments. This can help complement reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnosis. The aim of this work is to develop a system that automatically identifies ground-glass opacity (GGO) and pulmonary infiltrates (PIs) on CT images from patients with COVID-19. The purpose is to assess the disease progression during the patient's follow-up assessment and evaluation. We propose an efficient methodology that incorporates oversegmentation mean shift followed by superpixel-SLIC (simple linear iterative clustering) algorithm on CT images with COVID-19 for pulmonary parenchyma segmentation. To identify the pulmonary parenchyma, we described each superpixel cluster according to its position, grey intensity, second-order texture, and spatial-context-saliency features to classify by a tree random forest (TRF). Second, by applying the watershed segmentation to the mean-shift clusters, only pulmonary parenchyma segmentation-identified zones showed GGO and PI based on the description of each watershed cluster of its position, grey intensity, gradient entropy, second-order texture, Euclidean position to the border region of the PI zone, and global saliency features, after using TRF. Our classification results for pulmonary parenchyma identification on CT images with COVID-19 had a precision of over 92% and recall of over 92% on twofold cross validation. For GGO, the PI identification showed 96% precision and 96% recall on twofold cross validation.","Tello-Mijares, Santiago; Woo, Luisa",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968356/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8869372,413

The population was young, mean of age is 38.8±11.6. (Median: 36 [Min: 19 - Max: 85]). Complete blood count of the sample had minimal missing data points. Females were more presented in our samples, Female (n=560, 58.21%) and Male (n=402, 41.79%). Most of our sample had a documented PCR test result, negative (n=831, 86.38%); positive (n=123, 12.79%) and missing (n=8, 0.83%). Low haemoglobin values (n=265, 27.5%) and low red blood cell count (n =170, 17.7%) were the most prevalent complete blood count abnormality in the population. Leukopenia was less common (n=50, 8.2%). Most of the population had normal platelet count (n=895, 93%). Gender was the most influential factor in our sample to increase the odds of having a positive PCR test results; males were more likely to be affected (P<0.001, Chi-square test) (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.73-3.77). Categories for haematological abnormalities were not associated with increased risk of having a positive PCT test result. In a population attending primary healthcare settings with early presentation of symptoms of COVID-19 infection, the risk of infection among our cohort was not affected by the prior haematological values of those patients. Gender was the most influential parameter in the risk of infection in our population. Analysis of the results using gender-specific categories for different haematological parameters suggested that patients with abnormal haematological values were not at increased risk of having a positive COVID-19 infection.","Hamed, Ehab; Syed, Mohamed Ahmed; Alnuaimi, Ahmed Sameer; Soliman, Mohammed; Alemrayat, Bayan; Muktar, Amina Ali Mohamed; AlFehaidi, AlAnoud Saleh; AlQotba, Hamda Abdulla",Hematol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282166/; https://doi.org/10.4081/hr.2020.8829,413

In the glomerular and tubular compartments of the nephron, consistent studies demonstrated that well-characterized, distinct populations of progenitor cells, localized in the parietal epithelium of Bowman capsule and scattered in the proximal and distal tubules, could generate segment-specific cells in physiological conditions and following tissue injury. However, defective or abnormal regenerative responses of these progenitors can contribute to pathologic conditions. The molecular characteristics of renal progenitors have been extensively studied, revealing that numerous classical and evolutionarily conserved pathways, such as Notch or Wnt/β-catenin, play a major role in cell regulation. Others, such as retinoic acid, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2) and leptin, are also important in this process. In this review, we summarize the plethora of molecular mechanisms directing renal progenitor responses during homeostasis and following kidney injury. Finally, we will explore how single-cell RNA sequencing could bring the characterization of renal progenitors to the next level, while knowing their molecular signature is gaining relevance in the clinic.","Peired, Anna Julie; Melica, Maria Elena; Molli, Alice; Nardi, Cosimo; Romagnani, Paola; Lasagni, Laura",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33401654/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10010059,413

Furthermore, many viral zoonoses have emerged or reemerged in recent years, highlighting the importance of such diseases. Emerging viral zoonoses encompass a vast number of different viruses and many different transmission modes. There are many factors influencing the epidemiology of the various zoonoses, such as ecological changes, changes in agriculture and food production, the movement of pathogens, including via travel and trade, human behavior and demographical factors, and microbial changes and adaptation.

At this critical moment, it makes sense to interpret the systemic risk from the perspective of the financial crisis framework. By combing the latest research on systemic risks, we may arrive at some precautions relating to the current events. This literature review verifies the origin of systemic risk research. By comparing the retrieved and screened systemic literature with the relevant research on the financial crisis, more focus on the micro-foundations of systemic risk has been discovered. Besides, the measurement methods of systemic risks and the introduction of interdisciplinary methods have made the research in this field particularly active. This paper synthesizes the previous research conclusions to find the appropriate definition of systemic risk and combs the research literature of systemic risk from two lines: Firstly, conducting the division according to the sub-branch fields within the financial discipline and the relevant interdisciplinary research methods, which is helpful for scholars within and outside the discipline to have a more systematic understanding of the research in this field.

The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence, incidence and outcomes across a range of specific CVDs among homeless individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS : Using linked UK primary care electronic health records (EHRs) and validated phenotypes, we identified homeless individuals aged ≥16 years between 1998 and 2019, and age- and sex-matched housed controls in a 1:5 ratio. For 12 CVDs (stable angina; unstable angina; myocardial infarction; sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest; unheralded coronary death; heart failure; transient ischaemic attack; ischaemic stroke; subarachnoid haemorrhage; intracerebral haemorrhage; peripheral arterial disease; abdominal aortic aneurysm), we estimated prevalence, incidence, and 1-year mortality post-diagnosis, comparing homeless and housed groups. We identified 8492 homeless individuals (32 134 matched housed individuals). Comorbidities and risk factors were more prevalent in homeless people, e.g. smoking: 78.1% vs. 48.3% and atrial fibrillation: 9.9% vs. 8.6%, P < 0.001. CVD prevalence (11.6% vs. 6.5%), incidence (14.7 vs. 8.1 per 1000 person-years), and 1-year mortality risk [adjusted hazard ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29–2.08, P < 0.001] were higher, and onset was earlier (difference 4.6, 95% CI 2.8–6.3 years, P < 0.001), in homeless, compared with housed people. Homeless individuals had higher CVD incidence in all three arterial territories than housed people. CONCLUSION : CVD in homeless individuals has high prevalence, incidence, and 1-year mortality risk post-diagnosis with earlier onset, and high burden of risk factors. Inclusion health and social care strategies should reflect this high preventable and treatable burden, which is increasingly important in the current COVID-19 context.","Nanjo, Atsunori; Evans, Hannah; Direk, Kenan; Hayward, Andrew C; Story, Alistair; Banerjee, Amitava",Eur Heart J,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33205821/,413

This study assessed changes in HFI during the pandemic and examined the interlinkages between HFI with child feeding practices and coping strategies. DESIGN: A longitudinal survey in December 2019 (in-person) and August 2020 (by phone). SETTING: Community-based individuals from 26 blocks in 2 districts in Uttar Pradesh, India. PARTICIPANTS: Mothers with children <2 years (n=569). MAIN OUTCOMES AND ANALYSES: We measured HFI by using the HFI Access Scale and examined the changes in HFI during the pandemic using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. We then assessed child feeding practices and coping strategies by HFI status using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: HFI increased sharply from 21% in December 2019 to 80% in August 2020, with 62% households changing the status from food secure to insecure over this period. Children in newly or consistently food-insecure households were less likely to consume a diverse diet (adjusted OR, AOR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95 and AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.12, respectively) compared with those in food-secure households. Households with consistent food insecurity were more likely to engage in coping strategies such as reducing other essential non-food expenditures (AOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.24), borrowing money to buy food (AOR 4.3, 95% CI 2.31 to 7.95) or selling jewellery (AOR 5.0, 95% CI 1.74 to 14.27) to obtain foods. Similar findings were observed for newly food-insecure households. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown measures posed a significant risk to HFI which in turn had implications for child feeding practices and coping strategies. Our findings highlight the need for further investment in targeted social protection strategies and safety nets as part of multisectoral solutions to improve HFI during and after COVID-19.","Nguyen, Phuong Hong; Kachwaha, Shivani; Pant, Anjali; Tran, Lan M; Ghosh, Sebanti; Sharma, Praveen Kumar; Shastri, Vishal Dev; Escobar-Alegria, Jessica; Avula, Rasmi; Menon, Purnima",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883156/,413
633328,The role of obesity in inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients,2020-12-23,"BACKGROUND: Individuals admitted to hospital for COVID-19 might have persisting symptoms (so-called long COVID) and delayed complications after discharge. However, little is known regarding the risk for those not admitted to hospital. We therefore examined prescription drug and health-care use after SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study using the Danish prescription, patient, and health insurance registries. All individuals with a positive or negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark between Feb 27 and May 31, 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Outcomes of interest were delayed acute complications, chronic disease, hospital visits due to persisting symptoms, and prescription drug use. We used data from non-hospitalised SARS-CoV-2-positive and matched SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals from 2 weeks to 6 months after a SARS-CoV-2 test to obtain propensity score-weighted risk differences (RDs) and risk ratios (RRs) for initiation of 14 drug groups and 27 hospital diagnoses indicative of potential post-acute effects. We also calculated prior event rate ratio-adjusted rate ratios of overall health-care use. This study is registered in the EU Electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies (EUPAS37658). FINDINGS: 10 498 eligible individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark from Feb 27 to May 31, 2020, of whom 8983 (85·6%) were alive and not admitted to hospital 2 weeks after their positive test. The matched SARS-CoV-2-negative reference population not admitted to hospital consisted of 80 894 individuals. Compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals, SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals were not at an increased risk of initiating new drugs (RD <0·1%) except bronchodilating agents, specifically short-acting β2-agonists (117 [1·7%] of 6935 positive individuals vs 743 [1·3%] of 57 206 negative individuals; RD +0·4% [95% CI 0·1–0·7]; RR 1·32 [1·09–1·60]) and triptans (33 [0·4%] of 8292 vs 198 [0·3%] of 72 828; RD +0·1% [0·0–0·3]; RR 1·55 [1·07–2·25]). There was an increased risk of receiving hospital diagnoses of dyspnoea (103 [1·2%] of 8676 vs 499 [0·7%] of 76 728; RD +0·6% [0·4–0·8]; RR 2·00 [1·62–2·48]) and venous thromboembolism (20 [0·2%] of 8785 vs 110 [0·1%] of 78 872; RD +0·1% [0·0–0·2]; RR 1·77 [1·09–2·86]) for SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals compared with negative individuals, but no increased risk of other diagnoses. Prior event rate ratio-adjusted rate ratios of overall general practitioner visits (1·18 [95% CI 1·15–1·22]) and outpatient hospital visits (1·10 [1·05–1·16]), but not hospital admission, showed increases among SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. INTERPRETATION: The absolute risk of severe post-acute complications after SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission is low. However, increases in visits to general practitioners and outpatient hospital visits could indicate COVID-19 sequelae.

In this study, referencing the data published on the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 7BV2) on April 22, we conducted a detailed analysis of the interaction between the complex structures of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 and Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, from the quantum chemical perspective based on the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method. In addition to the hydrogen bonding and intra-strand stacking between complementary strands as seen in normal base pairs, Remdesivir bound to the terminus of an primer-RNA strand was further stabilized by diagonal π-π stacking with the -1A’ base of the complementary strand and an additional hydrogen bond with an intra-strand base, due to the effect of chemically modified functional group. Moreover, stable OH/π interaction is also formed with Thr687 of the RdRp.

The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the capacity of the many healthcare systems and created cascading economic impacts on interdependent sectors of the global society. This paper specifically explores the impact of pandemics on the workforce. The model proposed in this paper comprises of three major steps. First, sources for epidemic curves are identified to generate the attack rate, which is the daily number of infections normalized with respect to the population of the affected region. Second, the model assumes that the general attack rate can be specialized to reflect sector-specific workforce classifications, noting that each economic sector has varying dependence on the workforce. Third, using economic input-output (IO) data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, this paper analyzes the performance of several mitigation and suppression measures relative to a baseline pandemic scenario. Results from the IO simulations demonstrate the extent to which mitigation and suppression measures can flatten the curve. This paper concludes with reflections on other consequences of pandemics such as the mental health impacts associated with social isolation and the disproportionate effects on different socioeconomic groups.","Santos, Joost",Sustain Prod Consum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521216/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352550920305066; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352550920305066; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2020.06.001,413

In the COVID‐19 pandemic, it is urgent to understand the effects of antitumor therapy on the prognosis of patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, MedRxiv, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) until 21 June 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were evaluated using a random effects model to analyze the effects of antitumor therapies on COVID‐19 patients. RESULTS: For cancer patients with COVID‐19, the death events related to antitumor treatment were higher than those with no antitumor treatment (OR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.07–2.25; p = 0.021). Compared with patients in the survival group, the non‐survival group showed no significant differences in patients who received antitumor therapy. Compared with patients in the non‐severe group, the severe group was more likely to receive antitumor therapy (OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.02–2.19; p = 0.037) and there was a significant difference. The incidence of severe events was higher in the subgroup of chemotherapy (OR = 1.73; 95% CI 1.09–2.73). CONCLUSION: The synthesized evidence suggests that cancer patients with COVID‐19 who received antitumor treatment shortly before symptom onset are more likely to experience severe symptoms and have high mortality.

This study aimed to explore the prevalence of common respiratory viruses among hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Respiratory specimens were obtained from children with LRTI at Children’s Hospital of Fudan University for detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1 to 3, influenza virus A (FluA), influenza virus B (FluB), human metapneumovirus (MPV) and rhinovirus (RV). The data were analyzed and compared between the year of 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic) and 2019 (before COVID-19 pandemic). RESULTS: A total of 7107 patients were enrolled, including 4600 patients in 2019 and 2507 patients in 2020. Compared with 2019, we observed an unprecedented reduction of RSV, ADV, FluA, FluB, and MPV infections in 2020, despite of reopening of schools in June, 2020. However, the RV infection was significantly increased in 2020 and a sharp increase was observed especially after reopening of schools. Besides, the PIV infection showed resurgent characteristic after September of 2020. The mixed infections were significantly less frequent in 2020 compared with the year of 2019.

To examine the relationship between loneliness, perceived social support, and anxiety, we measured 222 Chinese participants’ (54.50% female, M(age) = 31.53, SD = 8.17) trait loneliness, chronic anxiety before the outbreak, COVID-19 anxiety at the peak and decline stages of COVID-19, and their perceived social support across the three time points. The results showed that people’s perceived social support dramatically increased from the pre-pandemic to the peak COVID-19 stage, and remained stable during the decline of COVID-19 stage. In contrast, COVID-19 anxiety decreased from the peak to the decline stage. Further, perceived social support consistently moderated the relationship between loneliness with both chronic anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety. The current study provides initial evidence that perceived social support provides protection for lonely people in daily life as well as during unexpected disasters, which will contribute to finding ways to alleviate lonely people’s anxiety during this global health crisis.","Xu, Jianjie; Ou, Jingyi; Luo, Shuyi; Wang, Zhuojun; Chang, Edward; Novak, Claire; Shen, Jingyi; Zheng, Shaoying; Wang, Yinan",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240152/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.566965,413

Especially, they highlighted the importance of religious/spiritual interventions in order to provide an integral and holistic care. In this perspective, an important consequence of the social isolation is the closure of churches and the suspension of religious meetings in order to avoid agglomeration and contagion. However, although this is a very important approach in terms of public health, a question is raised: how to promote spiritual care and help spiritual/religious individuals to cope with their problems while maintaining compliance with social isolation? To address this question, we report the Spiritual Hotline Project, a project designed by many Brazilian healthcare workers intended to give spiritual and religious assistance to people with different cultural background. So far, the hotline was able to assist people from different parts of the world, including Brazil and Portugal as well as with different religious affiliation, in order to provide a spiritual comfort and care during this public health crisis.","Ribeiro, Marcus Renato Castro; Damiano, Rodolfo Furlan; Marujo, Ricardo; Nasri, Fabio; Lucchetti, Giancarlo",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32696967/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa120,413

Despite well-established guides and recommendations regarding environmental surface cleaning and disinfection, there are several challenges in resource-limited settings. This viewpoint article will discuss the practice of environmental cleaning in resource-limited settings including challenges and relationship between environment and healthcare-associated infections in this setting and outlines pre-requisites to overcome these challenges. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite several barriers and challenges, environmental cleaning is a crucial component to help reduce transmission of healthcare-associated infections and multi-drug-resistant pathogens as well as emerging infectious disease-associated pathogens in resource-limited settings. However, there is a need to develop a multi-modal strategy together with a mechanism for monitor and feedback to improve the practices of environmental cleaning in resource-limited settings. SUMMARY: Additional researches on the barriers and implementation gaps and the role of collaborative network as well as how to apply technology would provide significant insights on the practices of environmental cleaning in resource-limited settings.","Apisarnthanarak, Anucha; Weber, David J.",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226320/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40506-018-0149-9,413

METHODS: The study was a multicentric open-label trial of COVID-19 patients who were aged ≥ 18 years, receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation, and with evidence of systemic inflammatory response who were assigned to standard of care (SOC) or SOC plus intravenous MP (40 mg bid for 3 days followed by 20 mg bid for 3 days). The primary outcome was a composite of death, admission to the intensive care unit, or requirement for noninvasive ventilation. Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients were screened, and 64 were randomized (mean age70 ± 12 years). In the ITT analysis, 14 of 29 patients (48%) in the SOC group and 14 of 35 (40%) in the MP group suffered the composite endpoint (40% versus 20% in patients under 72 years and 67% versus 48% in those over 72 years; p = 0.25). In the PP analysis, patients on MP had a significantly lower risk of experiencing the composite endpoint (age-adjusted risk ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.20–0.89; p = 0.043). CONCLUSION: The planned sample size was not achieved, and our results should therefore be interpreted with caution. The use of MP had no significant effect on the primary endpoint in ITT analysis; however, the PP analysis showed a beneficial effect due to MP, which consistent with other published trials support the use of glucocorticoids in severe cases of COVID-19.

Lapping or biting?,2020-06-01,"The novel coronavirus-related coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been relentless in disrupting and overwhelming healthcare the world over. Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with chronic comorbidities, especially in those with metabolic syndrome, are well documented. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis patients are a special sub-group, among whom the management of COVID-19 is challenging. Understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension improves our identification of at-risk patients for disease progression that will further help compartmentalize generalized and specialized treatment options in this special patient group. In this exhaustive review, we critically review the impact of COVID-19 on the liver and in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis patients. We further discuss common features associated with the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and cirrhosis, based on the renin-angiotensin system and deliberate current literature on guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 and extrapolate the same to the cirrhosis population to provide a concise and stepwise, evidence-based management for cirrhosis patients with severe and critical COVID-19. There are no specific management guidelines for cirrhosis patients with COVID-19 and current recommendations for treatment are as per guidelines for general population. Nevertheless, specific issues like avoiding corticosteroids in decompensated patients with variceal bleeding, suspected sepsis, high grade hepatic encephalopathy and acute kidney injury, use of early mechanical ventilation strategies in those with severe ascites and hepatopulmonary syndrome, avoidance of remdesivir in advanced liver disease, and application of liver-specific severity scores for prognostication and identification of futility need to be highlighted.","Philips, Cyriac Abby; Kakkar, Kamna; Joseph, Moby; Yerol, Praveen Kumar; Ahamed, Rizwan; Rajesh, Sasidharan; Augustine, Philip",J Clin Transl Hepatol,https://doi.org/10.14218/jcth.2020.00110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34447688/,413

The fusion of these wearable technologies in sporting garments can allow the objective assessment of the quality and the quantity of the muscle activity as well as the continuous monitoring of exercise programs. Several prototypes integrating EMG and NIRS have been developed previously; however, most devices presented the limitations of not measuring regional muscle oxyhemoglobin saturation and did not embed textile sensors for EMG. The purpose of this study was to compare regional muscle oxyhemoglobin saturation and surface EMG data, measured under resting and dynamic conditions (treadmill run and strength exercises) by a recently developed wearable integrated quadriceps muscle oximetry/EMG system adopting smart textiles for EMG, with those obtained by using two “gold standard” commercial instrumentations for EMG and muscle oximetry. The validity and agreement between the wearable integrated muscle oximetry/EMG system and the “gold standard” instrumentations were assessed by using the Bland-Altman agreement plots to determine the bias. The results support the validity of the data provided by the wearable electronic garment developed purposely for the quadriceps muscle group and suggest the potential of using such device to measure strength and endurance exercises in vivo in various populations.","Di Giminiani, Riccardo; Cardinale, Marco; Ferrari, Marco; Quaresima, Valentina",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32824976/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s20174664,413

Due to the large global impact COVID-19 has had on society, new entrepreneurial education management practices are required to deal with the change. To do this, this article discusses why COVID-19 can be a transformational opportunity for entrepreneurship education research due to the new thought processes raised by the pandemic. The article suggests several assumptions that have changed as a result of COVID-19 and how entrepreneurship education is required in order to help solve the pandemic. By doing this, the article suggests that more entrepreneurship education research embedding a COVID-19 context is required to breakthrough new frontiers and reset the research agenda. By taking an entrepreneurial stakeholder perspective that looks at entrepreneurship education as a holistic process, an enhanced analysis of how response mechanisms including recovery and change are conducted can be made.

AIMS: The aim of the study was to document cases of rhino-orbital mucormycosis seen at our Regional Institute of Ophthalmology during COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) times. METHODS: The study is a retrospective, institutional cohort, interventional study. It was carried out at our Regional Institute of Ophthalmology from September 2020 to mid-March 2021. All patients of biopsy-proven mucormycosis were enrolled in the study. The patients were subjected to complete history taking, ophthalmological examination, and imaging studies. The patients were treated via a multidisciplinary approach with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and debridement of local necrotic tissue. Exenteration was done when indicated. A minimum 75-day follow-up period was accorded to all study patients. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test. A P value ≤0.05 was taken as significant. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were seen, with a mean age of 56.3 years. The major risk factors included uncontrolled diabetes (96.7%) and COVID-19 positivity (61.2%), with concomitant steroid use in 61.2% patients. The most common presentation was diminution of vision (<6/60 in 80.64% patients) and ophthalmoplegia (77.4%). The most common imaging findings were orbital cellulitis (61.29%) and pansinusitis (77.4%). Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B was given to all patients for an average 18.93 days. Exenteration was required in (n = 4) 12.9% of cases. Twenty-eight patients recovered and were alive on follow-up. Mortality was seen in three patients.

The fear of becoming infected and the lockdown measures have drastically changed people's daily routine. The aim of this study is to establish the psychological impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is entailing, particularly with regards to levels of stress, anxiety and depression, and to the risks of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). METHODS: The study, carried out with a sample of 1612 subjects distributed in seven countries (Australia, China, Ecuador, Iran, Italy, Norway and the United States), allowed us to collect information about the psychological impact of COVID-19. RESULTS: The findings of this study show that the levels of stress, depression and anxiety, as well as the risks of PTSD, are higher than average in over half of the considered sample. The severity of these disorders significantly depends on gender, type of outdoor activities, characteristics of their homes, eventual presence of infected acquaintances, time dedicated to looking for related information (in the news and social networks), type of source information and, in part, to the level of education and income. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that COVID-19 has a very strong psychological impact on the global population.

A comparison of programs in the United States, Canada, France, the UK, and Australia indicates that they have similar function, although the structure of blood programs vary as does the extent and nature of formal ties with public health. The emergence of HIV in the late 1970s and early 1980s was key in recognizing that surveillance systems specific to blood transfusion were essential. Hence, most industrialized countries monitor transfusion-transmissible infections in donors and evaluate the impact of new testing and of predonation screening strategies. Emerging infections since HIV have had different transmission pathways and challenged blood programs to draw upon resources for a rapid and effective response, with recognition that the original focus on sexual/drug-related risk of HIV and hepatitis was inadequate. The focus of surveillance programs on new and emerging pathogens fulfills a key role in risk assessment and policy formulation. The precise nature of such activities varies by country because of the structure of the blood programs and surveillance systems, the strategic focus of the blood programs, and the epidemiology of disease in each country.","O'Brien, Sheila F.; Zou, Shimian; Laperche, Syria; Brant, Lisa J.; Seed, Clive R.; Kleinman, Steven H.",Transfus Med Rev,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmrv.2011.07.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887796311000605; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887796311000605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21944935/,413

HIVST with digital supports is defined as the use of digital interventions (e.g., website-based, social media, mobile HIVST applications (apps), text messaging (SMS), digital vending machines (digital VMs)) to improve the efficiency and impact of HIVST. HIVST deployment and integration in health services is an emerging priority. We conducted a systematic review aiming to close the gap in evidence that summarizes the impact of digitally supported HIVST and to inform policy recommendations. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for articles and abstracts on HIVST with digital supports published during the period February 1st, 2010 to June 15th, 2021, following Cochrane guidelines and PRISMA methodology. We assessed feasibility, acceptability, preference, and impact outcomes across all populations and study designs. Metrics reported were willingness to use HIVST, preferences for HIVST delivery, proportion of first-time testers, HIVST uptake, HIVST kit return rate, and linkage to care. Heterogeneity of the interventions and reported metrics precluded us from conducting a meta-analysis. FINDINGS: 46 studies were narratively synthesized, of which 72% were observational and 28% were RCTs. Half of all studies (54%, 25/46) assessed web-based innovations (e.g., study websites, videos, chatbots), followed by social media (26%, 12/46), HIVST-specific apps (7%, 3/46), SMS (9%, 4/46), and digital VMs (4%, 2/46). Web-based innovations were found to be acceptable (77–97%), preferred over in-person and hybrid options by more first-time testers (47–48%), highly feasible (93–95%), and were overall effective in supporting linkage to care (53–100%). Social media and app-based innovations also had high acceptability (87–95%) and linkage to care proportions (80–100%). SMS innovations increased kit return rates (54–94%) and HIVST uptake among hard-to-reach groups. Finally, digital VMs were highly acceptable (54–93%), and HIVST uptake was six times greater when using digital VMs compared to distribution by community workers. INTERPRETATION: HIVST with digital supports was deemed feasible, acceptable, preferable, and was shown to increase uptake, engage first-time testers and hard-to-reach populations, and successfully link participants to treatment. Findings pave the way for greater use of HIVST interventions with digital supports globally.","McGuire, Madison; de Waal, Anna; Karellis, Angela; Janssen, Ricky; Engel, Nora; Sampath, Rangarajan; Carmona, Sergio; Zwerling, Alice Anne; Suarez, Marta Fernandez; Pai, Nitika Pant",EClinicalMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34430835/,413

The aggressive tendencies of depressed individuals can harm their body and life and threaten those of others. The aggressive and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors of depressed youths may seriously affect their physical and psychological health if not identified and mediated promptly. METHOD: A total of 875 young respondents (including college students, community youths, migrant workers, and so on) from three provinces in China were surveyed in 2020 using a depression scale, non-suicidal self-injury scale, aggression scale, and resilience scale. RESULTS: Depression, non-suicidal self-injury, and aggression are significantly higher among the members of the depression group compared with the members of the healthy control group (P<0.001), and the resilience of the members of the former group is remarkably lower than that of the members of the latter group (P<0.001). Aggression among the depressed youths exhibits a significant positive correlation with non-suicidal self-injury (r= 0.43, P<0.01), whereas aggression (r= –0.18, P<0.05) and non-suicidal self-injury (r= –0.20, P<0.05) demonstrates significant negative correlations with resilience. The resilience of the youths in the depression group plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between aggression and non-suicidal self-injury. CONCLUSION: The more aggressive the behaviors of the depressed youths, the more serious their non-suicidal self-injurious symptoms.

646885,Benefit-Risk Analysis of Buprenorphine for Pain Management,2021-05-24,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage have been employed by several researchers as an alternative early warning indicator of virus spreading in communities, covering both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. A factor that can seriously mislead the quantitative measurement of viral copies in sewage is the adsorption of virus fragments onto the highly porous solids suspended in wastewater, making them inaccessible. This depends not only on the available amount of suspended solids, but also on the amount of other dissolved chemicals which may influence the capacity of adsorption. On this account, the present work develops a mathematical framework, at various degrees of spatial complexity, of a physicochemical model that rationalizes the quantitative measurements of total virus fragments in sewage as regards the adsorption of virus onto suspended solids and the effect of dissolved chemicals on it. The city of Thessaloniki in Greece is employed as a convenient case study to determine the values of model variables. The present data indicate the ratio of the specific absorption (UV254/DOC) over the dissolved oxygen (DO) as the parameter with the highest correlation with viral copies. This implies a strong effect on viral inaccessibility in sewage caused (i) by the presence of humic-like substances and (ii) by virus decay due to oxidation and metabolic activity of bacteria. The present results indicate suggest days where many fold corrections in the measurement of viral copies should be applied. As a result, although the detected RNA load in June 2020 is similar to that in April 2020, virus shedding in the city is about 5 times lower in June than in April, in line with the very low SARS-CoV-2 incidence and hospital admissions for COVID-19 in Thessaloniki in June.","Petala, M.; Dafou, D.; Kostoglou, M.; Karapantsios, Th.; Kanata, E.; Chatziefstathiou, A.; Sakaveli, F.; Kotoulas, K.; Arsenakis, M.; Roilides, E.; Sklaviadis, T.; Metallidis, S.; Papa, A.; Stylianidis, E.; Papadopoulos, A.; Papaioannou, N.",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199018/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720363853; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720363853?v=s5,413

Enterotropic strains predominate in natural infections, and molecular techniques for the detection of MHV shedding in feces are powerful enough to diagnose active infections. A reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technique was developed for the detection of rodent coronaviruses within 90 min. The specificity of this technique was confirmed by its ability to detect all 17 different strains of MHV and 6 strains of rat coronaviruses as well as its failure to detect human, bovine, and porcine coronaviruses nonspecifically. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP was 3.2-fold higher than that of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 31.6-fold lower than that of nested RT-PCR.

648505,Letter to the Editor: “Our Response to COVID-19 as Endocrinologists and Diabetologists”,2020-04-20,"The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of people and caused tremendous morbidity and mortality worldwide. Effective treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is lacking, and different therapeutic strategies are under testing. Host humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection is a critical determinant for patients’ outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in seroconversion and production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The antibodies may suppress viral replication through neutralization but might also participate in COVID-19 pathogenesis through a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement. Rapid progress has been made in the research of antibody response and therapy in COVID-19 patients, including characterization of the clinical features of antibody responses in different populations infected by SARS-CoV-2, treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma and intravenous immunoglobin products, isolation and characterization of a large panel of monoclonal neutralizing antibodies and early clinical testing, as well as clinical results from several COVID-19 vaccine candidates. In this review, we summarize the recent progress and discuss the implications of these findings in vaccine development.","Lu, Ligong; Zhang, Hui; Zhan, Meixiao; Jiang, Jun; Yin, Hua; Dauphars, Danielle J.; Li, Shi-You; Li, Yong; He, You-Wen",Sci China Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355886/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-020-1859-y,413

One such practice is refusing available vaccines known to be effective at preventing dangerous communicable diseases. For reasons of preventing individual harm, avoiding complicity in collective harm, and fairness, there is a growing consensus among ethicists that individuals have a duty to get vaccinated. I argue that these same grounds establish an analogous duty to avoid buying and eating most meat sold today, based solely on a concern for human welfare. Meat consumption is a leading driver of infectious disease. Wildlife sales at wet markets, bushmeat hunting, and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are all exceptionally risky activities that facilitate disease spread and impose immense harms on human populations. If there is a moral duty to vaccinate, we also should recognize a moral duty to avoid most meat. The paper concludes by considering the implications of this duty for policy.","Jones, Ben",Bioethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33222212/; https://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12834,413

We investigated the degree to which people's work performance is affected and the association between sedentary behavior under the state of emergency and worsened work performance during the COVID‐19 pandemic, as previous studies have suggested that sedentary behavior decreases work performance. METHODS: We used data from the Japan “COVID‐19 and Society” Internet Survey (JACSIS) study, a cross‐sectional, web‐based, self‐reported questionnaire survey. The main outcome was change in work performance after the COVID‐19 pandemic compared with that before the pandemic. We analyzed the association between the change in work performance and sitting duration under the state of emergency, adjusted for work‐related stress, participants’ demographics, socio‐economic status, health‐related characteristics, and personality. RESULTS: The change of work environment from the pandemic decreased work performance in 15% of workers, which was 3.6 times greater than the number of workers reporting increased performance in 14 648 workers (6134 women and 8514 men). Although telework both improved and worsened performance (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.0, 1.6‐2.5 and 1.7, 1.5‐1.9, respectively), sitting for long periods after the state of emergency was significantly associated only with worsened performance (OR, 95% CI = 1.8, 1.5‐2.2) in a dose–response manner. CONCLUSION: Sitting duration is likely a risk barometer of worsened work performance under uncertain working situations, such as the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Wakaizumi, Kenta; Yamada, Keiko; Shimazu, Akihito; Tabuchi, Takahiro",J Occup Health,https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346132/,413

Eighty RA patients were randomized to tocilizumab(n=40) or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs(csDMARDs) and glucocorticoids(GC) (n=40) for 3 months. Forty healthy subjects with similar age and sex served as controls. We measured: a)perfused boundary region(PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (increased PBR indicates reduced glycocalyx thickness), b)pulse wave velocity(PWV), c)global LV longitudinal strain(GLS), d)global work index(GWI) using speckle tracking echocardiography and e)C-reactive protein(CRP), malondialdehyde(MDA) and protein carbonyls(PCs) as oxidative stress markers at baseline and post-treatment. Compared to controls, RA patients had impaired glycocalyx and myocardial deformation markers(P<0.05). Compared with baseline, tocilizumab reduced PBR(2.14±0.2 versus 1.97±0.2μm; P<0.05) while no significant differences were observed post-csDMARDs+GC(P>0.05). Compared with csDMARDs+GC, tocilizumab achieved a greater increase of GLS, GWI and reduction of MDA, PCs and CRP(P<0.05). The percent improvement of glycocalyx thickness(PBR) was associated with the percent decrease of PWV, MDA, PCs and the percent improvement of GLS and GWI(P<0.05). Tocilizumab improves endothelial function leading to a greater increase of effective myocardial work than csDMARDs+GC through a profound reduction of inflammatory burden and oxidative stress.

651664,Systematic Review of Economic Evaluations of Preparedness Strategies and Interventions against Influenza Pandemics,2012-02-29,"This review describes the evidence for the potential benefit of Vitamin D supplementation in people with respiratory diseases who may have a higher susceptibility to Covid‐19 infection and its consequences. Clinical evidence indicates that vitamin D may reduce the risk of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and offers benefit particularly in people with Vitamin D deficiency. Some evidence exists for a higher incidence of active TB in patients who are deficient in vitamin D. An association between low levels of 25(OH)D (the active form of vitamin D) and COVID‐19 severity of illness and mortality has also been reported. In addition, low 25(OH)D levels are associated with poor outcomes in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The cytokine storm experienced in severe COVID‐19 infections results from excessive release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Due to its immunomodulatory effects, adequate Vitamin D levels may cause a decrease in the pro‐inflammatory cytokines and an increase in the anti‐inflammatory cytokines during Covid‐19 infections. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 82.2% of hospitalized COVID‐19 cases and 47.2% of population‐based controls (p<0.0001). The available evidence warrants an evaluation of Vitamin D supplementation in susceptible populations with respiratory diseases such as TB, and particularly in those who are deficient in Vitamin D. This may mitigate against serious complications of Covid‐19 infections or reduce the impact of ARDS in those who have been infected.","Chetty, Vasudevan V.; Chetty, Manoranjenni",Clin Transl Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057814/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.13044,413

The dual-purpose wheelchair was developed to facilitate sitting and sleeping postures that are desirable in handling the challenges of COVID-19 paraplegic patients in homes, hospitals and rehabilitation centers. The documented anthropometry parameter of the 5th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentile distribution of Nigerian paraplegics were retrieved and used in the design. The developed wheelchair was powered by a battery that converts the system from the wheelchair mode (sitting mode) to the bed (sleeping/relaxation) mode or vice versa. The average conversion rate of the dual-purpose wheelchair from bed mode to sitting mode and sitting mode to bed mode at no load is about 149.7 s and 163.6 s respectively with a standard error of ±0.2 s. Also, the average conversion rate from sitting mode to bed/sleeping mode and bed mode to sitting mode under load is about 150.4 s and 166 s respectively. The ergonomic suitability and comfortability were determined from the computed average acceleration (ARMS), vibration dose value (VDV), and weighted acceleration value (AWRMS). The result from the performance test shows that the average acceleration falls between the range of 0.10 m/s2 and 0.29 m/s2 and the vibration dose value (VDV) ranges between 0.01m/s1.75 and 1.35 m/s1.75. The weighted acceleration (Aweighted) was also computed and found to be between the range of 0.01 m/s2 and 0.35 m/s2 vibration value. Thus, attesting that the dual-purpose wheelchair design is ergonomically correct and safe to be used.

652044,Virtual support for remote proctoring in TAVR during COVID‐19,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak has led to travel bans and restricted social contact. Sudden decrease of social activities can easily trigger social anxiety, especially for community youths. Existing studies have inconclusive results regarding whether the development of youths’ social anxiety can be predicted by psychological capital. This study aims to clarify the influence mechanisms of psychological capital and coping style on social anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. METHODS: Overall 600 community youths with ages of 18–22 yr in Northeast China were randomly selected and voluntarily answered the online questionnaire survey in Mar 2020. General information questionnaire form, positive psychological capital questionnaire, social interaction anxiety scale, and simple coping style questionnaire were used to obtain the participants’ information. RESULTS: Psychological capital has a medium negative correlation with social anxiety, low positive correlation with positive coping (r = −0.42, 0.38), and low negative correlation with negative coping (r = −0.19). Social anxiety is negatively correlated with positive coping to a small degree and positively correlated with negative coping at a medium level (r = −0.16, 0.43). Positive coping has a low positive correlation with negative coping (r = 0.13). Positive coping and negative coping play partial mediating roles between psychological capital and social anxiety, with mediating effect values of −0.03 and 0.01, respectively. CONCLUSION: Youth’s psychological capital is closely associated with coping style and social anxiety. In addition to its direct bearing on social anxiety, psychological capital influences social anxiety through the mediating effect of coping style.","LI, Dongmei",Iran J Public Health,https://doi.org/10.18502/ijph.v49i11.4721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708726/,413
652190,Convalescent plasma in the management of COVID-19 pneumonia,2021-04-30,"Abstract With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic. We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.","Hart, Olga E.; Halden, Rolf U.",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720323925?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720323925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371231/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138875,413

Our study aimed at evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of screening patients with cancer for COVID-19 infection. METHODS: All oncology patients receiving care at Department of Oncology at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh were screened using the acute respiratory infection (ARI) survey. Nasopharyngeal and throat swap for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was performed on patients who have high ARI score (i.e. ≥ 4), or any patient requiring elective/emergency hospitalization, undergoing a procedure as well as screening asymptomatic patients receiving chemotherapy between April 1st and July 30, 2020. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Descriptive and inferential analyses were done and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated considering the COVID-19 PCR as the gold standard. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 473 patients were included with a median age was 56 years (14- 104), 51% were female, 73% had solid tumors, and 66% received treatment within the last 3 months. These patients underwent 688 PCR tests along with ARI survey screening. Testing was done in the outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department setting in 41%, 40% and 19% of the patients, respectively. Majority of tests were screening of asymptomatic patients and only 23% were tested for suspected infections with ARI ≥ 4. A total of 54 patients (8%) had positive PCR for COVID-19 infection. The prevalence of infection varied from month to month ranging from 1.09% in April up to 19.70% in June and correlated with the average daily and active case load at a national level. The diagnostic yield of the ARI score also correlated with infection burden nationally. The PPV and NPV of the ARI as a screening tool was 18.24% (0-31.8) and 95.6% (86.36-98.86%) with the PPN fluctuating considerably in parallel with the prevalence of COVID-19 result. Similarly, the sensitivity and specificity of the ARI were 55.77% (0-70.59) and 79.4 (69.19-92), respectively. CONCLUSION: The yield of screening asymptomatic patients with cancer varies based on the community burden of COVID-19 infection. As universal screening can cause delays to patient care, it should be tailored based on the individual patient risks and infection burden in the region.","Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Alghamdi, Majed; Alkaiyat, Mohammad; Al Johani, Sameera M.; Damlaj, Moussab",J Infect Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034121001234?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130118/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034121001234,413

A complex system of ground based infrastructure is necessary to operate the spacecraft and process scientific data. This infrastructure is comprised of six ground elements. A significant verification and validation (V&V) effort must be undertaken to ensure reliable functionality of this geographically diverse system;this effort takes the form of Ground Readiness Testing (GRT). The two year GRT campaign requires extensive detailed planning, preparation and coordination across multiple mission elements for execution of many individual tests. The network connectivity, hardware and software functionality and a myriad of integrated systems need to be fully functionally tested. The GRT Manager must outline all testing opportunities in accordance with mission requirements, and element requirements to properly test the Ground System (GS) prior to launch, and needs to consider each mission element's internal schedule for testing and delivery to verify requirements in a timely manner. During the early stages of performing GRTs, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the team to restrict work primarily to remote operations with restricted physical access to those systems. This restriction brought with it new challenges in the management and execution of the GRTs, which would not normally have arisen in other pre-launch environments. The pandemic challenged GRT management to rethink their approach to a successful schedule of testing. Challenges came in the form of communication, lack of real-time in-person troubleshooting, and decisions that take into account the safety of the team as well as the need for engineering progress to be made. For example, work on the actual GS hardware and some software needed for testing and troubleshooting has slowed. The team needs to determine the true need for going into the office in order to update, integrate, or fix any issues for testing. No longer can someone walk down the hall to chat, brainstorm or fix issues of concern quickly. When face-to-face coordination is no longer available, new ways of communication need to be put in place. Ensuring successful completion of the GRT campaign is different in both its management and execution due to the pandemic. Prior to March 2020, the Lucy GS was already coordinating meetings and whiteboard sessions across the country since the mission elements were spread across the U.S. Now the entire GS has more opportunity to meet from the safety of their own home. For many this relieved some of the stress associated with the work environment and allowed team members to be more productive in their work life, and active in their home life. Less time and money is spent traveling via car or plane to accomplish ground readiness testing. The paper will describe how the Lucy team met new challenges and took advantage of the unforeseen benefits while staying on track to complete the GRT campaign successfully ahead of the October 2021 launch.","Siegel, K.; Woodard, M.; Poland, D.; Bartels, A.; Ieee,",IEEE Aerospace Conference (AeroConf),https://doi.org/10.1109/aero50100.2021.9438271,413
655354,Theoretical reflections of Leininger's cross-cultural care in the context of Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Evidence so far shows that Waldorf students are characterized by average science achievement but at the same time high socioeconomic status and high science motivation. Moreover, Waldorf education is characterized by high emphasis on inquiry-based science education (IBSE). The present study investigates if the specific attitude-achievement constellation of Waldorf students in science may be explained by the high level of IBSE. METHODS: Propensity score matching was applied to control for Waldorf students’ more advantageous social background using the Austrian PISA 2015 sample (N = 7007 15-year old students). After propensity score matching, 1107 matched controls were included alongside all 149 Waldorf students. RESULTS: The results show that Waldorf students report higher enjoyment in learning science and more interest in broad science topics than matched controls. On the other hand, they demonstrate lower science achievement. Mediation analyses show that, although Waldorf students’ more positive attitudes towards science can be almost entirely attributed to their higher exposure to IBSE, their underperformance in science cannot. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that attending a school type with a high level of IBSE (Waldorf) may have positive effects on attitudinal outcomes (enjoyment and interest in science) whereas it does not seem to have notable effects on science achievement. This indicates that IBSE could be applied in educational contexts aiming to increase students’ scientific attitudes.","Salchegger, Silvia; Wallner-Paschon, Christina; Bertsch, Christian",Large Scale Assess Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40536-021-00107-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178572/,413

Systemic low‐dose corticosteroids have proven clinical benefit in patients with severe COVID‐19. Higher doses of corticosteroids are used in other inflammatory lung diseases and may offer additional clinical benefits in COVID‐19. At present, the balance between benefits and harms of higher vs. lower doses of corticosteroids for patients with COVID‐19 is unclear. METHODS: The COVID STEROID 2 trial is an investigator‐initiated, international, parallel‐grouped, blinded, centrally randomised and stratified clinical trial assessing higher (12 mg) vs. lower (6 mg) doses of dexamethasone for adults with COVID‐19 and severe hypoxia. We plan to enrol 1,000 patients in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and India. The primary outcome is days alive without life support (invasive mechanical ventilation, circulatory support or renal replacement therapy) at day 28. Secondary outcomes include serious adverse reactions at day 28; all‐cause mortality at day 28, 90 and 180; days alive without life support at day 90; days alive and out of hospital at day 90; and health‐related quality of life at day 180. The primary outcome will be analysed using the Kryger Jensen and Lange test adjusted for stratification variables and reported as adjusted mean differences and median differences. The full statistical analysis plan is outlined in this protocol. DISCUSSION: The COVID STEROID 2 trial will provide evidence on the optimal dosing of systemic corticosteroids for COVID‐19 patients with severe hypoxia with important implications for patients, their relatives and society.","Warrer Munch, Marie; Granholm, Anders; Nainan Myatra, Sheila; Kumar Tirupakuzhi Vijayaraghavan, Bharath; Cronhjort, Maria; Rubenson Wahlin, Rebecka; Jakob, Stephan M.; Cioccari, Luca; Nørregaard Kjær, Maj‐Brit; Kingo Vesterlund, Gitte; Sylvest Meyhoff, Tine; Helleberg, Marie; Hylander Møller, Morten; Benfield, Thomas; Venkatesh, Balasubramanian; Hammond, Naomi; Micallef, Sharon; Bassi, Abhinav; John, Oommen; Jha, Vivekanand; Tjelle Kristiansen, Klaus; Suppli Ulrik, Charlotte; Lind Jørgensen, Vibeke; Smitt, Margit; Bestle, Morten H.; Sofie Andreasen, Anne; Musaeus Poulsen, Lone; Steen Rasmussen, Bodil; Craveiro Brøchner, Anne; Strøm, Thomas; Møller, Anders; Saif Khan, Mohd; Padmanaban, Ajay; Vasishtha Divatia, Jigeeshu; Saseedharan, Sanjith; Borawake, Kapil; Kapadia, Farhad; Dixit, Subhal; Chawla, Rajesh; Shukla, Urvi; Amin, Pravin; Chew, Michelle S.; Gluud, Christian; Lange, Theis; Perner, Anders",Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33583034/,413

However, little is known about the kinetics of the systemic immune response and its association with survival in SARS-CoV-2+ patients admitted in ICU. We aimed to compare the immuno-inflammatory features according to organ failure severity and in-ICU mortality. METHODS: Six-week multicentre study (N = 3) including SARS-CoV-2+ patients admitted in ICU. Analysis of plasma biomarkers at days 0 and 3–4 according to organ failure worsening (increase in SOFA score) and 60-day mortality. RESULTS: 101 patients were included. Patients had severe respiratory diseases with PaO2/FiO2 of 155 [111–251] mmHg), SAPS II of 37 [31–45] and SOFA score of 4 [3–7]. Eighty-three patients (83%) required endotracheal intubation/mechanical ventilation and among them, 64% were treated with prone position. IL-1β was barely detectable. Baseline IL-6 levels positively correlated with organ failure severity. Baseline IL-6 and CRP levels were significantly higher in patients in the worsening group than in the non-worsening group (278 [70–622] vs. 71 [29–153] pg/mL, P < 0.01; and 178 [100–295] vs. 100 [37–213] mg/L, P < 0.05, respectively). Baseline IL-6 and CRP levels were significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors but fibrinogen levels and lymphocyte counts were not different between groups. After adjustment on SOFA score and time from symptom onset to first dosage, IL-6 and CRP remained significantly associated with mortality. IL-6 changes between Day 0 and Day 3–4 were not different according to the outcome. A contrario, kinetics of CRP and lymphocyte count were different between survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: In SARS-CoV-2+ patients admitted in ICU, a systemic pro-inflammatory signature was associated with clinical worsening and 60-day mortality.","Lavillegrand, Jean-Rémi; Garnier, Marc; Spaeth, Agathe; Mario, Nathalie; Hariri, Geoffroy; Pilon, Antoine; Berti, Enora; Fieux, Fabienne; Thietart, Sara; Urbina, Tomas; Turpin, Matthieu; Darrivière, Lucie; Fartoukh, Muriel; Verdonk, Franck; Dumas, Guillaume; Tedgui, Alain; Guidet, Bertrand; Maury, Eric; Chantran, Yannick; Voiriot, Guillaume; Ait-Oufella, Hafid",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439360/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00798-x,413

659654,Cardiac complications during the active phase of COVID-19: review of the current evidence,2021-05-27,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. In this study, we aimed to describe the aetiology of viral infection of pediatric CAP in Chinese mainland. During November 2014 to June 2016, the prospective study was conducted in 13 hospitals. The hospitalized children under 18 years old who met the criteria for CAP were enrolled. The throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected which were then screened 18 respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR assay. Viral pathogens were present in 56.6% (1539/2721) of the enrolled cases, with the detection rate of single virus in 39.8% of the cases and multiple viruses in 16.8% of the cases. The most frequently detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (15.2%, 414/2721). The highest detection rate of virus was in < 6-month-age group (70.7%, 292/413). RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) and influenza B virus (Flu B) showed the similar prevalence patterns both in north and south China, but HPIVs, Flu A, human bocavirus (HBoV), human adenovirus (HAdV) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) showed the distinct circulating patterns in north and south China. Human enterovirus/human rhinovirus (HEV/HRV) (27.6%, 27/98), HBoV (18.4%, 18/98), RSV (16.3%, 16/98) and HMPV (14.3%, 14/98) were the most commonly detected viruses in severe pneumonia cases with single virus infection. In conclusion, viral pathogens are frequently detected in pediatric CAP cases and may therefore play a vital role in the aetiology of CAP. RSV was the most important virus in hospitalized children with CAP in Chinese mainland.

Hypokalemia is a concerning electrolyte disorder closely associated with severe complications. This study aimed to estimate prevalence, risk factors and outcome of hypokalemia in a cohort of patients with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 290 non-ICU admitted patients with COVID-19 at the tertiary teaching hospital of Modena, Italy, from February 16 to April 14, 2020. RESULTS: Hypokalemia was detected in 119 out of 290 patients (41%) during hospitalization. Mean serum potassium was 3.1 ± 0.1 meq/L. The majority of patients (90.7%) patients experienced only a mild decrease in serum potassium level (3–3.4 mEq/L). Hypokalemia was associated with hypocalcemia, which was detected in 50% of subjects. Urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio, measured in a small number of patients (n = 45; 36.1%), revealed an increase of urinary potassium excretion in most cases (95.5%). Risk factors for hypokalemia were female sex (odds ratio (OR) 2.44; 95% CI 1.36–4.37; P 0.003) and diuretic therapy (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.08–3.48; P 0.027). Hypokalemia, adjusted for sex, age and SOFA score, was not associated with ICU transfer (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.228–1.212; P = 0.131), in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.47; 95% CI 0.170–1.324; P = 0.154) and composite outcome of ICU transfer or in-hospital mortality (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.222–1.047; P = 0.065) in our cohort of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia was a frequent disorder in subjects with COVID-19. Female sex and diuretic therapy were identified as risk factors for low serum potassium levels. Hypokalemia was unrelated to ICU transfer and death in this cohort of patients.

Social reintegration is a demanding and complex process, requiring individuals to become active again and acquire age-, gender-, and culture-appropriate roles and social status. It also involves independence and productive behavior as part of multiple interpersonal relationships with family, friends, and others. In order to establish whether individuals with spinal cord injury who are physically active subjectively rate their quality of life to be higher compared to those who are not, sixty-two respondents from Slovenia with spinal cord injury were interviewed. Thirty-one of them were physically active, and 31 were not. The level of injury of the responders was from Th6–Th12. The participants gave the highest assessments to their interpersonal relationships, and the lowest to their satisfaction with material prosperity. Data comparison showed that subjective estimates in all areas of quality of life are higher in respondents who were involved in physical activity after their injury. The results may encourage persons with spinal cord injury to participate more often in sports programs, and also encourage others to do so.","Filipcic, Tjasa; Sember, Vedrana; Pajek, Maja; Jerman, Janez",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501739/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179148,413

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the incidence of the clinical presentations suggestive for COVID-19 infection among patients with Multiple Sclerosis in the province of Lecco, in the North Italy, the closest province capital to Bergamo. To describe the association of demographics, clinical characteristics, and use of DMTs categories with the risk of contracting the disease. METHODS: We telephonically interviewed all the 275 MS patients followed in the MS center. The collected data included recent contact with a patient with COVID-19 diagnosis or a subject with respiratory symptoms and the developing of COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed diagnosis. RESULTS: 15 out of 275 patients reported symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 infection, only one of them with PCR-confirmed diagnosis. No one of them presented severe symptoms or needed hospitalization. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, the only factor associated with being in the COVID-suspect group was the report of a recent contact with a patient with a COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COVID-19 within MS patients seems to resemble the prevalence in general population. The lack of associations with other factors assessed, including DMTs, may reflect a lack of statistical power. Larger population studies are needed to explore the correlation between different disease-modifying therapies and COVID-19 course.","Mantero, Vittorio; Abate, Lucia; Balgera, Roberto; Basilico, Paola; Salmaggi, Andrea; Cordano, Christian",Mult Scler Relat Disord,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034820305289; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835900/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820305289?v=s5,413

We describe epidemiological and clinical characteristics and aim at identifying risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 detection during the first six weeks of operation. METHODS: Testing followed national recommendations, but was also based on the physician´s discretion. We related patient characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 test positivity for exploratory analyses using a cross-sectional, observational study design. RESULTS: Between March 3 and April 13, 2020, 5179 patients attended the site (median age 34 years; IQR 26-47 years). The median time since disease onset was 4 days (IQR 2-7 days). Among 4333 patients tested, 333 (7.7%) were positive. Test positivity increased up to 10.3% (96/929) during the first three weeks and then declined, paralleling Germany’s lock-down and the course of the epidemic in Berlin. Strict adherence to testing guidelines resulted in 10.4% (262/2530) test positivity, compared to 3.9% (71/1803) among patients tested for other indications. A nightclub was a transmission hotspot; 27.7% (26/94) of one night’s visitors were found positive. Smell and/or taste dysfunction indicated COVID-19 with 85.6% specificity (95%CI 82.1-88.1%). Some 4% (14/333) of those infected were asymptomatic. Risk factors for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recent contact to a positive case (second week after contact, OR 3.42; 95%CI 2.48-4.71), travel to regions of high pandemic activity (e.g. Austria, OR 4.16; 95%CI 2.48-6.99), recent onset of symptoms (second week, OR 3.61; 95%CI 1.87-6.98), and an impaired sense of smell/taste (4.08; 95%CI 2.36-7.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this young population, early-onset presentation of COVID-19 resembled flu-like symptoms, except for smell and/or taste dysfunction.

666378,Comparison of rapid antibody test and thorax computed tomography results in patients who underwent RT‐PCR with the pre‐diagnosis of COVID‐19,2021-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Destruction of the architectural and subsequently the functional integrity of the lung following pulmonary viral infections is attributable to both the extent of pathogen replication and to the host-generated inflammation associated with the recruitment of immune responses. The presence of antigenically disparate pulmonary viruses and the emergence of novel viruses assures the recurrence of lung damage with infection and resolution of each primary viral infection. Thus, there is a need to develop safe broad spectrum immunoprophylactic strategies capable of enhancing protective immune responses in the lung but which limits immune-mediated lung damage. The immunoprophylactic strategy described here utilizes a protein cage nanoparticle (PCN) to significantly accelerate clearance of diverse respiratory viruses after primary infection and also results in a host immune response that causes less lung damage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice pre-treated with PCN, independent of any specific viral antigens, were protected against both sub-lethal and lethal doses of two different influenza viruses, a mouse-adapted SARS-coronavirus, or mouse pneumovirus. Treatment with PCN significantly increased survival and was marked by enhanced viral clearance, accelerated induction of viral-specific antibody production, and significant decreases in morbidity and lung damage. The enhanced protection appears to be dependent upon the prior development of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in the lung in response to the PCN treatment and to be mediated through CD4+ T cell and B cell dependent mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The immunoprophylactic strategy described utilizes an infection-independent induction of naturally occurring iBALT prior to infection by a pulmonary viral pathogen. This strategy non-specifically enhances primary immunity to respiratory viruses and is not restricted by the antigen specificities inherent in typical vaccination strategies. PCN treatment is asymptomatic in its application and importantly, ameliorates the damaging inflammation normally associated with the recruitment of immune responses into the lung.","Wiley, James A.; Richert, Laura E.; Swain, Steve D.; Harmsen, Ann; Barnard, Dale L.; Randall, Troy D.; Jutila, Mark; Douglas, Trevor; Broomell, Chris; Young, Mark; Harmsen, Allen",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19774076/,413

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the impact of IL-6 inhibition on mortality from COVID-19, utilising meta-regression to explore differences in study results. METHODS: : Systematic database searches were performed to identify RCTs comparing IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) to placebo or standard of care in adults with COVID-19. Meta-analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality at 28 days between arms, expressed as a risk ratio. Within-study mortality rates were compared, and meta-regression was used to investigate treatment effect modification. RESULTS: : Data from nine RCTs were included. The combined mortality rate across studies was 19% (95% CI: 18, 20%), ranging from 2% to 31%. The overall risk ratio for 28-day mortality was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99), in favour of benefit for IL-6 inhibition over placebo or standard of care, with low treatment effect heterogeneity: I(2) 0% (95% CI: 0, 53%). Meta-regression showed no evidence of treatment effect modification by patient characteristics. Trial-specific mortality rates were explained by known patient-level predictors of COVID-19 outcome (male sex, CRP, hypertension), and country-level COVID-19 incidence. CONCLUSIONS: : IL-6 inhibition is associated with clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes for patients admitted with COVID-19. Long-term benefits of IL-6 inhibition, its effectiveness across healthcare systems, and implications for differing standards of care are currently unknown.","Tharmarajah, Emmanuel; Buazon, April; Patel, Vishit; Hannah, Jennifer R.; Adas, Maryam; Allen, Victoria B.; Bechman, Katie; Clarke, Benjamin D.; Nagra, Deepak; Norton, Sam; Russell, Mark D.; Rutherford, Andrew I.; Yates, Mark; Galloway, James B.",J Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2021.03.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445321001250?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745918/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445321001250,413
668600,Wins,2021,"Global misinformation and information overload have characterized the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Rumors are unverified pieces of information spreading online or person-to-person that reduce trust in health authorities and create barriers to protective practices. Risk communication and community engagement can increase transparency, build trust, and stop the spread of rumors. Building on previous work on Ebola and Zika viruses using Global Health Security Agenda systems strengthening support, the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Breakthrough ACTION project developed a process and technology for systematically collecting, analyzing, and addressing COVID-19 rumors in real-time in Côte d'Ivoire. Rumors were submitted through community-based contributors and collected from callers to the national hotlines and then processed on a cloud-hosted database built on the open-source software District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2). Hotline teleoperators and data managers coded rumors in near-real-time according to behavioral theory frameworks within DHIS2 and visualized the findings on custom dashboards. The analysis and response were done in full collaboration with the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and implementing partners to ensure a timely and coordinated response. The system captured both widespread rumors consistent with misinformation in other settings, such as suspicions about case counts and the belief that masks were deliberately contaminated, as well as very localized beliefs related to specific influencers. The qualitative findings provided rapid insights on circulating beliefs, enabling risk communicators to nuance and tailor messaging around COVID-19.","Tibbels, Natalie; Dosso, Abdul; Allen-Valley, Aliya; Benie, William; Fordham, Corinne; Brou, Jeanne Aka; Nana, Marjorie; Zounneme, Valère; Silué, Korodénin Fatoumata; Kamara, Diarra; Naugle, Danielle",Glob Health Sci Pract,https://doi.org/10.9745/ghsp-d-21-00031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038385/,413

669510,A simple prognostic score based on troponin and presepsin for COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department: a single-center pilot study,2021-09-02,"To understand and model public health emergencies, epidemiologists need data that describes how humans are moving and interacting across physical space. Such data has traditionally been difficult for researchers to obtain with the temporal resolution and geographic breadth that is needed to study, for example, a global pandemic. This paper describes Colocation Maps, which are spatial network datasets that have been developed within Facebook's Data For Good program. These Maps estimate how often people from different regions are colocated: in particular, for a pair of geographic regions x and y, these Maps estimate the probability that a randomly chosen person from x and a randomly chosen person from y are simultaneously located in the same place during a randomly chosen minute in a given week. These datasets are well suited to parametrize metapopulation models of disease spread or to measure temporal changes in interactions between people from different regions; indeed, they have already been used for both of these purposes during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we show how Colocation Maps differ from existing data sources, describe how the datasets are built, provide examples of their use in compartmental modeling, and summarize ideas for further development of these and related datasets. We also conduct the first large-scale analysis of human colocation patterns across the world. Among the findings of this study, we observe that a pair of regions can exhibit high colocation despite few people moving between them. We also find that although few pairs of people are colocated for many days over the course of a week, these pairs can contribute significant fractions of the total colocation time within a region or between pairs of regions.","Iyer, S.; Karrer, B.; Citron, D.

PURPOSE: This study investigates the HCPs’ general understanding of the health risks of COVID-19 and to what extent they are equipped with the knowledge to protect themselves and others against this contagion. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a web-based structured questionnaire posted on the UAE government electronic survey portal. A collection of 941 HCPs from diverse general and specialty hospitals in the UAE responded to an electronic participation invite. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that the majority of HCPs (97.6%) had updated information about COVID-19 modes of transmission, risks of contamination, high-risk groups, and the potential consequences of testing positive. Furthermore, the results of the chi-squared testing revealed that the HCPs' confidence and vigilance of the COVID-19 threats were significantly increased (p< 0.01) by being experienced, having had infection control training, or/and having undergone COVID-19 education. CONCLUSION: We conclude that HCPs have an evidence-based understanding of the ways their own health is at risk while they are performing their duties in hospital setups. Further, the study found that HCPs who undergo special infection control training and who are kept posted on the official updates on COVID-19 are more likely to remain vigilant at all times to minimize the risks to themselves and their patients. Although the generalizability of the study findings should be considered with caution, the results could be generalizable to health-care professionals who received similar COVID-19 related training in the UAE or other regional countries.","Dalky, Heyam F; Ghader, Nariman; Al Kuwari, Muna; Alnajar, Malek; Ismaile, Samantha; Almalik, Mona; Shudifat, Raed; Sanad, Sarah; Al-Nsair, Nezam; Al Matrooshi, Fatima",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s278479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33488085/,413
670728,Comparison of the clinical and radiological manifestations of male patients with COVID‐19 from different ethnicities,2021-08-22,"Biosensors are essential tools which have been traditionally used to monitor environmental pollution and detect the presence of toxic elements and biohazardous bacteria or virus in organic matter and biomolecules for clinical diagnostics. In the last couple of decades, the scientific community has witnessed their widespread application in the fields of military, health care, industrial process control, environmental monitoring, food-quality control, and microbiology. Biosensor technology has greatly evolved from in vitro studies based on the biosensing ability of organic beings to the highly sophisticated world of nanofabrication-enabled miniaturized biosensors. The incorporation of nanotechnology in the vast field of biosensing has led to the development of novel sensors and sensing mechanisms, as well as an increase in the sensitivity and performance of the existing biosensors. Additionally, the nanoscale dimension further assists the development of sensors for rapid and simple detection in vivo as well as the ability to probe single biomolecules and obtain critical information for their detection and analysis. However, the major drawbacks of this include, but are not limited to, potential toxicities associated with the unavoidable release of nanoparticles into the environment, miniaturization-induced unreliability, lack of automation, and difficulty of integrating the nanostructured-based biosensors, as well as unreliable transduction signals from these devices. Although the field of biosensors is vast, we intend to explore various nanotechnology-enabled biosensors as part of this review article and provide a brief description of their fundamental working principles and potential applications. The article aims to provide the reader a holistic overview of different nanostructures which have been used for biosensing purposes along with some specific applications in the field of cancer detection and the Internet of things (IoT), as well as a brief overview of machine-learning-based biosensing.","Banerjee, Aishwaryadev; Maity, Swagata; Mastrangelo, Carlos H.",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21041253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33578726/,413

Virus infection always induce high antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein), which can be used to detect COVID-19 at both infected and convalescent patients. In this study we reported the expression and purification of N protein in E.coli from inclusion bodies by a combination of two cation exchange chromatography, and the yield of N protein was around 50 mg/L fermentation broth with more than 90% purity. A corresponding colloidal gold detection kit prepared with our purified N protein was used to verify the efficiency and accuracy our N protein in antibody detection method.

671130,Otolaryngological manifestations of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection,2020-10-03,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection has sparked global concern due to the disease COVID-19 caused by it. Since the first cluster of confirmed cases in China in December 2019, the infection has been reported across the continents and inflicted upon a substantial number of populations. METHOD: This study is focused on immunoinformatics analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) which is key for the viral attachment to human host cells. Computational analyses were carried out for the prediction of B-cell and T-cell (MHC class I and II) epitopes of S protein and the analyses were extended further for the prediction of their immunogenic properties. The interaction and binding affinity of T-cell epitopes with HLA-B7 were also investigated by molecular docking. RESULT: Three distinct epitopes for vaccine design were predicted from the sequence of S protein. The potential B-cell epitope was KNHTSPDVDLG possessing the highest antigenicity score of 1.4039 among other B-cell epitopes. T-cell epitope for human MHC class I was VVVLSFELL with an antigenicity score of 1.0909 and binding ability to 29 MHC-I alleles. The predicted T-cell epitope for human MHC class II molecule was VVIGIVNNT with a corresponding 1.3063 antigenicity score, less digesting enzymes, and 7 MHC-II alleles binding ability. All these three peptides were predicted to be highly antigenic, non-allergenic, and non-toxic. Analyses of the physiochemical properties of these predicted epitopes indicate their stable nature for plausible vaccine design. Furthermore, molecular docking investigation between the MHC class-I epitopes and human HLA-B7 reflects the stable interaction with high affinity among them. CONCLUSION: The present study posits three potential epitopes of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 predicted by immunoinformatic methods based on their immunogenic properties and interactions with the host counterpart that can facilitate the development of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This study can act as the springboard for the future development of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Ashik, Arafat Islam; Hasan, Mahedi; Tasnim, Atiya Tahira; Chowdhury, Md.

671132,How can we evaluate an interrelation of symptoms?,2020-05-07,"BACKGROUND: Aging is characterized by a progressive decline in the capacity of the immune system to fight influenza virus infection and to respond to vaccination. Among the several factors involved, in addition to increased frailty and high-risk conditions, the age-associated decrease in cellular and humoral immune responses plays a relevant role. This is in large part due to inflammaging, the chronic low-grade inflammatory status of the elderly, associated with intrinsic inflammation of the immune cells and decreased immune function. RESULTS: Aging is usually associated with reduced influenza virus-specific and influenza vaccine-specific antibody responses but some elderly individuals with higher pre-exposure antibody titers, due to a previous infection or vaccination, have less probability to get infected. Examples of this exception are the elderly individuals infected during the 2009 pandemic season who made antibodies with broader epitope recognition and higher avidity than those made by younger individuals. Several studies have allowed the identification of B cell intrinsic defects accounting for sub-optimal antibody responses of elderly individuals. These defects include 1) reduced class switch recombination, responsible for the generation of a secondary response of class switched antibodies, 2) reduced de novo somatic hypermutation of the antibody variable region, 3) reduced binding and neutralization capacity, as well as binding specificity, of the secreted antibodies, 4) increased epigenetic modifications that are associated with lower antibody responses, 5) increased frequencies of inflammatory B cell subsets, and 6) shorter telomeres. CONCLUSIONS: Although influenza vaccination represents the most effective way to prevent influenza infection, vaccines with greater immunogenicity are needed to improve the response of elderly individuals. Recent advances in technology have made possible a broad approach to better understand the age-associated changes in immune cells, needed to design tailored vaccines and effective therapeutic strategies that will be able to improve the immune response of vulnerable individuals.","Frasca, Daniela; Blomberg, Bonnie B.",Immun Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33292323/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12979-020-00210-z,413

This paper presents findings related to the “universe” of people who called the toll-free service, from the sociocultural characteristics of the users to the information collected by the professionals during the psychological pathways until human satisfaction was achieved. We provide a retrospective description of an experience that took place between April and June 2020, and which involved users of the maternal-infant area calling from the whole Italy. (1) Methods: The aims of this study were to investigate the configuration of the indicators identified and to detect the possible correlations between them in the sample. There were 193 users who took advantage of the Service, 160 of whom continued beyond the reception service; it is this group that we report the findings from here. The tool used was a form reporting access to care and interventions, and the resulting data underwent a content analysis and the indicators were subject to non-parametric statistical analysis to analyze differences and relationships. (2) Results: There were many correlations among the indicators that revealed a high prevalence of calls due to personal motivations and requests for support, which later allowed users to gain a greater understanding of the underlying problems they were facing. The professionals running the service noticed a prevalence of weaknesses attributable to the negative emotions of its users, alongside a presence of cognitive and relational resources. The professionals’ interventions, which can be characterized by a prevalence of social support, psychological rehabilitation, and psychoeducation, achieved outcomes of redefining users’ relationships with themselves and others. All of the service’s users have expressed a high level of satisfaction with it. (3) Discussion: Our results revealed the protective and transformative effects of the service for its users and the underlying importance of having an easily accessible psychological support system in place during emergencies, like the recent pandemic. In conditions like these, the great value of a remote support service should be noted, and despite its limitations, assures its own efficacy when a medical emergency precludes closer in-person forms of psychological assistance.","Perricone, Giovanna; Rotolo, Ilenia; Beninati, Viviana; Billeci, Nicolò; Ilarda, Valeria; Polizzi, Concetta",Pediatr Rep,https://doi.org/10.3390/pediatric13010021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33810190/,413

The goal of this study was to evaluate if public health measures put in place to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020 in Ontario (Canada) have been associated with a change in the incidence of MOGAD and other neuroinflammatory disorders in children. METHODOLOGY We reviewed a single-centre cohort of children referred for a suspicion of neuroinflammatory disorder between January 2015 and March 2021. Age, date, sex, diagnosis, MOG-IgG antibodies status and detected pathogens at presentation were identified. Comparative statistical analysis was performed based on diagnosis between years and seasons using Pearson's Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables, as appropriate. We compared the post-lockdown period (March 17th, 2020, to March 31st, 2021) to previous calendar years (2015 to 2019) alone and to previous calendar years and the pre-lockdown 2020 period (January 1st, 2020, to March 16th, 2020). A p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons between the post-lockdown period and previous years were performed on significant results. A false discovery rate adjustment with an adjusted p-value (q-value) < 0.05 was computed. We hypothesized that the number of new MOGAD would be significantly lower in the post-lockdown period compared to previous years due to decreased regional pathogen transmission. RESULTS Among 491 referred cases, we identified 415 new cases of neuroinflammatory disorder between January 2015 and March 2021. The number of new neuroinflammatory disorder diagnoses did not change between years. We noted significantly fewer new MOGAD diagnoses in 2020 compared to previous years, with no MOGAD patients presenting in 2020 after the spring lockdown (q=0.0009). In addition, there were significantly fewer parainfectious neuroinflammatory cases (q=0.04) and pathogen detected (q=0.04) in the post-lockdown period. The number of new multiple sclerosis (MS) and aquaporin-4 neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (AQP4-NMOSD) cases remained stable despite the lockdown (q=0.185 and 0.693 respectively).

Here, using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and fluorescently tagged PRV, we directly show that depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane of host cells significantly reduces PRV entry. Cholesterol depletion did not reduce PRV attachment, but stalled virus particles at the plasma membrane before penetration of the cell. Cholesterol depletion results in destabilization of lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane, which have been shown before to be involved in efficient entry of different viruses. A significant fraction of PRV virions appears to localize juxtaposed to GM1, a lipid raft marker, during entry. Together, these data indicate that cholesterol and possibly cholesterol-rich lipid rafts may be important during PRV entry.","Desplanques, Ann S.; Nauwynck, Hans J.; Vercauteren, Dries; Geens, Tom; Favoreel, Herman W.",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.03.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18471850/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208002109; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208002109,413

PURPOSE: To investigate the mode of delivery and its impact on immediate neonatal outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected women. METHODS: A prospective study following pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 who delivered between March 15th and July 4th in seven university affiliated hospitals in Israel. RESULTS: A total of 52 women with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 delivered in the participating centers during the study period. The median gestational age at the time of delivery was 38 weeks, with 16 (30.8%) cases complicated by spontaneous preterm birth. Forty-three women (82.7%) underwent a trial of labor. The remaining 9 women underwent pre-labor cesarean delivery mostly due to obstetric indications, whereas one woman with a critical COVID-19 course underwent urgent cesarean delivery due to maternal deterioration. Among those who underwent a trial of labor (n = 43), 39 (90.7%) delivered vaginally, whereas 4 (9.3%) cases resulted in cesarean delivery. Neonatal RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs tested negative in all cases, and none of the infants developed pneumonia. No maternal and neonatal deaths were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study among SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers, vaginal delivery rates were high and associated with favorable outcomes with no cases of neonatal COVID-19. Our findings underscore that delivery management among SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers should be based on obstetric indications and may potentially reduce the high rates of cesarean delivery previously reported in this setting.","Rottenstreich, Amihai; Tsur, Abraham; Braverman, Nava; Kabiri, Doron; Porat, Shay; Benenson, Shmuel; Oster, Yonatan; Kam, Hadas Allouche; Walfisch, Asnat; Bart, Yossi; Meyer, Raanan; Lifshitz, Shirlee Jaffe; Amikam, Uri; Biron-Shental, Tal; Cohen, Gal; Sciaky-Tamir, Yael; Shachar, Inbar Ben; Yinon, Yoav; Reubinoff, Benjamin",Arch Gynecol Obstet,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-020-05854-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123808/,413
673011,Analysis of aerosol production and aerosol dispersion during otologic surgery,2021-09-03,"Background: In May-July 2020 in the New York City area, up to 16% of pregnant women had reportedly been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Prior studies found associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and certain adverse outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, cesarean delivery). These studies relied on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to establish SARS-CoV-2 infection. This led to overrepresentation of symptomatic or acutely ill cases in scientific studies. Objective: To expand our understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes, regardless of symptomatology and stage of infection, by using serological tests to measure IgG antibody levels. Study Design: The Generation C Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study conducted at the Mount Sinai Health System. All pregnant women receiving obstetrical care at the Mount Sinai Hospital and Mount Sinai West Hospital from April 20, 2020 onwards are eligible for participation. For the current analysis, we included participants who had given birth to a liveborn singleton infant on or before August 15, 2020. Blood was drawn as part of routine clinical care; for each woman, we tested the latest sample available to establish seropositivity using a SARS-CoV-2 serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, RT-PCR testing was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab taken during labor and delivery. Pregnancy outcomes of interest (i.e., gestational age at delivery, birth weight, mode of delivery, Apgar score, ICU/NICU admission, and neonatal hospital length of stay) and covariates were extracted from electronic medical records. Among all Generation C participants who had given birth by August 15, 2020 (n=708), we established the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Excluding women who tested RT-PCR positive at delivery, we conducted crude and adjusted linear and logistic regression models to compare antibody positive women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery with antibody negative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. We stratified analyses by race/ethnicity to examine potential effect modification. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence based on IgG measurement was 16.4% (n=116, 95% CI 13.7-19.3). Twelve women (1.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive at delivery (11 of these women were seropositive). Seropositive women were generally younger, more often Black or Hispanic, and more often had public insurance and higher pre-pregnancy BMI compared with seronegative women. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity without RT-PCR positivity at delivery was associated with decreased odds of caesarean delivery (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.27; 0.84) compared with seronegative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. Stratified by race/ethnicity, the association between seropositivity and decreased odds of caesarean delivery remained for non-Hispanic Black/African-American and Hispanic women, but not for non-Hispanic White women. No other pregnancy outcomes differed by seropositivity, overall or stratified by race/ethnicity. Conclusion: Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 without RT-PCR positivity at delivery, suggesting that infection occurred earlier during pregnancy, was not associated with selected adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among live births in a cohort sample of women from New York City. While non-Hispanic Black and Latina women in our cohort had a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity compared with non-Hispanic White women, we found no increase in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among these groups due to infection.","Molenaar, N.

In this study, we employed a DNA vaccine technology with the levamisole, our newly discovered chemical adjuvant, to generate Th1 type of response. To avoid the enhancement antibody issue, genes encoding the nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope protein of SARS-CoV were cloned and their expressions in mammalian cells were determined. After the intramuscular introduction into animals, we observed that the constructs of the E, M, and N genes could induce high levels of specific antibodies, T cell proliferations, IFN-γ, DTH responses, and in vivo cytotoxic T cells activities specifically against SARS-CoV antigens. The highest immune responses were generated by the construct encoding the nucleocapsid protein. The results suggest that the N, M, and E genes could be used as the targets to prevent SARS-CoV infection in the DNA vaccine development.","Jin, Huali; Xiao, Chong; Chen, Ze; Kang, Youmin; Ma, Yijie; Zhu, Kaichun; Xie, Qifa; Tu, Yixian; Yu, Yang; Wang, Bin",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X05001026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X05001026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15707974/,413

Many studies have revealed a potential regenerative function of the distal airway stem/progenitor cells (DASCs) after lung injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse and human DASCs were expanded, analysed, and engrafted into injured mouse lungs. Single‐cell analyses were performed to reveal the differentiation path of the engrafted cells. Finally, human DASCs were transplanted into COPD mice induced by porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. RESULTS: We showed that isolated mouse and human DASCs could be indefinitely expanded and were able to further differentiate into mature alveolar structures in vitro. Single‐cell analysis indicated that the engrafted cells expressed typical cellular markers of type I alveolar cells as well as the specific secreted proteins. Interestingly, transplantation of human DASCs derived from COPD patients into the lungs of NOD‐SCID mice with COPD injury repaired the tissue damage and improved the pulmonary function. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated that functional lung structure could be reconstituted by intrapulmonary transplantation of DASCs, suggesting a potential therapeutic role of DASCs transplantation in treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Wang, Xiaofan; Zhao, Yu; Li, Dandan; Feng, Yun; Xie, Yusang; Zhou, Yueqing; Zhou, Min; Wang, Yujia; Qu, Jieming; Zuo, Wei",Cell Prolif,https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960563/,413

COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has quickly spread around the globe. This pandemic demands rapid development of drugs and vaccines. Plant-based vaccines are a technology with proven viability, which have led to promising results for candidates evaluated at the clinical level, meaning this technology could contribute towards the fight against COVID-19. Herein, a perspective in how plant-based vaccines can be developed against COVID-19 is presented. Injectable vaccines could be generated by using transient expression systems, which offer the highest protein yields and are already adopted at the industrial level to produce VLPs-vaccines and other biopharmaceuticals under GMPC-processes. Stably-transformed plants are another option, but this approach requires more time for the development of antigen-producing lines. Nonetheless, this approach offers the possibility of developing oral vaccines in which the plant cell could act as the antigen delivery agent. Therefore, this is the most attractive approach in terms of cost, easy delivery, and mucosal immunity induction. The development of multiepitope, rationally-designed vaccines is also discussed regarding the experience gained in expression of chimeric immunogenic proteins in plant systems.","Rosales-Mendoza, Sergio; Márquez-Escobar, Verónica A.; González-Ortega, Omar; Nieto-Gómez, Ricardo; Arévalo-Villalobos, Jaime I.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295153/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8020183,413

Data from a population-based study in Sicily,2020-10-01,"Accurate estimates of the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection are critical to informing pandemic response. Confirmed COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. do not capture the total burden of the pandemic because testing has been primarily restricted to individuals with moderate to severe symptoms due to limited test availability. Here, we use a semi-Bayesian probabilistic bias analysis to account for incomplete testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy. We estimate 6,454,951 cumulative infections compared to 721,245 confirmed cases (1.9% vs. 0.2% of the population) in the United States as of April 18, 2020. Accounting for uncertainty, the number of infections during this period was 3 to 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. 86% (simulation interval: 64–99%) of this difference is due to incomplete testing, while 14% (0.3–36%) is due to imperfect test accuracy. The approach can readily be applied in future studies in other locations or at finer spatial scale to correct for biased testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy to provide a more realistic assessment of COVID-19 burden.","Wu, Sean L.; Mertens, Andrew N.; Crider, Yoshika S.; Nguyen, Anna; Pokpongkiat, Nolan N.; Djajadi, Stephanie; Seth, Anmol; Hsiang, Michelle S.; Colford, John M.; Reingold, Art; Arnold, Benjamin F.; Hubbard, Alan; Benjamin-Chung, Jade",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18272-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32908126/,413

The management of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis has provided exemplary lessons regarding the application of sustainable models of governance. Through a participatory research, guidances are provided to tackle the COVID-19 effects in the tourist sector, namely in the Spanish southwestern region of Sierra de Gata. Seventeen indicators are proposed to enhance the safety measures, commitment of tourist authorities, communities empowered and protection of common resources among tourism industry, tourist authority and communities to spread cooperative awareness, mutual trust and shared objectives. Using a sample of 161 tourism companies, we tested a model of tourism governance with two focus groups during May and October 2020. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilized. Based on the data attained from a questionnaire and interviews, a sustainable tourism model to recover the threatened tourism sector is proposed. Indeed, our results can be used to draw theoretical and practical conclusions such as 1.) connecting private and public interactions to tackle the spread of the virus and strategies to recover the damaged tourist sector, 2.) to develop corporative values among the tourist industry and communities, 3.) to enhance governance models (trusts, consortia, tourist boards, clusters) to promote cooperation, 4.) to improve the local participation of companies, communities and associations in decision-making, and 5.) to prioritize qualitative development goals over quantitative ones, in the touristic territory.

However, most of the current COVID-19 clinical practices and trials do not take the sex factor into consideration. METHODS: We performed a sex-based comparative analysis for the clinical outcomes, peripheral immune cells, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibody levels of 1558 males and 1499 females COVID-19 patients from a single center. The lymphocyte subgroups were measured by Flow cytometry. The total antibody, Spike protein (S)-, receptor binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)- specific IgM and IgG levels were measured by chemiluminescence. RESULTS: We found that male patients had approximately two-fold rates of ICU admission (4.7% vs. 2.7% in males and females, respectively, P = 0.005) and mortality (3% vs. 1.4%, in males and females, respectively, P = 0.004) than female patients. Survival analysis revealed that the male sex is an independent risk factor for death from COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 2.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–3.6, P = 0.003). The level of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood was higher in males during hospitalization. The renal (102/1588 [6.5%] vs. 63/1499 [4.2%], in males and females, respectively, P = 0.002) and hepatic abnormality (650/1588 [40.9%] vs. 475/1499 [31.7%], P = 0.003) were more common in male patients than in female patients. By analyzing dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets after symptom onset, we found that the percentage of CD19+ B cells and CD4+ T cells was generally higher in female patients during the disease course of COVID-19. Notably, the protective RBD-specific IgG against SARS-CoV-2 sharply increased and reached a peak in the fourth week after symptom onset in female patients, while gradually increased and reached a peak in the seventh week after symptom onset in male patients. CONCLUSIONS: Males had an unfavorable prognosis, higher inflammation, a lower percentage of lymphocytes, and indolent antibody responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery. Early medical intervention and close monitoring are important, especially for male COVID-19 patients.

It is shown that depending on the distribution of the extrinsic noise, the master equation yields quantitatively different results compared to using the expectation of the distribution for the stochastic parameter. This difference is incident to the nonlinear terms in the master equation, and we show that the deviation away from the expectation of the extrinsic noise scales nonlinearly with the variance of the distribution. The method presented here converges linearly with respect to the number of particles in the system and exponentially with respect to the order of the polynomials used in the stochastic collocation calculation. This makes the method presented here more accurate than standard Monte Carlo methods, which suffer from slow, nonmonotonic convergence. In epidemiological terms, the results show that extrinsic fluctuations should be taken into account since they effect the speed of disease breakouts and that the gamma distribution should be used to model the basic reproductive number.","Bayati, Basil S.",Phys Rev E,https://doi.org/10.1103/physreve.93.052124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27300847/,413
680532,New aspects in the pathogenesis and management of subacute thyroiditis,2021-05-05,"BACKGROUND: Schools increasingly prioritize social-emotional competence and bullying and cyberbullying prevention, so the development of novel, low-cost, and high-yield programs addressing these topics is important. Further, rigorous assessment of interventions prior to widespread dissemination is crucial. OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the effectiveness and implementation fidelity of the ACT Out! Social Issue Theater program, a 1-hour psychodramatic intervention by professional actors; it also measures students’ receptiveness to the intervention. METHODS: This study is a 2-arm cluster randomized control trial with 1:1 allocation that randomized either to the ACT Out! intervention or control (treatment as usual) at the classroom level (n=76 classrooms in 12 schools across 5 counties in Indiana, comprised of 1571 students at pretest in fourth, seventh, and tenth grades). The primary outcomes were self-reported social-emotional competence, bullying perpetration, and bullying victimization; the secondary outcomes were receptiveness to the intervention, implementation fidelity (independent observer observation), and prespecified subanalyses of social-emotional competence for seventh- and tenth-grade students. All outcomes were collected at baseline and 2-week posttest, with planned 3-months posttest data collection prevented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Intervention fidelity was uniformly excellent (>96% adherence), and students were highly receptive to the program. However, trial results did not support the hypothesis that the intervention would increase participants’ social-emotional competence. The intervention’s impact on bullying was complicated to interpret and included some evidence of small interaction effects (reduced cyberbullying victimization and increased physical bullying perpetration). Additionally, pooled within-group reductions were also observed and discussed but were not appropriate for causal attribution. CONCLUSIONS: This study found no superiority for a 1-hour ACT Out! intervention compared to treatment as usual for social-emotional competence or offline bullying, but some evidence of a small effect for cyberbullying. On the basis of these results and the within-group effects, as a next step, we encourage research into whether the ACT Out! intervention may engender a bystander effect not amenable to randomization by classroom. Therefore, we recommend a larger trial of the ACT Out! intervention that focuses specifically on cyberbullying, measures bystander behavior, is randomized by school, and is controlled for extant bullying prevention efforts at each school.

No approved/proper therapeutics is currently available which can effectively combat this outbreak. Several attempts have been undertaken in the search of effective drugs to control the spread of SARS CoV-2 infection. The main protease (Mpro), key component for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein, is considered to be one of the important drug targets for treating COVID-19. Various phytochemicals, including polyphenols and alkaloids, have been proposed as potent inhibitors of Mpro. The alkaloids from leaf extracts of Justicia adhatoda have also been reported to possess anti-viral activity. But whether these alkaloids exhibit any inhibitory effect on SARS CoV-2 Mpro is far from clear. To explore this in detail, we have adopted computational approaches. Justicia adhatoda alkaloids possessing proper drug-likeness properties and two anti-HIV drugs (lopinavir and darunavir; having binding affinity -7.3 to -7.4 kcal/mol) were docked against SARS CoV-2 Mpro to study their binding properties. Only one alkaloid (anisotine) had interaction with both the catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of Mpro and exhibited good binding affinity (-7.9 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamic simulations (100 ns) revealed that Mpro-anisotine complex is more stable, conformationally less fluctuated; slightly less compact and marginally expanded than Mpro-darunavir/lopinavir complex. Even the number of intermolecular H-bonds and MM-GBSA analysis suggested that anisotine is a more potent Mpro inhibitor than the two previously recommended antiviral drugs (lopinavir and darunavir) and may evolve as a promising anti-COVID-19 drug if proven in animal experiments and on patients.","Ghosh, Rajesh; Chakraborty, Ayon; Biswas, Ashis; Chowdhuri, Snehasis",J Mol Struct,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022286020318044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100380/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286020318044?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2020.129489,413

Drug shortages could cause a change in available NPS, with the introduction of new, unknown, substances. The aims of the current research were to use a web crawler, NPSfinder®, to identify and categorize emerging NPS discussed on a range of drug enthusiasts/psychonauts' websites/fora at the time of the pandemic; social media for these identified NPS were screened as well. The NPSfinder® was used here to automatically scan 24/7 a list of psychonaut websites and NPS online resources. The NPSs identified in the time frame between January and August 2020 were searched in both the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addictions (EMCDDA)/United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) databases and on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube) as well, with a content qualitative analysis having been carried out on reddit.com. Of a total of 229 NPSs being discussed at the time of the pandemic, some 18 NPSs were identified for the first time by the NPSfinder®. These included six cathinones, six opioids, two synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs), two phenylcyclohexylpiperidine (PCP)-like molecules, and two psychedelics. Of these NPSs, 10 were found to be previously unreported to either the UNODC or the EMCDDA. Of these 18 NPSs, opioids and cathinones were the most discussed on social media/reddit, with the highest number of threads associated. Current findings may support the use of both automated web crawlers and social listening approaches to identify emerging NPSs; the pandemic-related imposed restrictions may somehow influence the demand for specific NPS classes.","Catalani, Valeria; Arillotta, Davide; Corkery, John Martin; Guirguis, Amira; Vento, Alessandro; Schifano, Fabrizio",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.632405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633599/,413

METHODS: In this study, 903 patients who had admitted to the emergency department with a pre-diagnosis of COVID-19 between 1 and 18 July 2020 and had chest CT. Two radiologists classified the chest CT findings according to the RSNA and BSTI consensus statements. The performance, sensitivity and specificity values of the two classification systems were calculated and the agreement between the observers was compared by using kappa analysis. RESULTS: Considering RT-PCR test result as a gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values were significantly higher for the two observers according to the BSTI guidance statement and the RSNA expert consensus statement (83.3%, 89.7%, 89.0%; % 81.2,% 89.7,% 88.7, respectively). There was a good agreement in the PCR positive group (κ: 0.707; p < 0.001 for BSTI and κ: 0.716; p < 0.001 for RSNA), a good agreement in the PCR negative group (κ: 0.645; p < 0.001 for BSTI and κ: 0.743; p < 0.001 for RSNA) according to the BSTI and RSNA classification between the two radiologists.

According to Service-Dominant Logic (S-D L), patients become more active. Their role in co-production of services is strengthened and their behaviours changed. Telephone follow-ups can contribute to modifying the relationship between the patient and the nurse navigators in charge of it, moving logically from a passive attitude from the patient to a more active one. METHODS: This study was carried out at Léon Bérard, a cancer control unit, in France. It concerned patients treated in an oncohaematology department, who benefited from telephone follow-ups carried out by nurse specialists during the active phase of their treatment. The multidisciplinary research team including social science researchers, physicians and carers developed a research protocol to study this pilot case. Essentially based on a qualitative approach, it was validated by the centre’s management to study this follow-up on patients’ behaviours. The 1st phase of the research, based on 24 semi-structured interviews with patients undergoing treatment undertaken from November 2018 to September 2019, is presented. RESULTS: The Telephone follow-up was a positive experience for all patients. The action of the nurse specialist helped to develop certain dimensions of in-role and extra-role behaviour that created value. The patients’ discourse has reported a positive follow-up in its clinical dimensions, its psychological dimensions and an enhanced quality of life. We detected a patient activation through their roles but it remained limited. The telephone follow-up also created a patient dependency. CONCLUSIONS: The telephone follow-up is a relevant tool for patients undergoing treatment and it deserves to be more widely deployed. It brings comfort and creates a relationship based on trust but at the same time it limits the emancipation of the patient, which is a central element of the S-D logic and its empowerment.

In healthy populations, wearing a mask does not appear to cause any harmful physiological alterations, and the potentially life-saving benefits of wearing face masks seem to outweigh the documented discomforts (e.g. headaches). However, there continues to be controversy over mask wearing in the United States, even though wearing a mask appears to have only minor physiological drawbacks. While there are minimal physiological impacts on wearing a mask, theoretical evidence suggests that there may be consequential psychological impacts of mask wearing on the basic psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness. These psychological impacts may contribute to the controversy associated with wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. After we discuss the physiological impacts of mask wearing, we will discuss psychological effects associated with wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Scheid, Jennifer L.; Lupien, Shannon P.; Ford, Gregory S.; West, Sarah L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932652/,413

Regarding the roles of government policies, the study finds that the “stay-at-home” measures implemented by states appeared to suppress labor demand. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) program helps to stabilize the advertised wages, but also suppresses labor demand.

We report on the compliance with the COVID-19 vaccine of pts affected by solid tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cancer pts afferent to Medical Oncology-1-Unit of Regina Elena National-Cancer-Institute in Rome were considered eligible for vaccination if they were receiving systemic immunosuppressive antitumor treatment, or received it in the last 6 months, or having an uncontrolled advanced disease. The Pfizer-BNT162b2 vaccine was proposed to all candidates by phone contact or during a scheduled visit. Reasons of refusal were collected by administrating a 6-items-multiple-choice questionnaire. RESULTS: From March 1st to 20th,2021, out 914 eligible pts 102 refused vaccination (11.2%,95%CI9.1-13.2). The most frequent (>10%) reasons reported were concerns about vaccine-related adverse events (48.1%), negative interaction with concomitant antitumor therapy (26.7%) and the fear of allergic reaction (10.7%). The refusal rate (RR) after March 15th (date of AstraZeneca-AZD1222 suspension) was more than doubled compared to the RR observed before (19.7%vs8.6%,OR2.60,95%CI1.69-3.99,p<0.0001)(Fig.1B). ECOG-PS 2 was associated with higher RR compared with ECOG-PS 0-1(OR2.94,95%CI1.04-8.34,p=0.04). No statistically significant differences in RR according to other clinical characteristics were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience represents the first worldwide report on the adherence of cancer-pts to COVID-19 vaccination and underlines how regulatory decisions and media news-spreading could influence the success of the campaign.","Di Noia, Vincenzo; Renna, Davide; Barberi, Vittoria; Dicivita, Mattia; Riva, Federica; Costantini, Giulia; Aquila, Emanuela Dell’; Russillo, Michelangelo; Bracco, Domenico; La Malfa, Antonia Marina; Giannarelli, Diana; Cognetti, Francesco",Eur J Cancer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804921003105?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183225/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2021.05.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804921003105,413
685382,Use of anaesthesia machines for mechanical ventilation and sedation in patients with COVID-19 ARDS,2021-05-10,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce 28-day mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who required oxygen supplementation or invasive mechanical ventilation according to the RECOVERY trial. With the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are seeing increasing use of dexamethasone. This may lead to increased incidence of side effects as well. One of the side effects of dexamethasone therapy is hiccups which can range in presentation from mild and transient to persistent, causing distress and impaired quality of life. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented to the hospital with chief complaint of shortness of breath. Vitals were remarkable for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, improved with oxygen supplementation. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast both showed bilateral airspace opacities. COVID-19 PCR was positive. Patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and started on remdesevir and dexamethasone. On day 3 of therapy, patient endorsed having hiccups without aggravating or relieving factors. These hiccups were suspected to be secondary to dexamethasone after initial evaluation. Gabapentin therapy was planned for relief, but patient's hiccups resolved after 24 hours. Patient completed the remaining dexamethasone therapy without incident. DISCUSSION: This brief case highlights the importance of recognizing dexamethasone induced hiccups as a clinical entity that may increase in incidence given increasing utility of dexamethasone in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Previous studies described this phenomenon in patients who were prescribed dexamethasone for chemotherapy induced nausea. They noticed that rotating dexamethasone with prednisolone in patients who developed hiccups significantly reduced the hiccups intensity. The hiccups were thought to be due to dexamethasone being more permeable to and crossing the blood brain barrier to stimulate the hiccups reflex arc in the midbrain. For patients with COVID-19 who meet criteria for dexamethasone, it may be prudent to continue with dexamethasone despite hiccups if quality of life is not significantly impaired due to lack of convincing evidence regarding efficacy of other steroids in COVID-19. Therapies such as gabapentin, metoclopramide and baclofen have been proposed for hiccups that are significantly affecting quality of life. Dexamethasone induced hiccups usually resolve upon discontinuing the drug. As such, most patients usually require reassurance or brief pharmacotherapy for hiccups. CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone may cause hiccups during the course of therapy for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These hiccups are usual transient and resolve upon discontinuation of the drug.

686129,Observations during the COVID-19 pandemic in chronic heart failure patients with complex devices in a tertiary care cardiac centre using the HeartLogic software,2021-05-24,"The recent COVID-19 outbreak has motivated an extensive development of non-pharmaceutical intervention policies for epidemics containment. While a total lockdown is a viable solution, interesting policies are those allowing some degree of normal functioning of the society, as this allows a continued, albeit reduced, economic activity and lessens the many societal problems associated with a prolonged lockdown. Recent studies have provided evidence that fast periodic alternation of lockdown and normal-functioning days may effectively lead to a good trade-off between outbreak abatement and economic activity. Nevertheless, the correct number of normal days to allocate within each period in such a way to guarantee the desired trade-off is a highly uncertain quantity that cannot be fixed a priori and that must rather be adapted online from measured data. This adaptation task, in turn, is still a largely open problem, and it is the subject of this work. In particular, we study a class of solutions based on hysteresis logic. First, in a rather general setting, we provide general convergence and performance guarantees on the evolution of the decision variable. Then, in a more specific context relevant for epidemic control, we derive a set of results characterizing robustness with respect to uncertainty and giving insight about how a priori knowledge about the controlled process may be used for fine-tuning the control parameters. Finally, we validate the results through numerical simulations tailored on the COVID-19 outbreak.","Bin, Michelangelo; Crisostomi, Emanuele; Ferraro, Pietro; Murray-Smith, Roderick; Parisini, Thomas; Shorten, Robert; Stein, Sebastian",Annu Rev Control,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367578821000687?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1367578821000687; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2021.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404974/,413

The severity of Covid-19 infection is also known to be correlated with lipid disorders. Furthermore, the levels of both serum cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) decrease with Covid-19 severity, with normal levels resuming once the infection has passed. Here we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein interferes with the function of lipoproteins, and that this is dependent on cholesterol. In particular, the ability of HDL to exchange lipids from model cellular membranes is altered when co-incubated with the spike protein. Additionally, the S protein removes lipids and cholesterol from model membranes. We propose that the S protein affects HDL function by removing lipids from it and remodelling its composition/structure.","Correa, Yubexi; Waldie, Sarah; Thépaut, Michel; Micciula, Samantha; Moulin, Martine; Fieschi, Franck; Pichler, Harald; Trevor Forsyth, V.; Haertlein, Michael; Cárdenas, Marité",J Colloid Interface Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021979721009309; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157514/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979721009309?v=s5,413

Compared to the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2, the majority of currently circulating isolates possess an S protein variant characterized by an aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution at amino acid position 614 (D614G). Residue 614 lies outside the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the mutation does not alter the affinity of monomeric S protein for ACE2. However, S(G614), compared to S(D614), mediates more efficient ACE2-mediated transduction of cells by S-pseudotyped vectors and more efficient infection of cells and animals by live SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes and synthesizes the epidemiological and functional observations of the D614G spike mutation, with focus on the biochemical and cell-biological impact of this mutation and its consequences for S protein function.

Additionally, we study whether there are differences in well-being within the group of healthcare workers working with COVID-19 patients, based on personal and work characteristics. We find healthcare workers who are in direct contact with COVID-19 patients report more sleep problems and are more physically exhausted than those who are not in direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Mental exhaustion and general health do not significantly differ between healthcare workers who are in direct contact with COVID-19 patients and those who are not. Among healthcare workers in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, lower well-being on one or more indicators is reported by those who are female, living alone, without leadership role, or without sufficient protective equipment. Regarding age, physical exhaustion is more prevalent under healthcare workers older than 55 years, whereas mental exhaustion is more prevalent under healthcare workers younger than 36 years.

Limited research has explored if proximity to coal-fired power plants contributes to children’s neurobehavioral disorders. OBJECTIVE: This community-based study collected primary data to investigate the relationships of residential proximity to power plants and neurobehavioral problems in children. METHODS: 235 participants aged 6–14 years who lived within 10 miles of two power plants were recruited. Exposure to particulate matter ≤10 μm (PM(10)) was measured in children’s homes using personal modular impactors. Neurobehavioral symptoms were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Multiple regression models were performed to test the hypothesized associations between proximity/exposure and neurobehavioral symptoms. Geospatial statistical methods were used to map the spatial patterns of exposure and neurobehavioral symptoms. RESULTS: A small proportion of the variations of neurobehavioral problems (social problems, affective problems, and anxiety problems) were explained by the regression models in which distance to power plants, traffic proximity, and neighborhood poverty was statistically associated with the neurobehavioral health outcomes. Statistically significant hot spots of participants who had elevated levels of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and social problems were observed in the vicinity of the two power plants. SIGNIFICANCE: Results of this study suggest an adverse impact of proximity to power plants on children’s neurobehavioral health. Although coal-fired power plants are being phased out in the US, health concern about exposure from coal ash storage facilities remains. Furthermore, other countries in the world are increasing coal use and generating millions of tons of pollutants and coal ash. Findings from this study can inform public health policies to reduce children’s risk of neurobehavioral symptoms in relation to proximity to power plants.","Zhang, Charlie H.; Sears, Lonnie; Myers, John V.; Brock, Guy N.; Sears, Clara G.; Zierold, Kristina M.",J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34257388/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41370-021-00369-7,413
689677,The multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) for the prognostic stratification of older inpatients with COVID-19: A multicenter prospective observational cohort study,2021-04-05,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak marks the first time that large amounts of genome sequence data have been generated and made publicly available in near real-time. Early analyses of these data revealed low sequence variation, a finding that is consistent with a recently emerging outbreak, but which raises the question of whether such data are sufficiently informative for phylogenetic inferences of evolutionary rates and time scales. The phylodynamic threshold is a key concept that refers to the point in time at which sufficient molecular evolutionary change has accumulated in available genome samples to obtain robust phylodynamic estimates. For example, before the phylodynamic threshold is reached, genomic variation is so low that even large amounts of genome sequences may be insufficient to estimate the viruss evolutionary rate and the time scale of an outbreak. We collected genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from public databases at 8 different points in time and conducted a range of tests of temporal signal to determine if and when the phylodynamic threshold was reached, and the range of inferences that could be reliably drawn from these data. Our results indicate that by February 2nd 2020, estimates of evolutionary rates and time scales had become possible. Analyses of subsequent data sets, that included between 47 to 122 genomes, converged at an evolutionary rate of about 1.1x10-3 subs/site/year and a time of origin of around late November 2019. Our study provides guidelines to assess the phylodynamic threshold and demonstrates that establishing this threshold constitutes a fundamental step for understanding the power and limitations of early data in outbreak genome surveillance.","Duchene, Sebastian; Featherstone, Leo; Haritopoulou-Sinanidou, Melina; Rambaut, Andrew; Lemey, Philippe; Baele, Guy",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.077735,413

There was statistical association between diarrheic animals carrying E. coli Stx1/eae (+) in their feces at 2 and 4 weeks of age (P = 0.003) and E. coli Stx2 (+) at 5 weeks of age (P = 0.03). Rotavirus was detected in 49 (5.76 %) fecal samples collected from 33 calves (49.2 %). The presence of rotavirus was correlated with diarrheic feces (P < 0.0001) rather than feces with normal consistency. There was a significant relationship between age group and diarrhea (P = 0.001). Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was detected in 93 fecal samples collected from 46 calves (68.6 %). There was an association (P < 0.0001) between diarrheic animals positive for BCoV and age groups. The results demonstrate the importance of the pathogens studied in the etiology of diarrhea in calves.","Coura, Fernanda Morcatti; Freitas, Moisés Dias; Ribeiro, Juliane; de Leme, Raquel Arruda; de Souza, Cecília; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo; Facury Filho, Elias Jorge; de Carvalho, Antônio Último; Silva, Marcos Xavier; Lage, Andrey Pereira; Heinemann, Marcos Bryan",Trop Anim Health Prod,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-014-0675-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25311440/,413
