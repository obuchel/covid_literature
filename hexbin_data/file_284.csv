1301,Machine learning approach identifies new pathways associated with demyelination in a viral model of multiple sclerosis,2009-01-14,"Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis is an experimentally virus-induced inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord, displaying clinical and pathological similarities to chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. The aim of this study was to identify pathways associated with chronic demyelination using an assumption-free combined microarray and immunohistology approach. Movement control as determined by rotarod assay significantly worsened in Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis -virus-infected SJL/J mice from 42 to 196 days after infection (dpi). In the spinal cords, inflammatory changes were detected 14 to 196 dpi, and demyelination progressively increased from 42 to 196 dpi. Microarray analysis revealed 1001 differentially expressed genes over the study period. The dominating changes as revealed by k-means and functional annotation clustering included up-regulations related to intrathecal antibody production and antigen processing and presentation via major histocompatibility class II molecules. A random forest machine learning algorithm revealed that down-regulated lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, differentially expressed neurite morphogenesis and up-regulated toll-like receptor-4-induced pathways were intimately associated with demyelination as measured by immunohistology. Conclusively, although transcriptional changes were dominated by the adaptive immune response, the main pathways associated with demyelination included up-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 and down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol biosynthesis is a rate limiting step of myelination and its down-regulation is suggested to be involved in chronic demyelination by an inhibition of remyelination.","Ulrich, Reiner; Kalkuhl, Arno; Deschl, Ulrich; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang",J Cell Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3837619/,284
1967,The Large Scale Machine Learning in an Artificial Society: Prediction of the Ebola Outbreak in Beijing,2015-09-20,"Ebola virus disease (EVD) distinguishes its feature as high infectivity and mortality. Thus, it is urgent for governments to draw up emergency plans against Ebola. However, it is hard to predict the possible epidemic situations in practice. Luckily, in recent years, computational experiments based on artificial society appeared, providing a new approach to study the propagation of EVD and analyze the corresponding interventions. Therefore, the rationality of artificial society is the key to the accuracy and reliability of experiment results. Individuals' behaviors along with travel mode directly affect the propagation among individuals. Firstly, artificial Beijing is reconstructed based on geodemographics and machine learning is involved to optimize individuals' behaviors. Meanwhile, Ebola course model and propagation model are built, according to the parameters in West Africa. Subsequently, propagation mechanism of EVD is analyzed, epidemic scenario is predicted, and corresponding interventions are presented. Finally, by simulating the emergency responses of Chinese government, the conclusion is finally drawn that Ebola is impossible to outbreak in large scale in the city of Beijing.","Zhang, Peng; Chen, Bin; Ma, Liang; Li, Zhen; Song, Zhichao; Duan, Wei; Qiu, Xiaogang",Comput Intell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4592709/,284
3284,Cross-Species Meta-Analysis of Transcriptomic Data in Combination With Supervised Machine Learning Models Identifies the Common Gene Signature of Lactation Process,2018-07-12,"Lactation, a physiologically complex process, takes place in mammary gland after parturition. The expression profile of the effective genes in lactation has not comprehensively been elucidated. Herein, meta-analysis, using publicly available microarray data, was conducted identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pre- and post-peak milk production. Three microarray datasets of Rat, Bos Taurus, and Tammar wallaby were used. Samples related to pre-peak (n = 85) and post-peak (n = 24) milk production were selected. Meta-analysis revealed 31 DEGs across the studied species. Interestingly, 10 genes, including MRPS18B, SF1, UQCRC1, NUCB1, RNF126, ADSL, TNNC1, FIS1, HES5 and THTPA, were not detected in original studies that highlights meta-analysis power in biosignature discovery. Common target and regulator analysis highlighted the high connectivity of CTNNB1, CDD4 and LPL as gene network hubs. As data originally came from three different species, to check the effects of heterogeneous data sources on DEGs, 10 attribute weighting (machine learning) algorithms were applied. Attribute weighting results showed that the type of organism had no or little effect on the selected gene list. Systems biology analysis suggested that these DEGs affect the milk production by improving the immune system performance and mammary cell growth. This is the first study employing both meta-analysis and machine learning approaches for comparative analysis of gene expression pattern of mammary glands in two important time points of lactation process. The finding may pave the way to use of publically available to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of physiologically complex traits such as lactation in mammals.","Farhadian, Mohammad; Rafat, Seyed A.; Hasanpur, Karim; Ebrahimi, Mansour; Ebrahimie, Esmaeil",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6052129/,284
6709,Liver Resection for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients with Renal Dysfunction,2018-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Recipients of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) are at high risk for infections caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all infections caused by S. maltophilia in HSCT recipients in a single center in Israel during a 4 year period. RESULTS: Of 570 patients undergoing HSCT, 19 patients with an invasive S. maltophilia infection were identified. Sixteen had allogeneic HSCT and 3 had autologous HSCT. Seventeen patients (90%) had an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC) at the time of infection. S. maltophilia infections were detected in three clinical settings: as a complication of prolonged neutropenia (n = 9), as a CVC-related non-neutropenic infection occurring after CVC manipulation (n = 8) and as a respiratory tract infection (n = 2). Eleven patients (58%) had a polymicrobial infection. Ten patients (52.6%) received carbapenems during the previous month. The treatment for all patients included broad spectrum antibiotics, which were switched according to susceptibilities upon identification of the isolates. All isolates were susceptible in vitro to TMP-SMX. CVCs were removed in 12 patients (70%). Six patients, all after allogeneic HSCT, died. The CVC was removed in only two of the five patients with CVCs who died. CONCLUSIONS: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen in HSCT recipients, both in the early neutropenic phase and in the non-neutropenic phase. It is commonly associated with the presence and manipulation of an indwelling CVC. Removal of the CVC in addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy (TMP-SMX) is crucial for infection control.","Yeshurun, M.; Gafter-Gvili, A.; Thaler, M.; Keller, N.; Nagler, A.; Shimoni, A.",Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102005/,284
9781,Big‐bodied males help us recognize that females have big pelves,2004-12-28,"Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are common, but little is known about the response of biomarkers of inflammation in the lungs. Therefore, our primary aim was to compare the concentration of l‐lactate to the concentration of neutrophils in sputum and systemic markers of infection. Because it is difficult to differentiate viral and bacterial infection on the basis of clinical presentation in LRTI, our secondary aim was to evaluate if l‐ and d‐lactate may serve as markers of local inflammation as representatives of neutrophils and bacteria, respectively. METHODS: Patients with acute LRTI were prospectively recruited. Sputum samples were collected and analysed for neutrophil count, l‐lactate and d‐lactate. We had data on pathogens from sputum cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (atypical bacteria, virus) and C‐reactive protein (CRP) from blood. RESULTS: In 44 sputum samples from 32 patients, the median (interquartile range (IQR)) sputum neutrophil granulocyte count was 0.615 × 10(7) cells/mL (0.236–1.575). The sputum neutrophil granulocyte count was associated with sputum l‐lactate (p = 0.011) and CRP (p = 0.018), but not with d‐lactate (p = 0.177). There was a strong association between sputum d‐lactate and l‐lactate (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: As l‐lactate in sputum is closely correlated to sequestration of neutrophils in the lungs, l‐lactate is a marker for local inflammation in LRTI and a potential biomarker in clinical management of LRTI. On expectorated sputum, d‐lactate had no clinical relevance.","Fredman, Gabriella; Kolpen, Mette; Hertz, Frederik Boetius; Petersen, Pelle Trier; Jensen, Andreas Vestergaard; Baunbæk‐Egelund, Gertrud; Ravn, Pernille; Jensen, Peter Østrup; Faurholt‐Jepsen, Daniel",APMIS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159756/,284
10497,Study on Prediction Model of HIV Incidence Based on GRU Neural Network Optimized by MHPSO,2020-03-10,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that can lead towards death if left untreated. TB detection involves extraction of complex TB manifestation features such as lung cavity, air space consolidation, endobronchial spread, and pleural effusions from chest x-rays (CXRs). Deep learning based approach named convolutional neural network (CNN) has the ability to learn complex features from CXR images. The main problem is that CNN does not consider uncertainty to classify CXRs using softmax layer. It lacks in presenting the true probability of CXRs by differentiating confusing cases during TB detection. This paper presents the solution for TB identification by using Bayesian-based convolutional neural network (B-CNN). It deals with the uncertain cases that have low discernibility among the TB and non-TB manifested CXRs. The proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN is evaluated on two TB benchmark datasets, i.e., Montgomery and Shenzhen. For training and testing of proposed scheme we have utilized Google Colab platform which provides NVidia Tesla K80 with 12 GB of VRAM, single core of 2.3 GHz Xeon Processor, 12 GB RAM and 320 GB of disk. B-CNN achieves 96.42% and 86.46% accuracy on both dataset, respectively as compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning and CNN approaches. Moreover, B-CNN validates its results by filtering the CXRs as confusion cases where the variance of B-CNN predicted outputs is more than a certain threshold. Results prove the supremacy of B-CNN for the identification of TB and non-TB sample CXRs as compared to counterparts in terms of accuracy, variance in the predicted probabilities and model uncertainty.",,IEEE Access,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176037/,284

14762,Expansion of RiPP biosynthetic space through integration of pan-genomics and machine learning uncovers a novel class of lanthipeptides,2020-12-22,"Accumulating evidence shows that RAGE has an important function in the pathogenesis of sepsis. However, the mechanisms by which RAGE transduces signals to downstream kinase cascades during septic shock are not clear. Here, we identify SLP76 as a binding partner for the cytosolic tail of RAGE both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate that SLP76 binds RAGE through its sterile α motif (SAM) to mediate downstream signaling. Genetic deficiency of RAGE or SLP76 reduces AGE-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and IKKα/β, as well as cytokine release. Delivery of the SAM domain into macrophages via the TAT cell-penetrating peptide blocks proinflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, administration of TAT-SAM attenuates inflammatory cytokine release and tissue damage in mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and protects these mice from the lethality of sepsis. These findings reveal an important function for SLP76 in RAGE-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling and shed light on the development of SLP76-targeted therapeutics for sepsis.","Yan, Zhengzheng; Luo, Haihua; Xie, Bingyao; Tian, Tian; Li, Shan; Chen, Zhixia; Liu, Jinghua; Zhao, Xuwen; Zhang, Liyong; Deng, Yongqiang; Billiar, Timothy R.; Jiang, Yong",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7804203/,284

Here, we characterize the folding and immunogenicity of heterogeneous antigen display by integrating (a) dual-stage antigen SAPN presenting the P. falciparum (Pf) merozoite surface protein 1 subunit, PfMSP1(19), and Pf cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites, PfCelTOS, in addition to (b) a homogenous antigen SAPN displaying two copies of PfCelTOS. Mice and rabbits were utilized to evaluate antigen-specific humoral and cellular induction as well as functional antibodies via growth inhibition of the blood-stage parasite. We demonstrate that antigen orientation and folding influence the elicited immune response, and when appropriately designed, SAPN can serve as an adaptable platform for an effective multi-antigen display.","Schneider, Cosette G.; Taylor, Justin A.; Sibilo, Michael Q.; Miura, Kazutoyo; Mallory, Katherine L.; Mann, Christopher; Karch, Christopher; Beck, Zoltan; Matyas, Gary R.; Long, Carole A.; Bergmann-Leitner, Elke; Burkhard, Peter; Angov, Evelina",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7911071/,284
15675,Benchmarking Attention-Based Interpretability of Deep Learning in Multivariate Time Series Predictions,2021-01-25,"Organs On-a-Chip represent novel platforms for modelling human physiology and disease. The lymph node (LN) is a relevant immune organ in which B and T lymphocytes are spatially organized in a complex architecture, and it is the place where the immune response initiates. The present study addresses the utility of a recently designed LN-on-a-chip to dissect and understand the effect of drugs delivered to cells in a fluidic multicellular 3D setting that mimics the human LN. To do so, we analyzed the motility and viability of human B and T cells exposed to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). We show that the innovative LN platform, which operates at a microscale level, allows real-time monitoring of co-cultured B and T cells by imaging, and supports cellular random movement. HCQ delivered to cells through a constant and continuous flow induces a reduction in T cell velocity while promotes persistent rotational motion. We also find that HCQ increases the production of reactive oxygen species in T cells. Taken together, these results highlight the potential of the LN-on-a-chip to be applied in drug screening and development, and in cellular dynamics studies.","Hallfors, Nicholas; Shanti, Aya; Sapudom, Jiranuwat; Teo, Jeremy; Petroianu, Georg; Lee, SungMun; Planelles, Lourdes; Stefanini, Cesare",Bioengineering (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912616/,284
16498,From ECG signals to images: a transformation based approach for deep learning,2021-02-10,"Gene regulatory elements are central drivers of phenotypic variation and thus of critical importance towards understanding the genetics of complex traits. The Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes consortium was formed to collaboratively annotate the functional elements in animal genomes, starting with domesticated animals. Here we present an expansive collection of datasets from eight diverse tissues in three important agricultural species: chicken (Gallus gallus), pig (Sus scrofa), and cattle (Bos taurus). Comparative analysis of these datasets and those from the human and mouse Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects reveal that a core set of regulatory elements are functionally conserved independent of divergence between species, and that tissue-specific transcription factor occupancy at regulatory elements and their predicted target genes are also conserved.

Sports outcomes prediction is an attractive sports analytic challenge as it provides useful information for operations in the sports market. In this study, a hybrid basketball game outcomes prediction scheme is developed for predicting the final score of the National Basketball Association (NBA) games by integrating five data mining techniques, including extreme learning machine, multivariate adaptive regression splines, k-nearest neighbors, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and stochastic gradient boosting. Designed features are generated by merging different game-lags information from fundamental basketball statistics and used in the proposed scheme. This study collected data from all the games of the NBA 2018–2019 seasons. There are 30 teams in the NBA and each team play 82 games per season. A total of 2460 NBA game data points were collected. Empirical results illustrated that the proposed hybrid basketball game prediction scheme achieves high prediction performance and identifies suitable game-lag information and relevant game features (statistics). Our findings suggested that a two-stage XGBoost model using four pieces of game-lags information achieves the best prediction performance among all competing models. The six designed features, including averaged defensive rebounds, averaged two-point field goal percentage, averaged free throw percentage, averaged offensive rebounds, averaged assists, and averaged three-point field goal attempts, from four game-lags have a greater effect on the prediction of final scores of NBA games than other game-lags.

In light of this, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare these two medications in the treatment of patients with FN in terms of treatment success and adverse events. Data source and study design We conducted a search of major electronic databases [MEDLINE (PubMed, Ovid), Google Scholar, clinicaltrial.org], which returned 10 studies with 1,630 patients (vancomycin: 788; teicoplanin: 842) for analysis. An unadjusted odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for all studies, as well as separate sub-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective studies. Results The average age of patients ranged from 37 to 57 years in the vancomycin group and 31 to 57 years in the teicoplanin group (n=9 studies). Over half of the patients in both groups were male (vancomycin: 55.6%; teicoplanin: 57.7%; n=9 studies).

The primary goal of this research is to present an educational proposal for imparting socio-emotional competencies among primary school students. We attempt to impart socio-emotional competencies based on: (1) fostering self-knowledge, self-esteem, and respect for others among students; (2) developing behaviors that allow them to perceive and express feelings and self-regulating emotions; and (3) developing assertive communication skills aimed at improving conflict resolution. This program has been designed in such a way that it is implemented throughout the academic year by organizing bi-monthly sessions of 45 min each, held until the completion of 15 sessions. The sample consists of 100 students in the third grade, with the control and experimental groups having an equal number of students (50 each). The instruments used for this research are: (a) BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory (Youth Version [BarOn EQ-i:YV]): used for measuring emotional and social functioning; (b) the Matson Evaluation of Social Skills with Youngsters (MESSY): used for assessing social skills; and (c) Questionnaire for the Assessment of School Violence in Preschool and Primary School Questionnaire. To check the effectiveness of the educational intervention, a quasi-experimental design, along with pretest-posttest control group design, is used in accordance with the general linear model. Its effectiveness is also checked using repeated measures analysis of variance.

To circumvent this issue, we focused on the bat adenovirus (BtAdV) strain, which was previously isolated from healthy microbats. We previously showed that this virus replicated efficiently in canine cell lines and did not serologically cross-react with CAdVs, suggesting that it may offer the possibility of an OV candidate for canine tumors. Here, we tested the growth properties and cytotoxicity of the BtAdV Mm32 strain in a panel of canine tumor cells and found that its characteristics were equivalent to those of CAdVs. To produce an Mm32 construct with enhanced tumor specificity, we established a novel reverse genetics system for BtAdV based on bacterial artificial chromosomes, and generated a recombinant virus, Mm32-E1Ap + cTERTp, by inserting a tumor-specific canine telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter into its E1A regulatory region. The growth and cytotoxicity of this recombinant were superior to those of wild-type Mm32 in canine tumor cells, unlike in normal canine cells. These data suggest that Mm32-E1Ap + cTERTp could be a promising OV for alternative canine cancer therapies.","Matsugo, Hiromichi; Kitamura-Kobayashi, Tomoya; Kamiki, Haruhiko; Ishida, Hiroho; Sekine, Wataru; Takenaka-Uema, Akiko; Nakagawa, Takayuki; Murakami, Shin; Horimoto, Taisuke",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8373906/,284

However, osseointegration with host tissue is often not definite, which may cause implant failure at times. The present study investigates the capacity of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-secretome, formulated as a ready-to-use and freeze-dried medicinal product (the Lyosecretome), to promote the osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties of titanium cages. In vitro tests were conducted using adipose tissue-derived MSCs seeded on titanium cages with or without Lyosecretome. After 14 days, in the presence of Lyosecretome, significant cell proliferation improvement was observed. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the cytocompatibility of titanium cages: the seeded MSCs showed a spread morphology and an initial formation of filopodia. After 7 days, in the presence of Lyosecretome, more frequent and complex cellular processes forming bridges across the porous surface of the scaffold were revealed. Also, after 14 and 28 days of culturing in osteogenic medium, the amount of mineralized matrix detected by alizarin red was significantly higher when Lyosecretome was used. Finally, improved osteogenesis with Lyosecretome was confirmed by confocal analysis after 28 and 56 days of treatment, and demonstrating the production by osteoblast-differentiated MSCs of osteocalcin, a specific bone matrix protein.","Bari, Elia; Tartara, Fulvio; Cofano, Fabio; di Perna, Giuseppe; Garbossa, Diego; Perteghella, Sara; Sorlini, Marzio; Mandracchia, Delia; Giovannelli, Lorella; Gaetani, Paolo; Torre, Maria Luisa; Segale, Lorena",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8395097/,284
20484,Identification of Targeted Proteins by Jamu Formulas for Different Efficacies Using Machine Learning Approach,2021-08-23,"Propolis is a natural material that honey bees (Apis mellifera) produce from various botanical sources. The therapeutic activity of propolis, including antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory effects, have been known since antiquity. Cancer is one of the major burdens of disease worldwide, therefore, numerous studies are being conducted to develop new chemotherapeutic agents and treatments for cancer. Propolis is a rich source of biologically active compounds, which affect numerous signaling pathways regulating crucial cellular processes. The results of the latest research show that propolis can inhibit proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis of cancer cells and stimulate apoptosis. Moreover, it may influence the tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance of cancers. This review briefly summarizes the molecular mechanisms of anticancer activity of propolis and its compounds and highlights the potential benefits of propolis to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","Forma, Ewa; Bryś, Magdalena",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8399583/,284
20795,Exploiting Feature Selection and Neural Network Techniques for Identification of Focal and Nonfocal EEG Signals in TQWT Domain,2021-08-27,"Coxiella burnetii is a highly infectious, intracellular, Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that causes human Q fever, an acute flu-like illness that can progress to chronic endocarditis. C. burnetii is transmitted to humans via aerosols and has long been considered a potential biological warfare agent. Although antibiotics, such as doxycycline, effectively treat acute Q fever, a recently identified antibiotic-resistant strain demonstrates the ability of C. burnetii to resist traditional antimicrobials, and chronic disease is extremely difficult to treat with current options. These findings highlight the need for new Q fever therapeutics, and repurposed drugs that target eukaryotic functions to prevent bacterial replication are of increasing interest in infectious disease. To identify this class of anti-C. burnetii therapeutics, we screened a library of 727 FDA-approved or late-stage clinical trial compounds using a human macrophage-like cell model of infection. Eighty-eight compounds inhibited bacterial replication, including known antibiotics, antipsychotic or antidepressant treatments, antihistamines, and several additional compounds used to treat a variety of conditions. The majority of identified anti-C. burnetii compounds target host neurotransmitter system components. Serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and adrenergic components are among the most highly represented targets and potentially regulate macrophage activation, cytokine production, and autophagy. Overall, our screen identified multiple host-directed compounds that can be pursued for potential use as anti-C. burnetii drugs. IMPORTANCECoxiella burnetii causes the debilitating disease Q fever in humans. This infection is difficult to treat with current antibiotics and can progress to long-term, potentially fatal infection in immunocompromised individuals or when treatment is delayed. Here, we identified many new potential treatment options in the form of drugs that are either FDA approved or have been used in late-stage clinical trials and target human neurotransmitter systems. These compounds are poised for future characterization as nontraditional anti-C. burnetii therapies.","Fullerton, Marissa S.; Colonne, Punsiri M.; Dragan, Amanda L.; Brann, Katelynn R.; Kurten, Richard C.; Voth, Daniel E.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8386451/,284
21805,Machine Learning for Smart Environments in B5G Networks: Connectivity and QoS,2021-09-18,"Lung cancer is the second most common and lethal cancer in the world. Chemotherapy is the preferred treatment modality for lung cancer and prolongs patient survival by effective controlling of tumor growth. However, owing to the nonspecific delivery of anticancer drugs, systemic chemotherapy has limited clinical efficacy and significant systemic adverse effects. Inhalation routes, on the other hand, allow for direct delivery of drugs to the lungs in high local concentrations, enhancing their anti-tumor activity with minimum side effects. Preliminary research studies have shown that inhaled chemotherapy may be tolerated with manageable adverse effects such as bronchospasm and cough. Enhancing the anticancer drugs deposition in tumor cells and limiting their distribution to other healthy cells will therefore increase their clinical efficacy and decrease their local and systemic toxicities. Because of the controlled release and localization of tumors, nanoparticle formulations are a viable option for the delivery of chemotherapeutics to lung cancers via inhalation. The respiratory tract physiology and lung clearance mechanisms are the key barriers to the effective deposition and preservation of inhaled nanoparticle formulations in the lungs. Designing and creating smart nanoformulations to optimize lung deposition, minimize pulmonary clearance, and improve cancerous tissue targeting have been the subject of recent research studies. This review focuses on recent examples of work in this area, along with the opportunities and challenges for the pulmonary delivery of smart nanoformulations to treat lung cancers.","Yu, Xian-Yan; Jin, Xue; Shou, Zhang-Xuan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8477964/,284
21838,Preventing dataset shift from breaking machine-learning biomarkers,2021-09-28,"Several antibiotics demonstrate both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory activities and are used to treat inflammatory pulmonary disorders. Lefamulin is a pleuromutilin antibiotic approved to treat community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). This study evaluated lefamulin anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro in a lipopolysaccharide-induced lung neutrophilia model in which mouse airways were challenged with intranasal lipopolysaccharide. Lefamulin and comparators azithromycin and dexamethasone were administered 30min before lipopolysaccharide challenge; neutrophil infiltration into BALF and inflammatory mediator induction in lung homogenates were measured 4h postchallenge. Single subcutaneous lefamulin doses (10‒140mg/kg) resulted in dose-dependent reductions of BALF neutrophil cell counts, comparable to or more potent than subcutaneous azithromycin (10‒100mg/kg) and oral/intraperitoneal dexamethasone (0.5/1mg/kg). Lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and GM-CSF), chemokine (CXCL-1, CXCL-2, and CCL-2), and MMP-9 levels were significantly and dose-dependently reduced in mouse lung tissue with lefamulin; effects were comparable to or more potent than with dexamethasone or azithromycin. Pharmacokinetic analyses confirmed exposure-equivalence of 30mg/kg subcutaneous lefamulin in mice to a single clinical lefamulin dose to treat CABP in humans (150mg intravenous/600mg oral). In vitro, neither lefamulin nor azithromycin had any relevant influence on lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine/chemokine levels in J774.2 mouse macrophage or human peripheral blood mononuclear cell supernatants, nor were any effects observed on IL-8‒induced human neutrophil chemotaxis. These in vitro results suggest that impediment of neutrophil infiltration by lefamulin in vivo may not occur through direct interaction with macrophages or neutrophilic chemotaxis. This is the first study to demonstrate inhibition of neutrophilic lung infiltration and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine concentrations by clinically relevant lefamulin doses. This anti-inflammatory activity may be beneficial in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, cystic fibrosis, or severe inflammation-mediated lung injury, similar to glucocorticoid (eg, dexamethasone) activity. Future lefamulin anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory activity studies are warranted to further elucidate mechanism of action and evaluate clinical implications.","Hafner, Michael; Paukner, Susanne; Wicha, Wolfgang W.; Hrvačić, Boška; Cedilak, Matea; Faraho, Ivan; Gelone, Steven P.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8480901/,284

In part, the previous switched epidemic models are reintroduced with continuous (e.g., vaccination of newborns continuously in time) or switching control (i.e., piecewise continuous application of vaccination or treatment schemes) for evaluation and optimization. As discussed earlier, infectious disease models are a crucial component in designing and implementing detection, prevention, and control programs (e.g., the World Health Organization’s program against smallpox, leading to its global eradication by 1977). The switched SIR model is first returned to for consideration and analysis of vaccination of the susceptible group (e.g., newborns or the entire cohort). Subsequently, the developed theoretical methods are applied to the switched SIR model with a treatment program in effect. Common Lyapunov functions are used to provide controlled eradication of diseases modeled by the so-called SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model with seasonal variations captured by switching. A screening process, where traveling individuals are examined for infection, is proposed and studied for the switched multi-city model of the previous chapter.

For infectious diseases, one must study the circumstances under which both infection and disease occur, for these may be different. Infection is the consequence of an encounter of a potentially pathogenic microorganism with a susceptible human host through an appropriate portal of entry and usually involves a demonstrable host response to the agent. Exposure is the key factor, and the sources of infection lie mostly outside the individual human host, within the environment, or in other infected hosts. Disease represents one of the possible consequences of infection, and the factors important in its development are mostly intrinsic to the host, although the dosage and virulence of the infecting microbe play a role. These intrinsic factors include the age at the time of infection, the portal of entry, the presence or absence of immunity, the vigor of the primary defense system, the efficiency and nature of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, the genetic makeup of the host, the state of nutrition, the presence of other diseases, and psychosocial influences. These factors that result in the occurrence of clinical illness among those infected have been called the “clinical illness-promotion factors,”(3) and many of them remain unknown. The host responses can include death, the classic clinical features of the disease, mild or atypical forms, subclinical and inapparent infections, and the carrier state, which may exist in the absence of a detectable host response. While the clinician is primarily concerned with disease, the epidemiologist is interested in both infection and disease. Infection without disease is a common phenomenon, so that a study limited to clinical illness alone would give an incomplete epidemiological picture and would be a poor basis for control and prevention.(4) A full understanding involves the pathogenesis of the process leading to clinical disease both in the community and in the individual.","Evans, Alfred S.",Bacterial Infections of Humans,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176254/,284

It is of serious concern and extreme challenge not only to the health personnel but also to the countries for containment. The causative organism is SARS-CoV-2, RNA virus of subgenus Sarbecovirus, similar to the SARS virus, and seventh member of the human coronavirus family responsible for this zoonotic infection. It binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE-2) receptor and causes constitutional and respiratory symptoms. The major mode of transmission is human to human and the median incubation period is 4 days. The most common symptom as studied from various cohorts of COVID-19 patients are fever (83–98%) followed by fatigue (70%) and dry cough (59%); gastrointestinal symptoms are relatively uncommon differentiating it from SARS and MERS. Most of the SAR-CoV-2 infection are mild (80%) with a usual recovery period of 2 weeks. COVID-19 commonly affects males in the middle age and elderly age group, with highest case fatality (8–15%) among those aged >80 years. The disease begins with fever, dry cough, fatigue and myalgia progressing to dyspnoea and ARDS over 6 and 8 days post exposure, respectively. Underlying co-morbidities increase mortality in COVID-19. Poor prognostic factors are elderly, co-morbidities, severe lymphopaenia, high CRP and D-dimer >1 μg/L. The overall mortality rate ranges from 1.5 to 3.6%.

32963,Unsupervised Bootstrapping of Active Learning for Entity Resolution,2020-05-07,"BACKGROUND: The path for the development of hypersecreting strains of Trichoderma reesei capable of producing industrially relevant enzyme titers remains elusive despite over 70 years of research and industrial utilization. Herein, we describe the rational engineering of the publicly available T. reesei RUT-C30 strain and a customized process for cellulase production based on agroindustrial by-products. RESULTS: A CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to introduce six genetic modifications in RUT-C30. Implemented changes included the constitutive expression of a mutated allele of the cellulase master regulator XYR1, the expression of two heterologous enzymes, the β-glucosidase CEL3A from Talaromyces emersonii and the invertase SUC1 from Aspergillus niger, and the deletion of genes encoding the cellulase repressor ACE1 and the extracellular proteases SLP1 and PEP1. These alterations resulted in a remarkable increase of protein secretion rates by RUT-C30 and amended its well described β-glucosidase deficiency while enabling the utilization of sucrose and eliminating the requirement of inducing sugars for enzyme production. With a developed sugarcane molasses-based bioprocess, the engineered strain reached an extracellular protein titer of 80.6 g L(−1) (0.24 g L(−1) h(−1)), which is the highest experimentally supported titer so far reported for T. reesei. The produced enzyme cocktail displayed increased levels of cellulase and hemicellulase activities, with particularly large increments being observed for the specific activities of β-glucosidase (72-fold) and xylanase (42-fold). Notably, it also exhibited a saccharification efficiency similar to that of a commercially available cellulase preparation in the deconstruction of industrially pretreated sugarcane straw. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates the rational steps for the development of a cellulase hyperproducing strain from a well-characterized genetic background available in the public domain, the RUT-C30, associated with an industrially relevant bioprocess, paving new perspectives for Trichoderma research on cellulase production.","Fonseca, Lucas Miranda; Parreiras, Lucas Salera; Murakami, Mario Tyago",Biotechnol Biofuels,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7243233/,284

To screen different immunomodulatory medicinal compounds to unravel their interaction with SARS-COV-2 viral proteins. Materials & methods: A library of immunomodulatory medicinal compounds with antiviral capability were analyzed against SARS proteases, spike protein and nonstructural proteins (NSP-9, 15) using Autodock vina. Results: Out of more than 300 medicinal compounds, only six compounds: arzanol, ferulic acid, genistein, resveratrol, rosmanol and thymohydroquinone showed significant interaction with the SARS viral proteins by forming hydrogen bonds with the active site residues with low binding energy. Further ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) analysis showed good pharmacokinetic properties and low acute toxicity of these compounds. Conclusion: The current study provides convincing evidence that these medicinal compounds exert antiviral activity against the SARS-COV-2 virus and could be further exploited for the treatment of this disease.","Salman, Saad; Shah, Fahad H; Idrees, Jawaria; Idrees, Fariha; Velagala, Shreya; Ali, Johar; Khan, Abid A",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7243912/,284

If we are able to predict the situations in which BERT will fail, can we improve the performance by providing alternative models for these situations? We test several strategies and models, as alternatives to the standalone BERT model in the possible failure situations, and we take advantage of semantic features extracted from Discourse Representation Structures.","Fialho, Pedro; Coheur, Luísa; Quaresma, Paulo",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274325/,284

Motivation for this problem comes from a real-world scenario in an ever-changing environment, where the time to solve such optimization problem is constrained instead of endlessly searching for the optimal solution. First, a hybrid method combining Ant Colony Optimization with Local Search is proposed, which is used to solve a given static instance. Then, a framework to handle and adapt to dynamic changes over time is defined. A new method pairing nearest neighbourhood search with subtractive clustering is proposed to improve initial solutions and accelerate the convergence of the optimization algorithm. Overall, the proposed strategy presents good results for the dynamic environment and is suitable to be applied on real-world scenarios.","Martins, Miguel S.

We here focus on two such generalisations that apply to sets of probability measures: E-admissibility and maximality. Both of them can be regarded as special instances of so-called choice functions, a very general mathematical framework for decision making. For each of these two decision rules, we provide a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on choice functions that uniquely characterises this rule, thereby providing an axiomatic foundation for imprecise decision making with sets of probabilities. A representation theorem for Archimedean choice functions in terms of coherent lower previsions lies at the basis of both results.","De Bock, Jasper",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274763/,284

In a preliminary study to test the system, we were able to evaluate children’s performance over four different age groups by focusing on their performance during the interaction with the robot.

However, many agent systems are not developed with the ability to understand non-verbal input. Being able to automatically parse such input is essential for the practice of interpersonal skills such as empathy. Currently, it is still an open question which prosodic or visual features would aid automatic classification of empathy and how this knowledge can be used to support the practice of these skills. As a first step towards this goal, we report on 42 second-year nursing students practicing their empathy skills with a virtual patient or through collaborative role playing. We found that across both the role playing and simulation, students assessed their empathy as increasing over time but as higher during the role playing.

The main idea of HLBP is to threshold the distance between the current pixel and each of its neighbors with a homogeneity tolerance value which correspond more to the underlying spatial structures consequently allow extracting highly distinctive invariant features of the image. To assess the performance of the our proposed descriptor, we use “Outex"" database and compared with the basic (LBPs).

The application of flexible fibreoptic intubation in patients with difficult airways has been identified as the recommended method in various international guidelines. However, providing the opportunity to adequately train residents can be challenging. Using large animals for practice during ongoing studies could help to improve this situation, but there is no recent data on fibreoptic intubation in swine available. METHODS: Thirty male German landrace pigs were anesthetized, instrumented and randomized into two groups. The animals were either intubated conventionally using direct laryngoscopy or a single-use flexible video-endoscope. The intervention was carried out by providers with 3 months experience in conventional intubation of pigs and a brief introduction into endoscopy. Intubation attempts were supervised and aborted, when SpO2 dropped below 93%. After three failed attempts, an experienced supervisor intervened and performed the intubation. Intubation times and attempts were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: Flexible fibreoptic intubation showed a significantly higher success rate in first attempt endotracheal tube placement (75% vs. 47%) with less attempts overall (1.3 ± 0.6 vs. 2.1 ± 1.3, P = 0.043). Conventional intubation was faster (42 s ± 6 s vs. 67 s ± 10s, P < 0.001), but showed a higher complication rate and more desaturation episodes during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Flexible fibreoptic intubation in swine is feasible and appears to be a safer and more accessible method for inexperienced users to learn. This could not only improve resident training options in hospitals with animal research facilities but might also prevent airway complications and needless animal suffering.","Ruemmler, Robert; Ziebart, Alexander; Ott, Thomas; Dirvonskis, Dagmar; Hartmann, Erik Kristoffer",BMC Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7430093/,284

However, little is known about the characteristics of those who are at elevated risk of being problematic users. Using data from the 2012 Current Population Survey Internet Use Supplement and Educational Supplement for teens and young adults, this study developed a conceptual framework for modeling technology use. A three-part categorization of use was posited for utilitarian, social and entertainment purposes, which fit observed data well in confirmatory factor analysis. Seemingly unrelated regression was used to examine the demographic characteristics associated with each of the three categories of use. Exploratory factor analysis uncovered five distinct types of users, including one user type that was hypothesized to likely be at elevated risk of problematic use. Regression results indicated that females in their twenties who are in school and have greater access to technology were most likely to fall into this higher-risk category. Young people who live with both parents were less likely to belong to this category. This study highlighted the importance of constructing models that facilitate identification of patterns of use that may characterize a subset of users at high risk of problematic use. The findings can be applied to other contexts to inform policies related to technology and society as well.

42030,"Correction to: Cloud Computing, Big Data & Emerging Topics",2020-11-14,"Quantification of habitability is a complex task. Previous attempts at measuring habitability are well documented. Classification of exoplanets, on the other hand, is a different approach and depends on quality of training data available in habitable exoplanet catalogs. Classification is the task of predicting labels of newly discovered planets based on available class labels in the catalog. We present analytical exploration of novel activation functions as consequence of integration of several ideas leading to implementation and subsequent use in habitability classification of exoplanets. Neural networks, although a powerful engine in supervised methods, often require expensive tuning efforts for optimized performance. Habitability classes are hard to discriminate, especially when attributes used as hard markers of separation are removed from the data set. The solution is approached from the point of investigating analytical properties of the proposed activation functions. The theory of ordinary differential equations and fixed point are exploited to justify the “lack of tuning efforts” to achieve optimal performance compared to traditional activation functions.

This paper studies the technical feasibility of user-specific face mask production by 3D printing and the effectiveness of these masks. Material & methods: Six different face mask designs were produced by 3D printing and tested by subjective experimenter evaluation and using a respirator fit testing kit. Results were compared with the requirements as given for standard protective face masks. Results: None of the printed masks came anywhere near the required standards for personal protective gear. Conclusion: In spite of their euphoric presentation in the press, none of the currently advertised 3D printed mask designs are suitable as reliable personal protective equipment.","Duda, Sven; Hartig, Sascha; Hagner, Karola; Meyer, Lisa; Intriago, Paula Wessling; Meyer, Tobias; Wessling, Heinrich",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7707523/,284
42900,Correction to: Graph Matching Based Connectomic Biomarker with Learning for Brain Disorders,2020-10-05,"BACKGROUND: In the pediatric age group, approximately 7.5% of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) are complicated by acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS). Despite its prevalence, ABS is often overlooked in young children. The diagnosis and management present unique challenges in primary care. This is an updated narrative review on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of ABS. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed using the key term ‘acute sinusitis’. The search strategy included clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and reviews. The search was restricted to the English literature and children. RESULTS: Haemophilus influenzae (non-typeable), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the major pathogens in uncomplicated ABS in otherwise healthy children. In complicated ABS, polymicrobial infections are common. The diagnosis of acute sinusitis is mainly clinical and based on stringent criteria, including persistent symptoms and signs of a URI beyond 10 days, without appreciable improvement; a URI with high fever and purulent nasal discharge at onset lasting for at least 3 consecutive days; and biphasic or worsening symptoms. CONCLUSION: Data from high-quality studies on the management of ABS are limited. The present consensus is that amoxicillin-clavulanate, at a standard dose of 45 mg/kg/day orally, is the drug of choice for most cases of uncomplicated ABS in children in whom antibacterial resistance is not suspected. Alternatively, oral amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/day can be administered. For those with severe ABS or uncomplicated acute sinusitis who are at risk for severe disease or antibiotic resistance, oral high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day) is the drug of choice.","Leung, Alexander KC; Hon, Kam Lun; Chu, Winnie CW",Drugs Context,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7685231/,284

Population characteristics [Image: see text] General symptoms [Image: see text] METHODS: Descriptive, analytical and cross-sectional study. The cases of front-line doctors infected with Covid-19 during a hospitalary outbreak, in the General Hospital 71 “Lic. Benito Coquet Lagunes” of Veracruz, dependent on the Mexican Institute of Social Security, from April 1 to May 31, 2020. Treatments [Image: see text] [Image: see text] RESULTS: Seven doctors were entered into the study, with an average age of 42.4 years, all of them male. The affectation by service was: Internal medicine 5 of 17 doctors (29.4%), Emergencies 1 of 15 doctors (6.6%) and Intensive care 1 of 6 doctors (16.6%) infected by Covid-19. Laboratory studies were only performed in 5 cases, the presence of leukopenia in 1 case (20%), leukocytosis in 2 cases (40%), lymphopenia in 4 cases (80%) stand out. Impaired fasting glucose was reported in all cases. There was no alteration in kidney function; in liver function, transaminemia was reported in 80%. Regarding the acute phase reactants, the intake of these was very inconsistent since it was not uniform in all cases, but the most representative was elevated ESR in 4 of 4 cases (100%), positive PCR in 3 of 4 cases (75%), procalcitonin negative in 3 of 3 cases (100%), elevated DHL in 2 of 5 cases (40%), elevated D-dimer in 1 of 3 cases (33.3%), elevated ferritinemia in 1 of 2 cases (50 %). The rest of the characteristics in the table and graphs. CONCLUSION: The present cohort of doctors affected by Covid during a hospital outbreak shows that there are several factors to take into account, on the one hand, factors specific to the population (obesity, diabetes, hypertension), as well as the institutions that are in charge of medical personnel. they must identify the risk factors mentioned, influence them and protect said population that is vulnerable per se to a pandemic; Another constantly identified factor is occupational exposure to the pathogen without sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment.

In this study, we investigated the regulation of gelatinase-B (MMP-9) by S. cumini methanol seed extract (MSE) in diabetic cardiomyopathy using real-time PCR, RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, gel diffusion assay, and substrate zymography. The regulatory effects of MSE on NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6 were also examined. Identification and estimation of polyphenol constituents present in S. cumini extract were carried out using reverse-phase HPLC. Further, in silico docking studies of identified polyphenols with gelatinase-B were performed to elucidate molecular level interaction in the active site of gelatinase-B. Docking studies showed strong interaction of S. cumini polyphenols with gelatinase-B. Our findings indicate that MSE significantly suppresses gelatinase-B expression and activity in high-glucose- (HG-) stimulated cardiomyopathy. Further, HG-induced activation of NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6 was also remarkably reduced by MSE. Our results suggest that S. cumini MSE may be useful as an effective functional food and dietary supplement to regulate HG-induced cardiac stress through gelatinase.","Atale, Neha; Mishra, Chandra Bhushan; Kohli, Shrey; Mongre, Raj Kumar; Prakash, Amresh; Kumari, Sweta; Yadav, Umesh C.

47177,Malware Detection Framework Using PCA Based ANN,2020-06-08,"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory oral disease that affects almost half of the adult population. NF-κB activator 1 (Act1) is mainly expressed in immune cells, including macrophages, and modulates immune cells’ function to regulate inflammation in inflammatory diseases. Macrophages play a vital role in the pathophysiology of periodontitis. However, the effect of macrophage-specific Act1 on periodontitis has not been investigated yet. This study aims to unravel the role of macrophage-specific Act1 on the pathophysiology of periodontitis. The expression of Act1 in healthy and periodontitis periodontal tissue was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Macrophage-specific Act1 expression downregulated (anti-Act1) mice were developed by inserting anti-Act1 antisense oligonucleotides after the CD68 promoter of C57BL/6 mice. Ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) was induced in anti-Act1 mice and wildtype mice. Micro-CT, histology, and TRAP staining analyzed the periodontal tissue status, alveolar bone loss, and osteoclast numbers. Immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR, and ELISA analyzed the inflammatory cells infiltration, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and M1/M2 macrophage polarization. mRNA sequencing of in vitro bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated peritoneal macrophages analyzed the differentially expressed genes in anti-Act1 mice during inflammation. Anti-Act1 mice showed aggravated periodontitis and alveolar bone loss compared to wildtype. Periodontitis-affected periodontal tissue (PAPT) of anti-Act1 mice showed a higher degree of macrophage infiltration, and M1 macrophage polarization compared to wildtype. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα), and macrophage activity-related factors (CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4) were robustly high in PAPT of anti-Act1 mice compared to wildtype. mRNA sequencing and KEGG analysis showed activated TNF/NF-κB signaling in LPS-treated macrophages from anti-Act1 mice. In vitro studies on LPS-treated peritoneal macrophages from anti-act1 mice showed a higher degree of cell migration and expression of inflammatory cytokines, macrophage activity-related factors, M1 macrophage-related factors, and TNF/NF-κB signaling related P-p65 protein. In conclusion, downregulation of macrophage-specific Act1 aggravated periodontitis, alveolar bone loss, macrophage infiltration, inflammation, and M1 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, LPS-treated macrophages from anti-Act1 mice activated TNF/NF-κB signaling. These results indicate the distinct role of macrophage-specific Act1 on the pathophysiology of periodontitis possibly via TNF/NF-κB signaling.","Pathak, Janak L.; Fang, Ying; Chen, Yunxin; Ye, Zhitong; Guo, Xueqi; Yan, Yongyong; Zha, Jun; Liang, Dongliang; Ke, Xiuxian; Yang, Luxi; Zhong, Wenchao; Wang, Lijing; Wang, Liping",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7969798/,284

A sample of 477 teacher leaders in China responded to three measures, namely, teacher leader emotions, teacher professionalism and trust in colleagues. To analyse the data, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were utilised. The results confirmed three hypotheses on the relationships between three constructs. Specifically, positive emotions (e.g., pride and love) from teacher leaders positively and significantly affected their trust in colleagues. Moreover, enjoyment positively affected, and fatigue and anxiety negatively affected, teacher professionalism. The structural model showed that enjoyment, anxiety, and fatigue of teacher leaders directly affected teacher professionalism but pride and love indirectly affected teacher professionalism mediated by their trust in colleagues. It is also interesting to note that pride negatively affected teacher professionalism through collegial trust. Implications and future directions are proposed in the form of theory and practice.","Cheng, Tianjun; Chen, Junjun; Bryant, Darren A.",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7970824/,284

However, as technology continues to evolve and emerge, organizations find themselves in a near-constant state of transformation. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological innovation is outpacing any previous era and contributes to an already complex transforming workplace. As the transformation continues to unfold, the workforce must be equipped to perform in the new operational environment. In other words, the workforce must also transform to keep pace with the workplace. Unfortunately, current methods used to develop expertise are inefficient and consequently require a tremendous amount of time and effort. For example, scholars agree that reaching an expert level of mastery requires more than 10,000 hours and up to ten years to achieve. Therefore, developing expertise within the workforce for the transformed workplace requires Human Resource Development professions to design and implement innovative solutions capable of overcoming these and other challenges created by ever-present transformation. Moreover, innovative and emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, are quickly being adopted in the workplace, including in the fields of medicine (Allen, 2018; Harrington & Johnson, 2019) and business (Schneider & Leyer, 2019). These highly complex and emerging technologies provide organizations the power to push beyond the limitations of human performance. Likewise, these technologies provide the potential to outpace the ongoing technological evolution. Human Resource Development professionals must employ innovative strategies that transcend disciplines to harness the power offered by machines as well as circumvent the extremely long lead times to efficiently develop expertise. These innovations must fundamentally disrupt the current methods of expertise development to increase efficiency. Consequently, this begs the question: As humans traverse toward and through the continually transforming workplace, how is the needed expertise developed to equip humans to interact and help organizations establish and maintain their competitive advantage?

Her impact on travel writing as an unmarried European woman traveler, at the beginning of the twentieth century, without income, local connections or colonial rank is notable. This chapter provides close reading, through a postcolonial feminist lens, of two first edition volumes of Stark’s autobiographical travel books written during 1928–1939. The analysis explores the commercial nexus of Orientalism, which is the term that refers to Western depictions of the ‘Eastern’ world (Said E, Orientalism. Pantheon, New York, 1998). It discusses Stark’s work in relation to conceived reader expectations, as well as her distinctly ambivalent attitude to British colonialism and colonials. I suggest that Stark’s ambiguous role, as insider-outsider both within and between the Arab region and British Empire, poses provocative questions about the interrelationships of gender, self and ‘Other’ within commercialized Orientalist discourse (Ballaster R, Fabulous orients. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2005). Stark makes specific discursive moves, not only as a traveler across continents, but in literary, ethnographic and gender terms. These moves manage to disrupt fixed framings, images and descriptions of Arab people, places and gender practices. This chapter therefore makes a unique contribution to theorizing Stark’s work and, also, travel writing more generally, locating it as an import discursive genre that is always underpinned by moving practices of gender, politics and power.","Hurley, Zoe",Women in Tourism in Asian Muslim Countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978765/,284

It was established that some capsular polysaccharides of the clinically significant serotypes of S. pneumoniae in the composition of commercial pneumococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines exhibit low immunogenicity. The review considers production methods and structural features of the synthetic oligosaccharides from the problematic pneumococcal serotypes that are characterized with low immunogenicity due to destruction or detrimental modification occurring in the process of their preparation and purification. Bacterial serotypes that cause severe pneumococcal diseases as well as serotypes not included in the composition of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are also discussed. It is demonstrated that the synthetic oligosaccharides corresponding to protective glycotopes of the capsular polysaccharides of various pneumococcal serotypes are capable of inducing formation of the protective opsonizing antibodies and immunological memory. Optimal constructs of oligosaccharides from the epidemiologically significant pneumococcal serotypes are presented that can be used for designing synthetic pneumococcal vaccines, as well as test systems for diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infections and monitoring of vaccination efficiency .","Gening, M.

It examines the subjective decisions of the managers at medicinal product firms with regard to the outsourcing of logistics work to cargo logistics providers. The research targets outsourcing logistics decision makers from firms that manufacture medicinal products for human use in Taiwan. The empirical evidence supports five key logistics criteria factors: documentation, equipment, technology, certification, and training. The four key logistics outsourcing decision factors examined are quality, freight, service, and delivery. A significant relationship between the logistics criteria of the cargo logistics providers and the outsourcing logistics decisions of the medicinal products firms is also identified. The study provides an empirical validation of the two-factor construct to develop survey scales for international logistics criteria and client decisions with the establishment of a standard questionnaire, which uses 47 successful questionnaires and follows the Delphi method. Factor analysis was used on 40 criteria between the medicinal products firms and cargo logistics providers. The Pearson’s coefficients on the correlations applied the two factors of logistics criteria and outsourcing decisions.","Meng, Shiang-Min","Smart and Sustainable Supply Chain and Logistics - Trends, Challenges, Methods and Best Practices",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981008/,284

It is therefore key to foster their active participation in their children’s education and provide them with tools to be effective. This paper describes the implementation of a territorial learning ecosystem that provides K12 parents with the facilities to support their children’s learning at home, track progress against the national curriculum, and network and share their experience with other parents. The territorial learning ecosystem includes an interactive map of the country. This map displays indicators of the level of overall activity in the subject, as well as in each of the specific learning objectives defined by the national curriculum. The ecosystem provides indicators at four different levels: region, district, school, and classroom. During the second semester of 2019, a total of 1235 first grade classes voluntarily adopted the system. In mid-October, educational videos made by parents were uploaded to the system, in which they shared examples of homemade activities and teaching strategies. 98 schools from the most populated region submitted 98 parent-made videos to be shared during a public event. 82% of the videos showed a mother with her child learning to read or write, 49% showed word segmentation activities, 48% showed homemade educational games, and 26% showed activities using glove puppets. Experts rated the communication and educational quality of the videos. We found that a much higher proportion of videos involving glove puppets were rated as ``very good"" when compared to the other types.","Araya, Roberto","Ludic, Co-design and Tools Supporting Smart Learning Ecosystems and Smart Education",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981422/,284

The framework addresses two fundamental questions in economic sciences. What factors explain the divergence in living standards across countries and what ensures internal and external stability of the capitalist economic system? The framework adopts a non-technical and unified approach. Using the neoclassical growth model, it shows that economic growth is dependent on access to raw materials, labour, capital, technology, and perhaps most importantly ‘economies of scale’. Then it modifies the neoclassical growth model by introducing power relations (both internal and external to a nation), which ensures scale economies through guaranteed access to markets and raw materials. Thus, imperial expansion is a natural consequence of the capitalist economic system. The stability of the system depends on growth and distribution and it is not possible to have one without the other. However, the quest for growth and imperial expansion implies one empire invariably enters into conflict with another empire. Such inherent tension in the capitalist system can be best managed by acknowledging great power spheres of influence.","Bhattacharyya, Sambit",A History of Global Capitalism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981446/,284

More and more surgeries are performed on outpatient basis at ambulatory surgery centers. The understanding of how the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) functions is important in the appropriate care and discharge of the patients. Multiple phases of recovery exist and patients can be triaged based on their emergence from anesthesia. PACU discharge scoring systems have been implemented to progress a patient through the stages of recovery until discharge. The scoring systems initially developed by Aldrete, later modified by Chung and White, are still being used today. Discharge from ambulatory surgery centers has unique concerns when compared with discharge from PACU to hospital wards.

50593,Predicting COVID19 Spread in Saudi Arabia Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques—Proposing a Shift Towards a Sustainable Healthcare Approach,2020-06-06,"When you get ‘good grades’ from your clients, when your team executes the strategy really well, but when you, at the same time, anxiously look at a team that is on the edge, working long hours, powering on a high burn rate and actually being haunted by its own success—this is the moment you know that you are missing something. At that point in time, I came across Agile and embarked on what has proven to be the most fascinating journey of my career. And it is ongoing ever since. In this chapter I will share how the world of Agile opened up for me and how it led me to truly understand the underlying challenges for legal teams, as they work in the massively and rapidly changing environment of today. I will then explain, why we identified Scrum and Kanban as being the best combination to change how we approach our work and how to adapt our modus operandi. Scrum to organize the communication within the team, and Kanban to organize the information flow around our work. This part will include a detailed overview of exactly how we adopted and adapted those two Agile methodologies as a legal inhouse team. Against the background of our journey, I will finally put a spotlight on the cultural aspects of Agile. On the one hand, it is proven that Agile has positive impact on team culture. On the other hand, however, I know from experience that Agile also requires a strong culture and ongoing cultural awareness to come to fruition. This specifically includes the positive challenge for legal leaders to rethink their role, their skills and their interaction with the team. Based on what I am about to share, I am convinced, just like Rowan Bunning, one of the first Agile Coaches in Australia, that “… the Agile movement in software is part of a larger movement towards more humane and dynamic workplaces in the 21st century.” (Stated in “Who is Agile – Volume 1”, by Yves Hanoulle, Andrea Chiou, Marcin Floryan, Peter Doomen, Guy Nachimson, and Amber Ankerholz).","Schindler, Dierk",Liquid Legal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991315/,284

Using the life-story method and the lived religion approach will allow for the understanding of how postdenominationalism emerged in the region and why these congregations have been undergoing a series of deinstitutionalizing innovations that ring closer to the expectations that millennials have regarding the emotional, the intellectual, the social, and the cultural aspects of their lives. This phenomenon not only echoes with the idea of the deconstructed church that Marti and Ganiel described among millennials in the US (Marti and Ganiel 2014), it also imposes a challenge for Latin American religious studies, whose trend has been to ignore the postdenominational category, favoring the continued use of Pentecostal and/or Neopentecostal/charismatic to refer to these congregations, which makes it difficult to understand the changes, the innovation, and the deconstructive processes that postdenominational churches have been undergoing in the last three decades.","Ibarra, Carlos S.",Int J Lat Am Relig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7997484/,284

Clinical Case: A 51-year-old Mexican man with past medical history of T2DM presented to our hospital with 1-week history of fever, dyspnea, polydipsia, and nausea. Initial vital signs were notable for fever (axillary temperature 39°C) and low oxygen saturation (90% on room air). His examination was notable for a BMI of 31.2 kg/m(2). Blood tests showed hyperglycemia (663 mg/dl, n 70–100 mg/dL), hypernatremia (146 mEq/L, n 135–145 mEq/L), hyperchloremia (113 mEq/L, n 95–110 mEq/L), elevated C-Reactive Protein [CRP] (18.7 mg/dl, n < 0.7 mg/dl), elevated lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] (672 U/L, n 100–170 U/L), high D-dimer (3420 ng/ml, n <400 ng/ml), elevated WBC count (13,200 cell/mm(3), n 4600–10200 cells/mm(3)), high neutrophil count (11300 cells/mm(3), n 2000–6900 cells/mm(3)) and low lymphocyte count (200 cells/mm(3), n 600–3400 cells/mm(3)). Arterial blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.2 [n 7.35–7.45], bicarbonate 8mmol/L [22–28 mmol/L], anion gap 23.5 [8–16]) with ketones (100 mg/dl, n <5 mg/dl) in the urine analysis. Calculated serum osmolarity resulted of 328 mOsm/kg (n 278–305 mOsm/kg). Electrocardiogram showed no alterations. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities with bilateral infiltrates. Blood and urine cultures were negative. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Intravenous fluids, insulin infusion with ceftriaxone i.v. (2 g daily) and clarithromycin p.o. (1 g daily) were initiated but did not result in clinical improvement, continuing with fever, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis and worsening of respiratory status. At first day of hospitalization, he presented acute respiratory distress syndrome and was intubated and sedated. He developed multi-organ failure and expired after 3 days of mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: DM is a predisposing factor leading to severe COVID-19 disease. Patient showed similar features reported in cases who died of combined DKA and HHS associated with COVID-19: male, Hispanic, poor blood glucose control, mechanical ventilation, elevated CRP with high LDH and D-dimer.

In most cases, climate change will affect the use of agricultural production technology. The energy and material needed in the process of crop growth are also provided by climate change. People must pay attention to climate change if they want to carry out agricultural production. Through people’s long-term practice, it can be seen that the development of agriculture is greatly affected by climate. Once the climate change is unfavorable to the development of agriculture, the total grain reserve in China will be affected, and there will be some problems in the food supply of the whole country. In order to effectively reduce the negative impact of climate change, this paper analyzes the climate problems in the process of agricultural production by using geographic information technology, discusses the ability of agricultural resources to cope with sudden disasters, and puts forward reasonable resource allocation suggestions to improve the utilization efficiency of resources.","Xu, Di",Arab J Geosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8126472/,284

However, identifying markers in natural settings is nontrivial. Although ad hoc assignment of markers to groups is widely documented in the ethnographic literature, predicting the membership of individuals based on stylistic variation is less clear. We argue that a more systematic approach is required to satisfy the basic assumptions made in ethnic marker theory. To this end we introduce a three-step ethnographic method to assess the presence, recognition, and transmission of markers of group identity: (1) continual scans, (2) a utilization survey, and (3) a comparative classification task. Applying the method to a study of culturally significant motifs in the South Pacific Island nation of Tonga, we provide evidence that the motif set satisfies basic theoretical assumptions and thus the motifs are likely expressions for social coordination. We also found that the coordinating role of each motif is variable and requires further investigation.","Bell, Adrian Viliami; Paegle, Alina",Hum Nat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8186961/,284

54160,Detecting COVID-19 in chest images based on deep transfer learning and machine learning algorithms,2021-06-11,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted economies and health systems across the globe and has brought substantial challenges for food systems. Government responses key to minimizing disease spread have included a number of movement restriction policies (e.g., school closures, stay at home measures, etc.). Such policies have impacted food consumption and purchasing behaviours and have harmed much of the face-to-face type of labour required for food retailing, which in turn may have impacted the affordability of diets. We use evidence from 133 countries to investigate the association between stringency in movement restriction policies and retail price levels for food and other consumer goods. METHODS: We use the International Monetary Fund's monthly national consumer price index (CPI), and food and non-alcoholic beverage index (FCPI), as well as a ratio of FCPI to CPI—the food price index (FPI)—for 133 countries from January 2017 to November 2020. Data on stringency in movement restriction policies and COVID-19 cases and mortality per million were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, respectively. Fixed effects regression models were used to estimate the association between stringency of COVID-19 movement restrictions and monthly differences in 2020 retail price levels (from average 2017–2019 levels) of foods and other consumer goods, while controlling for pandemic severity in each country and month. RESULTS: Regression models yielded a positive and significant relationship between stringency level and FCPI level (coeff. = 1.24–1.91; 95% CIs: 0.25–2.79) or FPI level (coeff. = 1.24–2.14; 95% CIs: 0.60–2.53). Alternatively, stringency level was either negatively associated with CPI level (coeff. = −0.57; 95% CI: −1.06 – −0.07) or not significantly associated with CPI level. CONCLUSIONS: Government response stringency in COVID-19 movement restriction policies is linked with higher retail food price levels. Governments could consider implementing these policies alongside other measures (e.g., food assistance) to mitigate negative spillovers into the domain of food security and nutrition.

54174,"Measuring User Experience, Usability and Interactivity of a Personalized Mobile Augmented Reality Training System",2021-06-04,"OBJECTIVES: To identify associations of self-reported olfactory dysfunction (OD) with attributes of diet quality in a nationally-representative sample of US adults. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we utilized self-reported taste and smell, and dietary data collected from participants 40 years and older (n = 6356) in the NHANES 2011–2014. In the home-interview, a taste and smell questionnaire asked about smell-related problems, treatments and related conditions. Dietary information was collected by trained dietary interviewers using an in-person 24-h dietary recall interview and an automated multi-pass method. Self-reported OD was based on 3 questions, and defined as affirmative response to either a smell problem in the last 12 months, worse ability to smell since age 25, or smelling phantom odors. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015) and its adequacy and moderation components (higher scores indicating higher diet quality). Other qualitative attributes included energy density of all foods (kcal/g), % energy from fat, and added sugar. Independent associations between self-reported OD and dietary attributes were estimated with survey-weighted linear regression models adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income-poverty ratio, and chronic disease score (based on reported diabetes, cancer, stroke and heart attack). RESULTS: The prevalence of OD was 22.3% (95% CI: 20.4%--24.2%) and the average HEI-2015 score was 53.2 (0.4 SE). Compared to those without OD, adults with OD had higher energy density diets and higher % of energy from total fat, saturated fat and added sugar. Adjusted βs (95% CI) reflecting mean differences between those with and without OD were 0.06 (0.00, 0.12) for energy density of foods, 0.45 (0.10, 0.80) for % energy from saturated fat, 0.94 (0.19, 1.69) for % energy from total fat, and 0.96 (0.27, 1.65) for % energy from added sugar. Additionally, OD was significantly associated with lower scores on the moderation component of the HEI-2015 [βs (95% CI) = −0.62 (−1.19, −0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings may help inform dietary screening and recommendations for adults who perceive OD, including those experiencing transient or persistent smell loss with COVID-19.

55014,Image smog restoration using oblique gradient profile prior and energy minimization,2021-06-28,"This work reports the self-organization of dimple nanostructures on a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) surface where an Ar ion beam was irradiated at an ion energy of 600 eV. The peak-to-peak roughness and diameter of dimple nanostructures were 29.1~53.4 nm and 63.4~77.6 nm, respectively. The electron energy loss spectrum at the peaks and troughs of dimples showed similar C=C, C=O, and O=CH bonding statuses. In addition, wide-angle X-ray scattering showed that Ar ion beam irradiation did not induce crystallization of the PEN surface. That meant that the self-organization on the PEN surface could be due to the ion-induced surface instability of the amorphous layer and not due to the partial crystallinity differences of the peaks and valleys. A nonlinear continuum model described surface instability due to Ar ion-induced sputtering. The Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model reproduced the dimple morphologies numerically, which was similar to the experimentally observed dimple patterns. This preliminary validation showed the possibility that the continuum equation used for metal and semiconductor surfaces could be applied to polymer surfaces where ion beam sputtering occurred.","Yang, Jun-Yeong; Jung, Sunghoon; Byeon, Eun-Yeon; Lee, Hyun Hwi; Kim, Do-Geun; Kim, Hyo Jung; Jang, Ho Won; Lee, Seunghun",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8230451/,284

55987,A comparison of alternative selection methods for reporting spirometric parameters in healthy adults,2021-07-22,"Klebsiella aerogenes is a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterium that causes nosocomial infections. The organism showed resistance to most of the conventional antibiotics available. Because of the high resistance of the species, the treatment of K. aerogenes is difficult. These species are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins due to the production of chromosomal beta-lactams with cephalosporin activity. The lack of better treatment and the development of therapeutic resistance in hospitals hinders better/new broad-spectrum-based treatment against this pathogen. This study identifies potential drug targets/vaccine candidates through a computational subtractive proteome-driven approach. This method is used to predict proteins that are not homologous to humans and human symbiotic intestinal flora. The resultant proteome of K. aerogenes was further searched for proteins, which are essential, virulent, and determinants of antibiotic/drug resistance. Subsequently, their druggability properties were also studied. The data set was reduced based on its presence in the pathogen-specific metabolic pathways. The subtractive proteome analysis predicted 13 proteins as potential drug targets for K. aerogenes. Furthermore, these target proteins were annotated based on their spectrum of activity, cellular localization, and antigenicity properties, which ensured that they are potent candidates for broad-spectrum antibiotic and vaccine design. The results open up new opportunities for designing and manufacturing powerful antigenic vaccines against K. aerogenes and the detection and release of new and active drugs against K. aerogenes without altering the gut microbiome.

This paper develops a methodological framework to address strategic decision-making processes from a multi-criteria perspective, assisted by text analytics and interviews. The framework comprises five stages and 12 steps, and is empirically tested in a decision scenario involving a strategic focus for future analytics initiatives in order to stimulate value generation from analytics. The proposed framework enables the discovery, validation, and prioritisation of strategic patterns from relevant interview data. Among six decision alternatives discovered in the validation scenario, customer analytics was the strategic focus most relevant to future analytics initiatives.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Miscarriage rates were <2.5%, even when only studies of moderate/high-quality were included. Increased rates of CS and preterm birth were found, with uncertain vertical transmission. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: A considerable number of systematic reviews, with substantial heterogeneity regarding their methods and included populations, on the impact of COVID-19 on infected pregnant women and their neonates, has emerged. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Three bibliographical databases were searched (last search: September 10, 2020). Quality assessment was performed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Primary outcomes included mode of delivery, preterm delivery/labor, premature rupture of membranes (PROM/pPROM) and abortions/miscarriages. Outcomes were mainly presented as ranges. A separate analysis, including only moderate and high-quality systematic reviews, was also conducted. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020214447); PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The search strategy followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline. Keywords employed were (COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR “Coronavirus disease 2019”) AND (“Neonatal outcom*” OR “Neonatal characteristic*” OR “Maternal outcom*” OR “maternal characteristic*” OR “pregnancy outcom*” OR “vertical transmission”). All retrieved studies were imported into the Rayyan QCRI and duplicated articles were removed. A snow-ball procedure was also implemented by hand-searching the reference lists of included systematic reviews for additional sources. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Thirty-nine reviews were analyzed. Twelve reviews (30.8%) were found to be of “very low quality”, 11 of “low quality”, 13 (33.3%) of “moderate”, and three (7.7%) of “high quality”. Ten articles dealt with miscarriages. One review integrated them into pregnancy terminations (1.4% (4/295)), one into intrauterine fetal deaths (1(3%)), while another one described them as “spontaneous abortions” (0.8% (3/385)). Taking into account reviews, which calculated these rates for their entire included population, miscarriage rates were <2.5%. The reported rates by moderate and high-quality studies were ≤ 2%. Reported rates,regarding both preterm and term gestations, varied between 52.3%-95.8% for caesarean sections; 4.2%-44.7% for vaginal deliveries; 14.3%-63.8% specifically for preterm deliveries and 22.7%-32.2% for preterm labor; 5.3%-12.7% for PROM and 6.4%-16.1% for pPROM. Maternal anxiety for potential fetal infection contributed to abortion decisions, while SARS-CoV-2-related miscarriages could not be excluded. Maternal ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates were 3%-28.5% and 1.4%-12%, respectively. Maternal mortality rate was <2%, while stillbirth, neonatal ICU admission and mortality rates were <2.5%, 3.1%-76.9% and <3%, respectively. Neonatal PCR positivity rates ranged between 1.6% and 10%. After accounting for quality of studies, ranges of our primary outcomes remained unchanged. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Results are presented in a narrative way using ranges as the primary mean of quantification. We also included studies with both RT-PCR positive women and women with suspected infection based on their clinical and imaging manifestations, whereas, if excluding them, we might have missed a considerable source of information. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In conclusion, a rapid increase of CS was observed, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, most likely due to lack of knowledge and robust recommendations. Preterm birth rates were elevated, with iatrogenic reasons potentially involved. Even though neonatal infections were rare, the probability of vertical transmission cannot be eliminated.

The modified electrode was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Electrochemical test showed that the RGO–TiO(2) electrode had stronger electrochemical activity and higher effective real surface area than that of TiO(2) electrode and bare electrode. The electrochemical response of RGO–TiO(2) nanocomposite modified electrode toward HCQ oxidation was studied by CV, chronoamperometry (CHA), chronocoulometry (CHC) and square-wave voltammetry (SWV). Interestingly, RGO–TiO(2)/GCE indicated an excellent electrocatalytic activity for HCQ. Under the optimal experimental conditions, a linear relationship between the peak current and the concentration was obtained, ranging from 0.25 to 500 μM, with the detection limit (S/N = 3) of 12.5 nM and quantification limit (S/N = 10) of 0.97 μM. Furthermore, the proposed sensor was successfully applied to the determination of HCQ in pharmaceutical (tablets) samples. In summary, the developed sensor was low cost and efficient, making it potentially attractive for practical sample analysis application of HCQ.","Huilan Zhang; Cheng, Lu; Shang, Hongyuan; Zhang, Wen; Zhang, Aiping",Russ J Electrochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8432446/,284

These are intimately involved with the need to control climate change and the need to switch from high carbon, unsustainable economies to low carbon economies. Inherent in this approach are the concepts of the bioeconomy and the Green Industrial Revolution. The article addresses both issues, but it, principally, focusses on the development of the bioeconomy. It considers how nations are divided in relation to the use of biotechnology and synthetic biology in terms of their bioeconomy strategies. The article addresses, as a central theme, the nature and role of engineering biology in these developments. Engineering biology is addressed in terms of BioDesign, coupled with high levels of automation (including AI and machine learning) to increase reproducibility and reliability to meet industrial standards. This lends itself to distributed manufacturing of products in a range of fields. Engineering biology is a platform technology that can be applied in a range of sectors. The bioeconomy, as an engine for economic growth is addressed—in terms of moving from oil‐based economies to bio‐based economies—using biomass, for example, using selected lignocellulosic waste as a feedstock.","Bell, Jennifer; Philp, Jim; Kitney, Richard I.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8441825/,284

However, enzyme immobilization on nanomaterials is not straightforward due to the toxic and unpredictable properties of nanoparticles in medical practice. AIM OF REVIEW: In fact, because of the ability to load enzymes on nano-based supports and increase their renewability, scientific groups have been tempted to create potential therapeutic enzymes in this field. Therefore, this study not only pays attention to the therapeutic and diagnostic applications of diseases by enzyme–nanoparticle (NP) bio-conjugate (abbreviated as: ENB), but also considers the importance of nanoplatforms used based on their toxicity, ease of application and lack of significant adverse effects on loaded enzymes. In the following, based on the published reports, we explained that the immobilization of enzymes on polymers, inorganic metal oxide and hybrid compounds provide hopes for potential use of ENBs in medical activities. Then, the use of ENBs in bioassay activities such as paper-based or wearing biosensors and lab-on-chip/microfluidic biosensors were evaluated. Finally, this review addresses the current challenges and future perspective of ENBs in biomedical applications. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: This literature may provide useful information regarding the application of ENBs in biosensing and therapeutic platforms.","Khan, Suliman; Babadaei, Mohammad Mahdi Nejadi; Hasan, Anwarul; Edis, Zehra; Attar, Farnoosh; Siddique, Rabeea; Bai, Qian; Sharifi, Majid; Falahati, Mojtaba",J Adv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8463903/,284

E-planning is growing in the field of environmental planning, as it promises greater equity in terms of public participation. However, a lack of scholarly work exists on the applicability for forest planning. During the COVID-19 pandemic, county foresters and other natural resource professionals in Vermont turned to e-planning when safety restrictions limited their ability to engage in face-to-face efforts. This provided an opportunity to collect empirical data about the potential for e-planning to support the public engagement process in the context of forest planning. We provide an overview of e-planning theory and examine data from Vermont to explore the promise of e-planning for forest management. We make recommendations about the applicability of e-planning in the context of forest planning, and highlight areas for future research to investigate. STUDY IMPLICATIONS: Public participation is an important component in the planning and management of public forestland. The use of e-planning, or the use of computer-based systems to conduct planning and decision-making, increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to safely continue public participation efforts. Our paper suggests that e-planning may be a powerful tool for engaging both new and current stakeholders. However, we caution that there are challenges associated with e-planning, particularly issues related to technology and internet access.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a bottom-up, unsupervised, machine learning approach, could more accurately support concussion subtyping. Methods: Initial patient intake data as well as objective outcome measures including, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing Tool (ImPACT) were retrospectively extracted from the Advance Concussion Clinic's database. A correlation matrix and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Sklearn's agglomerative clustering algorithm was then applied, and the optimal number of clusters within the patient database were generated. Between-group comparisons among the formed clusters were performed using a Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Two hundred seventy-five patients within the clinics database were analyzed. Five distinct clusters emerged from the data when maximizing the Silhouette score (0.36) and minimizing the Davies-Bouldin score (0.83). Concussion subtypes derived demonstrated clinically distinct profiles, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between all five clusters. Conclusion: This machine learning approach enabled the identification and characterization of five distinct concussion subtypes, which were best understood according to levels of complexity, ranging from Extremely Complex to Minimally Complex. Understanding concussion in terms of Complexity with the utilization of artificial intelligence, could provide a more accurate concussion classification or subtype approach; one that better reflects the true heterogeneity and complex system disruptions associated with mild traumatic brain injury.","Rosenblatt, Cirelle K.; Harriss, Alexandra; Babul, Aliya-Nur; Rosenblatt, Samuel A.",Front Hum Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514654/,284

Our aim was to assess measures taken by sleep centers due to the COVID-19 pandemic and plans surrounding reinstatement of sleep services. METHODS We distributed an anonymous online survey to healthcare providers in sleep medicine on April 29, 2020. From responders, we identified a subset of unique centers, by region and demographic variables. RESULTS We obtained 379 individual responses, which represented 297 unique centers. A total of 93.6% of unique centers reported stopping all or nearly all sleep testing of at least one type, without significant differences between adult and pediatric labs, geographic region, or surrounding population density. By contrast, a greater proportion of respondents continued home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) services. A total of 60.3% reduced HSAT volume by at least 90%, compared to 90.4% that reduced in-laboratory testing by at least 90%. Respondents acknowledged that they implemented a wide variety of mitigation strategies. While no respondents reported virtual visits to be ≥25% of clinical visits prior to the pandemic, more than half (51.9%) anticipate maintaining ≥25% virtual visits after the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Among surveyed sleep centers, the vast majority reported near-cessation of in-laboratory sleep studies, while a smaller proportion reported reductions in HSATs.

This study investigated the impact of acute local allergen exposure on the frequency and phenotype of tissue eosinophils within remote mucosal organs. Our findings demonstrate allergen challenge to skin, lung, or gut elicited not only local eosinophilic inflammation, but also increased the number and frequency of eosinophils within remote, allergen nonexposed lung, and intestine. Remote allergen-elicited lung eosinophils exhibited an inflammatory phenotype and their presence associated with enhanced susceptibility to airway inflammation induced upon subsequent inhalation of a different allergen.

In the current study, we have developed a naked DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to PA(dIV) of Bacillus anthracis [CRT/PA(dIV)]. We transfected a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293) with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA and performed Western blotting and confocal microscopy analysis. We found that linkage of CRT to PA(dIV) targets PA(dIV) to the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in secretion of the chimeric CRT/PA(dIV) protein. We then evaluated the ability of CRT/PA(dIV) DNA to generate PA(dIV)-specific antibody responses and protective immunity against lethal anthrax toxin (PA plus lethal factor) challenge. We found that mice immunized with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA were capable of rapidly inducing significantly higher PA(dIV)-specific antibody responses than mice immunized with PA(dIV) DNA alone. Furthermore, we observed that this enhanced antibody response generated by CRT/PA(dIV) DNA was CD4 dependent, since CD4 knockout mice demonstrated a significant reduction in antibody responses. In addition, analysis of the titers and avidity maturation of the induced PA-specific antibodies revealed that vaccination with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA vaccine accelerated the avidity maturation of antibodies to PA(dIV) compared to vaccination with PA(dIV) DNA. Importantly, the enhanced antibody responses correlated to protective immunity against lethal anthrax toxin challenge. Thus, DNA vaccines encoding CRT linked to PA(dIV) may dramatically enhance PA-specific protective antibody responses. Our results have significant clinical applications for biodefense against anthrax toxin.","Park, Yong Sung; Lee, Jin Hyup; Hung, Chien-Fu; Wu, T-C; Kim, Tae Woo",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.01722-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18285494/,284

In this study, we investigated the epitaxial growth of PVDF-TrFE on a chitin film for developing triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The crystallographic match between the chitin and PVDF-TrFE enables the development of the intended crystal orientation, with the PVDF-TrFE polarization axis aligned perpendicular to the substrate. In addition, the epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE on chitin not only enhances the performance of the TENG but also increases the stability of the hygroscopic chitin film against water. The corresponding TENG exhibits a significantly higher output current compared to that of a non-epitaxial PVDF-TrFE/chitin film. Furthermore, the triboelectric sensors based on epitaxial PVDF-TrFE/chitin films allow the monitoring of subtle pressures, suggesting that tailoring the crystal orientation of PVDF-TrFE is a promising approach for developing high-performance TENGs.","Eom, Kijoo; Shin, Young-Eun; Kim, Joong-Kwon; Joo, Se Hun; Kim, Kyungtae; Kwak, Sang Kyu; Ko, Hyunhyub; Jin, Jungho; Kang, Seok Ju",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c02488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32809835/,284

70158,Cartolabe: A Web-Based Scalable Visualization of Large Document Collections.,2020-10-23,"Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are uncharged nucleic acid-like molecules designed to inactivate the expression of specific genes via the antisense-based steric hindrance of mRNA translation. PMOs have been successful at knocking out viral gene expression and replication in the case of acute viral infections in animal models and have been well tolerated in human clinical trials. We propose that antisense PMOs represent a promising class of therapeutic agents that may be useful for combating filoviral infections. We have previously shown that mice treated with a PMO whose sequence is complementary to a region spanning the start codon of VP24 mRNA were protected against lethal Ebola virus challenge. In the present study, we report on the abilities of two additional VP24-specific PMOs to reduce the cell-free translation of a VP24 reporter, to inhibit the in vitro replication of Ebola virus, and to protect mice against lethal challenge when the PMOs are delivered prior to infection. Additionally, structure-activity relationship evaluations were conducted to assess the enhancement of antiviral efficacy associated with PMO chemical modifications that included conjugation with peptides of various lengths and compositions, positioning of conjugated peptides to either the 5' or the 3' terminus, and the conferring of charge modifications by the addition of piperazine moieties. Conjugation with arginine-rich peptides greatly enhanced the antiviral efficacy of VP24-specific PMOs in infected cells and mice during lethal Ebola virus challenge.","Swenson, Dana L; Warfield, Kelly L; Warren, Travis K; Lovejoy, Candace; Hassinger, Jed N; Ruthel, Gordon; Blouch, Robert E; Moulton, Hong M; Weller, Dwight D; Iversen, Patrick L; Bavari, Sina",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00936-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19223614/,284

70957,Using effective hand hygiene practice to prevent and control infection.,2020-04-23,"BACKGROUND Surgical resection is viewed as the most effective way to ensure both locoregional control and long-term survival in esophageal cancer. Although minimally invasive esophagectomy has been widely accepted as an alternative to open surgery, the role of robotic assistance has yet to be elucidated. We report our institutional experience with robotic-assisted Ivor Lewis esophagectomy using real-time perfusion assessment and demonstrate this as a safe and technically feasible alternative to traditional open Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. METHODS A retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing robotic-assisted Ivor Lewis esophagectomy at a single institution from 2011 to 2014 was performed. Operative and postoperative outcomes were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-four patients underwent robotic-assisted Ivor Lewis esophagectomy during the study period. Indication for surgery was cancer in 49 patients, 38 of whom underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. The average operative time was 6 hours 2 minutes, and the average blood loss was 74 mL. There was 1 postoperative mortality (1.9%). Three (5.5%) patients experienced an anastomotic leak. The average number of lymph nodes harvested in cancer patients was 16.2 (range, 3 to 35). The average length of stay was 12.9 days. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that robotic-assisted Ivor Lewis esophagectomy using real-time perfusion assessment is a safe and technically feasible alternative to traditional open Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. It allows for R0 resection with adequate lymph node harvesting and a short hospital stay.","Hodari, Arielle; Park, Ko Un; Lace, Brian; Tsiouris, Athanasios; Hammoud, Zane",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.03.084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26116484/,284
72759,Wireless Monitoring System for Oral-Feeding Evaluation of Preterm Infants.,2015,"BACKGROUND Exposure to stressful events related to COVID-19 has been associated with increases in the prevalence of depression and anxiety, raising questions about vulnerabilities that make some individuals most susceptible to internalizing symptoms following stress exposure. METHODS The current prospective study examined the effects of neurophysiological reactivity to positive and threatening interpersonal stimuli, indexed by the late positive potential (LPP) event-related potential, in conjunction with exposure to interpersonal pandemic-related stressors in the prediction of internalizing symptom changes from pre- to during the pandemic. Emerging adults (N=75) initially completed measures of internalizing symptoms and an interpersonal emotional images task while electroencephalogram was recorded pre-pandemic and were re-contacted during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020 to complete measures of exposure to pandemic-related stressful events and current internalizing symptoms. RESULTS Results indicated that emerging adults experienced numerous stressful events associated with the pandemic, as well as overall increases in symptoms of depression and traumatic intrusions during the pandemic. Furthermore, significant interactions between LPP reactivity to positive and threatening interpersonal stimuli and interpersonal stress exposure emerged in the prediction of internalizing symptoms, controlling for baseline symptoms. Under high exposure to interpersonal stressors, reduced positive LPPs predicted increases in depressive symptoms while enhanced threatening LPPs predicted increases in traumatic intrusions. CONCLUSIONS These findings highlight the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on emerging adults, and the role of individual differences in neurophysiological reactivity to emotional stimuli in vulnerability for depression and traumatic intrusions following stress exposure.","Dickey, Lindsay; West, Michael; Pegg, Samantha; Green, Haley; Kujawa, Autumn",Biological psychiatry.

73074,Culturally aware mentorship: Lasting impacts of a novel intervention on academic administrators and faculty.,2020,"The potential benefits of insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) in the regulation of lipid metabolism have been reported in large prospective cohort studies although the molecular regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Okara is a by-product obtained during soybean processing for soy milk and soybean curd (tofu), which is rarely utilized and can be a cheap potential dietary fiber (DF) resource. In this study, the structure and physicochemical properties of insoluble dietary fiber (SIDF) extracted from okara were characterized, and the prebiotic effects on fat metabolism were investigated in vivo. The results showed that the main monosaccharides of SIDF (90.50%) identified were galactose, arabinose, xylose, rhamnose and glucose. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses suggested that SIDF had a loose and porous structure, polysaccharide functional groups, and a typical crystalline cellulose I structure. In addition, SIDF had ideal oil-adsorption capacity (OAC; 7.95 g g-1) and significantly improved cholesterol adsorption (11.14 mg g-1) at pH 7.0. In vivo, IDF supplementation reduced the serum lipid levels and inhibited hepatic fat accumulation. Additionally, SIDF administration improved hepatic steatosis by stimulating lipolysis via upregulation of PPARα, CYP4a10 and CPT1a. This is the first systematic study on the composition, structure, physicochemical properties, adsorption function and biological effects of SIDF. The above results show that SIDF could be used as an ideal functional ingredient in food processing as well as play a positive role in improving the added value of okara and promoting its comprehensive utilization.","Wang, Sainan; Sun, Wanling; Swallah, Mohammed Sharif; Amin, Khalid; Lyu, Bo; Fan, Hongliang; Zhang, Zhao; Yu, Hansong",Food & function,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1fo01050f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369950/,284

The traditional description of CRS in terms of two phenotypes based on the presence or absence of nasal polyps belies the underlying intricate immunopathophysiological processes responsible for this condition. CRS is being increasingly recognised as a disease spectrum encompassing a range of inflammatory states in the sinonasal cavity, with non-Type 2 inflammatory disease on one end, Type 2 inflammatory, eosinophil-heavy disease on the other, and an overlap of both in different proportions in between. An abundance in research on the immune mechanisms of CRS has revealed various new endotypes that hold promise as biomarkers for the development of targeted therapies in severe, uncontrolled CRS. The introduction of precision medicine to manage this chronic, complex condition is a step forward in providing individualised care for all patients with CRS. In this review, the latest research on the pathophysiology of CRS with a focus on potential novel biomarkers and treatment options over the last two years are summarised and integrated into a suggested model of precision medicine in CRS.","Xu, Xinni; Ong, Yew Kwang; Wang, De Yun",Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512248/,284

The interactions of this laser with commonly used supplies in transoral surgery have not been formally examined. This study evaluates the effects of the KTP laser on surgical supplies. STUDY DESIGN Experimental study. SETTING The study was conducted in an empty operating room at a university-affiliated medical center. METHODS An Aura XP 532-nm KTP laser with a 600-nm fiber was used in pulsed and continuous modes. The beam was focused at the shaft and balloon of 3 ""laser-safe"" endotracheal tubes (ETTs), a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ETT, and a Codman surgical patty. Time to penetrate was recorded. Results The KTP laser beam was unable to penetrate any of the laser-resistant ETTs. It did react with the black number markings on the PVC ETT by producing sparks but was unable to penetrate the shaft of the ETT. The KTP laser was nonreactive with all ETT cuffs except in 1 of 3 trials with the outer balloon cuff of a Rusch Lasertubus ETT when the laser was used in a continuous mode. The KTP laser caused the production of a flame upon contact with the blue radiopaque strip of the surgical patty, even when the patty was wet. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that a number of safe ETT options may be used during transoral laser microsurgery with a KTP laser. In addition, Codman surgical patties are shown to be a significant fire risk in KTP laser surgery.","Coughlan, Carolyn A; Verma, Sunil P",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599813505423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24057676/,284

79158,Ultra-resolution Metagenomics: When Enough Is Not Enough.,2021-08-31,"Background As one of the most lethal cancers, pancreatic cancer has been characterized by abundant supportive tumor-stromal cell microenvironment. Although the advent of tumor-targeted immune checkpoint blockers has brought light to patients with other cancers, its clinical efficacy in pancreatic cancer has been greatly limited due to the protective stroma. Thus, it is urgent to find potential new targets and establish multi-regulatory networks to predict patient prognosis and improve treatment. Methods We followed a strategy based on mining the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and ESTIMATE algorithm to obtain the immune scores and stromal scores. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with poor overall survival of pancreatic cancer were screened from a TCGA cohort. By comparing global gene expression with high vs. low immune scores and subsequent Kaplan-Meier analysis, DEGs that significantly correlate with poor overall survival of pancreatic cancer in TCGA cohort were extracted. After constructing the protein-protein interaction network using STRING and limiting the genes within the above DEGs, we utilized RAID 2.0, TRRUST v2 database and degree and betweenness analysis to obtain non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-pivotal nodes and TF-pivotal nodes. Finally, multi-regulatory networks have been constructed and pivotal drugs with potential benefit for pancreatic cancer patients were obtained by screening in the DrugBank. Results In this study, we obtained 246 DEGs that significantly correlate with poor overall survival of pancreatic cancer in the TCGA cohort. With the advent of 38 ncRNA-pivotal nodes and 7 TF-pivotal nodes, the multi-factor regulatory networks were constructed based on the above pivotal nodes. Prognosis-related genes and factors such as HCAR3, PPY, RFWD2, WSPAR and Amcinonide were screened and investigated. Conclusion The multi-regulatory networks constructed in this study are not only beneficial to improve treatment and evaluate patient prognosis with pancreatic cancer, but also favorable for implementing early diagnosis and personalized treatment. It is suggested that these factors may play an essential role in the progression of pancreatic cancer.","Li, Tong; Liu, Qiaofei; Zhang, Ronghua; Liao, Quan; Zhao, Yupei",Cancer cell international,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12935-020-01426-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724299/,284

The homolog 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB118) is one of the most important dioxin-like PCBs and is highly toxic. PCB118 can accumulate in human tissues, serum and breast milk, which leads to direct exposure of the fetus during development. In the present study, pregnant mice were exposed to 0, 20 and 100 μg/kg/day of PCB118 during the stage of fetal primordial germ cell migration. Compared with the control group, we found morphological alterations of the seminiferous tubules and a higher sperm deformity rate in the male offspring in the treatment groups. Furthermore, the methylation patterns in the treatment groups of the imprinted genes H19 and Gtl2 in the sperm were altered in the male offspring. We also characterized the disturbance of the expression levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1), Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Dnmt3l, and Uhrf1. The results indicated that intrauterine exposure to low doses of PCB118 could significantly damage the reproductive health of the male offspring. Therefore, attention should be paid to the adverse effects of PCB118 exposure during pregnancy on the reproductive system of male offspring.","He, Qi-Long; Lyu, Tian-Qi; Zhang, Yong-Tao; Wang, Hai-Quan; Zhou, Qian; Zhang, Jian-Mei; Liu, Yuan-Yuan; Li, Jia-Shuo; Jiang, Li-Gang; Cheng, Dong; Ge, Zhao-Jia; Liu, Shu-Zhen",Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,https://doi.org/10.1002/jat.3992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418265/,284

However, the size of the specimen is a limiting factor for NOSE. We describe a novel method for natural orifice colorectal specimen extraction that reduces the diameter of the specimen and provides an easier extraction through the vagina. A totally laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for a cecal adenocarcinoma 5 cm in diameter was performed on a 62-year-old woman. Ileocolic anastomosis was done intracorporeally. Before transvaginal extraction, the largest width of the specimen was measured as 12 cm. The bulky mesentery of the cecum that limited the NOSE was divided partially along the bowel with a LigaSure™ (Covidien, Boulder, CO) device. The largest width of the specimen was reduced to 9 cm, and the specimen was extracted without difficulty through the vagina in a bag. The stage of the tumor was pT3pN1. There was no recurrence with a 7-month follow-up. Transvaginal specimen extraction may fail because of the size of the specimen. Reduction of the width of the specimen by partial division of the mesocolon provides a high success rate for NOSE.

In this work we evaluated in vivo the effects of three relevant components of atmospheric dusts (brake dust, wood pellet ash and Saharan dust) employing the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans. Main endpoints of C. elegans such as life span, brood size and oxidative stress were addressed by exposing the nematodes to different dust concentrations. Brake dust and pellet ash affected the life span and increased significantly the oxidative stress of exposed nematodes, while Saharan dust showed no effects. Water soluble and insoluble fractions of these dusts were used to investigate the impact of the single fraction on C. elegans. The two fractions of brake dust and pellet ash exerted different effects on C. elegans endpoints in terms of life span and oxidative stress response. These fractions acted in different ways on the worm susceptibility to infection of two human pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) affecting the sek-1 gene expression. In conclusion, our study showed that C. elegans is a valuable tool to investigate in vivo possible effects of atmospheric dusts.","Ficociello, Graziella; Inverni, Agnese; Massimi, Lorenzo; Buccini, Giulio; Canepari, Silvia; Uccelletti, Daniela",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937173/,284

Hybrids of P. sibirica and true mume, belonging to the apricot mei group, inherited strong cold resistance from P. sibirica. These materials are favourable for research on the molecular mechanisms of cold resistance. However, no suitable reference genes have been identified for analysing gene expression patterns between P. sibirica and P. mume. Ten candidate reference genes were assessed, namely, actins (ACT2-1, ACT2-2, ACT2-3, ACT2-4), protein phosphatase 2A-1 (PP2A-1), ubiquitins (UBQ2, UBQ3), ubiquitin extension protein (UBQ1) and tubulins (TUB1, TUB2), with four distinct algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder). UBQ2 was recognized as the best reference gene in stems and buds across materials (P. sibirica; 'Xiaohong Zhusha', 'Beijing Yudie', and 'Xiao Lve' for true mume; and 'Dan Fenghou', 'Fenghou', and 'Yanxing' for apricot mei) under cold stress. In addition, the temporal and spatial expression patterns of PmCBF6 and PmLEA10 among seven varieties during winter periods were analysed using UBQ2 as a reference gene. The expression differed significantly among cultivars, which may contribute to their differences in cold tolerance. This paper confirmed the strong cold tolerance of apricot mei.

METHODS Review of publicly available public health and academic hospitals guidelines along with review of communication among otolaryngology departments. RESULTS Among 114 academic institutions affiliated with OHNS residencies, 20 (17.5%) institutions provided public access to some form of guidance on PPE and 73 (64%) provided information on screening or diagnostic testing. PPE guidelines were uniquely described based on several variables: location of care, COVID-19 status, involvement of aerosol generating or high-risk procedures, and physical distance from the patient. Six hospital guidelines were highlighted. Across these 6 institutions, there was agreement that N95 respirators were needed for high-risk patients undergoing high-risk procedures. Variations existed amongst institutions for scenarios with low-risk patients. Definitions of the low-risk patient and high-risk procedures were inconsistent amongst institutions. Three of the highlighted institutions had OHNS departments recommending higher level of airway protection than the institution. CONCLUSION OHNS departments typically had more stringent PPE guidance than their institution. Discrepancies in communicating PPE use were frequent and provide inconsistent information on how healthcare workers should protect themselves in the COVID-19 pandemic. Identification of these inconsistencies serves as an opportunity to standardize communication and develop evidence-based guidelines. This article is protected by copyright.

92776,Assessing drug development risk using Big Data and Machine Learning.,2020-12-22,"This study describes the development and validation of a blocking ELISA that measures avidity of BVDV-specific immunoglobulins (Igs) as an alternative to the classic virus neutralization test. The assay comprises a recombinant soluble E2 glycoprotein as target antigen, a neutralizing serum as detector antibody and a washing-step with a chaotropic agent to determine BVDV-specific Igs avidity. Avidity-Blocking ELISA was validated with 100 negative and 87 positive BVDV-neutralization serum samples from either infected or vaccinated bovines (inactivated commercial vaccines). Specificity and sensitivity of the Avidity-Blocking ELISA were 100% and 98.8%, respectively. The assay was standardized to use a single dilution, so that 90 samples can be tested per plate. Results expressed as Avidity Index (AI) correlated with BVDV neutralizing titers (r=0.94). Unlike the virus neutralization test, the Avidity-Blocking ELISA could discriminate between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA), suggesting that avidity measurement can be a valuable tool to achieve DIVA compliances. The data show that the avidity of anti BVDV antibodies is related to their capacity to block viral infection in vitro.","Franco Mahecha, O L; Ogas Castells, M L; Combessies, G; Lavoria, M A; Wilda, M; Mansilla, F C; Seki, C; Grigera, P R; Capozzo, A V",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.05.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21621555/,284

Biological assays showed compound 18 capable of binding α(v)β(3) integrin with nanomolar affinity according to a two-sites model, and molecular modeling studies revealed a peculiar π-stacking interaction between the triazole ring and Tyr178 side chain. Accordingly, compound 18 inhibited the adhesion of integrin-expressing human melanoma cells to RGD-containing proteins of the extracellular matrix, such as vitronectin, fibronectin, and osteopontin, and also angiogenesis in in vitro and in vivo experimental models. The relevant biological effects exerted by compound 18 suggest its potential application as an antiangiogenic agent in the diagnosis and therapy of tumors where α(v)β(3) integrin expression is up-regulated.","Trabocchi, Andrea; Menchi, Gloria; Cini, Nicoletta; Bianchini, Francesca; Raspanti, Silvia; Bottoncetti, Anna; Pupi, Alberto; Calorini, Lido; Guarna, Antonio",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/jm100754z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20809642/,284
100916,Ethics of Being Close.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND Liver parenchymal transection is the most invasive and challenging part in the living donor operation. The study was planned to compare the safety, efficacy, and outcome of harmonic scalpel versus spray diathermy as a method of parenchymal liver transection in donor hepatectomy. PATIENT AND METHOD Eighty consecutive patients, who were treated by living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), were included in the study. The study population was divided into two groups according to the method of liver transection: group A by harmonic scalpel (HS) and group B by spray diathermy (SD). The primary outcome was the volume of blood loss during transection. Secondary outcomes were time of transection, number of ligatures needed during transection, pathological changes at cut surface, postoperative morbidities, cost, and hospital stay RESULTS: Blood loss during overall liver transection and in each zone was significantly less in the SD than in the HS group (P = 0.015). The number of ligatures was significantly less in the SD than in the HS group (P = 0.0001). The SD group had significantly higher level of serum bilirubin, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), and international normalized ratio (INR) levels on postoperative day 3 than the HS group. Lateral tissue coagulation and hepatic necrosis are significantly less in HS group. The overall incidence of postoperative morbidities was the same in both groups. The cost was higher in HS group than SD group (US$760 vs. US$40 P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION Spray diathermy is an effective method of parenchymal transection with significantly lower blood loss and lower cost compared to HS with no increase in morbidity. HS is associated with earlier recovery of liver functions.","El Shobary, Mohamed; Salah, Tarek; El Nakeeb, Ayman; Sultan, Ahmad M; Elghawalby, Ahmed; Fathy, Omar; Wahab, Mohamed Abdel; Yassen, Amro; Elmorshedy, Mohamed; Elkashef, Wagdi F; Shiha, Usama; Elsadany, Mohamed",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-016-3312-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27798785/,284

Being a recent virus outbreak, there are still no available therapeutic regimens that have been approved in large randomised trials and so patients are currently being treated with multiple drugs. This raises concerns regarding drug interaction and their implication in arrhythmic burden. In fact, two of the actually used drugs against SARS-CoV2, such as chloroquine and the combination lopinavir/ritonavir, might determine a QT (the time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave) interval prolongation and they show several interactions with antiarrhythmic drugs and antipsychotic medications, making them prone to an increased risk of developing arrhythmias. This brief review focuses the attention on the most relevant drug interactions involving the currently used COVID-19 medications and their possible association with cardiac rhythm disorders, taking into account also pre-existing condition and precipitating factors that might additionally increase this risk. Furthermore, based on the available evidence and based on the knowledge of drug interaction, we propose a quick and simple algorithm that might help both cardiologists and non-cardiologists in the management of the arrhythmic risk before and during the treatment with the specific drugs used against SARS-CoV2.","Sciaccaluga, Carlotta; Cameli, Matteo; Menci, Daniele; Mandoli, Giulia Elena; Sisti, Nicolò; Cameli, Paolo; Franchi, Federico; Mondillo, Sergio; Valente, Serafina",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32820084/,284

The reasons for this are numerous and complex, but key amongst them is the interplay between poor research methodology and the likely selective reporting of randomised trials. In this issue of Perioperative Medicine, we find a very unusual report, one which describes a randomised trial stopped for futility after the recruitment of only a small proportion of the target patient sample (Jammer et al. Periop Med). The authors offer no statistical analysis of their findings but simply an explanation of what went wrong. On the face of it, this exercise would seem to offer little of value to the general reader. How can publication of the findings of an unsuccessful trial contribute to the evidence base on this topic?

114900,Modern statistical tools for inference and prediction of infectious diseases using mathematical models.,2018,"OBJECTIVES Cost utility analyses compare the costs and health outcome of interventions, with a denominator of quality-adjusted life year, a generic health utility measure combining both quality and quantity of life. Cost utility analyses are difficult to compare when methods are not standardized. It is unclear how cost utility analyses are measured/reported in critical care and what methodologic challenges cost utility analyses pose in this setting. This may lead to differences precluding cost utility analyses comparisons. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of cost utility analyses conducted in critical care. Our objectives were to understand: 1) methodologic characteristics, 2) how health-related quality-of-life was measured/reported, and 3) what costs were reported/measured. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES We systematically searched for cost utility analyses in critical care in MEDLINE, Embase, American College of Physicians Journal Club, CENTRAL, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews' selected subset of archived versions of UK National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and American Economic Association electronic databases from inception to April 30, 2020. SETTING Adult intensive care units. PATIENTS Adult critically ill patients. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 8,926 citations, 80 cost utility analyse studies were eligible. The time horizon most commonly reported was lifetime (59%). For health utility reporting, health-related quality-of-life was infrequently measured (29% reported), with only 5% of studies reporting baseline health-related quality-of-life. Indirect utility measures (generic, preference-based health utility measurement tools) were reported in 85% of studies (majority Euro-quality-of-life-5 Domains, 52%). Methods of estimating health-related quality-of-life were seldom used when the patient was incapacitated: imputation (19%), assigning fixed utilities for incapacitation (19%), and surrogates reporting on behalf of incapacitated patients (5%). For cost utility reporting transparency, separate incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years were both reported in only 76% of studies. Disaggregated quality-adjusted life years (reporting separate health utility and life years) were described in only 34% of studies. CONCLUSIONS We identified deficiencies which warrant recommendations (standardized measurement/reporting of resource use/unit costs/health-related quality-of-life/methodological preferences) for improved design, conduct, and reporting of future cost utility analyses in critical care.","Lau, Vincent I; Xie, Feng; Basmaji, John; Cook, Deborah J; Fowler, Robert; Kiflen, Michel; Sirotich, Emily; Iansavichene, Alla; Bagshaw, Sean M; Wilcox, M Elizabeth; Lamontagne, François; Ferguson, Niall; Rochwerg, Bram",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591013/,284
115900,SARS nurses shunned after recovery.,2004,"INTRODUCTION Ocular symptoms are uncommon manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Earlier study reported that dry eye, blurred vision, foreign body sensation, tearing, itching, conjunctival secretion, conjunctival congestion, ocular pain, and photophobia are among the ocular symptoms that could be found in COVID-19 patients. However, there are only a few reports available regarding corneal involvement in this disease. Here we report a case of keratoconjunctivitis as the only symptom of COVID-19 infection. CASE DESCRIPTION A 27-year-old man who worked as an obstetrics and gynecology resident came to the outpatient clinic with the chief complaints of eye discomfort, foreign body sensation, conjunctival hyperemia, lacrimation, and photophobia in his right eye for the past 3 weeks. Fluorescence test showed a small corneal lesion. The patient was then diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis. A week after the treatment, all symptoms were resolved. A month later, the patient came to the emergency room with the same eye complaints but with a more severe pain. The fluorescence test showed wider corneal lesion compared to last month. The result from the corneal swab is negative for bacterial or fungal infection, indicating a viral infection. Afterwards, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test from nasopharyngeal swab was performed and revealed that the patient was positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS This case report showed that keratoconjunctivitis may occur as the only manifestation of COVID-19 infection. Thus, patient presented with unexplainable eye symptoms should be evaluated for COVID-19 infection.","Hutama, Satria Audi; Alkaff, Firas Farisi; Intan, Ryan Enast; Maharani, Citra Dewi; Indriaswati, Luki; Zuhria, Ismi",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/11206721211006583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781126/,284

Weight excess is a well-established respiratory disease risk factor, and the newly reported correlation is therefore unsurprising. The underlying pathophysiology is likely multi-stranded, ranging from complement system hyperactivation, increased Interleukin-6 secretion, chronic inflammation, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, and a possible local, detrimental effect within the lung.

There is also expected to be an increase in mental health problems in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. An increase in severe health anxiety (SHA) is particularly anticipated, for which Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a frontline treatment. However, it is unclear what interaction-types are associated with outcome-improvement in remote-CBT (rCBT) for SHA. This study aimed to identify interaction-types that predict outcomes and sudden gains in rCBT for SHA using initial therapy session content. Forty-eight participants in rCBT for SHA had interactions at their first sessions categorized and rated in terms of patient activation: An individual's confidence and ability to manage their health. Multilevel modelling assessed whether early interaction-types predicted session-by-session wellbeing. For participants experiencing sudden gains (n = 12) interactions at the session directly prior to the gain were similarly categorised and rated. The scores were then compared to ratings for the preceding session. A smaller proportion of early sessions was taken up with problem descriptions amongst those with greater outcome-improvements. There was also a significant reduction in the proportion of the session spent describing problems in the session directly prior to a sudden gain, as compared to the previous session. Conversely, clients with better outcomes made more positive evaluations of themselves and therapy, noticed more positive changes, and made more contributions to structuring interactions at initial sessions. Conclusion. Specific early interaction-types predict session-by-session outcomes and precede sudden gains in rCBT for SHA.","Malins, Sam; Moghaddam, Nima; Morriss, Richard; Schröder, Thomas; Brown, Paula; Boycott, Naomi",Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33368731/,284

126112,Sixty seconds on . . . reorganising the NHS.,2020-07-13,"BACKGROUND Peritoneal dialysis (PD) for acute kidney injury (AKI) of newborns has been performed safely. AKI occurs in 8 to 24% of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. Although PD has only been used occasionally in ELBW infants, prognosis is poor for ELBW infants with AKI. Several reports have described successful PD in these infants, but no guideline-based evidence concerning indications for renal replacement therapy in ELBW infants are currently available. Here, we report on our experience with PD in an ELBW infant with AKI resulting from septic shock. CASE PRESENTATION A male was born at 24 weeks and 3 days gestation weighing 264 g by emergency cesarean section due to complications of pregnancy in a patient with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. On day of life (DOL) 15, the inability to ventilate, along with cardiovascular dysfunction, acute kidney injury, and ascites under tension led to the tentative diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). On DOL 17, placement of a percutaneous drainage tube immediately released compression of the tense abdomen. Although intra-abdominal pressure reduction with percutaneous drainage temporarily improved respiratory status, circulatory impairment persisted and infections were not well controlled. Finally, the patient developed anuria. On DOL 21, peritoneal dialysis (PD) was started by initially inserting a drainage tube. Although the patient had catheter-associated peritonitis, urine output improved by DOL 44 and PD was discontinued on DOL 53. On DOL 75, extubation was conducted without circulatory dysfunction. The patient was discharged on DOL 224. CONCLUSIONS We emphasize that starting PD treatment before the onset of anuria is important in ELBW infants with AKI. Although the catheter used in our case was initially inserted for drainage of ascites, this type of catheter is sufficiently useful for PD in ELBW infants, and PD using a drainage tube may represent a safe, effective, and minimally invasive treatment for ELBW infants. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the use of a percutaneous tube to conduct successful PD for peritoneal drainage in an ELBW infant. This is the lowest-weight ELBW infant with successful PD reported to date.","Yokoyama, Satoshi; Nukada, Takayuki; Ikeda, Yuka; Hara, Shigeto; Yoshida, Akira",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-017-0390-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29124521/,284
126920,Pushing Back Against the Microaggression Pushback in Academic Psychology: Reflections on a Concept-Creep Paradox.,2021-09-01,"Reducing meat consumption may improve human health, curb environmental damage, and limit the large-scale suffering of animals reared in factory farms. Most attention to reducing consumption has focused on restructuring environments where foods are chosen or on making health or environmental appeals. However, psychological theory suggests that interventions appealing to animal welfare concerns might operate on distinct, potent pathways. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effec-tiveness of these interventions. We searched eight academic databases and extensively searched grey literature. We meta-analyzed 100 studies assessing interventions designed to reduce meat consumption or purchase by mentioning or portraying farm animals, that measured behavioral or self-reported outcomes related to meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions, and that had a control condition. The interventions consistently reduced meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions at least in the short term with meaningfully large effects (meta-analytic mean risk ratio [RR] = 1.22; 95% CI: [1.13, 1.33]). We estimated that a large majority of true population effects (71%; 95% CI: [59%, 80%]) were stronger than RR = 1.1 and that few were in the unintended direction. Via meta-regression, we identified some specific characteristics of studies and interventions that were associated with effect size. Risk-of-bias assessments identified both methodological strengths and limitations of this literature; however, results did not differ meaningfully in sensitivity analyses retaining only studies at the lowest risk of bias. Evidence of publication bias was not apparent. In conclusion, animal welfare inter-ventions preliminarily appear effective in these typically short-term studies of primarily self-reported outcomes. Future research should use direct behavioral outcomes that mini-mize the potential for social desirability bias and are measured over long-term follow-up.","Mathur, Maya B; Peacock, Jacob; Reichling, David B; Nadler, Janice; Bain, Paul A; Gardner, Christopher D; Robinson, Thomas N",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984401/,284
129656,Detection of COVID-19 Using Deep Learning Algorithms on Chest Radiographs.,2020-09-22,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion for hydrocephalus via ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures. Unfortunately, VP shunting also carries a high complication rate. While long-term complications of VP shunting are generally well-described, the literature on more acute, iatrogenic injury during shunt placement is essentially limited to easily identifiable intracranial bleeds. Herein is presented the first reported case of iatrogenic abdominal wall vessel injury as a consequence of blind distal VP shunt catheter placement causing a critical haemoperitoneum that necessitated multiple transfusions. Presentation and recognition of this bleed was delayed as it occurred over a number of days. Injury to the inferior epigastric artery, or potentially a distal branch of the superficial epigastric artery, is suspected to have occurred during either blind subcutaneous tunnelling of the shunt catheter passage or during penetration of the peritoneum. Haemoperitoneum as a potential complication of procedures involving manipulation or penetration of the abdominal wall (i.e. paracentesis) is well-described in the medical and general surgical literature, and ultrasound-guidance has been widely adopted to mitigate bleeding in these cases. Familiarity with intra-abdominal haemorrhage as a potential complication of VP shunting and an understanding of its presentation is critical for timely identification of this phenomenon. Furthermore, the use of real-time ultrasound-guidance for tunnelling and distal shunt catheter placement may decrease the incidence of intrabdominal complications after shunt placement more generally and should be considered an area of future study.","Patel, Aneek; Golub, Danielle; Guerrero Zuniga, Adler; Kaufman, Brian",British journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1080/02688697.2020.1858025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305645/,284

131434,Ribosome Binding Protein 1 Correlates with Prognosis and Cell Proliferation in Bladder Cancer.,2020,"Importance Suicide, a leading cause of death with devastating emotional and societal costs, is a generally preventable cause of death and a critical global public health issue. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase the risk of population suicide through its effects on a number of well-established suicide risk factors. Observations Prior to the pandemic, many countries were engaging in suicide prevention strategies, and although the overall global burden of suicide deaths has increased, some national efforts were beginning to see positive results. Additionally, the gap between mental health needs and services has been increasing in many nations. With the added physical and mental health, social, and economic burdens imposed by the pandemic, many populations worldwide may experience increased suicide risk. Data and recent events during the first 6 months of the pandemic reveal specific effects on suicide risk. However, increases in suicide rates are not a foregone conclusion even with the negative effects of the pandemic. In fact, emerging suicide data from several countries show no evidence of an increase in suicide during the pandemic thus far. There are actionable steps that policy makers, health care leaders, and organizational leaders can take to mitigate suicide risk during and after the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance COVID-19 presents a new and urgent opportunity to focus political will, federal investments, and global community on the vital imperative of suicide prevention. Suicide prevention in the COVID-19 era requires addressing not only pandemic-specific suicide risk factors, but also prepandemic risk factors. This Special Communication provides prioritized, evidence-based strategies for clinicians and health care delivery systems, along with national and local policy and educational initiatives tailored to the COVID-19 environment. If implemented to scale, these interventions could significantly mitigate the pandemic's negative effects on suicide risk.","Moutier, Christine",JAMA psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.3746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064124/,284
131700,Ionising radiation risk perception through mental models: towards radiological emergency preparedness.,2020-10-28,"BACKGROUND Many have questioned whether the laparoscopic, percutaneous hernia repair technique is as durable as an open repair in which the sac is divided and ligated. We set out to assess if the suture alone causes enough injury and scar over time to obliterate the internal ring. MATERIALS AND METHODS In total, 28 male rabbits with congenital patent processus vaginalis underwent laparoscopic repair with the subcutaneous endoscopically assisted ligation technique. For Group 1 the repairs were evaluated laparoscopically at predetermined time points before and after removal of the ligating suture. Group 2 assessed the effect of sharp peritoneal trauma at the time of repair and was evaluated at 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS When durability of repair with suture alone was evaluated, all repairs failed after insufflation to 35 mm Hg after suture removal out to a time point of 12 weeks. In the peritoneal trauma group, at the 2- and 4-week survival time point, 87.5% and 100%, respectively, of repairs remained intact after removal of suture. In contrast, only 25% and 12.5%, respectively, of defects remained closed in the animals repaired with suture ligation alone. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic, percutaneous hernia repair may rely heavily on the suture itself to prevent recurrence. In the event of suture failure, this could lead to an increasingly high recurrence rate. The addition of minor peritoneum trauma may induce sufficient scarring to provide a more durable repair.","Blatnik, Jeffrey A; Harth, Karem C; Krpata, David M; Kelly, Katherine B; Schomisch, Steven J; Ponsky, Todd A",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

134858,Efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma in the caudate lobe of the liver.,2013,"BACKGROUND The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming the major health issue in recent human history with thousands of deaths and millions of cases worldwide. Newer research and old experience with other corona-viruses highlighted a probable underlying mechanism of disturbance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that is associ-ated with intrinsic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE In this review, we aimed to describe the intimate connections between the RAS components, the immune system and COVID-19 pathophysiology. METHODS This non-systematic review article summarizes recent evidence on the relationship between COVID-19 and the RAS. RESULTS Several studies have indicated that the downregulation of membrane-bound ACE2 may exert a key role for the impairment of immune functions and for COVID-19 patients' outcome. The downregulation may occur by distinct mecha-nisms, particularly: (1) the shedding process induced by SARS-CoV-2 fusion pathway, which reduces the amount of mem-brane-bound ACE2, stimulating more shedding by the high levels of Angiotensin II; (2) the endocytosis of ACE2 receptor with the virus itself and (3) by the interferon inhibition caused by SARS-CoV-2 effects on immune system, which leads to reduction of ACE2 receptor expression. CONCLUSION Recent research provides evidence of a reduction of the components of the alternative RAS axis, including ACE2 and Angiotensin-(1-7). In contrast, increased levels of Angiotensin II can activate the AT1 receptor in several organs. Consequently, increased inflammation, thrombosis and angiogenesis occur in patients infected with SARS-COV-2. Atten-tion should be paid to the interactions of the RAS and COVID-19, mainly in the context of novel vaccines and proposed medications.","Vieira, Cristina; Nery, Lucas; Martins, Ludimila; Jabour, Luiz; Dias, Raphael; Simões E Silva, Ana Cristina",Current drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389450121666201020154033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33081670/,284

METHODS Eighteen consecutive patients (11 men; median age 75 years) with significant restenosis within 24 months of CEA were treated with a paclitaxel-coated DCB prior to CAS. Clinical outcomes and stent patency were systematically appraised. RESULTS All patients were successfully treated according to this clinical protocol. The only complication occurred in a patient who had a transient ischemic attack during prolonged DCB inflation. At a median follow-up of 18 months, no >50% restenosis was observed on duplex ultrasound scans; however, moderate hyperplasia at the proximal stent edge was found in 4 patients. One patient died at 9 months from a myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION Despite the small sample size and in keeping with the historically high risk of recurrent restenosis after CAS for CEA restenosis, this case series suggests that DCB dilation followed by CAS for postsurgical restenosis is feasible, safe, and may be associated with favorable clinical outcomes at midterm follow-up.","Piccoli, Gianluca; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Gavrilovic, Vladimir; Radici, Viviana; Cancelli, Iacopo; Frigatti, Paolo; Frati, Giacomo; Marullo, Antonino G M; Divis, Paolo; Gasparini, Daniele",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602815573498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25809364/,284
137567,A review of machine learning methods for retinal blood vessel segmentation and artery/vein classification.,2020-11-17,"BACKGROUND Intravascular imaging can facilitate chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS AND RESULTS We examined the frequency of use and outcomes of intravascular imaging among 619 CTO percutaneous coronary interventions performed between 2012 and 2015 at 7 US centers. Mean age was 65.4±10 years and 85% of the patients were men. Intravascular imaging was used in 38%: intravascular ultrasound in 36%, optical coherence tomography in 3%, and both in 1.45%. Intravascular imaging was used for stent sizing (26.3%), stent optimization (38.0%), and CTO crossing (35.7%, antegrade in 27.9%, and retrograde in 7.8%). Intravascular imaging to facilitate crossing was used more frequently in lesions with proximal cap ambiguity (49% versus 26%, P<0.0001) and with retrograde as compared with antegrade-only cases (67% versus 31%, P<0.0001). Despite higher complexity (Japanese CTO score: 2.86±1.19 versus 2.43±1.19, P=0.001), cases in which imaging was used for crossing had similar technical and procedural success (92.8% versus 89.6%, P=0.302 and 90.1% versus 88.3%, P=0.588, respectively) and similar incidence of major cardiac adverse events (2.7% versus 3.2%, P=0.772). Use of intravascular imaging was associated with longer procedure (192 minutes [interquartile range 130, 255] versus 131 minutes [90, 192], P<0.0001) and fluoroscopy (71 minutes [44, 93] versus 39 minutes [25, 69], P<0.0001) time. CONCLUSIONS Intravascular imaging is frequently performed during CTO percutaneous coronary intervention both for crossing and for stent selection/optimization. Despite its use in more complex lesion subsets, intravascular imaging was associated with similar rates of technical and procedural success for CTO percutaneous coronary intervention.

INTRODUCTION Simulation activities are now widely implemented in health care professionals' education. However, the mechanisms by which simulations and their design features lead to health care professionals' and students' learning remains unclear. Still, because of their high interactivity and complexity, simulation activities have the potential to impact the cognitive load of learners. Synthesizing evidence regarding this phenomenon could help simulation educators identify the design features that affect learners' cognitive load, and explain why some simulation activities are more effective than others.

139509,Detection of liver cirrhosis in standard T2-weighted MRI using deep transfer learning.,2021-05-11,"We have previously described a novel temporal encoding mechanism in the somatosensory system, where mechanical pulses grouped into periodic bursts create a perceived tactile frequency based on the duration of the silent gap between bursts, rather than the mean rate or the periodicity. This coding strategy may offer new opportunities for transmitting information to the brain using various sensory neural prostheses and haptic interfaces. However, it was not known whether the same coding mechanisms apply when using electrical stimulation, which recruits a different spectrum of afferents. Here, we demonstrate that the predictions of the burst gap coding model for frequency perception apply to burst stimuli delivered with electrical pulses, re-emphasising the importance of the temporal structure of spike patterns in neural processing and perception of tactile stimuli. Reciprocally, the electrical stimulation data confirm that the results observed with mechanical stimulation do indeed depend on neural processing mechanisms in the central nervous system, and are not due to skin mechanical factors and resulting patterns of afferent activation.","Ng, Kevin K W; Olausson, Christoffer; Vickery, Richard M; Birznieks, Ingvars",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790784/,284

We studied thyroid hormones as possible indicators of nutrition in adolescent girls with eating disorders. METHOD Blood samples for analyses of thyroid hormones were obtained at 360 assessments of 298 patients and biweekly during 42 treatment periods in 36 patients. RESULTS At assessment, when most of the girls were on a weight losing course, serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations were low. Great weight loss and rapid rate of weight loss were the most important predictors of low T3 concentrations. Serum free thyroxine concentrations were in the lower normal range. In premenarcheal girls, weight loss was the most important predictor of free thyroxine but this relationship was weaker in postmenarcheal girls. Serum TSH concentrations were within the normal range and only weakly related to weight changes. During treatment, T3 increased in parallel with weight but was also influenced by the short-term weight trend. CONCLUSION Serum T3 concentration is an indicator of nutritional status in adolescent girls with eating disorders. It is sensitive to short-term weight changes and could be used to monitor progress throughout nutritional rehabilitation.","Swenne, Ingemar; Stridsberg, Mats; Thurfjell, Barbro; Rosling, Agneta",Hormone research,https://doi.org/10.1159/000208800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19339791/,284
141594,Respiratory Viruses and Treatment Failure in Children With Asthma Exacerbation.,2018,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 is characterized by a pulmonary interstitial compromise which can require intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation. Covid patients develop a wide range of pathologies. This study aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 in diseases commonly treated by vascular surgeons. METHODS Four conditions were selected: venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and microangiopathy. A systematic review of the literature using PRISMA guidelines was. RESULTS Out of 1195 papers reviewed for conditions in COVID-19 patients relevant to routine vascular surgery practice, 43 papers were included and analyzed. Venous thrombosis was found to be the most common COVID-19 associated pathology with a cumulative incidence of 25% at 7 days and 48% at 14 days. Additionally, D-dimer levels proved to be a good predictor, even in the early stages of the disease with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 88.5% and a negative predictive value of 94.7%. Patients in the ICU demonstrated a significantly higher risk of developing VTE, even when receiving pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Although evidence of arterial thrombosis was less common (1% to 16.3%), its consequences were typically more serious, including limb loss and death even in young individuals (OR = 25, 95% CI). Finally, microangiopathy has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations from retinal microangiopathy to other more severe manifestations such as myocardial injury, pulmonary compromise and potential multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Although the pathophysiological pathway by which COVID-19 produces thrombosis is not completely clear, the incidence of both arterial and venous thrombosis is increased. D-dimer screening should be done in all COVID-19 patients, as a predictor of thrombotic complications.","Ulloa, Jorge H; Figueroa, Valentin; Cifuentes, Juan Sebastian; Pinto, Paula; Lurie, Fedor",Vascular and endovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1538574421998212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657926/,284
141599,Retrofitting an environmental monitor with a silicon photomultiplier sensor.,2020-05-14,"Microplastics (MPs) are emerging as a severe threat in our environment. Their diverse existence in marine environments is being researched globally and thus a widely known fact; however, their presence in the freshwater counterpart has gained attention lately only. Riverine systems, the most critical freshwater resources serve as an essential link between terrestrial and marine environments and their contamination with MPs is going to create severe environmental issues. Because of their small size and unique morphology, these polymers can exhibit variable toxicity to the interacting biota and alter their habitat properties; thus, causing serious impacts on the environment and health of living beings, including humans. These microplastics can also interact with pollutants like heavy metals and organic pollutants, which further augment their harming potential. Inefficient and poor plastic waste disposal practices play an important role in the generation of microplastic pollutants. In the present COVID 19 pandemics, the excessive use of plastic to contain the spread of infection has further added the plastic load in the environment which will eventually lead to the generation of microplastic particles. Also, a significant amount of microplastic pollutants in riverine systems are delivered through wastewater treatment plant effluents. These trade-offs create a distress situation in the environment. The present study connects these key issues for a better understanding of the diverse existence of microplastic pollutants, their sources, and fate, with a special emphasis on riverine systems. A critical appraisal of the knowledge gaps and proposal of suitable solutions through this review might open up avenues for further research and effective management of the microplastics in aquatic environments.","Vaid, Mansi; Sarma, Kiranmay; Gupta, Anshu",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34089959/,284
142127,The Zero Waste utopia and the role of waste-to-energy.,2020-05-01,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the flexural properties and surface characteristics of a structural colored resin composite after different finishing and polishing methods, in comparison to those of conventional resin composites. METHODS AND MATERIALS A structural color resin composite, Omnichroma (OM, Tokuyama Corp, Chiyoda City, Tokyo, Japan), and two comparison resin composites, Filtek Supreme Ultra (FS, 3M, St Paul, MN, USA) and Tetric EvoCeram (TE, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), were used. The flexural properties of the resin composites were determined in accordance with the ISO 4049 specifications. For surface properties, 70 polymerized specimens of each resin composite were prepared and divided into seven groups of 10. Surface roughness (Sa), gloss (GU), and surface free energy (SFE) were investigated after the following finishing and polishing methods. Three groups of specimens were finished with a superfine-grit diamond bur (SFD), and three with a tungsten carbide bur (TCB). After finishing, one of the two remaining groups was polished with a one-step silicone point (CMP), and the other with an aluminum oxide flexible disk (SSD). A group ground with SiC 320-grit was set as a baseline. RESULTS The average flexural strength ranged from 116.6 to 142.3 MPa in the following order with significant differences between each value: FS > TE > OM. The average E ranged from 6.8 to 13.2 GPa in the following order with significant differences between each value: FS > TE > OM. The average R ranged from 0.77 to 1.01 MJ/mm3 in the following order: OM > FS > TE. The Sa values of the OM groups polished with CMP and SSD were found to be significantly lower than those of the other resin composites, regardless of the finishing method. The GU values appeared to be dependent on the material and the finishing method used. The OM specimens polished with SSD showed significantly higher GU values than those polished with CMP. Most of the resin composites polished with SSD demonstrated significantly higher γS values compared to the other groups. Extremely strong negative correlations between Sa and GU in the combined data from the three resin composites and each resin composite and between Sa and γS in the OM specimens were observed; GU showed a strong positive correlation with γS in the same material. CONCLUSION These findings indicate that both flexural and surface properties are material dependent. Furthermore, the different finishing and polishing methods used in this study were observed to affect the Sa, GU, and SFE of the resin composites.","Mizutani, K; Ishii, R; Takamizawa, T; Shibasaki, S; Kurokawa, H; Suzuki, M; Tsujimoto, A; Miyazaki, M",Operative dentistry,https://doi.org/10.2341/20-154-l; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370032/,284

PATIENTS AND METHODS The patients were enrolled into the study having poor pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s <1.5 L) and undergoing radical resection of pulmonary carcinoma requiring at least 2 h of OLV. Patients were respectively allocated to VCV group and PCV group. The intraoperative data, arterial, and mixed venous blood gases were obtained at baseline, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min after OLV and end of surgery. The postoperative data had been recorded and arterial gas measurements were performed at 6, 12 and 24 h after surgery in Intensive Care Unit. RESULTS Comparison of the VCV group and PCV group, PaO2 and P(A-a)O2 were higher and dead space to tidal volume was lower in the PCV group (P < 0.05) after the point of OLV +60, Ppeak was higher in the VCV group (P < 0.05). There were significant advantages in PCV groups with regard to the PaO2 of three points in postoperation, the duration of postoperative ventilation duration, intensive care duration of stay and the days stay in hospital after surgery. CONCLUSIONS The use of PCV compared with VCV during OLV in elderly patients with poor pulmonary function has significant advantages of intraoperative and postoperative oxygenation and it might be a factor, which can beneficial to postoperative recovery.","Lin, Fei; Pan, Linghui; Huang, Bin; Ruan, Lin; Liang, Rui; Qian, Wei; Ge, Wanyun",Annals of thoracic medicine,https://doi.org/10.4103/1817-1737.140125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25276238/,284

Here, we introduce a skin-worn wearable hybrid sensing system that offers simultaneous real-time monitoring of a biochemical (lactate) and an electrophysiological signal (electrocardiogram), for more comprehensive fitness monitoring than from physical or electrophysiological sensors alone. The two sensing modalities, comprising a three-electrode amperometric lactate biosensor and a bipolar electrocardiogram sensor, are co-fabricated on a flexible substrate and mounted on the skin. Human experiments reveal that physiochemistry and electrophysiology can be measured simultaneously with negligible cross-talk, enabling a new class of hybrid sensing devices.","Imani, Somayeh; Bandodkar, Amay J; Mohan, A M Vinu; Kumar, Rajan; Yu, Shengfei; Wang, Joseph; Mercier, Patrick P",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms11650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27212140/,284
150172,Assessing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on urban transportation and air quality in Canada.,2020-12-24,"In patients with small aortic roots who need an aortic valve replacement with biological valve substitutes, the implantation of the stented pericardial valve might not meet the functional needs. The implantation of a too-small stented pericardial valve, leading to an effective orifice area indexed to a body surface area less than 0.85 cm2/m2, is regarded as prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM). A PPM negatively affects the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and thus the normalization of left ventricular function and the alleviation of symptoms. Persistent left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In the case of predictable PPM, there are three options: 1) accept the PPM resulting from the implantation of a stented pericardial valve when comorbidities of the patient forbid the more technically demanding operative technique of implanting a larger prosthesis, 2) enlarge the aortic root to accommodate a larger stented valve substitute, or 3) implant a stentless biological valve or a homograft. Compared to classical aortic valve replacement with stented pericardial valves, the full-root implantation of stentless aortic xenografts offers the possibility of implanting a 3-4 mm larger valve in a given patient, thus allowing significant reduction in transvalvular gradients. However, a number of cardiac surgeons are reluctant to transform a classical aortic valve replacement with stented pericardial valves into the more technically challenging full-root implantation of stentless aortic xenografts. Given the potential hemodynamic advantages of stentless aortic xenografts, we have adopted full-root implantation to avoid PPM in patients with small aortic roots necessitating an aortic valve replacement. Here, we describe in detail a technique for the full-root implantation of stentless aortic xenografts, with emphasis on the management of the proximal suture line and coronary anastomoses. Limitations of this technique and alternative options are discussed.","Tavakoli, Reza; Jamshidi, Peiman; Gassmann, Max",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/55632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28570525/,284
151223,Management and cleanup of legacy radium-contaminated sites in the United States.,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND Acorn fruit, its components and by-products are experiencing renewed interest thanks to their nutritional and phytochemical features. In particular, the oil extracted from acorns is recognized for having high nutritional quality and for being rich in bioactive compounds. Despite the growing interest, few papers are available about the evolution of acorn oil characteristics during storage. In this framework, our aim was to investigate the storage-related changes in acorn oils extracted from three Quercus species grown in Algeria (Q. ilex, Q. suber and Q. coccifera) after 180 days from production, with a focus on polar and volatile compounds, not yet investigated. In addition, basic quality parameters, phenolic content, antioxidant activity and induction time were monitored. RESULTS The oxidation markers (peroxide value and UV absorptions) increased during storage, whereas antioxidants decreased. A distinctive volatile profile was observed at the time of production, which underwent changes during storage. Polar compounds increased, whereas induction time decreased. The oil extracted from Quercus suber L. was the most affected by storage time. CONCLUSION Floral and fruity volatile compounds detected in the oils headspace could explain the pleasant flavor of acorn oils reported by other authors. Similarly to other vegetable oils, storage depletes both volatiles and antioxidants and produces oxidation compounds, such as oxidized triacylglycerols. However, the studied acorn oils were quite stable under storage in the dark at room temperature for 6 months. This article is protected by copyright.

Pasireotide, a multi-receptor targeted somatostatin analogue, and everolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR, showed antitumour properties in neuroendocrine tumours. Aim of this study was to evaluate pasireotide alone and in combination with everolimus in patients with MTC. METHODS Patients with progressive metastatic or persistent postoperative MTC received pasireotide LAR 60 mg/m for at least 6 months. Patients exhibiting progressive disease received everolimus 10 mg/d as combination therapy. Primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included, overall survival, objective response rates, change in circulating markers, safety. Study registration no. NCT01625520. RESULTS Nineteen consecutive patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 31 months. Median PFS with pasireotide was 36 months (95% CI: 19.5-52.5). Nine patients (47%) had tumour progression: seven of them started everolimus in combination with pasireotide, achieving a median PFS of 9.0 months (95% CI: 0-21.83). Five of them (71%) had further tumour progression, one objective response (14.3%), one stopped treatment because of pulmonary embolism. Pasireotide alone and with everolimus was safe and required withdrawal only in one case. Diarrhoea and hyperglycaemia were the most frequent adverse events with pasireotide (grade 3 in 5.3% each). Hyperglycaemia was the most frequent grade 3 toxicity with the combination therapy (28.6%). CONCLUSIONS Pasireotide therapy shows antiproliferative effects in persistent postoperative MTC suggesting further investigation on larger series of patients.

Surgical morbidity and mortality must be kept to a minimum to achieve this benefit. Neurological status of the CEA patients can be monitored easily during regional anesthesia depending on the awake testing (neurocognitive assessment) method of the CEA patients. In addition, specific parameters can help us to monitor and to predict the neurological status of the CEA patients during the procedures such as regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) and middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) changes. We conducted a computerized literature search involving humans, published in English until December 2017, and indexed through Medical Databases; MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. We reviewed articles performed for prospective and other types of studies related to CEA procedures and techniques which can predict patient's status during the procedure. Searching relevant articles and discussing the results to allow meaningful rate comparison, and to conclude a result view which benefits the CEA patients and the medical staff during the CEA procedures. In total, studies observed cerebral rSO2 and MCAv have significant value during CEA procedures. Patients with neurological symptoms during the procedures showed changes of cerebral rSO2 and MCAv more than the patients without neurological symptoms. Mentioned parameters (cerebral rSO2 and MCAv) showed significant increasing right after the procedure. Mostly, CEA surgeries under local anesthesia were observed, for monitoring patients' consciousness status and comparing it to patients who undergo general anesthesia, to view the reliability of these techniques during CEA procedures, and to predict and avoid intraoperative neurological symptoms.","Al Sultan, Ahmed Yousef A; Alsubhi, Abdulrahman Mawadh A","Anesthesia, essays and researches",https://doi.org/10.4103/aer.aer_217_17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29628544/,284
153075,How to verify the death of a patient.,2020-05-26,"PURPOSE Immigrant patients run a risk of receiving lower quality of care. Co-production, as the concept of how to collaboratively create valuable healthcare service for the patient, offers a new perspective that might help. The scoping review aimed at identifying and analysing factors facilitating co-production between immigrant patients and healthcare professionals. METHODS We searched seven scientific databases for peer-reviewed publications of all study designs. Two reviewers independently screened the publications for eligibility and performed data extraction. Data were analysed by applying an inductive, interpretive approach for data synthesis. RESULTS Fifteen publications were included for analysis. We identified six factors hat facilitate co-production: 1) prioritizing co-production in the organization, 2) providing a safe environment that promotes trust and patience, 3) using a language the patient understands, 4) respecting the patient's knowledge and priorities, 5) improvising with knowledge and courage, and 6) engaging in self-reflection. CONCLUSIONS The scoping review illustrated that co-production with immigrant patients can be successful if the system and professionals are interested and prepared. Immigrant patients could be a valuable source of information and powerful co-producers of their own health. The study contributed to a growing body of research on patient-professional co-production in healthcare and might also prove relevant for other disadvantaged patient groups.","Radl-Karimi, Christina; Nicolaisen, Anne; Sodemann, Morten; Batalden, Paul; von Plessen, Christian",International journal of qualitative studies on health and well-being,https://doi.org/10.1080/17482631.2020.1838052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33112713/,284

METHODS we retrospectively identified 60 patients who had been evaluated for known or suspected BVM by both SWI and digital subtraction angiography, without intervening treatment, during a 3-year period. SWI images were retrospectively assessed by 2 independent reviewers for the presence of AVS as determined by the presence of signal hyperintensity within a venous structure in the vicinity of the BVM. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus among a panel of 3 neuroradiologists. Accuracy parameters of SWI for the detection of AVS were calculated using digital subtraction angiography as the reference standard. RESULTS a total of 80 BVM were identified in the 60 patients included in our study. Of the 29 BVM with AVS on digital subtraction angiography, 14 were untreated arteriovenous malformations, 10 were previously treated arteriovenous malformations, and 5 were untreated dural arteriovenous fistulas. Overall, SWI was 93% sensitive and 98% specific for the detection of AVS in BVM, with excellent interobserver agreement (κ=0.94). In the 14 previously treated arteriovenous malformations, SWI was 100% sensitive and specific for the detection of AVS. In the 28 BVM associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, SWI was 100% sensitive and 96% specific for the detection of AVS. CONCLUSIONS SWI is accurate for the detection of arteriovenous shunting in vascular malformations of the brain and, for some patients, SWI may offer a noninvasive alternative to angiography in screening for or follow-up of treated BVM.","Jagadeesan, Bharathi D; Delgado Almandoz, Josser E; Moran, Christopher J; Benzinger, Tammie L S",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.110.584862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21088245/,284

Whilst their value is undisputed, each tool is not without limitations. The COVID-19 pandemic has restricted access to VFSS and FEES leading clinicians to explore alternative or augmentative tools to support swallowing assessment.Ultrasound (US) is an established tool for visualisation of head and neck anatomy, including structures implicated in swallowing. Although US has been utilised in swallowing research for many years, its application has not translated into common clinical practice. This review presents and debates the evidence for and against use of US for clinical swallowing assessment. RECENT FINDINGS Evaluation of swallowing muscle morphometry and measurement of isolated swallowing kinematics are two primary uses of US in swallowing assessment that have been identified in the literature. Use of US to detect bolus flow, aspiration and residues is in its early stages and needs further research. SUMMARY US shows promise as an adjunctive modality to support assessment of swallowing. With standardisation, these measurements may have potential for transition into clinical care. Reliability and validity testing and development of normative data are imperative to ensure its use as an evidence-based instrumentation.","Allen, Jodi E; Clunie, Gemma M; Winiker, Katharina",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/moo.0000000000000708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741822/,284
162956,Genetic Circuits Combined with Machine Learning Provides Fast Responding Living Sensors,2020-10-29,"The main histocompatibility complex – HLA system (Human Leukocyte Antigens) is among the most important genetic factors determining response of humans to infectious agents. The key role that HLA molecules play in immune response is to present the pathogen-derived peptides. Enormous molecular variability of HLA alleles in human populations have attracted close attention and became the basis for numerous studies aimed at evaluating the role of HLA genotypes for individual features of immune response to COVID-19, the new infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 β-coronavirus. Many studies have focused on search of specific alleles associated with both susceptibility and resistance to this disease. Separate HLA patterns were reported already. These patterns may be either universal to several populations, or rather peculiar, since distribution of HLA genes is different for various populations, depending on the living conditions, including specific protection from environmental pathogens. Therefore, it is evident that individual effects of HLA genotype upon occurrence and course of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be performed in comparison with the HLA distribution among the residents of appropriate region. The objective of this study was to compare the distribution of HLA-A*, B*, DRB1* allele groups, and to analyze the frequencies of HLA-AB-DRB1 haplotypes in subjects with COVID-19 (n = 138), compared with the control group presented by residents of the North-Western Russia (n = 1456). The most significant differences between COVID-19 patients compared with a group from control population were revealed for the groups of HLA-A* alleles: the frequencies of HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*26 were significantly reduced (39.86% versus 51.72%, χ2 = 7,58, and 4.35% versus 9.07%, χ2 = 4.17, respectively). At the same time, the frequency of HLA-A*29 was increased more than 2-fold (5.80% versus 2.47%, χ2 = 4.03). This finding suggests that the allele groups A*02 and A*26 are associated with reduced likelihood of the disease, while A*29, is an apparent factor predisposing for susceptibility to the disease. It was found that occurrence of definite HLA haplotypes, including the A*02 allele group, is less common in persons who have undergone COVID-19, and are ranged at the 4th, 7th and 10th positions in frequency, while in the population control group such HLA haplotypes took the 3rd, 4th, 7th and 8th places. Further evaluation of the HLA gene polymorphism will allow to understand the predetermined immunogenetic basis for susceptibility, as well as clinical severity of COVID-19.","Bubnova, L.

Nevertheless, a central challenge in designing such personalized IoT applications arises from human variability. Such variability stems from the fact that different humans exhibit different behaviors when interacting with IoT applications (intra-human variability), the same human may change the behavior over time when interacting with the same IoT application (inter-human variability), and human behavior may be affected by the behaviors of other people in the same environment (multi-human variability). To that end, we propose FaiR-IoT, a general reinforcement learning-based framework for adaptive and fairness-aware human-in-the-loop IoT applications. In FaiR-IoT, three levels of reinforcement learning agents interact to continuously learn human preferences and maximize the system's performance and fairness while taking into account the intra-, inter-, and multi-human variability. We validate the proposed framework on two applications, namely (i) Human-in-the-Loop Automotive Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and (ii) Human-in-the-Loop Smart House. Results obtained on these two applications validate the generality of FaiR-IoT and its ability to provide a personalized experience while enhancing the system's performance by 40%-60% compared to non-personalized systems and enhancing the fairness of the multi-human systems by 1.5 orders of magnitude.","Elmalaki, Salma",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16033v1.pdf,284

Objective: The goal of this research was to investigate the degree of attitude, perception, and awareness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) and disease management among dental practitioners in Namakkal district - A prevalence study. Methods: Dental practitioner operating in Namakkal district private health center, nursing homes, and health-care organizations was included in the research population. An questionnaire survey was issued to a test group in May 2020. The participants answered a sequence of quiz about dental practitioner survey was, their deep understanding of latent period, disease symptoms, SARS-COV-2 spreading route, and disease prevention. Results: A total of 207 dental practitioner were included in this study (98 males and 109 females). While all respondents (100%) were aware of the PPE required in this situation, a small percentage (2.5%) did not prefer to use one. About 99.5% of them endorsed social isolation as a containment measure to avert this epidemic and correctly identified the age group in which the disease is most prevalent.

164266,Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for COVID-19,2021,"Last year the COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has started. The new coronavirus is highly contagious and causes severe complications. The mechanisms of humoral immunity and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in a population are not well understood. Therefore, we aimed to summarize and analyze numerous global and Russian serological studies for understanding dynamics of the SARSCoV-2 humoral immune response and getting an accurate picture of the seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 in the world population. The PubMed and e-library databases were searched from February 2020 to March 2021 using terms ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""antibodies"", ""humoral immunity"". At the beginning of the pandemic first studies were cross-sectional by design and were responsible for determination of the seropositivity and for understanding the fundamental humoral immunity parameters of SARS-CoV-2. Since then, longitudinal seroepidemiological studies have been studying antibody kinetics. Seroconversion time for IgM, IgG antibodies varies, but most researchers report the seroconversion of IgM from the 1stto 14thdays after the onset of clinical manifestations, and the seroconversion for IgG is around the 14thday with a concentration peak by the 21stday. Regarding seroprevalence we may say about low herd immunity at the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, global seroprevalence is about 10 %, and more than 20 % for regions with high incidence and among healthcare workers. Seroprevalence studies have to be continued for more accurate monitoring of long-term humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2, because the majority of the world's population is still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2021 Sovero Press Publishing House.

Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains standard of care for these patients and achieving a clinical response pre-ASCT predicts favorable outcomes. Pre-ASCT salvage chemotherapy combinations with BV have been explored in this setting. Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of BV and chemotherapy in heavily pretreated R/R HL patients eligible for ASCT. Methods:We reviewed the clinical characteristics, treatment, response, safety, and survival of 21 heavily pretreated R/R HL patients in 2 Peruvian institutions between June 2018 and February 2020. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results:A total of 21 patients (15 (71%) refractory and 6 (29%) relapsed) were included. The median age was 31 years (range, 19-55), 13 (62%) patients were female. The median of previous treatment lines was 3 (range, 1-4). Patients received BV plus chemotherapy (CT) on day 1: Dexamethasone, Cytarabine and Cisplatin (DHAP) (43%), Gemcitabine-based CT (33%), Ifosfamide, Carboplatin and Etoposide (ICE) (14%), and other CT (ESHAP, Bendamustine) (10%). After a median of 3 cycles of combination therapy (range, 2-7), the objective response rate was 81 %, with 8 (38%) patients achieving CR. 10 (48%) patients had successful peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection. 7 (33%) patients underwent ASCT, the remaining responding patients had a delay in either collection or ASCT due to COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant adverse events were thrombocytopenia (69%) (G3-4: 53%), neutropenia (47%) (G3-4: 28%), infections (37%), febrile neutropenia (33%) and G1-2 peripheral neuropathy (16%). The Progression Free-Survival (PFS) at 1 year was 86% in ASCT patients. Conclusion:The combination of Brentuximab and chemotherapy is active as a bridge for ASCT in heavily pretreated R/R HL patients. The CR rates were lower than previously reported and it could be related with the number of previous lines of treatment received;there was also a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in our cohort. We could hypothesize that the combination of Brentuximab and chemotherapy provides greater benefit if it is administered earlier in patients with R/R HL.

Analysis of the situation is particularly needed in Nigeria, the country with by far the largest share of the burden, where approximately a quarter of all cases in the world are estimated to occur. Methods We analysed data from three nationwide surveys (Malaria Indicator Surveys in 2010 and 2015, and a National Demographic and Health Survey in 2018), with malaria parasite prevalence in children under five years of age determined by sampling from all 36 states of Nigeria, and blood slide microscopy performed in the same accredited laboratory for all samples. Changes over time were evaluated by calculating prevalence ratio (PR) values with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each state, together with Mantel-Haenszel adjusted prevalence ratios (PRadj) for each of the six major geopolitical zones of the country. Results Between 2010 and 2018 there were significant reductions in parasite prevalence in 25 states, but not in the remaining 11 states. Prevalence decreased most in southern zones of the country (South West PRadj = 0.53; South East PRadj = 0.59; South South PRadj = 0.51) and the North Central zone (PRadj = 0.36). Changes in the north were less marked, but were significant and indicated overall reductions by more than 20% (North West PRadj = 0.74; North East PRadj = 0.76). Changes in the south occurred mostly between 2010 and 2015, whereas those in the north were more gradual and most continued after 2015.

165490,Capacity Control in Indoor Spaces Using Machine Learning Techniques Together with BLE Technology,2021,"Background: Emerging observational data have shown that rheumatic patients seem not to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection neither to worse outcomes. However, the true prevalence of COVID19 is still unknown due to the high proportion of subclinical infection. In this scenario, measuring the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 may be crucial to improve the knowledge about the impact of COVID19 in rheumatic patients. Objectives: To estimate in a COVID19 high-endemic area (Lombardy, Italy) the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a large cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or spondyloarthritis (SpA) treated with biologic (b-) or targeted synthetic (ts-) disease modifying drugs (DMARDs). Methods: A seroprevalence cross-sectional study was conducted in the period between 4th May and 16th June 2020, including patients with confirmed RA or SpA treated with b-or tsDMARDs. Patients were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies against main viral antigens (nucleoprotein [N], spike 1 [S1], receptor-binding domain [RBD]) using ELISA. These data were compared with those observed in the healthy population in the same period and region. Patients also answered a questionnaire on history of symptoms consistent with COVID19, risk factors and comorbidities. Serological response to RBD was evaluated according to symptom severity (asymptomatic, minor, or major [respiratory and fever >37.5°C] symptoms). Results: The study population included 300 patients (62% females, mean age 53 years, 20% over 65 years old) diagnosed with RA (56%), psoriatic arthritis (23%), or ankylosing spondylitis (21%), treated with anti-TNF (57%), abatacept (20%), anti-IL6 (11%), or JAK inhibitors (5%). Four patients (1.3%) referred a prior diagnosis of COVID19 defined by nasopharyngeal swab. Immunoglobulin titers were evaluated resulting in 9%, 13.6%, and 13.3% positive patients for IgG, IgM and IgA, respectively (Table 1), with no significant difference to the healthy population. Among seropositive patients, 55.3% were asymptomatic, 16% had minor and 19.6% major symptoms, 7.1% were hospitalized. No deaths or admission to intensive care units occurred. IgM, IgG and IgA titers to RBD were higher in patients with both minor and major symptoms compared with asymptomatic ones (Figure 1). No differences were found between seronegative and seropositive patients in relation to age, sex, rheumatic diagnosis, and treatments with b-or tsDMARDs. A relative lower risk of seropositivity was observed in patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.94;p 0.04), while an increased risk was associated with obesity (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.26-3.79;p 0.019) and presence of at least 2 comorbidities (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.11-3.15;p 0.037). Corticosteroids use was numerically more frequent in seropositive than seronegative patients (18% vs 14%). Conclusion: This study confirms that, even in a cohort of rheumatic patients, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection is much greater than that observed by capturing only swab-diagnosed COVID19 cases. The underlying rheumatic disease and ongoing therapy with b/ts-DMARDs do not seem to impact SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity, which conversely seems to be proportional to the intensity of COVID19 symptoms and less frequent in patients receiving concomitant methotrexate.

165644,Deep-learning Based Approach to Identify Covid-19,2021,"In 2019, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began infecting humans, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic. While the push for development of vaccines has yielded some positive results, the emergence of additional variants has led to concerns surrounding sustained vaccine effectiveness as the variants become the dominant strains. This work was undertaken to develop peptide-based antivirals capable of targeting both the wildtype (WT) heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain of SARS-CoV-2 and the new HR1 variants which have developed. In silico protein mutagenesis, structural characterization, and protein–protein molecular docking were utilized to determine molecular interactions which facilitated binding of peptide-based antivirals targeting the HR1 domains. Molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to predict the final binding affinities of the top five peptide inhibitors designed. This work demonstrated the importance of hydrophobic interactions in the hydrophobic gorge and in the rim of the HR1 domain. Additionally, the placement of charged residues was shown to be essential in maximizing electrostatic interactions. The top five designed peptide inhibitors were all demonstrated to maintain good binding affinity to the WT and the variant HR1 SARS-CoV-2 domains. Therefore, the peptide inhibitors designed in this work could serve as potent antivirals which are effective in targeting both the original SARS-CoV-2 and the HR1 variants that have developed.","Stoddard, Shana V.; Wallace, Felissa E.; Stoddard, Serena D.; Cheng, Qianyi Acosta Daniel Barzani Shaliz Bobay Marissa Briant Jared Cisneros Christian Feinstein Samantha Glasper Kelsey Hussain Munazza Lidoski Abigail Lingareddy Pranay Lovett Grace Matherne Leslie McIntosh Jackson Moosani Nikita Nagge Lia Nyamkondiwa Kudzai Pratt Isaiah Root Emma Rutledge Mary Rose Sawyer Mackenzie Singh Yash Smith Kristiana Tanveer Ubaid Vaghela Sona",Biophysica,https://doi.org/10.3390/biophysica1030023,284

This article shows how, from the reuse of an agro-industrial waste such as corn husks, a biomaterial can be developed that manages to standardize the properties of materials such as paper and cardboard, thus allowing the development of single-use products that replace the excessive expense of materials such as polymers. In this article, it will be possible to show how from the process of transforming an agro-industrial waste into a raw material base, it is possible not only to reduce the number of raw materials discarded but also to redesign a product that not only contributes to the environmental component but also facilitates the processes of economic sustainability when generating products. As a practical case, a comparison is made between traditional fast-food packaging and how from these, a new packaging proposal can be generated, which starts from the principles of circular economy and complements sustainable design processes to make more efficient manufacturing of the mentioned product.","Hernán Darío Castaño, Castrillón Gutiérrez Aguilar Carlos Mario Beatriz Elena Angel Álvarez",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158356,284

167011,Re-Start Italy: (post-)Covid19 Lessons for Full Scope Renovation of the Italian Public Space,2021,"The rapid spread of COVID-19 prompted many to take precautions to control the transmission of the virus. The most crucial of these is face coverings, such as face masks, as the virus is an airborne pathogen capable of transmission via respiratory droplets. While there are developments in smart mask technologies, they only provide passive protection through filtration and internal decontamination against the virus. This paper describes a new approach to smart mask technology that actively monitors for airborne pathogens using a PM sensor and reduces the wearer's exposure to them by an active mitigation strategy. This strategy involves using a mist spray to increase the pathogen's particle size, which reduces their ability to linger in the air. This system can be controlled wirelessly via a mobile application, which also displays the monitoring data. Deployment areas of this smart mask include classrooms, hospitals, and workspaces. Our experimental results demonstrate that increasing droplet sizes reduces the settling time for pathogens. Our future work includes a more precise detection of pathogens and improvements in deploying mitigation using fine-grained analysis about the aerosol and artificial intelligence. © 2021 IEEE.","Masna, N.

Moreover, the attitudes towards joining have seemingly not correlated with either the level of economic development or the time spent as part of the EU, nor with any other rational reason such as the level of integration into the EU real economy, or the level of trust in the EU on the part of the public. Therefore, at first sight, the answer to the question 'why in, why out?' remains rather unclear. The attractiveness of the currency union has nevertheless not disappeared for the CEE countries. Despite the Eurozone crisis of 2010-13, it was during that time that the Baltic states introduced the euro. Then, after a few years of inactivity, Croatia and Bulgaria successfully applied for membership of the exchange rate mechanism in July 2020, amid the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

168058,A New Malware Classification Framework Based on Deep Learning Algorithms,2021,"Background Management of concussion remains a serious issue for professional sports, particularly with the growing knowledge on the consequences of repetitive concussion. One primary concern is the subjective assessment of recovery that dictates the time until a concussed athlete is returned to competition. In response to this concern, the Australian Football League (AFL) changed its policy in 2020 such that clearance for return-to-play was extended from one day, to a minimum of five days, prior to the next scheduled match. Objective We sought to examine the impact of the AFL policy change by asking whether the time to return-to-play after concussion was increased in the 2020 season relative to previous years. Methods Retrospective data on injury and return-to-play were sourced from publicly available tables published on the AFL website. We compared the number of matches missed and the number of days missed in concussed players across 2017 to 2020 inclusive. Results Analysis of data from 166 concussed players revealed no increase in the number of matches missed in 2020 relative to previous years as would have been expected from an extend recovery protocol. Considering the number of days missed in 2020 relative to 2017-19 we found, paradoxically, that there was an overall reduction in the average time to return-to-play in 2020 (11.2 vs 16.2 days). Conclusion This study demonstrates that any policy change around concussion management requires ongoing auditing to ensure clearance meets policy objectives and highlights the need for objective measures for return-to-play after concussion.","Pearce, A.

To investigate the initial introductions and transmissions of the SARS-CoV-2 in the country, we performed the largest genomic epidemiology study of COVID-19 in Pakistan and generated 150 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from samples collected before June 1, 2020. We identified a total of 347 variants, 29 of which were over-represented in Pakistan. Meanwhile, we found over one thousand intra-host single-nucleotide variants. Several of them occurred concurrently, indicating possible interactions among them. Some of the hypermutable positions were not observed in the polymorphism data, suggesting strong purifying selections. The genomic epidemiology revealed five distinctive spreading clusters. The largest cluster consisted of 74 viruses which were derived from different geographic locations and formed a deep hierarchical structure, indicating an extensive and persistent nation-wide transmission of the virus that was probably contributed by a signature mutation of this cluster. Twenty-eight putative international introductions were identified, several of which were consistent with the epidemiological investigations. No progenies of any of these 150 viruses have been found outside of Pakistan, most likely due to the nonphmarcological intervention to control the virus. This study has inferred the introductions and transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan, which could provide a guidance for an effective strategy for disease control.","Song, S.; Li, C.; Kang, L.; Tian, D.; Badar, N.; Ma, W.; Zhao, S.; Jiang, X.; Wang, C.; Sun, Y.; Li, W.; Lei, M.; Li, S.; Qi, Q.; Ikram, A.; Salman, M.; Umair, M.; Shireen, H.; Batool, F.; Zhang, B.; Chen, H.; Yang, Y.; Abbasi, A.

169360,COVID-19 detection from lung CT-scan images using transfer learning approach,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving, with emerging variants and fluctuating control policies. Real-time population screening and identification of groups in whom positivity is highest could help monitor spread and inform public health messaging and strategy. Methods: To develop a real-time screening process, we included results from nose and throat swabs and questionnaires taken 19 July 2020-17 July 2021 in the UK's national COVID-19 Infection Survey. Fortnightly, associations between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and 60 demographic and behavioural characteristics were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders, considering multiple testing, collinearity, and reverse causality. Findings: Of 4,091,537 RT-PCR results from 482,677 individuals, 29,903 (0.73%) were positive. As positivity rose September-November 2020, rates were independently higher in younger ages, and those living in Northern England, major urban conurbations, more deprived areas, and larger households. Rates were also higher in those returning from abroad, and working in healthcare or outside of home. When positivity peaked December 2020-January 2021 (Alpha), high positivity shifted to southern geographical regions. With national vaccine roll-out from December 2020, positivity reduced in vaccinated individuals. Associations attenuated as rates decreased between February-May 2021. Rising positivity rates in June-July 2021 (Delta) were independently higher in younger, male, and unvaccinated groups. Few factors were consistently associated with positivity. 25/45 (56%) confirmed associations would have been detected later using 28-day rather than 14-day periods. Interpretation: Population-level demographic and behavioural surveillance can be a valuable tool in identifying the varying characteristics driving current SARS-CoV-2 positivity, allowing monitoring to inform public health policy.

The purpose of the study is to determine the influence of socio-demographic factors (gender, age, year of study, the direction of professional training at university, combining study and work, living in a rural area or a city, in a private house or an apartment, with parents or independently) in conditions of self-isolation on assessment of the main components of the psycho-emotional state of the students: well-being, activity, and mood. We used the method of rapid well-being, activity, and mood assessment. The test was conducted online;the relevant materials were posted on eCampus of North Caucasus Federal University educational portal. The research results analysis was based on Kruskal Wallice H-test, the primary frequency analysis, analysis of average scale values and standard deviations for the comparison groups. The study was conducted from 13 of April to 22 of May 2020, and involved 1,173 students aged 17 to 36 years, enrolled in 1-5 years. The study suggests that the psycho-emotional state of students in the self-isolation period depends on their age: the younger the students are, the more likely they are to experience fatigue and decline in well-being, activity, mood. The study provided new data on the features of integrated assessments of students' well-being, activity, and mood in conditions of forced self-isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Belasheva, I.

Models have guided health policy for epidemics including COVID- 19 and Ebola and endemic diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Yet a single coding bug may bias results, leading to incorrect conclusions and wrong actions that could cause avoidable harm. We are ethically obliged to ensure our code is as free of error as possible. Unit testing is a coding method to avoid such bugs, but unit testing is rarely used in epidemiology. We demonstrate through simple examples how unit testing can handle the particular quirks of infectious disease models.","Lucas, T. C.; Pollington, T. M.; Davis, E. L.; Hollingsworth, T.

In this context, using a combination of AutoDock Vina and fast pulling of ligand simulations, eleven marine fungi compounds were identified that probably play as highly potent inhibitors for preventing viral replication. In particular, four compounds includingM15(3-O-(6-O-α-l-arabinopyranosyl)-β-d-glucopyranosyl-1,4-dimethoxyxanthone),M8(wailupemycins H),M11(cottoquinazolines B), andM9(wailupemycins I) adopted the predicted ligand-binding free energy of −9.87, −9.82, −9.62, and −9.35 kcal mol−1, respectively, whereas the other adopted predicted ligand-binding free energies in the range from −8.54 to −8.94 kcal mol−1. The results were obtained using a combination of Vina and FPL simulations. Notably, although, AutoDock4 adopted higher accurate results in comparison with Vina, Vina is proven to be a more suitable technique for rapidly screening ligand-binding affinity with a large database of compounds since it requires much smaller computing resources. Furthermore, FPL is better than Vina to classify inhibitors upon ROC-AUC analysis. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.","Tam, N. M.; Pham, M. Q.; Nguyen, H. T.; Hong, N. D.; Hien, N. K.; Quang, D.

171448,Poverty Classification Using Machine Learning: The Case of Jordan,2021,"Despite the recommendation for genetic assessment for all women with ovarian cancer, the limited available data suggest significant disparities in referral and uptake of genetic services in minority populations. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated many existing health care disparities, making it even more critical that inequalities be identified and addressed. We sought to evaluate differences in genetic counseling and genetic testing among women with ovarian cancer based on race and insurance status. A complete systematic search of online databases (PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library) for studies reporting on genetic testing in ovarian cancer without date restriction was performed. Random effects pooled proportions were calculated using the logit transformation and 95% confidence intervals for individual study proportions were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method. The comprehensive search produced 3026 studies, among which 38 met inclusion criteria. Eight studies included analysis by self-reported race/ethnicity and 6 included analysis by insurance status. Among studies listing mean age of diagnosis, stage, and histology data, the median of the mean age of diagnoses across the studies was 63.3 years. The median proportion of patients with early stage (I/II) ovarian cancer was 14.7%, late stage (III/IV) 68.6%, and unknown stage 9.3%. The median proportion of patients with serous histology was 81.8%, endometrioid 12.6%, mucinous 5%, clear cell 5.8%, mixed 3.7%, carcinosarcoma 3%, and other/unknown histology 81.8%. Among 7,862 patients, 6,469 reported being White, 599 Black, and 794 Asian. Random-effects pooled proportions by race/ethnicity to follow: Among White patients, 43% [CI 26-62%] were referred for genetic counseling and 40% [CI 25-57%] completed testing, and for Black patients, 24% [CI 13-42%] were referred for counseling and 26% [CI 17-38%] completed testing. For Asian patients, 23% [CI 2-83%] were referred for counseling and 14% [CI 2-51%] completed testing, although only two studies included referral and testing proportions in Asian patients, with the majority of patient data coming from one study with referral proportion of 39% and another study with testing proportion of 31%. Among 7,681 patients, 5,320 (69%) had private insurance, 2,078 (27%) had Medicare/Medicaid, and 283 (4%) were uninsured. Random-effects pooled proportions by insurance status to follow: Among patients with private insurance, 39% [CI 26-54%] were referred for genetic counseling and 47% [CI 30-64%] completed testing. Among patients with Medicare/Medicaid, 27% [CI 18-38%] were referred for counseling and 26% [CI 16-40%] completed testing, and among uninsured patients, 24% [CI 13-41%] were referred for counseling and 23% [CI 18-28%] completed testing. Small sample and high study heterogeneity observed in the race and insurance data resulted in large confidence intervals in the pooled proportions of interest. Rates of genetic counseling and genetic testing are below national guidelines for all women with ovarian cancer. Our systematic review of the existing literature on this topic suggests that minority women and patients without private insurance may be disproportionally affected by lower referral rates and more limited access to genetic testing. This disparity is concerning as it can have significant impact on the health of the affected patient and her at-risk relatives.

172027,Virtual Reality in Italian Museums: A Brief Discussion,2021,"Background: Despite the clear risks of tobacco use, millions of people continue to smoke. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly called e-cigarettes, have been proposed as a substitute for those who are unwilling or unable to quit. Current systematic and narrative reviews on the health effects of ENDS use, respiratory and cardiovascular effects in particular, have come to differing conclusions. Objective: The purpose of our two systematic reviews is to critically assess and synthesize the available human studies on the respiratory and cardiovascular health effects of ENDS substitution for people who smoke. The primary goal is to provide clinicians with evidence on the health effects of ENDS substitution to inform their treatment recommendations and plans. The twin goal is to promote the health literacy of ENDS users with facts on the health effects of ENDS. A secondary goal is to develop policy briefs to provide governmental bodies with a preliminary assessment of the potential public health impacts of ENDS. Methods: These two reviews will be living systematic reviews. The systematic reviews will be initiated with a baseline review. Studies will be evaluated with the JBI quality assessment tools and a checklist of biases drawn from the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine Catalogue of Bias. A narrative synthesis is planned due to the heterogeneity of data. A search for recently published studies will be conducted every three months, and an updated review published every six months for the duration of the project or possibly longer. Results: The baseline and updated reviews will be published in a peer review journal. The review findings will be reported in a white paper for clinicians, a fact sheet for people who use ENDS, and country-specific policy briefs. Conclusions: The substitution of ENDS for cigarettes is one of the ways to potentially reduce the risks of smoking. Clinicians and their patients need to understand the potential benefits and possible risks of substituting ENDS for cigarettes. Our living systematic reviews seek to highlight the best and most up-to-date evidence in this highly contentious and fast-moving field of research.","O'Leary, R.; Qureshi, M.; La Rosa, G. R.

Besides, there are numerous questions about the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin C in various human (infectious) diseases, as well as its immune system function and antiviral potential. The fact that vitamin C can act as a reductant (antioxidant) and a prooxidant further emphasizes its oxidation-reduction (redox) potential in real physiological conditions. Today, the question of the intravenous administration of vitamin C effect in patients with SARS-CoV-2 requires special attention. This review aims to showcase known facts about vitamin C and its mechanisms of action to better understand the current new challenges related to vitamin C.","Zakic, T.; Budnar, M.; Kalezic, A.; Korac, A.; Jankovic, A.; Korac, B.",Hrana i Ishrana,https://doi.org/10.5937/hraish2002059z,284
172238,Discovery of cardiac imaging biomarkers by training neural network models across diagnostic modalities,2021-02-08,"The signal peptidase complex (SPC) is an essential membrane complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it removes signal peptides (SPs) from a large variety of secretory pre-proteins with exquisite specificity. Although the determinants of this process have been established empirically, the molecular details of SP recognition and removal remain elusive. Here, we show that the human SPC exists in two functional paralogs with distinct proteolytic subunits. We determined the atomic structures of both paralogs using electron cryo-microscopy and structural proteomics. The active site is formed by a catalytic triad and abuts the ER membrane, where a transmembrane window collectively formed by all subunits locally thins the bilayer. This unique architecture generates specificity for thousands of SPs based on the length of their hydrophobic segments.","Liaci, A.

172362,Introduction: Strategies for How Men can Advance Gender Equity in Political Science,2021,"Video chat may allow young children and grandparents to develop and maintain bonds when they are physically separated because it enables them to share experiences with each other in real time. We used an ecological model framework to examine factors associated with the development of the grandparent-grandchild relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many families were experiencing reduced opportunities for in-person interaction. We analyzed survey data from grandparents (N = 855) and parents (N = 846) of children ages 0-5 years. Predictor variables included participant characteristics (age and education level), proximity variables (geographical distance and whether grandparents had met their grandchildren in person), as well as video chat-specific factors (e.g., frequency of video chats, activities used during video chats). The frequency of video chat and the variety of behaviors engaged in during the video chats predicted grandparents' feelings of closeness to their grandchild as well as grandparents' and parents' enjoyment of family video chats. These predictors were statistically significant after controlling for participant characteristics and physical proximity, suggesting that when families are separated (e.g., due to pandemics, deployment, geographic distance, etc.) family video chats may help to build and maintain grandparent-grandchild connections in an enjoyable way. One future implication is that family video chat may introduce children to the connection between screen and world, a supportive first step in understanding and using technology.

172555,How tech-savvy organizations are outperforming their peers during the pandemic,2021,"BackgroundFractures associated with skin wounds are termed open fractures. The British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma guidelines on open fractures recommends photographing the patient’s wound prior to application of a temporary dressing. Access to these images prevents the need for clinicians to uncover and re-examine wounds which reduces the risk of infection.ProblemA retrospective audit revealed only 10% of open fracture patients’ records contained a wound photograph at our hospital. This was attributed to technical difficulties with existing hospital camera software applications and patient confidentiality issues preventing use of personal mobile devices.AimsWe aimed to develop a new process to improve compliance to wound photography in open fracture patients.Methods and resultsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft Teams became available for PC and mobile devices in our trust. A channel was set up in this software enabling secure sharing of photographs across devices. Photographs could be captured using a mobile phone without the image being saved on the device and then accessed through the PC software application. Images could then be transferred to patients’ electronic records and stored. A photography consent form was developed and stored using the same method. Details of this intervention were circulated via departmental and induction meetings. Our work demonstrates leadership qualities through setting a new direction to securely photograph and store images to improve patient care. Our management skills are demonstrated through organisation and administration of the channel. We are on Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle 1 and will shortly commence evaluation of our intervention.ConclusionsWe anticipate our intervention will gradually improve wound photography compliance in open fracture patients following continued PDSA cycles. Our devised photography process can be applied for other clinical indications within various specialities.","Farhan-Alanie, Muhamed M.; Mackay, Nicola D.; Ward, Jayne King Richard",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.171,284
172682,Review of Systems Engineering (SE) Methods and Their Application to Wave Energy Technology Development,2020,"Background Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symptoms such as progressive cerebellar ataxia and cognitive decline. The modified amino acid N-acetyl-leucine has been associated with positive symptomatic and neuroprotective, disease-modifying effects in observational case studies and animal and cellular models of NPC. Therefore, the effects of the active L-enantiomer, N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL, Sponsor Code IB1001) were evaluated in pediatric and adult patients with NPC. Methods We conducted a 9-center, multinational, open-label, rater-blinded Phase 2 study to assess the safety and efficacy of NALL for the treatment of pediatric (6 years and older) and adult patients with NPC (IB1001-201 clinical trial). Eligible patients were assessed during three study phases: a baseline period (with or without a study run-in), a 6-week treatment period (dosage of NALL 4 g/d in patients aged 13 years and older; weight tiered doses for patients aged 6-12 years based on approximately 0.1 g/kg/day), and a 6-week post-treatment washout period. The primary outcome was based on the Clinical Impression of Change in Severity (CI-CS) assessment (assessed on a 7-point Likert scale) performed by blinded, centralized raters who compared videos of patients performing a pre-defined primary anchor test - either the 8-Meter Walk Test (8MWT) or 9-Hole Peg Test of the Dominant Hand (9HPT-D) - at different study periods. Secondary outcomes included the cerebellar function evaluations, namely the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), the Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index (SCAFI), and the Clinical Global Impression Scales (CGI) as well as the EuroQol-5D/VAS. Results Thirty-three subjects aged 7 to 64 years with a confirmed diagnosis of NPC were enrolled according to the trial protocol between 04 September 2019 and 30 January 2020. Thirty-two patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. IB1001 met its CI-CS primary endpoint (mean difference 0.86 ((90% CI 0.25,1.75, p=0.029). IB1001 also met secondary endpoints, including improvement during treatment on the SARA scale (mean difference -1.19, 90% CI -1.8, -0.5, p=0.001), investigators CGI-C assessment (mean difference from baseline to the end of treatment 0.6, 90% CI 0.5, 1.0, p<0.001), clinically worsening over the washout period on the SARA (mean difference 1.45, 90% CI 0.5, 2.0, p=0.002) and investigators CGI-C assessment (washout mean difference -0.5, 90% CI -1.0, 0.0, p=0.006). IB1001 was well-tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse reactions occurring. Conclusions Consistent with its pharmacological action, IB1001 rapidly improved symptoms, functioning, and quality of life in 6-weeks, the clinical effect of which was lost after the 6-week, post-treatment washout period. High consistency and statistical significance between the primary and secondary endpoints demonstrate a clear, clinically meaningful improvement with IB1001. IB1001 was well-tolerated and no drug-related serious adverse events were reported, demonstrating a favorable risk/benefit profile for the treatment of NPC (Funded by IntraBio; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03759639; EudraCT number 2018-004331-71).","Bremova-Ertl, T.; Claassen, J.; Foltan, T.; Gascon-Bayarri, J.; Gissen, P.; Hahn, A.; Hassan, A.; Hennig, A.; Jones, S.; Kolnikova, M.; Martakis, K.; Ramaswami, U.; Sharma, R.; Schneider, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248704v1?rss=1,284
172700,Virtual Reality Integrated Multi-Depth-Camera-System for Real-Time Telepresence and Telemanipulation in Caregiving,2020,"Background Age, sex, race and comorbidities are insufficient to explain why some individuals remain asymptomatic after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while others die. In this sense, the increased risk caused by the long-term exposure to air pollution is being investigated to understand the high heterogeneity of the COVID-19 infection course. Objectives We aimed to assess the underlying effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM10 on the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted with 2112 patients suffering COVID-19 infection. We built two sets of multivariate predictive models to assess the relationship between the long-term exposure to NO2 and PM10 and COVID-19 outcome. First, the probability of either death or severe COVID-19 outcome was predicted as a function of all the clinical variables together with the pollutants exposure by means of two regularized logistic regressions. Subsequently, two regularized linear regressions were constructed to predict the percentage of dead or severe patients. Finally, odds ratios and effects estimates were calculated. Results We found that the long-term exposure to PM10 is a more important variable than some already stated comorbidities (i.e.: COPD/Asthma, diabetes, obesity) in the prediction of COVID-19 severity and mortality. PM10 showed the highest effects estimates (1.65, 95% CI 1.32-2.06) on COVID-19 severity. For mortality, the highest effect estimates corresponded to age (3.59, 95% CI 2.94-4.40), followed by PM10 (2.37, 95% CI 1.71-3.32). Finally, an increase of 1 µg/m3 in PM10 concentration causes an increase of 3.06% (95% CI 1.11%-4.25%) of patients suffering COVID-19 as a severe disease and an increase of 2.68% (95% CI 0.53%-5.58%) of deaths. Discussion These results demonstrate that long-term PM10 burdens above WHO guidelines exacerbate COVID-19 health outcomes. Hence, WHO guidelines, the air quality standard established by the Directive 2008/50/EU, and that of the US-EPA should be updated accordingly to protect human health.","Marques, Montse; Correig, Eudald; Ibarretxe, Daiana; Anoro, Eva; Antonio Arroyo, Juan; Jerico, Carlos; Borrallo, Rosa M.; Miret, Marcel la; Naf, Silvia; Pardo, Anna; Perea, Veronica; Perez-Bernalte, Rosa; Ramirez-Montesinos, Rafael; Royuela, Meritxell; Soler, Cristina; Urquizu-Padilla, Maria; Zamora, Alberto; Pedro-Botet, Juan; Masana, Lluis; Domingo, Jose L.",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412021005559; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412021005559?v=s5,284

To promote high-quality science communication, we participated in a local science festival, both providing information about the brain and ASD and asking passersby questions about their knowledge of ASD. We then asked the booth staffers to evaluate the program and conducted qualitative analyses of public and staffer responses. Public responses to the question “what would you like to know about autism?” most often concerned how the disorder was diagnosed or defined. In contrast, public responses to the question “what would you like others to know about autism?” centered around educating those unaffected by ASD on how to improve interactions and awareness, mentioning inclusivity and intersectionality, and dispelling negative stereotypes. The staffers overwhelmingly reported that in future years, they would include even more science and allow for more in-depth conversations with interested parties, as well as bringing materials in other languages. These responses are in keeping with a trend for more inclusive science communication, particularly in the field of behavioral health and ASD, and a desire to challenge myths around the condition. We conclude that our science festival interactions brought multiple benefits to public and staff.","Gunter, Chris; Sinha, Cynthia B; Jaquess, David",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.425324,284
173391,Residual Learning Diagnosis Detection: An Advanced Residual Learning Diagnosis Detection System for COVID-19 in Industrial Internet of Things,2021,"Face masks have been proven to be medicine’s best public health tool for preventing transmission of airborne pathogens. However, in situations with continuous exposure, lower quality and “do-it-yourself” face masks cannot provide adequate protection against pathogens, especially when mishandled. In addition, the use of multiple face masks each day places a strain on personal protective equipment (PPE) supply and is not environmentally sustainable. Therefore, there is a significant clinical and commercial need for a reusable, pathogen-inactivating face mask. Herein, we propose adding quaternary poly(dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate), q(PDMAHDM), abbreviated to q(PDM), to existing fabric networks to generate “contact-killing” face masks – effectively turning cotton, polypropylene, and polyester into pathogen resistant materials. It was found that q(PDM)-integrated face masks were able to inactivate both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in liquid culture and aerosolized droplets. Furthermore, q(PDM) was electrospun into homogeneous polymer fibers, which makes the polymer practical for low-cost, scaled-up production.

This research aims to identify the techniques that used in harvesting community teak forests. The techniques used in each harvesting process, including felling, skidding, and timber transportation processes were analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis. The results showed that the technique used in the wood harvesting process was a semi-mechanical technique that combined the use of manual and mechanical equipment. Manual equipment is widely used in the felling and skidding process, while mechanical equipment is used in the felling and transportation processes. The felling is carried out to cut down the tree, which is then carried out by dividing the stems into parts that are suitable for skidding. Mechanical equipment in felling using chainsaws in the felling process and for the stems. Furthermore, in the branch cleaning process using manual equipment in the form of machetes. Felling is carried out by one operator by observing four basic steps in felling including determining the direction of felling, making the felling notch and the back cut. Furthermore, the pilgrimage process is carried out using manual equipment by means of a shoulder, using an ARTCO cart, horse, and dompeng. The method used in the skidding process at the research location is still manual with several considerations including;field conditions, such as unavailability of road access to the felling site and scattered locations, volume of timber to be skidded, and relatively low cost. In the final process of harvesting, the transport of skidded wood to the industry is carried out by mechanical engineering using a rented truck based on the number of trips with a maximum load volume of four m3 per trip.","Mujetahid, A.; Gautama, I.; Dalya, N.",IOP Conference Series.

The fake news campaign that accompanied public communications during the pandemic was named, by the Worls Health Organization (2020), infodemic, considering that its purpose was to generate panic and create social and economic problems, which would seriously overcome the initial public health problem - namely that of the pandemic -, to destabilize both states and global alliances. From an ethical point of view, we must notice the negative impact of infodemic, both on public health and on humanity in general;this can lead to deviations from democracy and human rights and, ultimately, to the dehumanization of society through the emphasis on social anxiety and the exacerbation of desocializing fears, which increase social distancing far beyond the limit of the physical distancing necessary to combat the pandemic.

Magnetic susceptibility exhibits a pronounced antiferromagnetic transition at $T_{\text{N}}$ $\approx$ 25K, a weaker anomaly at $T_{\text{S}}$ $\approx$ 142K, and strong magnetic anisotropy at all temperatures. Resonant elastic x-ray scattering experiments reveal a second order structural phase transition at $T_{\text{S}}$ and a magnetic transition at $T_{\text{N}}$. Both structural and magnetic superlattice peaks are observed at $L$ = half integer values. The magnetization anomaly at $T_{\text{S}}$ implies the presence of magneto-elastic coupling, which conceivably facilitates the symmetry lowering. Mean field critical scattering is observed above $T_{\text{S}}$. The magnetic structure of the antiferromagnetic ground state is discussed based on the measured magnetic superlattice peak intensity.

In this paper we present a long-term, multi-face tracking architecture conceived for working in crowded contexts where faces are often the only visible part of a person. Our system benefits from advances in the fields of face detection and face recognition to achieve long-term tracking, and is particularly unconstrained to the motion and occlusions of people. It follows a tracking-by-detection approach, combining a fast short-term visual tracker with a novel online tracklet reconnection strategy grounded on rank-based face verification. The proposed rank-based constraint favours higher inter-class distance among tracklets, and reduces the propagation of errors due to wrong reconnections. Additionally, a correction module is included to correct past assignments with no extra computational cost. We present a series of experiments introducing novel specialized metrics for the evaluation of long-term tracking capabilities, and publicly release a video dataset with 10 manually annotated videos and a total length of 8' 54"". Our findings validate the robustness of each of the proposed modules, and demonstrate that, in these challenging contexts, our approach yields up to 50% longer tracks than state-of-the-art deep learning trackers.","Barquero, Germ'an; Hupont, Isabelle; Fern'andez, Carles",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13273v1.pdf,284

176188,On Representation Learning for Scientific News Articles Using Heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs,2021-04-12,"Purpose Although there have been considerable discussions on the business value of adopting blockchain in supply chains, it is unclear whether such blockchain-enabled supply chains (BESCs) can help firms mitigate the negative impact resulting from the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to answer this important question. Design/methodology/approach The authors conduct an event study to quantify the financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and compare the differences in such effects between treatment firms that have adopted BESCs and matched control firms that have not adopted BESCs. The authors also perform a regression analysis to examine how the role of BESCs in mitigating COVID-19's negative impact varies across firms with different levels of supply chain leanness and complexity. The analysis is based on 88 treatment firms and 88 matched control firms, all of which are publicly listed on the US stock markets. Findings The test results suggest that although both the treatment and control firms are negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the effect is less negative for the treatment firms compared to the control firms, demonstrating the role of BESCs in mitigating the negative impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the mitigating role of BESCs is more pronounced for firms with lean and complex supply chains. Originality/value This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence on the mitigating role of BESCs during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the importance of adopting blockchain in supply chains with high uncertainties and disruption risks.","Xiong, Y.

176389,Deep Learning for Vein Biometric Recognition on a Smartphone,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 ARTIC amplicon protocol is the most widely used genome sequencing method for SARS-CoV-2, accounting for over 43% of publicly-available genome sequences. The protocol utilises 98 primers to amplify ~400bp fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 genome covering all 30,000 bases. Understanding the analytical performance metrics of this protocol will improve how the data is used and interpreted. Different concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 control material were used to establish the limit of detection (LoD) of the ARTIC protocol. Results demonstrated the LoD was a minimum of 25-50 virus particles per mL. The sensitivity of ARTIC was comparable to the published sensitivities of commercial diagnostics assays and could therefore be used to confirm diagnostic testing results. A set of over 3,600 clinical samples from three UK regions were then evaluated to compare the protocols performance to clinical diagnostic assays (Roche Lightcycler 480 II, AusDiagnostics, Roche Cobas, Hologic Panther, Corman RdRp, Roche Flow, ABI QuantStudio 5, Seegene Nimbus, Qiagen Rotorgene, Abbott M2000, Thermo TaqPath, Xpert). We developed a Python tool, RonaLDO, to perform this validation (available under the GNU GPL3 open-source licence from https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/ronaldo). Positives detected by diagnostic platforms were generally supported by sequencing data; platforms that used RT-qPCR were the best predictors of whether the sample would subsequently sequence successfully. To maximise success of sample sequencing for phylogenetic analysis, samples with Ct <31 should be chosen. For diagnostic tests that do not provide a quantifiable Ct value, adding a quantification step is recommended. The ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 sequencing protocol is highly sensitive, capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in samples with Cts in the high 30s. However, to routinely obtain whole genome coverage, samples with Ct <31 are recommended. Comparing different virus detection methods close to their LoD was challenging and significant discordance was observed.","Alikhan, N.-F.; Quick, J.; Trotter, A. J.; Robson, S.

MATERIAL and METHODS The study was carried out as qualitative research at a hospital in Turkey between June 17, 2020 and July 7, 2020. The sample consisted of eight COVID-19 patients hospitalized in service after intensive care treatment. The data were collected through an in-depth individual interview form. Each interview was transcribed verbatim, and a thematic analysis was performed. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist was followed. RESULTS Three main themes were identified for patients' perceptions of the disease experiences and treatment process. The patients experienced negative emotions after being diagnosed with COVID-19, and they spent the isolation and treatment process communicating with their beloved ones over the phone, watching television, and praying. Having an infectious disease caused them to have anxiety and sadness, and they reported satisfaction with the physicians and nurses during the treatment process. CONCLUSION Psychological and sociocultural factors, religious values, and health policies can be effective in patients' perception of disease and treatment. It is recommended for healthcare professionals to be aware of the psychosocial problems of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the disease and treatment process, monitor them for post-traumatic stress disorder, and provide the necessary support.","Sahin, C.

However, the expected earthquake ultimately did not occur and the statistics of the number COVID-19 cases and deaths for other continents (Europe, America, Asia) were far higher than those of Africa. This study focused on Central Africa tried to explain this low incidence of COVID-19. Methodology: A cross-sectional time series method was adopted and the data of COVID-19 cases and deaths for Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Congo Brazzaville, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Sao Tome and Principe between March and November 2020 were extracted from the World Health Organization COVID-19 database. The evolution of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country were plotted and the accuracy measures such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error, Median Absolute Deviation and Mean Squared Displacement were calculated. Association between the countries and the prevalence of cases, deaths and recovered was visualized through principal component analysis. Results: The results showed that the highest number of cases was observed in Cameroon (21,793) while Sao Tome and Principe scored the smallest one (962). However, based on the total population, the prevalence of COVID-19 cases was high in Sao Tome and Principe (0.436%) and Gabon (0.400%). The highest death percentages (>= 2%) were observed in Chad (6.742%), RDC (2.708%) and Angola (2.592%) while the highest recovered percentages were in Gabon (99.10%), Equatorial Guinea (97.62%) and Cameroon (97.02%). Development of traditional medicines and modification of food behavior including consumption of plant extracts appear as the reasons for the highest recovered rates. The accuracy measurements showed that the trend curves were not correlated with the actual evolution of the pandemic, but the Spearman correlation test revealed that except Equatorial Guinea (r=0.042, p=0.817), the evolution of COVID-19 cases and deaths were strongly correlated. Conclusion: The overall prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 is low in the countries of the Central Africa sub-region despite the problems facing the health systems of these countries.","Arsene, M.

Compatible with this data, we report rapid consumption of FXII in COVID-19, but not in ARDS-influenza, plasma. Interestingly, the kaolin clotting time was not prolonged in COVID-19 as compared to ARDS-influenza. Using confocal and electron microscopy, we show that increased FXII activation rate, in conjunction with elevated fibrinogen levels, triggers formation of fibrinolysis-resistant, compact clots with thin fibers and small pores in COVID-19. Accordingly, we observed clot lysis in 30% of COVID-19 patients and 84% of ARDS-influenza subjects. Analysis of lung tissue sections revealed wide-spread extra- and intra-vascular compact fibrin deposits in COVID-19. Together, our results indicate that elevated fibrinogen levels and increased FXII activation rate promote thrombosis and thrombolysis resistance via enhanced thrombus formation and stability in COVID-19.","Wygrecka, Malgorzata; Birnhuber, Anna; Seeliger, Benjamin; Michalick, Laura; Pak, Oleg; Schultz, Astrid-Solveig; Schramm, Fabian; Zacharias, Martin; Gorkiewicz, Gregor; David, Sascha; Welte, Tobias; Schmidt, Julius J.; Weissmann, Norbert; Schermuly, Ralph T.; Barreto, Guillermo; Schaefer, Liliana; Markart, Philipp; Brack, Markus C.; Hippenstiel, Stefan; Kurth, Florian; Sander, Leif E.; Witzenrath, Martin; Kuebler, Wolfgang M.; Kwapiszewska, Grazyna; Preissner, Klaus T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.17.460777,284

There is currently no vaccine licensed to prevent ETEC. Development of prophylaxis against ETEC is challenging due to the vast heterogeneity of the ETEC strains. The discovery of nanobodies has emerged as a successful new biologics in treating mucosal infectious disease as nanobodies can recognize conserved epitopes on hypervariable pathogens. In this study, we performed large screens using immunized llamas and a naïve nanobody yeast display library against adhesins of colonization factors. Cross-protective nanobodies were selected with in vitro activities inhibiting mannose-resistant hemagglutination (MRHA) against all eleven major pathogenic ETEC strains. Oral administration of nanobodies led to significant reduction of bacterial colonization in animals challenged with multiple ETEC strains. Structural analysis revealed novel conserved epitopes as critical structural features for pan-ETEC vaccine design. Two of the lead nanobodies, 2R215 and 1D7, were further engineered as trimer or fused with human IgA Fc-fragments as fusionbodies. Oral administration of the trimers or fusionbodies protected mice from infection at a much lower dose compared to the monomeric format. Importantly, fusionbodies prevented infection as a pre-treatment when administrated 2 hours before ETEC challenge to the animals. Together, our study provides the first proof of concept that oral administration of a single nanobody could confer broad protection against major pathogenic ETEC strains. Technological advances in large-scale manufacturing of biological proteins in plants and microorganisms will make nanobody-based immunotherapy a potent and cost-effective prophylaxis or treatment for ETEC.","Amcheslavsky, Alla; Wallace, Aaron; Ejemel, Monir; Li, Qi; McMahon, Conor; Stoppato, Matteo; Giuntini, Serena; Schiller, Zachary A.; Pondish, Jessica; Toomey, Jacqueline R.; Schneider, Ryan; Meisinger, Jordan; Heukers, Raimond; Kruse, Andrew C.; Barry, Elieen M.; Pierce, Brian; Klempner, Mark S.; Cavacini, Lisa A.; Wang, Yang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.155465,284

Binding affinity helps in understanding the degree of protein-ligand interactions and has wide protein applications. Protein-ligand docking using virtual screening and molecular dynamic simulations are required to predict the binding affinity of a ligand to its cognate receptor. In order to perform such analyses, it requires intense computational power and it becomes impossible to cover the entire chemical space of small molecules. Recent developments using deep learning has enabled us to make sense of massive amounts of complex datasets where the ability of the model to “learn” intrinsic patterns in a complex plane of data is the strength of the approach. Here, we have incorporated Convolutional Neural Networks to find spatial relationships amongst data to help us predict affinity of binding of proteins in whole superfamilies towards a diverse set of ligands without the need of a docked pose or complex as input. The models were trained and validated using a detailed methodology for feature extraction. We have also tested DEELIG on protein complexes relevant to the current public health scenario.

Methods: The hospital costs of 2 IVIG vs. non-IVIG COVID-19 patient groups were compared. The first cohort was a case-control analysis of 10 non-ventilated moderately to severely hypoxic COVID-19 patients who received IVIG (Privigen) matched 1:2 with 20 control patients of similar age, body mass index (BMI), degree of hypoxemia, and co-morbidities. The second cohort consisted of patients enrolled in a previously published randomized open-label prospective study of 14 COVID-19 patients receiving standard of care (SOC) versus 13 patients who received SOC plus IVIG (Octagam 10%). Results: Among the first case control population, mean total direct costs including IVIG for the treatment group was $21,982 per IVIG-treated case versus $42,431 per case for matched non-IVIG receiving controls, representing a net cost reduction of $20,449 (48%) per case. For the second (randomized) group, mean total direct costs including IVIG for the treatment group was $28,268 per case versus $62,707 per case for untreated controls, representing a net cost reduction of $34,439 (55%) per case. 24% of the non-IVIG patients had hospital costs exceeded $80,000, as compared to none of the IVIG patient host (p=0.016, Fisher exact test). Conclusion: When allocated to the appropriate patient type (moderate to severe illness without end-organ comorbidities and age <70 years), IVIG can significantly reduce hospital costs in COVID-19 care.

Using a 30-year experiment on desert rodents, we show that the impact of species loss on community-level energy use has changed dramatically over time, due to changes in both species composition and in the degree of functional redundancy among the same set of species. Although strong compensation, initially driven by the dispersal of functionally redundant species to the local community, occurred in this system from 1996-2010, since 2010, compensation has broken down due to decreasing functional overlap within the same set of species. Simultaneously, long-term changes in sitewide community composition due to niche complementarity have decoupled the dynamics of compensation from the overall impact of species loss on community-level energy use. These results highlight the importance of explicitly long-term, metacommunity, and eco-evolutionary perspectives on compensatory dynamics, zero-sum constraints, and the link between species-level fluctuations and community function in a changing world.

COVID-19 infection has been directly related to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe infections lead to admission to intensive care and can also lead to death. The use of clinical data in machine learning models available at time of admission to ED can be used to assess possible risk of ARDS, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission as well as risk of mortality. In addition, chest radiographs can be inputted into a deep learning model to further assess these risks. Purpose: This research aimed to develop machine and deep learning models using both structured clinical data and image data from the electronic health record (EHR) to adverse outcomes following ED admission. Materials and Methods: Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LightGBM) was used as the main machine learning algorithm using all clinical data including 42 variables. Compact models were also developed using 15 the most important variables to increase applicability of the models in clinical settings. To predict risk of the aforementioned health outcome events, transfer learning from the CheXNet model was implemented on our data as well. This research utilized clinical data and chest radiographs of 3571 patients 18 years and older admitted to the emergency department between 9th March 2020 and 29th October 2020 at Loyola University Medical Center. Main Findings: Our research results show that we can detect COVID-19 infection (AUC = 0.790 (0.746-0.835)) and predict the risk of developing ARDS (AUC = 0.781 (0.690-0.872), ICU admission (AUC = 0.675 (0.620-0.713)), and mortality (AUC = 0.759 (0.678-0.840)) at moderate accuracy from both chest X-ray images and clinical data. Principal Conclusions: The results can help in clinical decision making, especially when addressing ARDS and mortality, during the assessment of patients admitted to the ED with or without COVID-19 symptoms.","Butler, L.; Karabayir, I.; Tootooni, M.

181851,Supporting Junior Women: Strategies for Men Colleagues,2021,"Purpose: Having easy access to the flu and COVID-19 vaccination sites may be important for controlling the spread of the infection. Chicago implemented a broad strategy of opening COVID-19 vaccination locations across the city in a variety of locations. Design/methodology/approach: We defined access as having vaccinations within one mile. Data came from the American Community Survey (ACS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Chicago Data Portal. We calculated the street-network distance from the population-weighted centroid of census tracts to the nearest vaccination sites before, during and post COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the demographics of census tracts within one mile to those greater than one mile during each period. Findings: People age 65 and above and with disabilities saw significant decreases in flu vaccination site access to locations within one mile of their census tract in 2020–2021 compared to 2018–2019. The COVID-19 vaccination sites mimic these flu vaccination site patterns, suggesting a severe lack of geographic access for a group likely to experience limited mobility. Results combining instances of both flu and COVID-19 vaccination sites suggest that making COVID-19 vaccination sites available at flu shot site locations would significantly reduce the number of people with limited mobility lacking geographic access. Originality/value: Policymakers should explore how this expanded network of vaccination locations could facilitate permanent improvements to access to vaccination sites for people with disabilities. © 2021, Aida Rosalia Guhlincozzi and Aynaz Lotfata.","Guhlincozzi, A.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the unanticipated positive consequences of these and the scope for longer-term learning and developments within the sector. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach was used, semi-structured interviews were conducted across six major project sites. Interviewees (n = 33) included site and senior managers, supply chain representatives and occupational safety and health (OSH) professionals. The interviews explored their experiences of working on site during the pandemic, the changes made to work practices and their perceived impacts of these changes. Findings: Improved planning and work sequencing were part of the revised process to make sites COVID-secure. This increased worker effectiveness and housekeeping/tidiness. The view on some sites was that this would improve OSH performance. The changes were perceived to be beneficial but may not be accepted by clients in the long term, as they could result in projects taking longer to complete. The ways in which COVID-19 risk has been communicated and perceived also provides longer-term lessons for the sector’s OSH management and training. Originality/value: Construction has adapted rapidly and effectively to new ways of working during the pandemic.

Patients and methods. This prospective, comparative, controlled study included 140 patients with COVID-19 randomized in two groups. The experimental group (EG) included 70 patients who received standard therapy plus VIFERON® (one rectal suppository 3,000,000 IU three times a day and gel 36,000 IU/g 5 times a day applied to the nasal mucosa and palatine tonsils for 14 days);the control group (CG) comprised 70 patients who received standard therapy alone. Results. Patients in the EG demonstrated more rapid resolution of main symptoms, such as intoxication, bronchopulmonary and catarrhal manifestations. Normalization of the total score in the EG was observed 7 days earlier than in the CG. In the EG, the proportions of patients who had their D-dimer and CRP levels normalized were 42.7% and 18.7% higher than those in the CG, respectively (р < 0.05). Follow-up computed tomography demonstrated that the proportion of patients with positive dynamics in the EG was 8.1% higher than that among controls, whereas advanced disease with 51%–75% of lung tissue affected was 11.9% less common in participants from the EG than in controls (р = 0.019). We observed no adverse events associated with interferon alpha-2b (VIFERON®) or other medicines included in the treatment scheme. Conclusion. Our findings suggest high efficacy and safety of recombinant interferon alpha-2b (VIFERON®) used in combination with symptomatic agents, antibiotics, anticoagulants, which allows us to recommend this drug for inclusion into standard treatment schemes for COVID-19.","Mordyk, A.

183758,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).,2003,"Phenomenon Professional identity development is recognised as a core goal of medical education alongside knowledge and skill acquisition. Identity is a complex entity that can be conceptualised as externally influenced, but individually constructed. Integration from legitimate bystander to ""old timer"" of the medical community of practice provides a backdrop for individual negotiation of professional identity. During Covid-19, the medical community of practice and education experienced significant disruption. We sought to investigate how these disruptions impacted professional identity development by examining conflicts between students' identities highlighted by the pressures of the pandemic. Approach A mixed-methods survey was distributed to medical students in the UK. The survey was active from 2nd May to 15th June 2020, during the height of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK. Operating within the paradigm of constructivism, we conducted a reflexive thematic analysis of qualitative responses. Analysis was focused around the disruption to medical education, actions taken by medical students during this disruption, and the tension between student actions where they existed in conflict. Findings Three themes were constructed to describe the identities that participants felt were in conflict during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic: Status and role as a future doctor; status and role as a student; and status and role as a member of the wider community. Students noted that lack of clinical exposure was detrimental to their education, implicitly recognising that many aspects of professional identity formation are forged in the clinical environment. Participants were keen to volunteer clinically but struggled to balance this with academic work. Participants worried about the risk to their families and the wider community, and wanted to ensure that their skills would add value to the clinical environment. Volunteers felt frustrated when they were unable to perform tasks which aligned with their identities future doctors, with the exception of participants who worked as interim FY1s (FiY1s), which aligned well with the roles of FY1s. Insights As hypothesised, the participants in this study experienced disruptions to their professional identity development during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. This work provides early evidence, collected at the beginning of the pandemic, that the effects of disruptions to professional identity development were wide-reaching, often negative, and represent an important topic for future exploration. Given that the pandemic has highlighted areas of identity tension, these findings have the potential to provide insight into how medical training can better nurture professional identity development during and beyond international crises.","Harvey, A.; Brown, M.

184646,News in brief.,2006,"Lassa virus (LASV) glycoprotein complex (GPC) contains retained stable-signal peptide (SSP), GP1, and GP2. SSP interacts with GP2 and provides an interface targeted by numerous fusion inhibitors. Serially passaging of LASV with inhibitors allowed some adaptive mutants to be obtained of which most had mutations located in the transmembrane (TM) domain of GP2. In the current study, we focused on the F446L mutant, which is reported to confer resistance to ST-series inhibitors. We found that F446L conferred cross-resistance to structurally distinct inhibitors. Furthermore, F446L increased the fusion activities of LASV and Mopeia virus GPC, elevating the pH threshold for fusion of LASV and promoting fusion of MOPV at neutral pH. F446L exerted little effect on the pseudotype viral growth profile or thermostability. By introducing other residues to the conserved F446 locus, it was found that this site was less compatible with a similar tyrosine residue and was intolerable to charged residues. These results help characterize the fusion inhibitor target located in the TM domain of GP2, which should be useful for drug and vaccine design. IMPORTANCE The LASV SSP-GP2 interface provides an Achilles heel that is targeted by numerous inhibitors. However, the emergence of resistant viruses is a major concern for direct antiviral drugs. In this study, we investigated the F446L mutant located in the GPC TM domain to determine the relationship between drug resistance, membrane fusion activity, viral growth kinetics, and thermostability. These results will be helpful in monitoring drug-resistant variants, as well as the advancement of drug and vaccine design.","Guo, Jiao; Zhang, Guangshun; Liu, Yang; Cao, Junyuan; Zhang, Mengmeng; Lan, Xiaohao; Zhang, Yueli; Liu, Chenchen; Xiao, Gengfu; Wang, Wei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.424274,284
186315,Mental health emergency.,2000,"Purpose: Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) brings high-quality patient care to the bedside but continues to be an expensive training to implement in a residency program. There are multiple resources available to train providers in ultrasound, but they are all associated with significant cost. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) mandates anesthesiology residents to be competent in diagnostic and therapeutic uses of ultrasound. In this paper, we describe how an academic anesthesiology department implemented a POCUS curriculum for resident training. Methods: An anesthesiologist intensivist directed program was created to train residents in POCUS. We started by training a group of seven critical care trained anesthesiologists with the guidance of cardiologists. These anesthesiologists participated in the training of our anesthesiology residents. A hybrid curriculum consisting of a simulator as well as hands-on scanning of patients was created. We recorded the time that personnel spent in the training program as well as the money spent in acquiring equipment. Results: Seven faculty utilized a total of 270 hours of scanning and teaching time to train 48 residents who rotated through the ICU between July 2017 and June 2018. Simulation technicians used 48 hours to guide residents through simulation scenarios. The education administrator used 24 hours to coordinate sessions for residents. The technician and coordinator were both employees of the department with no additional cost for their responsibilities. The cost of equipment, including the ultrasound machine and simulator, was $45,000. An additional charge of $3500 was incurred for technician training time. Conclusion: Implementing a robust, sustainable POCUS curriculum requires a significant investment of time and money. Simulators and e-learning can allow efficiency in resource allocation and control cost in orienting new students to ultrasound. Having residents go through the simulator decreased the time that faculty would otherwise have spent going over basics with the students while allowing students to master these skills at their own pace. Advances in ultrasound technology have created newer, more affordable machines which can decrease cost considerably. It would serve departments well to consider alternatives and plan for resources when deciding to implement POCUS curriculum for resident training.","Deshpande, Ranjit; Karnik, Ruchika; Baer, Christine; Kurup, Viji",Yale J Biol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7448394/,284
186989,In mental health.,2010,"SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus causing COVID-19, is one of the most contagious disease of past decades. COVID-19 is different only in that everyone is encountering it for the first time during this pandemic. The world has gone from complete ignorance to a blitz of details in a matter of months. The foremost challenge that the scientific community faces is to understand the growth and transmission capability of the virus. As the world grapples with the global pandemic, people are spending more time than ever before living and working in the digital milieu, and the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is propelled to an unprecedented level especially as AI has already proven to play an important role in counteracting COVID-19. AI and Data Science are rapidly becoming important tools in clinical research, precision medicine, biomedical discovery and medical diagnostics. Machine learning (ML) and their subsets, such as deep learning, are also referred to as cognitive computing due to their foundational basis and relationship to cognition. To date, AI based techniques are helping epidemiologists in projecting the spread of virus, contact tracing, early detection, monitoring, social distancing, compiling data and training of healthcare workers. Beside AI, the use of telemedicine, mobile health or mHealth and the Internet of Things (IOT) is also emerging. These techniques have proven to be powerful tools in fighting against the pandemic because they provide strong support in pandemic prevention and control. The present study highlights applications and evaluations of these technologies, practices, and health delivery services as well as regulatory and ethical challenges regarding AI/ML-based medical products.","Dabla, Pradeep Kumar; Gruson, Damien; Gouget, Bernard; Bernardini, Sergio; Homsak, Evgenija",EJIFCC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421492/,284

187983,Room for improvement.,2001,"The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), JHM strain, induces a biphasic retinal disease in adult BALB/c mice. In the early phase of the disease, day 1 to 7, a retinal vasculitis is noted and is associated with the presence of virus particles. In the late phase of the disease, day 10 to 140, a retinal degeneration is observed and is associated with the absence of both virus particles and inflammatory cells. We show that the retinal degenerative process is also associated with the presence of antiretinal autoantibodies. In total, 22 of 23 sera collected from 10 to 70 days after JHM virus inoculation contained antiretinal autoantibodies. These autoantibodies are not found in sera from normal or mock-injected mice. Antibodies to retinal tissue were identified as two distinct patterns of immunoperoxidase staining on frozen sections of normal rat eyes, retinal autoantibodies and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) autoantibodies. The antiretinal autoantibodies first appeared as IgM class antibodies that shifted to IgG class autoantibodies. The anti-RPE cell autoantibodies were predominantly of the IgG class. Sera that were positive for these autoantibodies did not stain with liver or kidney sections but 2 of 3 did react with rat brain sections. A second mouse strain, CD-1, was also evaluated because these animals respond to JHM virus inoculation by developing only the early phase of this disease, i.e. vasculitis. On day 10 postinoculation, the retina architecture has a normal appearance. In these mice, which are free of a retinal degeneration, antiretinal autoantibodies are not produced. However, just as is noted in the BALB/c mice, antivirus neutralizing antibodies are produced in the infected CD-1 mice. These findings suggest a role for autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of murine coronavirus induced retinal degeneration. This study establishes an animal model for the study of humoral autoimmune responses in human retinal degenerations.","Hooks, J J; Percopo, C; Wang, Y; Detrick, B",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8397257/,284
190045,News in brief.,1993,"Serum uric acid (SUA) is currently recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It has been reported that an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), losartan, decreases SUA level, whereas other ARBs, such as candesartan, have no lowering effect. Because the renal uric acid transporter (URAT1) is an important factor controlling the SUA level, we examined the involvement of URAT1 in those differential effects of various ARBs on SUA level at clinically relevant concentrations. This study was done by using URAT1-expressing Xenopus oocytes. Losartan, pratosartan, and telmisartan exhibited cis-inhibitory effects on the uptake of uric acid by URAT1, whereas at higher concentrations, only telmisartan did, and these ARBs reduced the uptake in competitive inhibition kinetics. On the other hand, candesartan, EXP3174 [2-n-butyl-4-chloro-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yI)methyl]imidazole-5-carboxylic acid] (a major metabolite of losartan), olmesartan, and valsartan were not inhibitory. Preloading of those ARBs in the oocytes enhanced the URAT1-mediated uric acid uptake, showing a trans-stimulatory effect. The present study is a first demonstration of the differential effects of ARBs on URAT1 that some ARBs are both cis-inhibitory and trans-stimulatory, depending on concentration, whereas others exhibit either a trans-stimulatory or cis-inhibitory effect alone, which could explain the clinically observed differential effects of ARBs on SUA level. Furthermore, it was found that such differential effects of ARBs on URAT1 could be predicted from the partial chemical structures of ARBs, which will be useful information for the appropriate use and development of ARBs without an increase of SUA.","Iwanaga, Takashi; Sato, Masanobu; Maeda, Tomoji; Ogihara, Toshio; Tamai, Ikumi",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17043154/,284

OBJECTIVES To describe the characteristics, outcomes, and potential associations of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel. METHODS We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of 58 consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Laniado Hospital, Israel, between 14 March 2020 and 14 May 2020. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on admission were collected and analyzed, and the association to subsequent respiratory failure was assessed. RESULTS Mean age of patients was 70.7 ± 16.9 years (53% males, 47% females.); 74% had at least one co-morbidity. Most patients were of Jewish Ashkenazi descent. During hospitalization 15 patients (mean age 78.18 ± 10.35 years); 80% male, 73% Sephardi descent developed respiratory failure rates of 60% occurring on average 10.6 days following intubation. Laboratory tests at admission displayed a significant increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatine kinase (CK) and a decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in patients who eventually developed respiratory failure (163.97 mg/L, 340.87 IU/L, 0.886 K/μl vs. 50.01 mg/L and 123.56 IU/L, 1.28 K/μl, respectively). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed an integrated parameter of CRP, CK, and ALC highly correlated with respiratory failure. Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed the area under the curve of CRP, CK, and ALC and the integrated parameter to be 0.910, 0.784, and 0.754, respectively. CRP was the strongest predictor to correlate with respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS CRP, CK, and ALC levels on admission could possibly be used to detect high-risk patients prone to develop respiratory failure.","Elhadad, Dana; Bronstein, Yotam; Yana, Moshe; Baris, Harel; Levinger, Uriel; Shapiro, Maurice; Sharon, Nechama",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070482/,284
191870,On the hybridization of memetic algorithms with branch-and-bound techniques.,2007,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, utilizes a discontinuous transcription mechanism for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Previous studies (C.-L. Liao and M. C. C. Lai, J. Virol. 68:4727-4737, 1994) have demonstrated that an upstream cis-acting leader sequence serves as a transcriptional enhancer, but the mechanism of transcriptional regulation is not clear. In this study, we constructed a series of defective interfering (DI) RNAs containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene behind a differentially expressed transcription initiation (intergenic) sequence (for mRNA2-1). These DI RNAs had different copy numbers of the UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence at the 3' end of the leader. Transfection of these DI RNA constructs into cells infected with a helper MHV, which contains either two or three UCUAA copies at the 3' end of the leader, resulted in differential expression of CAT activities. We demonstrated that the copy number of UCUAA repeats in the leaders of both helper viral and DI RNAs affected the level of CAT activity, suggesting that MHV leader RNA could regulate both in trans and in cis the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs. The leader RNA of subgenomic mRNAs was derived from either the trans- or the cis-acting leader. Furthermore, insertion of a UA-rich sequence (UUUAUAAAC) immediately downstream of the leader in DI RNA, to match the sequence of helper viral RNA, enhanced the CAT activity by threefold, suggesting that this nine-nucleotide sequence is a cis-acting element. Interestingly, when the nine-nucleotide sequence was absent in DI RNA, the leaders of subgenomic mRNAs were exclusively derived from the helper virus. In contrast, when the nine-nucleotide sequence was present in DI RNA, the leaders were derived from both helper viral and DI RNAs. These results suggest that the nine-nucleotide sequence either is required for the leader RNA to initiate mRNA synthesis or, alternatively, serves as a transcription terminator for the leader RNA synthesis. However, when a constitutively expressed intergenic sequence (for mRNA7) was used, no difference in transcription efficiency was noted, regardless of the copy number of UCUAA in the DI RNA and helper virus. This study thus indicates that MHV subgenomic RNA transcription requires the interaction among the intergenic (promoter) sequence, a trans-acting leader, and a cis-acting leader sequence. A novel model of transcriptional regulation of coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs is presented.","Zhang, X; Liao, C L; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8035476/,284

Free-ranging Namibian cheetahs share ancestry with captive cheetahs, but their susceptibility to infectious diseases has not been investigated. The largest remaining population of free-ranging cheetahs resides on Namibian farmlands, where they share habitat with domestic dogs and cats known to carry viruses that affect cheetah health. To assess the extent to which free-ranging cheetahs are exposed to feline and canine viruses, sera from 81 free-ranging cheetahs sampled between 1992 and 1998 were evaluated for antibodies against canine distemper virus (CDV), feline coronavirus (feline infectious peritonitis virus; FCoV/ FIPV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV1), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline calicivirus (FCV) and for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigens. Antibodies against CDV, FCoV/FIPV, FHV1, FPV, and FCV were detected in 24, 29, 12, 48, and 65% of the free-ranging population, respectively, although no evidence of viral disease was present in any animal at the time of sample collection. Neither FIV antibodies nor FeLV antigens were present in any free-ranging cheetah tested. Temporal variation in FCoV/FIPV seroprevalence during the study period suggested that this virus is not endemic in the free-ranging population. Antibodies against CDV were detected in cheetahs of all ages sampled between 1995 and 1998, suggesting the occurrence of an epidemic in Namibia during the time when CDV swept through other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. This evidence in free-ranging Namibian cheetahs of exposure to viruses that cause severe disease in captive cheetahs should direct future guidelines for translocations, including quarantine of seropositive cheetahs and preventing contact between cheetahs and domestic pets.","Munson, Linda; Marker, Laurie; Dubovi, Edward; Spencer, Jennifer A; Evermann, James F; O'Brien, Stephen J",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15137485/,284

Keeping this information in view, we prepared aqueous extracts and determined their biochemical properties including their impact on the activity of human RBC's acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The UV—Visible spectrophotometric profiles of the aqueous extracts of different parts of the four plant species viz. Calotropis procera, Datura metal, Cannabis sativa, Argemone mexicana and Thevitia peruviana displayed two major peaks at 302 and 336 nm corresponding to the presence of different flavonoids in these preparations. These extracts indicated presence of protein in the range of 1.12 to 19.25mg/g wet weight of the plant tissues. The impact of different phytochemicals present in these extracts was studied on the activity of AChE isolated from human erythrocytes (RBCs). The extracts derived from Argemone mexicana and Datura metal exhibited strong AChE inhibitory potential, whereas others did not show significant inhibition even at higher concentrations. The results indicate that human RBC's can be used as a potential biomarker towards evaluation of the efficacy and toxic potential of varied plant extracts.","Srivastava, N; Sharma, R K; Singh, N; Sharma, B",Cellular and molecular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23273207/,284
196209,[Impact of recent advances in molecular techniques on diagnosing lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs)].,2012,"The onset and pattern of the clinical signs of feline corona virus (FCoV) infection in cats were studied in a setting behind an isolation barrier. Two FCoV-seropositive cats were the source of the infection, and 3 barrier reared cats - initially FCoV-seronegative - were the recipients. The first clinical sign in the recipients appeared 11 days after contact with the source of infection. After 2 years 1 male and 1 female of the recipients started to breed. Their offspring developed clinical signs of disease at an age of 4-5 weeks. A pattern of recurring upper respiratory tract signs and conjunctivitis at intervals of about 4 months was observed in both the recipients and their offspring, while CNS dependent signs and wasting remained or got worse, once developed. Once demonstrated, FCoV antigen persisted in membrana nictitans throughout the investigation, and was found in all cats but 4 (90%). The offspring died during 2 periods, around the first week of life (9/37), and at 3-5 months of age (5/25). For comparison 3 offspring were euthanized at an age of 1 day and 16 offspring at an age of 3-6 months. FCoV antigen was demonstrated in all organs investigated (100%) from offspring dying during the first period, and in 97% from those dying during the second period. For the offspring euthanized during the same 2 periods the corresponding findings were 95% and 85%. Offspring euthanized between 9 and 17 months (4 kittens) had antigen in 67% of all investigated organs. The incidence of FCoV antigen in almost every organ in the investigated newborn kittens suggests an intrauterine infection. The demonstration of FCoV antigen in all euthanised cats, suggests a persistent infection. Virus was cultivated from membrana nictitans, that was FCoV antigen positive in the M3 test.","Hök, K",Acta veterinaria Scandinavica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8147286/,284
198573,Risk perception and compliance with quarantine during the SARS outbreak.,2005,"Fecal samples from suckling (n=153) and weaned (n=116) piglets with diarrhea in Japan were examined for shedding of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens using culture, microscopic, and polymerase chain reaction methods. In suckling piglets, diarrhea was attributed to infection with a single etiologic agent in 60.8% of cases and with combinations of agents in 22.2%. In weaned piglets, diarrhea was attributed to a single etiologic agent in 43.1% and to combinations of agents in 47.4% of cases. Rotavirus was the most prevalent agent in suckling (67.3%) and weaned (65.5%) piglets. The detection of other pathogens was associated with age of the animals examined. Coccidia were predominantly isolated from suckling piglets, whereas Escherichia coli was found predominantly in weaned piglets. Although a relationship was not observed between detection rate of rotavirus and age of piglets, a single group of rotavirus was detected in 87.5% of suckling piglets whereas multiple groups were detected in 51.6% of weaned piglets. The results of this study confirm that diarrhea in piglets can, to a variable degree, be causally associated with multiple agents. Additionally, these results suggest reasons why this syndrome can be difficult to control.","Katsuda, Ken; Kohmoto, Mariko; Kawashima, Kenji; Tsunemitsu, Hiroshi","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16921873/,284
199565,Medical Deep Learning -- A systematic Meta-Review,2020-10-28,"Four studies were carried out to determine the ovarian responses of dairy cows undergoing natural oestrous cycles to sequential injections of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), followed seven days later by prostaglandin and, 48 to 72 hours later, by a second injection of GnRH. In study 1, of 60 cows so treated, 47 were in the intended periovulatory phase when a fixed-time insemination was given 72 hours after the prostaglandin. In study 2, detailed observations were made in 32 cows treated as in study 1, using ultrasound to determine the optimum time to administer the second dose of GnRH. Ovulation was most effectively synchronised by giving GnRH 56 to 60 hours after the prostaglandin. Study 3 investigated the timing of ovulation when no initial dose of GnRH was given. Six cows were injected with prostaglandin on day 12 of the oestrous cycle, followed by GnRH 60 hours later. Five of the six cows ovulated 24 to 36 hours after GnRH, an equivalent timing and synchrony to that in study 2, in which a dose of GnRH had been given seven days before prostaglandin. In study 4, an initial dose of GnRH was given to six cows late (day 17) in the oestrous cycle, and prostaglandin seven days later. The GnRH treatment delayed luteolysis in five of the cows so that they were responsive to the prostaglandin and ovulated 24 to 36 hours after the second dose of GnRH. The use of GnRH (day 0) - prostaglandin (day 7) - GnRH (day 9.5) appears to be an effective means of synchronising ovulation in most cows.","Peters, A R; Mawhinney, I; Drew, S B; Ward, S J; Warren, M J; Gordon, P J",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10576625/,284

By screening a library of known drugs, we identified 13 compounds that inhibited vaccinia virus replication at noncytotoxic doses. The anticancer drug mitoxantrone is unique among the inhibitors identified in that it has no apparent impact on viral gene expression. Rather, it blocks processing of viral structural proteins and assembly of mature progeny virions. The isolation of mitoxantrone-resistant vaccinia strains underscores that a viral protein is the likely target of the drug. Whole-genome sequencing of mitoxantrone-resistant viruses pinpointed missense mutations in the N-terminal domain of vaccinia DNA ligase. Despite its favorable activity in cell culture, mitoxantrone administered intraperitoneally at the maximum tolerated dose failed to protect mice against a lethal intranasal infection with vaccinia virus.","Deng, Liang; Dai, Peihong; Ciro, Anthony; Smee, Donald F; Djaballah, Hakim; Shuman, Stewart",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928345/,284

The aims of this study were (1) to assess ecotoxicity effects over time to soil fauna, posed by Lorsban® 480 BR (Chlorpyrifos) and Dithane® NT (Mancozeb) residues when disposed of in a biobed system compared with two subtropical soils, and (2) to assess ecotoxicity effects over time to soil fauna simulating an accidental spillage with Lorsban® 480 BR at the biobed. A semi-field experiment was conducted for 420 days in southern Brazil, testing continuous disposal of washing pulverization tanks in biobeds, Typic Haploperox or Typic Hapludults. In addition, different biobeds received a single dose (1 L) of Lorsban® 480 BR to simulate an accidental spillage. Chronic ecotoxicity tests were performed using Folsomia candida, Eisenia andrei, and Enchytraeus crypticus in different sampling times for both experiments. F. candida was the most sensitive species. The biobed system was able to eliminate effects from residues of both pesticides over time in all species, which did not happen in both natural soils. In accidental spillage simulation, even 420 days after contamination, F. candida did not show reproduction. The biobeds can be a feasible alternative for the disposal and treatment residues of pesticides, also for handling and washing pesticides activities. The system was efficient in promoting degradation and reducing ecotoxicity effects posed by Lorsban® 480 BR and Dithane® NT for soil fauna. It is a safe alternative to avoid soil contamination.","Carniel, Letícia Scopel Camargo; Niemeyer, Julia Carina; de Oliveira Filho, Luís Carlos Iuñes; Alexandre, Douglas; Gebler, Luciano; Klauberg-Filho, Osmar",Ecotoxicology,,284

Economic activity also contracted severely because of voluntary social distancing in response to higher infections. Furthermore, we show that lockdowns substantially reduced COVID-19 cases, especially if they were introduced early in a country's epidemic. This implies that, despite involving short-term economic costs, lockdowns may pave the way to a faster recovery by containing the spread of the virus and reducing voluntary social distancing. Finally, we document that lockdowns entail decreasing marginal economic costs but increasing marginal benefits in reducing infections. This suggests that tight short-lived lockdowns are preferable to mild prolonged measures. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.","Caselli, F.; Grigoli, F.; Sandri, D.",B.E.

204824,Rethinking the role of the EU in enhancing European competitiveness,2021,"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, drastically modifies the cells that it infects. One such effect is the activation of the host p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which plays a major role in inflammation pathways that are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 cases. Inhibition of p38/MAPK activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells reduces both cytokine production and viral replication. Here, we applied a systems biology approach to better understand interactions between the p38/MAPK pathway and SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells. We found several components of the p38/MAPK pathway positively and negatively impact SARS-CoV-2 infection and that p38{beta} is a required host factor for SARS-CoV-2 that acts by promoting viral protein translation in a manner that prevents innate immune sensing. Furthermore, we combined chemical and genetic perturbations of p38{beta} with quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify novel, putative p38{beta} substrates in an unbiased manner, with broad relevance beyond SARS-CoV-2 biology.","Higgins, Christina A; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E; Kurland, Andrew; Adhikary, Prithy; Golynker, Ilona; Danziger, Oded; Panis, Maryline; Rosenberg, Brad R; tenOever, Benjamin R; Johnson, Jeffrey R",,,284

We performed a thorough review of data on CoV pathogenesis and morbidity rate in cancer patients, through the analysis of the previous CoV pandemics. Considering the interaction between CoV and the host immune system, cancer patients receiving immunotherapy might be more at risk for an aberrant immune response in case of infection, and might therefore deserve additional precautions.

METHOD: A total of 139 patients with acute STEMI admitted to our heart center from 20 March 2020 to 20 June 2020 were included in this study. If the time interval between the estimated onset of symptoms and admission to the emergency room was >120 min, it was considered as a prehospital delay. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Padua Inventory-Washington State University Revision (PI-WSUR) test were used to assess Contamination-Obbsessive compulsive disorder (C-OCD). RESULT: The same period STEMI count compared to the previous year decreased 25%. The duration of symptoms onset to hospital admission was longer in the first month compared to second and third months (180 (120-360), 120 (60-180), and 105 (60-180), respectively; P = 0.012).

METHODS: We systematically reviewed multiple databases to find relevant articles reporting the effect of biologics on ""severe"" COVID-19 in IBD patients. Those in the form of case series (> 10 patients), case-control, and cohort studies were included. Severe COVID-19 was defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or mortality. Pooled analysis with multivariate regression was performed. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies with 2681 patients were included. The proportion of females was (48.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 47.0-49.5%). The proportion of UC patients was (44.8%, 95% CI 41.0-48.5%).

However, there are lack of study assessing COVID-19 related human stress and its’ associations with other relevant factors affecting quality of life in the country, and which were explored in the present study. Methods: An online based survey was carried out among 340 Bangladeshi adult populations (65.90% male; mean age 26.23 ± 6.39) by utilizing the socio-demographics, possible human stress due to COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. Dataset were analysed through a set of statistical tools e.g., T-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Cluster Analysis (CA). Results: About 85.60% of the participants are in COVID-19-related stress, which results in sleep shortness, short temper, and chaos in family. Fear of COVID-19 infection (i.e., self and/or family member(s), and/or relatives), hampering scheduled study plan and future career, and financial difficulties are identified as the main causes of human stress. Results of PCM explain the relationship among the factors of human stress, and found economic hardship and food crisis are linked together causes stress of mass people, while hamper of formal education and future plan create stress of career seeker. T-test, and one-way ANOVA illustrate demographic characteristics (i.e., occupation, age, gender, and marital status) have significant effects on elevated mental stress. Moreover, PCA and CA results revealed significant interface among the respondents’ perception and factors of human stress, which matched with the existing scenario of the country.

212739,Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Health Risks Prediction,2021,"BACKGROUND: A key strategy for mitigating the current opioid epidemic is expanded access to medications for treating opioid use disorder (MOUD). However, interventions developed to expand MOUD access have limited ability to engage opioid users at higher levels of overdose risk, such as those who inject opioids. This paper describes the study protocol for testing STAMINA (Syringe Service Telemedicine Access for Medication-assisted Intervention through NAvigation), an intervention that engages high-risk opioid users at community-based syringe service programs (SSP) and quickly links them to MOUD using a telemedicine platform. METHODS: This randomized control trial will be conducted at three SSP sites in Chicago. All participants will complete an initial assessment with a provider from a Federally Qualified Health Center who can prescribe or refer MOUD services as appropriate. The control arm will receive standard referral to treatment and the intervention arm will receive immediate telemedicine linkage to the provider and (depending on the type of MOUD prescribed) provided transportation to pick up their induction prescription (for buprenorphine or naltrexone) or attend their intake appointment (for methadone). We aim to recruit a total of 273 participants over two years to provide enough power to detect a difference in our primary outcome of MOUD treatment linkage. Secondary outcomes include treatment engagement, treatment retention, and non-MOUD opioid use. Data will be collected using structured interviews and saliva drug tests delivered at baseline, three months, and six months. Fixed and mixed effects generalized linear regression analyses and survival analysis will be conducted to compare the probabilities of a successful treatment linkage between the two arms, days retained in treatment, and post-baseline opioid and other drug use. DISCUSSION: If successful, STAMINA's telemedicine approach will significantly reduce the amount of time between SSP clients' initial indication of interest in the medication and treatment initiation. Facilitating this process will likely lead to stronger additional treatment- and recovery-oriented outcomes. This study is also timely given the need for more rigorous testing of telemedicine interventions in light of temporary regulatory changes that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to evaluate the changes of frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs, a population of cells with potent immunosuppressive capacity, in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The levels of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs were determined by flow cytometry in 27 COVID-19 patients, and their association with clinical characteristics and laboratory data were analyzed. RESULTS: The frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs was elevated in COVID-19 patients, particularly severe patients. A follow-up comparison revealed a decline of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs percentages in most patients 1 day after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the levels of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs were still greater than 50.0% in 3 ICU patients 4-10 days after negative SARS-CoV-2 results. Elevated frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs was positively correlated with oropharyngeal viral loads and length of hospital stay, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte counts and serum albumin. Moreover, strong correlations were observed between the frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs and T cell subsets, NK cell counts, and B cell percentages. The frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs could be used as a predictor of COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs, especially in severe patients, may indicate an immunoparalysis status and could be a predictor of disease severity and prognosis.","Xue, GuoHui; Jiang, Mei; Zhao, Rui; Le, AiPing; Li, JunMing",Aging (Albany NY),,284

This chapter explores how applications of machine learning in the healthcare sector have sought progress, and extricate the challenges with respect to early prediction of chronic illnesses. The review of past work in this fast-growing research and development area, as well as the state-of-the-art, is conducted in order to establish a roadmap for future trajectories. This study emphasises that there is no ML algorithm that can guarantee a reliable predictive outcome for all kinds of diseases in every given problem case, the quantity of the dataset employed has a significant contribution to the performance of the predictive algorithms, and that quality time must be given to the data preparation stages because the result of the ML algorithms employed depends on the quality of the dataset used. This work is mainly intended to serve researchers and developers in the field.

216992,A Residual Network based Deep Learning Model for Detection of COVID-19 from Cough Sounds,2021-06-04,"Molecular imaging using PET/CT or PET/MRI has evolved from an experimental imaging modality at its inception in 1972 to an integral component of diagnostic procedures in oncology, and, to lesser extent, in cardiology and neurology, by successfully offering in-vivo imaging and quantitation of key pathophysiological targets or molecular signatures, such as glucose metabolism in cancerous disease. Apart from metabolism probes, novel radiolabeled peptide and antibody PET tracers, including radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have entered the clinical arena, providing the in-vivo capability to collect target-specific quantitative in-vivo data on cellular and molecular pathomechanisms on a whole-body scale, and eventually, extract imaging biomarkers possibly serving as prognostic indicators. The success of molecular imaging in mapping disease severity on a whole-body scale, and directing targeted therapies in oncology possibly could translate to the management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), by identifying, localizing, and quantifying involvement of different immune mediated responses to the infection with SARS-COV2 during the course of acute infection and possible, chronic courses with long-term effects on specific organs. The authors summarize current knowledge for medical imaging in COVID-19 in general with a focus on molecular imaging technology and provide a perspective for immunologists interested in molecular imaging research using validated and immediately available molecular probes, as well as possible future targets, highlighting key targets for tailored treatment approaches as brought up by key opinion leaders.","Juengling, Freimut D; Maldonado, Antonio; Wuest, Frank; Schindler, Thomas H",Front Immunol,,284

But no systematic review of COVID-19 infection control has been published. Aim: The aim of this study is to determine the COVID-19 disease control methods. Material and methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature using the keywords: ‘coronavirus’ and ‘2020,’ ‘COVID-19’ in databases including ScienceDirect, PubMed, Springer and Scopus from January 1, 2020 to February 23, 2020. All observational studies, as well as case reports and editorials that were published in English were included. Data on the disease control methods of COVID-19 were extracted by two researchers. Results and discussion: The preliminary search result was about 131 articles;38 articles were retrieved for full-text screening, after screening articles by title and abstract. Finally, 17 papers having the study inclusion criteria were selected. Disease control is possible at three levels of prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Conclusions: COVID-19 is a new clinical infectious disease that can be controlled by adopting measures to prevent, diagnose and treat the disease. Further studies are needed to elucidate factors that may be effective in controlling the spread of the disease during recovery.","Esteki, R.; Asgari, N.; Ghomi, R.; Biyabanaki, F.; Hajheidari, A.; Nasirinasab, F.",Polish Annals of Medicine,,284
220670,nCOVID-19 classification by CCSHNet with deep fusion using transfer learning and discriminant correlation analysis,2020,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive, behavioral and motor symptoms and has a more challenging clinical management and poorer prognosis compared to other forms of dementia. The experience of lockdown leads to negative psychological outcomes for fragile people such as elderly with dementia, particularly for DLB, causing a worsening of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Since an individual's feeling of time passage is strongly related to their cognitive and emotional state, it is conceivable to expect alterations of this construct in people with DLB during such a difficult period. We therefore assessed the subjective experience of the passage of time for present and past time intervals (Subjective Time Questionnaire, STQ) during the lockdown due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 22 patients with DLB (17 of which were re-tested in a post-lockdown period) and compared their experience with that of 14 caregivers with similar age. Patients showed a significantly slower perception of present and past time spent under lockdown restrictions. We argue that these alterations might be related to the distinctive features of DLB and their exacerbation recorded by the patients' caregivers during the period of lockdown, though our results show that the patients' experience of time passage in a post-lockdown period remained similarly slow. Overall, we show an impairment of the subjective perception of time passage in DLB tested during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Emergency Department (ED) specific RRS are relatively new and the factors associated with their effectiveness are largely unknown. This study describes the period prevalence of deterioration and characteristics of care for deteriorating patients in an Australia ED and examine relationships between system factors and escalation of care. METHODS: A retrospective medical record audit of all patients presenting to an Australian ED in two weeks. RESULTS: Period prevalence of deterioration was 10.08% (n=269). Failure to escalate care occurred in nearly half (n=52, 47.3%) of the patients requiring a response (n=110). Appropriate escalation practices were associated with where the patient was being cared for (p=0.01), and the competence level of the person documenting deterioration (p=0.005). Intermediate competence level nurses were nine times more likely to escalate care than novices and experts (p=0.005). While there was variance in escalation practice related to system factors, these associations were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The safety of deteriorating ED patients may be improved by informing care based on the escalation practices of staff with intermediate ED experience and competence levels.","Connell, Clifford J; Endacott, Ruth; Cooper, Simon",Australas.

In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a “sandwich” complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic beads. rRBD-15 from the competitive biopanning of our synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection with IC50values of 12 nM. Nevertheless, rRBD-16 from the standard biopanning can only bind to RBD in vitro, but not have the blocking or neutralization activity. Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Zeng, Xin; Li, Lingfang; Lin, Jing; Li, Xinlei; Liu, Bin; Kong, Yang; Zeng, Shunze; Du, Jianhua; Xiao, Huahong; Zhang, Tao; Zhang, Shelin; Liu, Jianghai",Antib. ther.,,284

It is all the more important to understand the characteristics of the virus and to utilize them diagnostically, therapeutically and epidemiologically. This article firstly elucidates the medical importance of coronaviruses in general. Then angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the binding site of SARS-CoV­2 and the possible influence on the disease susceptibility are explained. The gold standard for detection of an active SARS-CoV­2 infection is the direct detection of the pathogen with nucleic acid amplification techniques. At the onset of symptoms, a swab of the upper airway is especially suitable due to the high viral burden. At a later stage direct detection can be achieved in samples from the lower airway or a stool or anal swab. Antigen or antibody tests cannot replace the direct detection of the pathogen; however, the detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies are of special interest for epidemiological questions (seroconversion time of sometimes several weeks). The plaque reduction neutralization test exclusively detects antibodies which neutralize viruses but the procedure is complicated. In addition, the importance of these antibodies with respect to immunity against a second infection is uncertain. Thanks to modern techniques thousands of SARS-CoV­2 sequences are already available, which show a genomic variability. The D614G mutation in the S spikes seems to cause a higher infectiosity. Mutations can impair the diagnostics and treatment, which makes monitoring necessary.","Hoehl, S; Ciesek, S",Internist (Berl),,284
227929,Comparison of Different Optimizers Implemented on the Deep Learning Architectures for COVID-19 Classification,2021,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to significant disruptions in the healthcare system including surges of infected patients exceeding local capacity, closures of primary care offices, and delays of non-emergent medical care. Government-initiated measures to decrease healthcare utilization (i.e., ""flattening the curve"") have included shelter-in-place mandates and social distancing, which have taken effect across most of the USA. We evaluate the immediate impact of the Public Health Messaging and shelter-in-place mandates on Emergency Department (ED) demand for radiology services. METHODS: We analyzed ED radiology volumes from the five University of California health systems during a 2-week time period following the shelter-in-place mandate and compared those volumes with March 2019 and early April 2019 volumes. RESULTS: ED radiology volumes declined from the 2019 baseline by 32 to 40% (p < 0.001) across the five health systems with a total decrease in volumes across all 5 systems by 35% (p < 0.001). Stratifying by subspecialty, the smallest declines were seen in non-trauma thoracic imaging, which decreased 18% (p value < 0.001), while all other non-trauma studies decreased by 48% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Total ED radiology demand may be a marker for public adherence to shelter-in-place mandates, though ED chest radiology demand may increase with an increase in COVID-19 cases.","Houshyar, Roozbeh; Tran-Harding, Karen; Glavis-Bloom, Justin; Nguyentat, Michael; Mongan, John; Chahine, Chantal; Loehfelm, Thomas W; Kohli, Marc D; Zaragoza, Edward J; Murphy, Paul M; Kampalath, Rony",Emerg Radiol,,284

230026,Modeling and controlling the spread of epidemic with various social and economic scenarios,2021,"Although Vietnam has been successful in the fight against the first wave of COVID-19, domestic outbreaks have continued to occur. Given university students constitute a significant proportion of the population in Vietnam, to improve the prevention and control of COVID-19 in Vietnam and comparable countries, we examined their knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards face mask use which is an important preventive measure and the association between the levels of COVID-19 knowledge and KAP towards face mask use. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on all students studying at Phenikaa University, Hanoi, using a self-developed questionnaire consisted of 42 questions regarding KAP towards face mask use as well as reuse of cloth mask, and COVID-19 knowledge. Among 728 participants, 40.9% (298/728) were male, 63.2% (460/728) were from health-related faculties, 46% (335/728) lived in urban areas, and 51.9% (378) had good levels of COVID-19 knowledge. Regarding face mask, most (89.7%, 653/728) participants had good knowledge scores, 72.8% (530/728) had positive attitudes, and 76.5% (557/728) had good practice scores. The most common types of masks used were surgical mask (57.6%, 419/728), followed by non-antibacterial cloth mask (23.1%, 168/728). Among 168 participants using non-antibacterial cloth mask, 43.5% reused masks (73/168), of whom 6.8% (5/73) did not wash their masks at least daily. Face mask use knowledge was statistically associated with COVID-19 knowledge (P < 0.001). Face mask use attitudes were statistically associated with education levels (P = 0.02), and COVID-19 knowledge (P < 0.001). Practice of face mask use was statistically associated with gender (P = 0.03), geographical distribution (P = 0.04), academic majors (P = 0.02), and COVID-19 knowledge (P = 0.01). The levels of KAP towards face mask use among Vietnamese university students are high. It is important to continue to enforce the mass masking policy, together with the ongoing community education with an emphasis on the route of COVID-19 transmission and how correct face mask use can stop the spread. To ensure the effectiveness of face masks, there is an urgent need to educate the community regarding the procedures for cloth masks re-use.","Duong, Minh Cuong; Nguyen, Hong Trang; Duong, Bich Thuy",J. community health,,284

Most infected people have mild or moderate symptoms and recover without the need for extensive treatment. However, for seriously ill patients, no specific treatments are currently available. Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), a passive immunotherapy, involves infusing plasma from recovered people into actively infected people, and is thought to be a specific intervention to improve outcome in patients with severe COVID-19. The presumed mechanism involves neutralizing antibodies and antibody dependent cytotoxicity/phagocytosis. Previous CPT trials showed an effect in SARS and pilot studies suggest CPT is an effective and safe strategy for seriously ill COVID-19 patients. CPT is currently being tested in large randomized clinical trials. Herein, we critically review the mechanism, applications and the challenges for CPT in the treatment of severe COVID-19, paving the way toward vaccine and immunotherapy development.","Ouyang, Jing; Isnard, Stéphane; Lin, John; Fombuena, Brandon; Peng, Xiaorong; Routy, Jean-Pierre; Chen, Yaokai",Front Immunol,,284

Our analysis is highly pertinent given that the World Health Organisation acknowledges that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted by respiratory droplets, and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recognises that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur. In our theoretical treatment, the virion is assimilated to a core-shell nanoparticle, and contributions of various interaction energies to the virion-PM association (electrostatic, hydrophobic, London-van der Waals, etc.) are generically included. We review the limited available literature on the physicochemical features of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and identify knowledge gaps. Despite the lack of quantitative data, our conceptual framework qualitatively predicts that virion-PM entities are largely able to maintain equilibrium on the timescale of their diffusion towards the host cell surface. Comparison of the relevant mass transport coefficients reveals that virion biointernalization demand by alveolar host cells may be greater than the diffusive supply. Under such conditions both the free and PM-sorbed virions may contribute to the transmitted dose. This result points to the potential for PM to serve as a shuttle for delivery of virions to host cell targets. Thus, our critical review reveals that the chemodynamics of virion-PM interactions may play a crucial role in the transmission of COVID-19, and provides a sound basis for explaining reported correlations between episodes of air pollution and outbreaks of COVID-19.","Duval, Jérôme F L; van Leeuwen, Herman P; Norde, Willem; Town, Raewyn M",Adv Colloid Interface Sci,,284

RESULTS: BNT162b2 vaccination was associated with a low rate of adverse events, characterized mostly by pain at the injection site. By a mean 41 days post second dose there were no clinical episodes of rejection, as suggested by a troponin leak or allograft dysfunction. At a mean 21 days following the second dose, IgG anti-RBD antibodies were detectable in 14 (18%) HT recipients. Immune sera neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus in 8 (57%) of those with IgG anti-RBD antibodies.

Among patients with malignant diseases, those with hematologic neoplasms are at a higher risk for poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to register treatment modifications associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and their short-term consequences in Latin America. METHODS: Multicenter, prospective, observational, cohort study including patients older than 14 years from 14 centers in four countries (Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, and Panama) who had a confirmed diagnosis of acute leukemia, and who were undergoing active treatment since the first COVID-19 case in each country until the cutoff on July 15, 2020. RESULTS: We recruited 635 patients. Treatment modifications because of the COVID-19 pandemic were reported in 40.8% of cases. The main reason for such modifications was logistic issues (55.0%) and the most frequent modification was chemotherapy delay (42.0%). A total of 13.1% patients developed COVID-19 disease, with a mortality of 37.7%. Several factors were identified as independently associated with mortality, including a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (odds ratio 2.38 [95% CI, 1.47 to 3.84]; P < .001), while the use of telemedicine was identified as a protective factor (odds ratio 0.36 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.82]; P = .014).

As BSL seems to be more and more implemented in many higher education institutions, especially in the current context of the COVID‐19 pandemic, and given the recent interest and scarce published research in BSL, more studies are needed on this kind of learning. The purpose of this research was to explore students and instructors perspective regarding their experience in BSL, according to three dimensions: pedagogy, technology and organization/logistics. To meet the study objective, a qualitative methodology was adopted. The study participants were remote students (n = 4) and face‐to‐face students (n = 4) enrolled in a graduate program in education offering only blended synchronous courses, and instructors (n = 5) in this program. Semi‐structured interviews were selected as the data collection method. Nine sub‐themes in reference to the three dimensions emerged from the study participants. They have also highlighted some challenges associated with BSL. The results reported in this study should provide faculties and higher education administrators with additional information and guidance, based on empirical data, on the use of BSL if they wish to implement it in academic programs. Moreover, in regard to the challenges revealed by the study participants, the results will permit to surpass the obstacles when implementing BSL successfully.

The advent of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has fundamentally changed these traditional learning opportunities by causing a nationwide reliance on virtual education environments and reducing the clinical diversity of cases encountered by EM trainees.We propose an innovative case conference that combines low-fidelity simulation with elements of gamification to foster the development of clinical reasoning skills and increase engagement among trainees during a virtual conference. After a team of residents submits a real clinical case that challenged their clinical reasoning abilities, a different team of residents ""plays"" through a gamified, simulated version of the case live on a video conference call. The case concludes with a facilitated debriefing led by a simulation-trained faculty, where both the resident teams and live virtual audience discuss the challenges of the case. Participants described how the Challenging Case Conference improved their perceptions of their clinical reasoning skills. Audience members reported increased engagement compared to traditional conferences. Participants also reported an unexpected, destigmatizing effect on the discussion of medical errors produced by this exercise. Residency programs could consider implementing a similar case conference as a component of their conference curriculum.","Kobner, Scott; Grassini, Molly; Le, Nhu-Nguyen; Riddell, Jeff",West J Emerg Med,,284

239594,Subset Node Representation Learning over Large Dynamic Graphs,2021-06-03,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence suggesting that quarantine might have undesirable psychological impacts on the patients. Therefore, it is important to seek for ways to increase the resilience and alleviate the psychological pressure of the patients who are quarantined due to infection with COVID-19. The present study was conducted to assess an online multimedia psychoeducational intervention regarding the feasibility, adherence, patient satisfaction and effectiveness on resilience and perceived stress of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. METHOD: This was a pilot cluster randomized parallel-controlled trial with hospital wards as the units of randomization. Participants in this fully online trial were 50 consecutive patients who were hospitalized in 2 hospitals in Shiraz, after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Before the beginning of the intervention, four inpatient wards inside two of the hospitals were randomly assigned to either intervention or control conditions. All eligible participants in the wards allocated to the intervention condition received online multimedia psychoeducational interventions during the 2 weeks, whilst the patients in the wards allocated to the control condition were offered the opportunity to receive telephone-based psychological counseling if needed. Psychoeducational interventions mainly included cognitive-behavioural techniques, stress management techniques, mindfulness-based stress reduction and positive psychotherapy. The patients were assessed regarding resilience and perceived stress at baseline and after two weeks. RESULTS: Of 27 patients starting multimedia psychoeducational interventions, 26 (96.29%) completed post-assessments. A high level of adherence (80.76%) and satisfaction (Mean = 29.42; SD = 4.18) with the online multimedia psychoeducational interventions was found. Compared with the control group, the patients who used online multimedia psychoeducational interventions reported greater resilience (Meanintervention = 81.74; Meancontrol = 72.86; adjusted t (46) = 2.10; p = 0.04; CI: 0.39 to 17.38; dppc2 = 0.83) and fewer perceived stress (Meanintervention = 22.15; Meancontrol = 29.45; adjusted t (46) = 2.66; p = 0.01; CI: - 12.81 to - 1.78; dppc2 = - 0.77) after 2 weeks. DISCUSSION: The findings of the present study provided a successful first attempt at implementing feasible online multimedia psychoeducational interventions to promote resilience and mitigate stress among the patients who were hospitalized due to infection with COVID-19. The present results could help mental health professionals to determine which psychological techniques should be emphasized to promote patients' resilience in the context of COVID-19 disease.

To study the specific antibody responses would contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19. METHODS: We collected complete follow-up data from 777 patients with pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 with corresponding immunoglobulin G and M (IgG/IgM) testing results. RESULTS: Overall, the positive rates of IgG and IgM in severe patients were slightly higher than those in non-severe patients. In addition, higher IgG levels were detected in severe patients compared to non-severe patients (P = 0.026). Through further analysis, differences in IgG were only significant in serum samples taken in the first 14 days of disease onset (P < 0.001). On the basis of analysis of antibody expression levels at different time points in 74 patients who had undergone more than three detection tests, we found that the differences in IgG levels between the severe/non-severe patients were more pronounced than those of IgM. On multivariate logistic regression, after adjusting for cofactors, the higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) IgG levels observed in the first 14 days of disease onset were independently associated with severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio (OR) = 1.368, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.138-1.645). CONCLUSION: We observed differences in antibody responses among patients with different severity of COVID-19. A high IgG level in the first 14 days of disease may be positively associated with disease severity.","Lu, Wanrong; Wu, Ping; He, Liang; Meng, Yifan; Wu, Peng; Ding, Wencheng; Liu, Jia",,,284
241806,Identifying mortality factors from Machine Learning using Shapley values - a case of COVID19,2021,"BackgroundMuch research shows that blood calcidiol (25(OH)D3) levels correlate strongly with SARS-CoV-2 infection severity. There is open discussion regarding whether low D3 is caused by the infection or if deficiency negatively affects immune defense. The aim of this study was to collect further evidence on this topic. MethodsSystematic literature search was performed to identify retrospective cohort as well as clinical studies on COVID-19 mortality rates versus D3 blood levels. Mortality rates from clinical studies were corrected for age, sex and diabetes. Data were analyzed using correlation and linear regression. ResultsOne population study and seven clinical studies were identified, which reported D3 blood levels pre-infection or on the day of hospital admission. They independently showed a negative Pearson correlation of D3 levels and mortality risk (r(17)=-.4154, p=.0770/r(13)=-.4886, p=.0646). For the combined data, median (IQR) D3 levels were 23.2 ng/ml (17.4 - 26.8), and a significant Pearson correlation was observed (r(32)=-.3989, p=.0194). Regression suggested a theoretical point of zero mortality at approximately 50 ng/ml D3. ConclusionsThe two datasets provide strong evidence that low D3 is a predictor rather than a side effect of the infection. Despite ongoing vaccinations, we recommend raising serum 25(OH)D levels to above 50 ng/ml to prevent or mitigate new outbreaks due to escape mutations or decreasing antibody activity.

At the critical time of epidemic prevention and control in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the excellent achievements of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) show the advantages and contributions of TCM. In view of the complexity of the symptoms of patients with coronavirus infection, the diversity of organ and tissue damage and functional damage or failure, how to adapt to the needs of clinical prevention and treatment is not only a problem of modern medicine, but also a problem of TCM. In this review article, the authors combed the research of TCM prescription and single medicine after understanding the cause of coronavirus infection and pathogenicity and multiple organ dysfunction and failure caused by coronavirus. Based on the emphasis on the TCM scientific research and application, the TCM therapeutic effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection is discussed. The framework of new drug research and development based on possible “target” is proposed, and we put forward the ideas for researching new TCM products through the expanding molecular mechanism of infection.","Liu, Chang-Xiao; Wang, Yu-Li; Zhang, Hong-Bing; Tian, Cheng-Wang; Huang, He; Zhang, Tie-Jun",Chin.

245588,Organizing a Successful Artificial Intelligence Online Conference: Lessons from the 13th Symposium on Combinatorial Search,2021,"Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is a global pandemic. The Covid-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overloaded healthcare systems that need medication to be rapidly established, at least to minimize the incidence of Covid-19. The co-infection with other microorganisms has drastically affected human health. Due to the utmost necessity to treat the patient infected with Covid-19 earliest, poor diagnosis and misuse of antibiotics may lead the world where no more drugs are available even to treat mild infections. Besides, sanitizers and disinfectants used to help minimize widespread coronavirus infection risk also contribute to an increased risk of antimicrobial resistance. To ease the situation, zinc supplements' potentiality has been explored and found to be an effective element to boost the immune system. Zinc also prevents the entry of the virus by increasing the ciliary beat frequency. Furthermore, the limitations of current antiviral agents such as a narrow range and low bioavailability can be resolved using nanomaterials, which are considered an important therapeutic alternative for the next generation. Thus, the development of new antiviral nanoagents will significantly help tackle many potential challenges and knowledge gaps. This review paper provides profound insight into how Covid-19 and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are interrelated and the possible implications and current strategies to fight the ongoing pandemic.","Goel, Nikky; Ahmad, Razi; Fatima, Huma; Khare, Sunil Kumar",Med Drug Discov,,284

This study aimed to review the association of COVID-19 with renal involvement. Evidence Acquisition: International databases, including the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched for articles by April 1, 2020. Keywords were COVID-19, coronavirus disease, SARS-CoV-2, kidney, renal function, acute kidney injury, and acute renal failure, or a combination of them in title/abstracts. Results: There were a few studies concerning COVID-19 and renal failure due to the short time elapsed from the epidemic onset. The results showed that hematuria and proteinuria were common in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Patients with elevated creatinine are at risk of mortality two times more than patients with normal creatinine. Also, elevated BUN, proteinuria, and hematuria can increase the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 up to four times compared to patients with normal tests. Therefore, it is important to check creatinine, BUN, proteinuria, and hematuria in primary assessments. Generally, all routine measures for people affected with COVID-19 can be done for COVID-19 patients with acute renal failure until the current knowledge is changed. Chloroquine phosphate may improve the chance of treatment.","Lotfi, Behzad; Farshid, Saman; Dadashzadeh, Nahid; Valizadeh, Rohollah; Rahimi, Mohammad Mohsen",Jundishapur J. Microbiol.,,284

There is a need to identify effective health behaviors to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the regional differences in mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress, in light of the state-level prevalence of COVID-19 cases; (2) estimate the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and health behavior engagement (ie, physical activity, mindfulness meditation); and (3) explore the mediating effect of health behavior engagement on the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to a sample of US adult paying subscribers to the Calm app (data were collected from April 22 to June 3, 2020). The survey assessed COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; health behavior engagement; and mental health (ie, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety and depression). Statistical analyses were performed using R software. Differences in COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and mental health by location were assessed using t tests and chi-square tests. Logistic and ordinary least squares models were used to regress mental health and health behavior on COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; moreover, causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the significance of the mediation effects. RESULTS: The median age of the respondents (N=8392) was 47 years (SD 13.8). Participants in the Mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) reported higher levels of stress, more severe depression symptoms, greater worry about COVID-19, paying more attention to COVID-19-related news, and more stress related to social distancing recommendations than participants living in other regions. The association between worry about COVID-19 and perceived stress was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001), strength of meditation habit (P<.001), and stopping meditation (P=.046). The association between worry about COVID-19 and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001) and strength of meditation habit (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings describe the mental health impact of COVID-19 and outline how continued participation in health behaviors such as physical activity and mindfulness meditation reduce worsening of mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These data have important implications for public health agencies and health organizations to promote the maintenance of health habits to reduce the residual mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Green, Jennifer; Huberty, Jennifer; Puzia, Megan; Stecher, Chad",JMIR Ment Health,,284

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity of healing any divide between organized medicine and state and local health officials seems self-evident. Using the recommendations abstracted from a 2005 article by Dr. Ronald Davis, ""Marriage Counseling for Medicine and Public Health,"" this cross-sectional study explores the formal relationships that existed between state-level public health and medical practice across the U.S. at the end of 2019. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to every state's senior public health official and medical society executive (N=104) between August and December 2019 to examine the extent of these entities' partnerships. Analysis was completed in January 2020. RESULTS: Among the respondents, 40%-63.1% (n=65) currently engage in the recommended activities, with 1 exception: state health departments infrequently invite medical society executives to speak at major conferences or meetings (26.2%). The majority of respondents (71.1%-85.9%) judged that each recommended activity would improve the practices of medicine and public health. CONCLUSIONS: Survey results illustrate a desire for reconciliation, but poor implementation of recommended strategies aimed at building a healthy marriage between the 2 sectors. More formal efforts are needed among state medical and public health organizations to capitalize on the current climate of rapprochement. The burden of COVID-19 on the national health system could provide a worthy cause around which these efforts would coalesce.","Scutchfield, F Douglas; Howard, Jeffrey D; Gouge, Kaylee R; Malone, Payton D; Wilson, Kaylee N",Am. j. prev. med,,284

For this reason, the present study investigates the impact of attitudes on TA behavior in 382 adolescents by gender and extent of technology use. Three scales were used to determine adolescents' TA awareness, attitude, and behavior. The results of the dual-moderated mediation model show that gender and duration of technology use (h) moderated the full mediation of attitude on awareness and behavior in TA (F = 39.29, df = 9;372, p < .01). The indirect effect in males with 16.04 h per day of technology use is stronger (.24) than the indirect effect in males with 4.90 h per day of technology use (.13). In addition, the simple slope plot shows that when attitude scores increase, addictive behavior rises in females (simple slope = .74, t = 8.79, p < .01). On the other hand, with 16.04 h per day of technology use, when attitude scores decrease, addictive behavior rises in females (simple slope = .69, t = 7.59, p < .01). Furthermore, when the attitude scores increase, addictive behavior rises in males (simple slope = .85, t = 13.26, p < .01). As a result, the psychoeducational intervention programs to be implemented for TA should not only focus on awareness, but should also encompass behavioral, cognitive and lifestyle changes.","Potas, Nihan; Açikalin, Suay Nilhan; Erçetin, Sefika Sule; Koçtürk, Nilüfer; Neyisci, Nilay; Çevik, Mehmet Sabir; Görgülü, Deniz",Curr Psychol,,284

The study aimed to evaluate the hygienic condition of posthandwashing facilities in public washrooms at different timeslots, particularly those near food courts and restaurants located in shopping malls. METHODS: This observational study was conducted in 12 public washrooms that ranged from low-end, middle-end, to high-end category on 3 different timeslots including baseline, T1 (immediate postcleaning) and T2 (1-hour postcleaning, with counting the footfall). Hand-touch surfaces with a high risk of recontamination after handwashing, which included paper tower dispensers, air drying outlets, and exit door handles, were evaluated by the surface adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence method (ATP-value). ATP-values <500 relative light units (RLUs) were considered a good hygiene. Cleaning schedules and footfalls of each sampled washroom were obtained by direct observations. RESULTS: The overall mean ATP value of washroom was 785 RLU (Nâ¯=â¯108); the ATP values of female and male washrooms at T2 were 203 and 3,718 RLUs, respectively. The highest ATP value was found on the exit door handles of male washrooms (rangeâ¯=â¯13-26,695 RLUs, meanâ¯=â¯3,229 RLU). Regarding passed/failed hygiene conditions, there were significant differences in the proportion of exit door handles between genders (P = .018) and timeslots (P = .007) as well as that of paper towel button/screw between timeslots (P= .025). CONCLUSION: Attention should be paid at the exit door handles of male washrooms, where are high risks of cross and re-contamination.","Lam, Simon Ching; Cheung, Matthew Man Fai; Au, Jessie Kit Ling; Suen, Lorna Kwai Ping",Am J Infect Control,,284

However, the need for social distancing has interrupted the delivery of continuing education for ASD children. ASD emerges in early childhood, which may cause interruptions in numerous essential areas of progress in daily life. Therefore, we proposed a mobile game, namely Basic Daily Life (BasLife) game, for ASD children. The game offered positive affection and an enjoyable experience in learning sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology was implemented to produce the BasLife game. The RAD methodology consists of four phases: Requirement Planning Phase, User Design Phase, Development Phase, and Cutover Phase. The EGame Flow Model was applied as a guideline to develop an enjoyable game during the User Design Phase and Development Phase. Keenly, the study results produce theBasLifegame as a learning approach for ASD children that would tackle the interpersonal skills and create an enjoyable learning experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

METHODS: This was a case series of Chicago COVID-19 patients aged 0-17 years reported to the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) from March 5 to April 8, 2020. Enhanced case investigation was performed. &#967;â2 and Wilcoxon 2-sample tests were used to compare characteristics among hospitalized and nonhospitalized cases. RESULTS: During March 5-April 8, 2020, 6369 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported to CDPH; 64 (1.0%) were among children aged 0-17 years. Ten patients (16%) were hospitalized, and 7 (70%) required intensive care (median length of hospitalization, 4 days [range, 1-14 days]). Reported fever and dyspnea were significantly higher in hospitalized patients than in nonhospitalized patients (9/10 vs 28/54, Pâ =â .04 and 7/10 vs 10/54, Pâ =â .002, respectively). Hospitalized patients were significantly younger than nonhospitalized patients (median, 3.5 years vs 12 years; Pâ =â .03) and all either had an underlying comorbidity or coinfection. Among the 34 unique households with multiple laboratory-confirmed infections, the median number of laboratory-confirmed infections was 2 (range, 2-5), and 31 (91%) households had at least 1 COVID-19-infected adult. For 15 households with available data to assess transmission, 11 (73%) were adult-to-child, 2 (13%) child-to-child, and 2 (13%) child-to-adult. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced case investigation of hospitalized patients revealed that underlying comorbidities and coinfection might have contributed to severe disease. Given frequency of household transmission, healthcare providers should consider alternative dispositional planning for affected families of children living with comorbidities.","Mannheim, Jonathan; Gretsch, Stephanie; Layden, Jennifer E; Fricchione, Marielle J",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,,284

Previously, the test has been strictly controlled to minimize the introduction of extraneous, nonspectro-temporal cues. Here, the effect of relaxing many of those controls was investigated to ascertain the generalizability of the STRIPES test. Preemphasis compensation was removed from the STRIPES stimuli, the test was presented over a loudspeaker at a level similar to conversational speech and above the automatic gain control threshold of the CI processor, and listeners were tested using the everyday setting of their clinical devices. There was no significant difference in STRIPES thresholds measured across conditions for the 10 CI listeners tested. One listener obtained higher (better) thresholds when listening with their clinical processor. An analysis of longitudinal results showed excellent test-retest reliability of STRIPES over multiple listening sessions with similar conditions. Overall, the results show that the STRIPES test is robust to extraneous cues, and that thresholds are reliable over time. It is sufficiently robust for use with different processing strategies, free-field presentation, and in nonresearch settings.","Archer-Boyd, Alan W; Goehring, Tobias; Carlyon, Robert P",Trends Hear,,284

Therefore, we have analysed the sequence data of ACE2 among 393 samples worldwide, focusing on South Asia. Genetically, South Asians are more related to West Eurasian populations rather than to East Eurasians. In the present analyses of ACE2, we observed that the majority of South Asian haplotypes are closer to East Eurasians rather than to West Eurasians. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the South Asian haplotypes shared with East Eurasians involved two unique event polymorphisms (rs4646120 and rs2285666). In contrast with the European/American populations, both of the SNPs have largely similar frequencies for East Eurasians and South Asians, Therefore, it is likely that among the South Asians, host susceptibility to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 will be more similar to that of East Eurasians rather than to that of Europeans.","Srivastava, Anshika; Pandey, Rudra Kumar; Singh, Prajjval Pratap; Kumar, Pramod; Rasalkar, Avinash Arvind; Tamang, Rakesh; van Driem, George; Shrivastava, Pankaj; Chaubey, Gyaneshwer",PLoS One,,284

Identifying patients at risk is critical for optimized care and early therapeutic interventions. We investigated the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 shedding relative to disease severity.We analyzed nasopharyngeal and tracheal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in 92 patients with diagnosed COVID-19. Upon admission, standardized nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum were collected. If patients were mechanically ventilated, tracheal aspirates were additionally obtained. Viral shedding was quantified by real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.45% (41 of 92) of COVID-19 had a severe disease course with the need for mechanical ventilation (severe group). At week 1, the initial viral shedding determined from nasopharyngeal swabs showed no significant difference between non-severe and severe cases. At week 2, a difference could be observed as the viral shedding remained elevated in severely ill patients. A time course of C-reactive-Protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (Il-6), and Procalcitonin (PCT) revealed an even more protracted inflammatory response following the delayed drop of virus shedding load in severely ill patients. A significant proportion (47.8%) of patients showed evidence of prolonged viral shedding (>17â days), which was associated with severe disease courses (73.2%).We report that viral shedding does not differ significantly between severe and non-severe cases upon admission to the hospital. Elevated SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the second week of hospitalisation, a systemic inflammatory reaction peaking between second and third week and prolonged viral shedding are associated with a more severe disease course.","Munker, Dieter; Osterman, Andreas; Stubbe, Hans; Muenchhoff, Maximilian; Veit, Tobias; Weinberger, Tobias; Barnikel, Michaela; Mumm, Jan-Niclas; Milger, Katrin; Khatamzas, Elham; Klauss, Sarah; Scherer, Clemens; Hellmuth, Johannes C; Giessen-Jung, Clemens; Zoller, Michael; Herold, Tobias; Stecher, Stephanie; de Toni, Enrico N; Schulz, Christian; Kneidinger, Nikolaus; Keppler, Oliver T; Behr, Jürgen; Mayerle, Julia; Munker, Stefan",Eur. respir. j,,284

OBJECTIVE: This retrospective cohort study sought to evaluate the initial clinical characteristics of pregnant patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and to develop a pregnancy-specific early warning score to identify patients at risk for clinical deterioration and requiring advanced respiratory support. STUDY DESIGN: This was a single center, retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between April 2020 and December 2020. A total of 50 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between April 2020 and November 2020 were used to create the prediction model. Initial clinical characteristics identified at the time of diagnosis were compared between patients who required advanced respiratory support and those who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms for those diagnosed during the period of April 2020 to November 2020. Risk factors associated with a requirement for advanced respiratory support were used to create the Obstetric Warning Score system. The Obstetric Warning Score system was then validated using 30 patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in December 2020. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to evaluate the test characteristics of the Obstetric Warning Score system compared with other scoring systems including the Early Warning Score, the National Early Warning Score 2, and the Maternal Early Warning Criteria. RESULTS: Women who required advanced respiratory support were more likely to present with dyspnea (100% vs 33.3%; P<.001), have a higher heart rate (113.4 beats per minute vs 93 beats per minute; P<.001), respiratory rate (23.5 breaths per minute vs 17.7 breaths per minute; P<.001), temperature (99.1°F vs 98.3°F; P=.004), and C-reactive protein level (7.4 mg/dL vs 2.4 mg/dL; P<.001).

We aimed to develop and test an online tool for patient education on pregnancy-related issues and communication with epilepsy nurses during pregnancy for women with epilepsy. METHODS: An existing national platform for online communication (1177.se) was used, and an online tool was developed by two epilepsy nurses, two neurologists, and an IT technician. The tool was launched as a complement to standard care, and patients deciding to use it were invited to participate in a survey of user experiences and knowledge questions. RESULTS: The online tool consists of two modules: one for patient education and one for TDM during pregnancy. The latter module allows scheduling of automatic reminders of blood tests that are sent to patients at set intervals. The epilepsy nurse can communicate results and suggested dose changes in the tool. A total of 48 women answered the survey: 28 had been invited to use the information module and 20 to use the TDM module. Patient experiences were generally good, and most users of the TDM module would prefer an online means of communication in future pregnancies. For epilepsy nurses, the tool provided good overview of patients currently pregnant and administrative advantages compared with traditional means of communication. SIGNIFICANCE: Online patient education and communication about TDM during pregnancy are feasible and can be a valuable part of future digitalization efforts in epilepsy care.","Lisovska, Kristina; Gustafsson, Eva; Klecki, Judith; Edelvik Tranberg, Anna; Zelano, Johan",Epilepsia Open,,284

The survey consisted of 31 questions that were classified into separate sections, including academic characteristics, college size and facilities, action taken after announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic, perception of the pandemic, opinion regarding teaching, patient flow, possible facilities to implement for short- and long-term plans, and actions suggested to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic RESULTS: Two hundred-twelve responses were received. Respondents commonly agreed that COVID-19 will have major negative effects on dental education, adversely affecting all clinical disciplines. Shifting to virtual curricula, simulation labs, and distant learning were the prevailing actions taken in different dental colleges during the pandemic. Special attention was raised by the majority of respondents regarding dental aerosolizing procedures, preferring to postpone their training to a postpandemic/later phase. Coinciding opinions suggested adopting a future dynamic hybrid strategy analysis that combines online distant learning, virtual simulation, and haptic labs together with traditional direct clinical training on real patients CONCLUSION: The future of dental education will have far-reaching changes in strategies and tools to cope with COVID-19 pandemic and the postpandemic requirements of an effective, yet safe, dental learning environment.

We invited all employees (n = 15,300) at work at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden to participate in a study examining SARS-Cov-2 antibodies in relation to registered sick leave. For consenting 12,928 healthy hospital employees antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 could be determined and compared to participant sick leave records. Subjects with viral serum antibodies were not at excess risk for future sick leave (adjusted odds ratio (OR) controlling for age and sex: 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) (0.85 (0.43-1.68)]. By contrast, subjects with antibodies had an excess risk for sick leave in the weeks prior to testing [adjusted OR in multivariate analysis: 3.34 (2.98-3.74)]. Thus, presence of viral antibodies marks past disease and protection against excess risk of future disease. Knowledge of whether exposed subjects have had disease in the past or are at risk for future disease is essential for planning of control measures.Trial registration: First registered on 02/06/20, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04411576.","Dillner, Joakim; Elfström, K Miriam; Blomqvist, Jonas; Eklund, Carina; Lagheden, Camilla; Nordqvist-Kleppe, Sara; Hellström, Cecilia; Olofsson, Jennie; Andersson, Eni; Jernbom Falk, August; Bergström, Sofia; Hultin, Emilie; Pin, Elisa; Månberg, Anna; Nilsson, Peter; Hedhammar, My; Hober, Sophia; Mattsson, Johan; Mühr, Laila Sara Arroyo; Conneryd Lundgren, Kalle",Sci Rep,,284
269518,Convolutional Neural Network Based Classification of Patients with Pneumonia using X-ray Lung Images,2020,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic calls for expanded opportunities for testing, including novel testing strategies such as home-collected specimens. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand whether oropharyngeal swab (OPS), saliva, and dried blood spot (DBS) specimens collected by participants at home and mailed to a laboratory were sufficient for use in diagnostic and serology tests of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Eligible participants consented online and were mailed a participant-collection kit to support collection of three specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing: saliva, OPS, and DBS. Participants performed the specimen collection procedures during a telehealth video appointment while clinical observers watched and documented the suitability of the collection. The biological sufficiency of the specimens for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and serology testing was assessed by laboratorians using visual inspection and quantification of the nucleic acid contents of the samples by ribonuclease P (RNase P) measurements. RESULTS: Of the enrolled participants,153/159 (96.2%) returned their kits, which were included in this analysis. All these participants attended their video appointments. Clinical observers assessed that of the samples collected, 147/153 (96.1%) of the saliva samples, 146/151 (96.7%) of the oropharyngeal samples, and 135/145 (93.1%) of the DBS samples were of sufficient quality for submission for laboratory testing; 100% of the OPS samples and 98% of the saliva samples had cycle threshold values for RNase P <30, indicating that the samples contained sufficient nucleic acid for RNA-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data indicate that most participant-collected OPS, saliva, and DBS specimens are suitable and sufficient for testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serology. Clinical observers rated the collection of specimens as suitable for testing, and visual and quantitative laboratory assessment indicated that the specimens were biologically sufficient. These data support the utility of participant-collected and mailed-in specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

In this paper, we proposed a deterministic model governed by a system of nonlinear differential equations which consider the intervention of media campaign to increase human awareness, and rapid testing to track the undetected cases in the field. Analysis of the autonomous model shows the existence of transcritical bifurcation at a basic reproduction number equal to one. We estimate our parameter using the incidence data from East Java, Indonesia. Using these parameters, we analyze the sensitivity of the parameters in determining the size of the basic reproduction number. An optimal control problem which transforms media campaign and rapid testing as a time-dependent control was conducted also in this article. Cost-effectiveness analysis using the Infection averted ratio (IAR) and the Average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) conducted to analyze the best strategies to eradicate COVID-19 spread. We observe that the combination of the media campaign and rapid testing as time-dependent interventions reduces the number of an infected individual significantly and also minimizes the economic burden due to these strategies in East Java.","Aldila, Dipo",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,284
271230,Evaluation of emergency management capability of urban community based on entropy weight and multi-layer fuzzy,2021,"Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Extension programs used web-based resources but balanced those with in-person events for interpersonal connection with producers and for individuals with limited access to technology. In 2020, in-person Extension programs were cancelled or converted to online versions. This was the case for the 'Alfalfa in the South' (AITS) program, a collaboration between Auburn University (AU) and University of Georgia (UGA). Two online AITS programs were held (May and Sept) and are examples of rethinking traditional models and optimizing resources to prioritize our commitment to clientele. In its first program, the program content was delivered through 1) a series of webinars from AU, UGA and University of Florida (UF) Extension Specialists (n = 6 webinars) and a 1-h live roundtable discussion held through Zoom on May 13, 2020. The roundtable consisted of a moderator interacting with five panelists (faculty, Extension agents and producers) answering live questions from the audience (n = 45 participants). All content was archived by the Alabama Cooperative Extension System (ACES) for later access using online resources. The second program occurred in Sept 2020 as a collaboration between AU, UF and UGA Specialists. This program included several pre-recorded short videos and e-publications on topics in establishment and management of alfalfa in the South. In 2020, the web-metrics gathered for the ACES webpage and Youtube channel across these programs sums over 3000 views of alfalfa resources. Similarly, engagement on the AL Beef and Forage Extension Facebook pages were over 3000 people. Although a traditional formal post-programming survey was not conducted with participants, an online survey was distributed simultaneously in the south region (n = 12 states) from May through December 2020 aiming to identify main challenges and limitations of alfalfa adoption. The results (n = 212 respondents) showed approximately 65% participants already invested time in learning about alfalfa using Extension online programs and resources available. This shows increased importance of online outreach as a tool to maintain relevance and connection with clientele.

This major human health emergency has been caused by a betacoronavirus, as have others in the past. In this chapter, we outline the taxonomy of betacoronaviruses and their properties, both genetic and biological. We discuss their recombinational and mutational histories separately to show that the sequence of the RaTG13 bat virus isolate is the closest currently known full-length genetic homolog of that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the RaTG13 bat virus and SARS-CoV-2 have probably diverged over 20 years. We discuss the ecology of their pangolin and bat hosts and conclude that, like other recent viral pandemics, the underlying cause of the SARS-CoV-2 emergence is probably the relentless growth of the world's human population and the overexploitation and disturbance of the environment.","Rodríguez-Román, Eduardo; Gibbs, Adrian J",Adv Exp Med Biol,,284
273536,Proposal of close contact confirmation method in cyberspace for influencer marketing,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Green House and other small nursing home (NH) models are considered ""nontraditional"" due to their size (10-12 beds), universal caregivers, and other home-like features. They have garnered great interest regarding their potential benefit to limit Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections due to fewer people living, working, visiting, and being admitted to Green House/small NHs, and private rooms and bathrooms, but this assumption has not been tested. If they prove advantageous compared with other NHs, they may constitute an especially promising model as policy makers and providers reinvent NHs post-COVID. DESIGN: This cohort study compared rates of COVID-19 infections, COVID-19 admissions/readmissions, and COVID-19 mortality, among Green House/small NHs with rates in other NHs between January 20, 2020 and July 31, 2020. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All Green House homes that held a skilled nursing license and received Medicaid or Medicare payment were invited to participate; other small NHs that replicate Green House physical design and operational practices were eligible if they had the same licensure and payer sources. Of 57 organizations, 43 (75%) provided complete data, which included 219 NHs. Comparison NHs (referred to as ""traditional NHs"") were up to 5 most geographically proximate NHs within 100 miles that had <50 beds and &#8805;50 beds for which data were available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Because Department of Veterans Affairs organizations are not required to report to CMS, they were not included. METHODS: Rates per 1000 resident days were derived for COVID-19 cases and admissions, and per 100 COVID-19 positive cases for mortality. A log-rank test compared rates between Green House/small NHs and traditional NHs with <50 beds and &#8805;50 beds. RESULTS: Rates of all outcomes were significantly lower in Green House/small NHs than in traditional NHs that had <50 beds and &#8805;50 beds (log-rank test P < .025 for all comparisons). The median (middle value) rates of COVID-19 cases per 1000 resident days were 0 in both Green House/small NHs and NHs <50 beds, while they were 0.06 in NHs &#8805;50 beds; in terms of COVID-19 mortality, the median rates per 100 positive residents were 0 (Green House/small NHs), 10 (<50 beds), and 12.5 (&#8805;50 beds). Differences were most marked in the highest quartile: 25% of Green House/small NHs had COVID-19 case rates per 1000 resident days higher than 0.08, with the corresponding figures for other NHs being 0.15 (<50 beds) and 0.74 (&#8805;50 beds). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates are less in Green House/small NHs than rates in traditional NHs with <50 and &#8805;50 beds, especially among the higher and extreme values. Green House/small NHs are a promising model of care as NHs are reinvented post-COVID.","Zimmerman, Sheryl; Dumond-Stryker, Carol; Tandan, Meera; Preisser, John S; Wretman, Christopher J; Howell, Abigail; Ryan, Susan",J.

273907,A Deep-Learning-Based Edge-Centric COVID-19-Like Pandemic Screening and Diagnosis System within a B5G Framework Using Blockchain,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if COVID-19 State of Emergency (SOE) restrictions were associated with a reduction in presentations to two urban EDs in Melbourne, Victoria. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included adult patients presenting to The Alfred and Sandringham Hospital EDs during the first month of stage 2 and 3 SOE restrictions (26 March-25 April 2020). Patients transferred from other hospitals or diagnosed with COVID-19 were excluded. The primary outcome was the average number of presentations per day. Secondary outcomes included the average daily number of presentations for pre-specified subgroups defined by triage category and diagnosis. The independent impact of SOE restrictions, adjusted for underlying trends in attendance, was determined using negative binomial regression and reported as an incident rate ratio (IRR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Average daily attendance during the exposure period was 174.7. In the absence of SOE restrictions, 278.8 presentations per day were predicted, a reduction of 37.3% (IRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.59-0.67). Attendance was lower than anticipated for all triage categories (especially category 5 [IRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.44-0.59]) and diagnostic groups (including circulatory problems [IRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50-0.76] and injury [IRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.53-0.63]). There were fewer than predicted presentations for several sentinel diagnoses, including gastroenteritis (IRR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17-0.42) and renal colic (IRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: SOE restrictions were associated with a significant reduction in ED presentations across a range of triage categories and diagnoses. Public health messaging should emphasise the importance of timely ED attendance for acute illness and injury.","Mitchell, Rob D; O039,; Reilly, Gerard M; Mitra, Biswadev; Smit, De Villiers; Miller, Jean-Philippe; Cameron, Peter A",Emerg Med Australas,,284

278826,Explainable Machine Learning for Fraud Detection,2021-05-13,"INTRODUCTION: Depression is responsible for 800 000 deaths worldwide, a number that will rise significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Affordable novel drugs with less severe side effects are urgently required. We investigated the effect of withanone (WN) from Withania somnifera on the serotonin system of wild-type and knockout Caenorhabditis elegans strains using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods. METHODS: WN or fluoxetine (as positive control drug) was administered to wild-type (N2) and knockout C. elegans strains (AQ866, DA1814, DA2100, DA2109, and MT9772) to determine their effect on oxidative stress (Trolox, H2DCFDA, and juglone assays) on osmotic stress and heat stress and lifespan. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was applied to investigate the effect of WN or fluoxetine on the expression of serotonin receptors (ser-1, ser-4, ser-7) and serotonin transporter (mod-5). The binding affinity of WN to serotonin receptors and transporter was analyzed in silico using AutoDock 4.2.6. RESULTS: WN scavenged ROS in wild-type and knockout C. elegans and prolonged their lifespan. WN upregulated the expression of serotonin receptor and transporter genes. In silico analyses revealed high binding affinities of WN to Ser-1, Ser-4, Ser-7, and Mod-5. LIMITATIONS: Further studies are needed to prove whether the results from C. elegans are transferrable to mammals and human beings. CONCLUSION: WN ameliorated depressive-associated stress symptoms by activating the serotonin system. WN may serve as potential candidate in developing new drugs to treat depression.","Naß, Janine; Efferth, Thomas",Pharmacopsychiatry,,284

Seventy-nine chest CT examinations demonstrated positive, indeterminate, and negative rates for COVID-19 of 3.79%, 24.1%, and 72.15% respectively. Three patients had discordant swab results with initially negative and subsequently positive results for SARS-CoV-2, resulting in false-negative rates of 5.1% for those retested. Combining discordant RT-PCR swab results, positive radiology, and patients treated as COVID-19-positive due to indeterminate radiology and highly consistent symptoms, resulted in a false-negative rate for initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swabs of 16.67%. CONCLUSION: Seventy-five per cent compliance with relevant WHO guidance and a false-negative rate for initial swabs of 16.67% was demonstrated. Further evidence is needed to fully determine the utility of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the context of initial false-negative RT-PCR results.","McGrath, J; Kenny, C; Smyth, H; McGinty, T; Sheehan, G; Gaine, S; McCullagh, B; MacMahon, P; Egan, J J; Cotter, A",Clin Radiol,,284

280791,Analyzing of LAM-CIoT: Lightweight Authentication Mechanism in Cloud-based IoT Environment,2020,"Although biological processes have been directly targeted to substantial advantage in effective treatments for major depression, the evidence base for addressing potential ""existential"" contributions to depressive syndromes has lagged behind that related to other tractable mediators of the condition, such as cognitive bias, nonadaptive learned behavior, and variation in monoamine neurotransmission. Whether the experience of existential conflict is a cause or an effect of these phenomena is incompletely understood. Here, we provide a clinical update on knowledge surrounding a psychotherapeutic tradition that addresses existential issues but has not consistently been invoked in contemporary approaches to adolescent depression, and we consider whether the evolution of this approach, in concert with parallel advances in positive psychology, is nearing readiness for more systematic implementation in the treatment of adolescent depression. The goal of this article is to briefly summarize the state of the literature on logotherapy and to consider ways in which its implementation might be incorporated to advantage in the approach to treating adolescent depression.","Baumel, W Thomas; Constantino, John N",J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,,284

The trapezius and serratus anterior (SA) muscles are the main stabilizers and are therefore the main target muscles of therapeutic exercises. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the current literature investigating the optimal activation ratio of the scapular muscles during a range of closed kinetic chain exercises. METHODS: A systematic review search was conducted to identify studies reporting shoulder electromyography (EMG) activity during rehabilitation exercises in healthy participants. The search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and ScienceDirect. The included studies reported closed kinetic chain exercises and the muscle activity as a percentage of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) or muscle ratios of the lower trapezius (LT), middle trapezius (MT), and SA with respect to the upper trapezius (UT). Muscle ratios were classified as optimal if they were equal to or lower than 0.6, and the adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the selected studies. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were included in this review; 7 main exercises and 30 variations of these were reported. The average electromyographic activity of the concentric and eccentric phase was considered. Half Push Up, Push Up Plus, and Scap Protraction exercises showed optimal SA activity (UT/SA < 0.6), while Press Up, Half Push Up, and One Hand Plank exercises showed optimal LT activity (UT/LT < 0.6). According to the NOS, 15 studies were classified as moderate methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: The exercises in higher positions (e.g. exercises with the trunk closest to the vertical line) or unstable surfaces tend to favor UT activity over the MT, LT and SA. The exercises including scapular retraction showed optimal UT/MT and UT/LT ratios, while those including scapular protraction showed optimal UT/SA ratios. This will assist therapists in the correct selection of exercises for shoulder rehabilitation.","Mendez-Rebolledo, Guillermo; Morales-Verdugo, Juan; Orozco-Chavez, Ignacio; Habechain, Fernanda Assis Paes; Padilla, Eleazar Lara; de la Rosa, Francisco José Berral",J. back musculoskelet. rehabil,,284

Last year, 2019-n-CoV (COVID-19) was a global threat for everyone caused by the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. 3CLpro, chymotrypsin-like protease, is a major cysteine protease that substantially contributes throughout the viral life cycle of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. It is a prospective target for the development of SARS-CoV inhibitors by applying a repurposing strategy. This review focuses on a detailed overview of the chemical synthesis and computational chemistry perspectives of peptidomimetic inhibitors (PIs) and small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) targeting viral proteinase discovered from 2004 to 2020. The PIs and SMIs are one of the primary therapeutic inventions for SARS-CoV. The journey of different analogues towards the evolution of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors and complete synthetic preparation of nineteen derivatives of PIs and ten derivatives of SMIs and their computational chemistry perspectives were reviewed. From each class of derivatives, we have identified and highlighted the most compelling PIs and SMIs for SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The protein-ligand interaction of 29 inhibitors were also studied that involved with the 3CLpro inhibition, and the frequent amino acid residues of the protease were also analyzed that are responsible for the interactions with the inhibitors. This work will provide an initiative to encourage further research for the development of effective and drug-like 3CLpro inhibitors against coronaviruses in the near future.","Paul, Abhik; Sarkar, Arnab; Saha, Sanjukta; Maji, Avik; Janah, Pritha; Kumar Maity, Tapan",Bioorg Med Chem,,284

Although previous studies have described the clinical aspects of COVID-19, few studies have focused on the early detection of severe COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of severe COVID-19 and to compare clinical features between patients with severe COVID-19 and those with less severe COVID-19. Patients admitted to designated hospital in the Henan Province of China who were either discharged or died prior to February 15, 2020 were enrolled retrospectively. Additionally, patients who underwent at least one of the following treatments were assigned to the severe group: continuous renal replacement therapy, high-flow oxygen absorption, noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The remaining patients were assigned to the non-severe group. Demographic information, initial symptoms, and first visit examination results were collected from the electronic medical records and compared between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of severe COVID-19. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify a threshold for each predictor. Altogether,104 patients were enrolled in our study with 30 and 74 patients in the severe and non-severe groups, respectively. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that patients aged &#8805;63 years (odds ratio = 41.0; 95% CI: 2.8, 592.4), with an absolute lymphocyte value of &#8804;1.02×109/L (odds ratio = 6.1; 95% CI = 1.5, 25.2) and a C-reactive protein level of &#8805;65.08mg/L (odds ratio = 8.9; 95% CI = 1.0, 74.2) were at a higher risk of severe illness. Thus, our results could be helpful in the early detection of patients at risk for severe illness, enabling the implementation of effective interventions and likely lowering the morbidity of COVID-19 patients.","Liu, Xinkui; Yue, Xinpei; Liu, Furong; Wei, Le; Chu, Yuntian; Bao, Honghong; Dong, Yichao; Cheng, Wenjie; Yang, Linpeng",PLoS One,,284

We performed a retrospective cardiopathological analysis of the heart and vasculature from 23 autopsies of COVID-19 patients, comparing the findings with control tissue. Myocardium from autopsies of COVID-19 patients was categorised into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive (n = 14) or negative (n = 9) based on the presence of viral RNA as determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Control tissue was selected from autopsies without COVID-19 (n = 10) with similar clinical sequelae. Histological characteristics were scored by ordinal and/or categorical grading. Five RT-PCR-positive cases underwent in situ hybridisation (ISH) for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with lethal COVID-19 infection were mostly male (78%) and had a high incidence of hypertension (91%), coronary artery disease (61%), and diabetes mellitus (48%). Patients with positive myocardial RT-PCR died earlier after hospital admission (5 versus 12 days, p < 0.001) than patients with negative RT-PCR. An increased severity of fibrin deposition, capillary dilatation, and microhaemorrhage was observed in RT-PCR-positive myocardium than in negatives and controls, with a positive correlation amongst these factors All cases with increased cardioinflammatory infiltrate, without myocyte necrosis (n = 4) or with myocarditis (n = 1), were RT-PCR negative. ISH revealed positivity of viral RNA in interstitial cells. Myocardial capillary dilatation, fibrin deposition, and microhaemorrhage may be the histomorphological correlate of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Increased cardioinflammation including one case of myocarditis was only detected in RT-PCR-negative hearts with significantly longer hospitalisation time. This may imply a secondary immunological response warranting further characterisation.","Haslbauer, Jasmin D; Tzankov, Alexandar; Mertz, Kirsten D; Schwab, Nathalie; Nienhold, Ronny; Twerenbold, Raphael; Leibundgut, Gregor; Stalder, Anna K; Matter, Matthias; Glatz, Katharina",J Pathol Clin Res,,284

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare changes in motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and the corresponding volume of the electrostatic field (VEsF) achieved by DBS programming using GUIDE XT&#8482;, a commercially available software for visualization of DBS leads within the patient-specific anatomy from fusions of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans, versus standard-of-care clinical programming. METHODS: Clinical evaluation was performed to identify the optimal set of parameters based on clinical effects in 29 patients with PD and bilateral directional leads for Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) DBS. A second DBS program was generated in GUIDE XT&#8482; based on a VEsF optimally located within the dorsolateral STN. Reduction of motor symptoms (Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, MDS-UPDRS) and the overlap of the corresponding VEsF of both programs were compared. RESULTS: Clinical and imaging-guided programming resulted in a significant reduction in the MDS-UPDRS scores compared to off-state. Motor symptom control with GUIDE XT&#8482;-derived DBS program was non-inferior to standard clinical programming. The overlap of the two VEsF did not correlate with the difference in motor symptom reduction by the programs. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging-guided programming of directional DBS leads using GUIDE XT&#8482; is possible without computational background and leads to non-inferior motor symptom control compared with clinical programming. DBS programs based on patient-specific imaging data may thus serve as starting point for clinical testing and may promote more efficient DBS programming.","Waldthaler, Josefine; Bopp, Miriam; Kühn, Nele; Bacara, Bugrahan; Keuler, Merle; Gjorgjevski, Marko; Carl, Barbara; Timmermann, Lars; Nimsky, Christopher; Pedrosa, David J",Brain Stimul,,284

Based on the perspective of cereals trade networks (CTN), the pandemic risk is combined with the trade intensity between countries, and an assessment model of cereals external supply risk is constructed that includes external dependence index (EDI), import concentration, and risk of COVID-19 from import countries index (RICI). The results show that: (1) the global main CTN have typical scale-free characteristics, and seven communities are detected under the influence of the core countries;(2) about 60%, 50%, and 70% of countries face risks of medium and above (high and very high) external dependence, concentration of imports, and COVID-19 in the country of origin, respectively. Under the influence of the pandemic, the risk of global external cereal supply index (RECSI) has increased by 65%, and the USA-CAN communities show the highest risk index;(3) the countries with a very high risk are mainly the Pacific island countries and the Latin American and African countries. In addition, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and 80% of the net food-importing developing countries are at high or very high RECSI levels. Approximately 50% of countries belong to the compound risk type, and many export countries belong to the RICI risk type;(4) global external food supply is subjected to multiple potential threats such as trade interruption, “price crisis”, and “payment dilemma”. The geographical proximity of community members and the geographical proximity of the pandemic risk is superimposed, increasing the regional risk of external food supply;and (5) this study confirms that the food-exporting countries should avoid the adoption of food export restriction measures and can prevent potential external supply risks from the dimensions of maintaining global food liquidity and promoting diversification of import sources. We believe that our assessment model of cereals external supply risk comprises a useful method for investigations regarding the international CTN or global food crisis under the background of the pandemic.","Zhang, Chao Yang Yanzhao Feng Zhiming Xiao Chiwei Lang Tingting Du Wenpeng Liu Ying",Foods,,284

We retrospectively investigated associations between SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure or death with receipt of the aforementioned medications and with pre-COVID-19 neutropenia. The study included all cancer patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center until June 2, 2020 (N = 820). We controlled for cancer-related characteristics known to predispose to worse COVID-19 as well as level of respiratory support during corticosteroid administration. Corticosteroid administration was associated with worse outcomes prior to use of supplemental oxygen; no statistically significant difference was observed in sicker cohorts. In patients with metastatic thoracic cancer, 9 of 25 (36%) and 10 of 31 (32%) had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive immunotherapy, respectively. Seven of 23 (30%) and 52 of 187 (28%) patients with hematologic cancer had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive anti-CD20 therapy, respectively. Chemotherapy itself was not associated with worse outcomes, but pre-COVID-19 neutropenia was associated with worse COVID-19 course. Relative prevalence of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia in previous studies may account for different conclusions regarding the risks of chemotherapy in patients with COVID-19.

These nanoparticles can be tailor-made with specific functions and properties including bioavailability. To the best of our knowledge, in this study we show for the first time that a tailored titanium oxide nanoparticle interacts specifically with a unique site of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 protein. This can be developed potentially into a tool for selective control of viral protein functions.","Agback, Peter; Agback, Tatiana; Dominguez, Francisco; Frolova, Elena I; Seisenbaeva, Gulaim; Kessler, Vadim",,,284

295968,XIRL: Cross-embodiment Inverse Reinforcement Learning,2021-06-07,"OBJECTIVE: At the end of 2019, the Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread rapidly from China to the whole world. Circadian rhythms can play crucial role in the complex interplay between viruses and organisms, and temporized schedules (chronotherapy) have been positively tested in several medical diseases. We aimed to compare the possible effects of a morning vs. evening antiviral administration in COVID patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all patients admitted to COVID internal medicine units with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and treated with darunavir-ritonavir (single daily dose, for seven days). Age, sex, length of stay (LOS), pharmacological treatment, and timing of antiviral administration (morning or evening), were recorded. Outcome indicators were death or LOS, and laboratory parameters, e.g., variations in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2, mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) (PaO2/FiO2), and leucocyte count. RESULTS: The total sample consisted of 151 patients, 33 (21.8%) of whom were selected for antiviral treatment. The mean age was 61.8±18.3 years, 17 (51.5%) were male, and the mean LOS was 13.4±8.6 days. Nine patients (27.3%) had their antiviral administration in the morning, and 24 (72.7%) had antiviral administration in the evening. No fatalities occurred. Despite the extremely limited sample size, morning group subjects showed a significant difference in CRP variation, compared to that in evening group subjects (-65.82±33.26 vs. 83.32±304.89, respectively, p<0.032). No significant differences were found for other parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This report is the first study evaluating temporized morning vs. evening antiviral administration in SARS-CoV-2 patients. The morning regimen was associated with a significant reduction in CRP values. Further confirmations with larger and multicenter samples of patients could reveal novel potentially useful insights.","De Giorgi, A; Fabbian, F; Di Simone, E; Greco, S; De Giorgio, R; Zuliani, G; Passaro, A; Caselli, E; Manfredini, R",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,284

300801,A Demonstration of Machine Learning in Detecting Frequency Following Responses in American Neonates,2020,"Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus can lead to variable clinical outcomes. Approximately 40% of those infected will remain asymptomatic;with a similar percentage developing a mild to moderate illness, essentially localized to the respiratory system. A markedly more severe and extensive illness involving multiple organs occurs in the remaining approximately 20% of those infected. A further intriguing consequence of Covid-19 disease is the continuing illness in about 10% of those with either the mild to moderate or the more severe acute Covid-19 disease. This Long Covid-19 syndrome has many features in common with the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The concept of coinfecting virus pathogens is central to understanding several human diseases. Another useful concept is that of stealth adapted viruses. These viruses differ from the viruses from which they are derived in not typically evoking inflammation. This is because of deletion or mutation of the genes coding for the relatively few virus components that are normally targeted by the cellular immune system. It is a generic process that can potentially apply to all viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Stealth adaptation has occurred with the cytomegaloviruses of rhesus and African green monkeys. Kidney cells from African green monkeys are still being used to produce poliovirus vaccines. DNA sequencing studies on these monkey-derived stealth adapted viruses show that in addition to deletions or mutations of some of the originating virus genes, stealth adaptation can involve the incorporation of additional genetic sequences from cells, other viruses, and bacteria. These ?renegade? sequences become components within the reformed, replicating and infectious stealth adapted viruses. The variable and diverse genetic compositions of different stealth adapted viruses are likely to at least occasionally include some elements that are interactive with genes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This could lead to the potentiation of either or both viruses with added pathogenicity for the infected individual. Moreover, although the residual virus components may not be ordinarily immunogenic, some may become so if the virus levels are greatly increased and/or the immune system is sufficiently stimulated. A strong case can be made for a role of stealth adapted viruses in patients with the Long Covid-19 syndrome. These patients can be divided into those who had similar but milder symptoms prior to Covid-19 and those who had previously been asymptomatic. The former patients were probably infected earlier with a stealth adapted virus, which has now become potentiated through its interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The later patients are likely to be newly infected with a stealth adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus. The next step in exploring this hypothesis is to culture the blood of patients for evidence of infection with stealth adapted viruses, followed by genetic sequencing of the positive cultures. The testing should include patients who have experienced severe acute Covid-19 illness and patients with the Long Covid-19 syndrome. Identifying severe acute Covid-19 illness as a co-infection and the realization that the Long Covid-19 syndrome is also an infectious and transmissible disease will have important Public Health implications with regards to an expanding spectrum of human illnesses.","Martin, W.

301184,A Blockchain-Based Artificial Intelligence-Empowered Contagious Pandemic Situation Supervision Scheme Using Internet of Drone Things,2021,"Code mixing (or code switching) is a common phenomenon observed in social-media content generated by a linguistically diverse user-base. Studies show that in the Indian sub-continent, a substantial fraction of social media posts exhibit code switching. While the difficulties posed by code mixed documents to further downstream analyses are well-understood, lending visibility to code mixed documents under certain scenarios may have utility that has been previously overlooked. For instance, a document written in a mixture of multiple languages can be partially accessible to a wider audience; this could be particularly useful if a considerable fraction of the audience lacks fluency in one of the component languages. In this paper, we provide a systematic approach to sample code mixed documents leveraging a polyglot embedding based method that requires minimal supervision. In the context of the 2019 India-Pakistan conflict triggered by the Pulwama terror attack, we demonstrate an untapped potential of harnessing code mixing for human well-being: starting from an existing hostility diffusing \emph{hope speech} classifier solely trained on English documents, code mixed documents are utilized as a bridge to retrieve \emph{hope speech} content written in a low-resource but widely used language - Romanized Hindi.

Yet despite the threat posed to the scientific enterprise, there is no agreement concerning alternative approaches for evidence assessment. This lack of consensus reflects long-standing issues concerning Bayesian methods, the principal alternative to NHST. We report on recent work that builds on an approach to inference put forward over 70 years ago to address the well-known""Problem of Priors""in Bayesian analysis, by reversing the conventional prior-likelihood-posterior (""forward"") use of Bayes's Theorem. Such Reverse-Bayes analysis allows priors to be deduced from the likelihood by requiring that the posterior achieve a specified level of credibility. We summarise the technical underpinning of this approach, and show how it opens up new approaches to common inferential challenges, such as assessing the credibility of scientific findings, setting them in appropriate context, estimating the probability of successful replications, and extracting more insight from NHST while reducing the risk of misinterpretation. We argue that Reverse-Bayes methods have a key role to play in making Bayesian methods more accessible and attractive for evidence assessment and research synthesis. As a running example we consider a recently published meta-analysis from several randomized controlled clinical trials investigating the association between corticosteroids and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Held, Leonhard; Matthews, Robert; Ott, Manuela; Pawel, Samuel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13443v2.pdf,284

METHODS: We reviewed 218 intubated patients at Stony Brook University Hospital and stratified them into three groups based on AGI severity, according to data collected in the first 10 days of ICU course. We used chi-square test to compare categorical variables such as age and sex and two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-tests for continuous variables, including important laboratory values. Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to determine whether AGI score was an independent predictor of survival, and multivariable analysis was performed to compare risk factors that were deemed significant in the univariable analysis. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis based on the AGI score and the presence of FI. RESULTS: The overall incidence of AGI was 95% (45% AGI I/II, 50% AGI III/IV), and FI incidence was 63%. Patients with AGI III/IV were more likely to have prolonged mechanical ventilation (22 days vs 16 days, P-value <0.002) and higher mortality rate (58% vs 28%, P-value <0.001) compared to patients with AGI 0/I/II. This was confirmed with multivariable analysis which showed that AGI score III/IV was an independent predictor of higher mortality (AGI III/IV vs AGI 0/I/II hazard ratio (HR), 2.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.69-4.25; P-value <0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that both AGI III/IV and FI (P-value <0.001) were associated with worse outcomes. Patients with AGI III/IV had higher daily and mean D-dimer and CRP levels compared to AGI 0/I/II (P-value <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AGI and FI among critically ill COVID-19 patients was high. AGI grades III/IV were associated with higher risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation and mortality compared to AGI 0/I/II, while it also correlated with higher D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. FI was independently associated with higher mortality. The development of high-grade AGI and FI during the first days of ICU stay can serve as prognostic tools to predict outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Drakos, Panagiotis; Volteas, Panagiotis; Cleri, Nathaniel A; Alkadaa, Leor N; Asencio, Anthony A; Oganov, Anthony; Pryor, Aurora; Talamini, Mark; Rubano, Jerry; Bannazadeh, Mohsen; Mikell, Charles B; Spaniolas, Konstantinos; Mofakham, Sima",J. gastrointest. surg,,284

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association of disability status with the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test positivity and the risk of major adverse clinical outcomes among participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This study included all patients (n = 8070) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and individuals without COVID-19 (n = 121,050) in South Korea from January 1 to May 30, 2020. The study variables included officially registered disability status from the government, SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, and major adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death). RESULTS: The study participants included 129,120 individuals (including 7261 PwDs), of whom 8070 (6.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, PwDs had an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity compared with people without disabilities (odds ratio [OR]: 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-1.48).

In this article, we review findings of how aging alters immunity to respiratory viral infections to identify age-impacted pathways common to several viral pathogens, permitting us to speculate about potential mechanisms of age-enhanced mortality to COVID-19. Aging generally leads to exaggerated innate immunity, particularly in the form of elevated neutrophil accumulation across murine and large animal studies of influenza infection. COVID-19 patients who succumb exhibit a 2-fold increase in neutrophilia, suggesting that exaggerated innate immunity contributes to age-enhanced mortality to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation in relevant experimental models will elucidate the mechanisms by which aging impacts respiratory viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of viral coinfection and macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection on M. pneumoniae pneumonia in hospitalized children and build a model to predict a severe disease course. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were collected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia meeting our protocol who were admitted to Shanghai Children's Medical Center from December 1, 2016, to May 31, 2019. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis, M. pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors for adenovirus coinfection and macrolide-resistant mycoplasma infection. RESULTS: Among the 107 M. pneumoniae pneumonia patients, the coinfection rate was 56.07%, and 60 (60/107, 56.07%) patients were infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. Adenovirus was the most prevalent coinfecting organism, accounting for 22.43% (24/107). The classification tree confirmed that viral coinfection was more common in patients younger than 3 years old. Adenovirus coinfection and drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection occurred more commonly in patients with refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia (P = 0.019; P = 0.001). A prediction model including wheezing, lung consolidation and extrapulmonary complications was used to predict adenovirus coinfection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.795 (95% CI 0.679-0.893, P < 0.001). A prolonged fever duration after the application of macrolides for 48 h was found more commonly in patients infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae (P = 0.002). A fever duration longer than 7 days was an independent risk factor for drug-resistant Mycoplasma infection (OR = 3.500, 95% CI = 1.310-9.353, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia is associated with adenovirus coinfection and infection by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. A prediction model combining wheezing, extrapulmonary complications and lung consolidation can be used to predict adenovirus coinfection in children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. A prolonged fever duration indicates drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection, and a reasonable change in antibiotics is necessary.","Zhou, Yajuan; Wang, Jing; Chen, Wenjuan; Shen, Nan; Tao, Yue; Zhao, Ruike; Luo, Lijuan; Li, Biru; Cao, Qing",BMC Infect Dis,,284
309027,Detection of COVID-19 Enhanced by a Deep Extreme Learning Machine,2021,"AIMS: Atypical lymphocytes circulating in blood have been reported in COVID-19 patients. This study aims to (1) analyse if patients with reactive lymphocytes (COVID-19 RL) show clinical or biological characteristics related to outcome; (2) develop an automatic system to recognise them in an objective way and (3) study their immunophenotype. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory findings in 36 COVID-19 patients were compared between those showing COVID-19 RL in blood (18) and those without (18). Blood samples were analysed in Advia2120i and stained with May Grünwald-Giemsa. Digital images were acquired in CellaVisionDM96. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to accurately recognise COVID-19 RL. Immunophenotypic study was performed throughflow cytometry. RESULTS: Neutrophils, D-dimer, procalcitonin, glomerular filtration rate and total protein values were higher in patients without COVID-19 RL (p<0.05) and four of these patients died. Haemoglobin and lymphocyte counts were higher (p<0.02) and no patients died in the group showing COVID-19 RL. COVID-19 RL showed a distinct deep blue cytoplasm with nucleus mostly in eccentric position. Through two sequential CNNs, they were automatically distinguished from normal lymphocytes and classical RL with sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy values of 90.5%, 99.4% and 98.7%, respectively. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed COVID-19 RL are mostly activated effector memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. CONCLUSION: We found that COVID-19 RL are related to a better evolution and prognosis. They can be detected by morphology in the smear review, being the computerised approach proposed useful to enhance a more objective recognition. Their presence suggests an abundant production of virus-specific T cells, thus explaining the better outcome of patients showing these cells circulating in blood.","Merino, Anna; Vlagea, Alexandru; Molina, Angel; Egri, Natalia; Laguna, Javier; Barrera, Kevin; Boldú, Laura; Acevedo, Andrea; Díaz-Pavón, Mar; Sibina, Francesc; Bascón, Francisca; Sibila, Oriol; Juan, Manel; Rodellar, José",,,284

A recently developed field-deployable clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) detection assay with lateral flow strips shows promise for point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, the limit of detection of paper strip-based assays (10-100 copies/µL) is much lower than that of fluorescence-based detection methods. In this study, we developed an easy-readout and sensitive enhanced (ERASE) strip to visualize the results of CRISPR detection and improve the sensitivity to 1 copy/µL with an unambiguous easy-read result. Using 649 clinical samples from blind specimens collected from patients in China, we validated our ERASE assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with 90.67% positive predictive agreement and 99.21% negative predictive agreement. In conclusion, our study provided a customized CRISPR strip for use in a simple, rapid, ultrasensitive, and highly specific assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

METHODS: Muslim people with T1DM were surveyed in 13 countries between June and August 2020, shortly after the end of Ramadan (23rd April-23rd May 2020) using a simple questionnaire. RESULTS: 71.1% of muslims with T1DM fasted during Ramadan. Concerns about COVID-19 were higher in individuals &#8805;18 years (p = 0.002). The number of participants who decided not to fast plus those who received Ramadan-focused education were significantly higher in the &#8805;18-year group (p < 0.05). Hypoglycemia (60.7%) as well as hyperglycemia (44.8%) was major complications of fasting during Ramadan in both groups irrespective of age. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic had minor impact on the decision to fast Ramadan in T1DM cohort. This was higher in the age group of &#8805;18 years compared to those <18 years group. Only regional differences were noted for fasting attitude and behavior among T1DM groups.

315849,Discovering Unknown Diseases with Explainable Automated Medical Imaging,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research is to determine the change in outdoor air quality during the COVID­19 related state of emergency resulting in a lockdown and the potential health benefits for the urban population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During 53 days of the COVID­19 related state of emergency with a lockdown (March 15-May 6, 2020) in the Republic of Serbia, as well as in the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019, data on the daily sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations were analyzed. The total mortality data were analyzed to estimate the impact of the COVID­19 related lockdown measures on the burden of health in a given population, attributed to the outdoor air quality in the City of Novi Sad, using AirQ+ software. RESULTS: The average daily concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, PM10 and SO2 were reduced by 35%, 34%, 23% and 18%, respectively. In contrast, the average daily concentration of O3 increased by 8%, even if the primary precursors were reducing, thus representing a challenge for air quality management. In the City of Novi Sad, a reduction in the average daily PM2.5 concentration of 11.23 µg/m³ was significant, which resulted in a quantified number of avoided deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Air pollution in the City of Novi Sad had a chance to be improved due to some preventive measures related to the infectious disease (the COVID­19 related lockdown), which in turn was the mitigation measure to air pollution with positive public health effects. The confirmed positive effects of the improved air quality on public health could also include raising collective resistance to mass non-communicable and infectious diseases such as COVID­19 and reducing economic costs.","Dragic, Natasa; Bijelovic, Sanja; Jevtic, Marija; Velicki, Radmila; Radic, Ivana",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,,284
316091,A BLE-based monitoring system for estimating congestion on university campuses,2021,"Physical distancing, as a measure to contain the spreading of Covid-19, is defining a ""new normal"". Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: ""in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?"", ""Are there repeated offenders?"", and ""How are new crowd management measures performing?"". Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns.","Pouw, Caspar A S; Toschi, Federico; van Schadewijk, Frank; Corbetta, Alessandro",PLoS One,,284

To address this challenge, over a million citizen scientists banded together through the Folding@home distributed computing project to create the first exascale computer and simulate 0.1 seconds of the viral proteome. Our adaptive sampling simulations predict dramatic opening of the apo spike complex, far beyond that seen experimentally, explaining and predicting the existence of 'cryptic' epitopes. Different spike variants modulate the probabilities of open versus closed structures, balancing receptor binding and immune evasion. We also discover dramatic conformational changes across the proteome, which reveal over 50 'cryptic' pockets that expand targeting options for the design of antivirals.

METHODS: Seven patients presented with or developed severe bradyarrhythmias requiring pacing support during the course of their COVID-19 illness over a 6-week period of peak COVID-19 incidence. A retrospective review of their presentations and clinical course was performed. RESULTS: Symptomatic high-degree heart block was present on initial presentation in three of seven patients (43%), and four patients developed sinus arrest or paroxysmal high-degree atrioventricular block. No patients in this series demonstrated left ventricular systolic dysfunction or acute cardiac injury, whereas all patients had elevated inflammatory markers. In some patients, bradyarrhythmias occurred prior to the onset of respiratory symptoms. Death from complications of COVID-19 infection occurred in 57% (4/7) patients during the initial hospitalization and in 71% (5/7) patients within 3 months of presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite management of bradycardia with temporary (3/7) or permanent leadless pacemakers (4/7), there was a high rate of short-term morbidity and death due to complications of COVID-19.

Particular attention has been paid to delays in accessing timely pediatric care leading to unintended morbidity. In this study, we aim to describe the broader spectrum of unintended negative consequences for pediatric patients and families due to recent health care and societal changes. METHODS: All full-time doctors, dentists, and nurse practitioners working at a tertiary care children's hospital in Canada were surveyed every 2 weeks throughout the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify clinical cases in which they perceived a negative outcome associated with hospital or societal changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis followed a qualitative case series methodology using a narrative synthesis approach to determine similarities and associated themes. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-one clinicians, representing 26 hospital divisions, reported 57 unique cases in the first 6 weeks of the study. Thematic analysis of the first 50 reported cases was used to identify 6 primary themes focusing on health care quality domains as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable care). CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary case analysis, we describe the broad social and clinical impact of COVID-19 on hospitalized pediatric patients and their families. These themes highlight the unintended consequence on families, siblings, disease diagnosis, and hospital-based care provision. Recognition and understanding of the broad implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are necessary as we strive to deliver safe, high-quality, family-centered pediatric care in this new era.","Diskin, Catherine; Orkin, Julia; Agarwal, Tanvi; Parmar, Arpita; Friedman, Jeremy N",Hosp Pediatr,,284

Concerns regarding vulnerability to infections and disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and their complications have been raised. Recent published guidelines on the use of DMTs in relation to COVID-19 in MS patients have been diverse between countries with lack of evidence-based facts. In Sweden, there exists a particular interest in anti-CD20 therapy as a possible risk factor for severe COVID-19 due to the large number of rituximab-treated patients off-label in the country. Rapid responses from the Swedish MS Association (SMSS) and the Swedish MS registry (SMSreg) have resulted in national guidelines on DMT use for MS patients and implementation of a COVID-19 module in the SMSreg. Recently updated guidelines also included recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination with regard to the different DMTs. Social distancing policies forced implementation of telemedicine consultation to replace in-person consultations as part of regular MS health care. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in SMSreg have been useful in this respect. This paper reports our experiences on the progress of national MS health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to offering an overview of the present scientific context.","Landtblom, Anne-Marie; Berntsson, Shala G; Boström, Inger; Iacobaeus, Ellen",Acta neurol. scand,,284

This study aimed to investigate the differences in our surgical approach to kidney stone cases between the COVID-19 period and pre-COVID-19 period. Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) for kidney stones in our clinic between March 11, 2020, and September 11, 2020, and those in the same period 1 year ago were included in the study. Demographic information, laboratory data, stone characteristics, treatment choices and results were evaluated comparatively. Results: A total of 39 patients in the COVID-19 period (group 1) and 93 patients in the pre- COVID-19 period (group 2) underwent kidney stone surgery. While RIRS was performed to 32 of the patients in group 1, PNL was applied to seven of the patients in group 2. RIRS was performed to 70 patients in group 2, and PNL was applied to 23 of them. While the RIRS/PNL ratio was 4.5 in group 1, it was 3.04 in group 2. During the COVID-19 period, the number of patients who underwent PNL has decreased significantly. Conclusion: The number of elective surgery cases has significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is predicted that the incidence of organ loss will increase due to complications and delayed treatment. Moreover, interruption of the residents’ surgical training secondary to the decreasing number of cases is one of the pandemic’s critical drawbacks.","Batur, Ali Furkan Gülmen Mustafa Böcü Kadir Gül Murat Kaynar Mehmet Kılıç Özcan Göktaş Serdar",Journal of Urological Surgery,,284

324827,Epidemiologic evolution platform using integrated modeling and geographic information system,2021,"Human factor Xa (FXa) is a serine protease of the common coagulation pathway. FXa is known to activate prothrombin to thrombin, which eventually leads to the formation of cross-linked blood clots. While this process is important in maintaining hemostasis, excessive thrombin generation results in a host of thrombotic conditions. FXa has also been linked to inflammation via protease-activated receptors. Together, coagulopathy and inflammation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections, including the current coronavirus pandemic. Direct FXa inhibitors have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects, in addition to their established anticoagulant activity. This review summarizes the pharmacological activities of direct FXa inhibitors, their pharmacokinetics, potential drug-drug interactions and adverse effects, and the details of clinical trials involving direct FXa inhibitors in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.","Al-Horani, Rami A",Am J Cardiovasc Drugs,,284

327828,A Different World,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a surge of demand for medical supplies and spare parts, which has put pressure on the manufacturing sector. As a result, 3D printing communities and companies are currently operating to ease the breakdown in the medical supply chain. If no parts are available, 3D printing can potentially be used to produce time-critical parts on demand such as nasal swabs, face shields, respirators, and spares for ventilators. A structured search using online sources and feedback from key experts in the 3D printing area was applied to highlight critical issues and to suggest potential solutions. The prescribed outcomes were estimated in terms of cost and productivity at a small and large scale. This study analyzes the number and costs of parts that can be manufactured with a single machine within 24 h. It extrapolates this potential with the number of identical 3D printers in the world to estimate the global potential that can help practitioners, frontline workers, and those most vulnerable during the pandemic. It also proposes alternative 3D printing processes and materials that can be applicable. This new unregulated supply chain has also opened new questions concerning medical certification and Intellectual property rights (IPR). There is also a pressing need to develop new standards for 3D printing of medical parts for the current pandemic, and to ensure better national resilience.","Salmi, Mika; Akmal, Jan Sher; Pei, Eujin; Wolff, Jan; Jaribion, Alireza; Khajavi, Siavash H.",Appl.

A search strategy involving search terms corresponding to 'health', 'industrial worker', and 'Vietnam' was applied to search for related papers published in English on Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Duplicates were removed, and relevant data were extracted from the full text of remaining publications. Results showed that underlying health problems, including respiratory system problems, were common among industrial workers. Many suffered occupational diseases and/or work-related injuries. Self-treatment (without medication) was the most used method when having health problems (by 28.2% to 51% of participants), followed by visiting commune health centers (24%) and self-medication (20.3%). Findings suggest a high risk of disease spreading among industrial workers and of them suffering more severe conditions when infected. Economic vulnerabilities may be the reason for workers' reluctance to taking time off work to attend hospital/clinic. These imply a need for involving local pharmacies, commune health centers, traditional health providers or village health collaborators as local health gatekeepers who are the first point of detecting and reporting of suspected COVID-19 cases, as well as a channel where accurate information regarding COVID-19, protective equipment, and intervention packages can be delivered.

Prevention recommendations emphasize frequent testing of health care personnel and residents, but additional strategies are needed. Objective: To develop a reproducible index of nursing home crowding and determine whether crowding was associated with COVID-19 cases and mortality in the first months of the COVID-19 epidemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based retrospective cohort study included more than 78â¯000 residents across more than 600 nursing homes in Ontario, Canada, and was conducted from March 29 to May 20, 2020. Exposures: The nursing home crowding index equaled the mean number of residents per bedroom and bathroom. Main Outcomes and Measures: The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases confirmed by a validated nucleic acid amplification assay and mortality per 100 residents; the introduction of COVID-19 into a home (&#8805;1 resident case) was a negative tracer. Results: Of 623 homes in Ontario, we obtained complete information on 618 homes (99%) housing 78â¯607 residents (women, 54â¯160 [68.9%]; age &#8805;85 years, 42â¯919 [54.6%]). A total of 5218 residents (6.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, and 1452 (1.8%) died of COVID-19 infection as of May 20, 2020. COVID-19 infection was distributed unevenly across nursing homes; 4496 infections (86%) occurred in 63 homes (10%). The crowding index ranged across homes from 1.3 (mainly single-occupancy rooms) to 4.0 (exclusively quadruple occupancy rooms); 308 homes (50%) had a high crowding index (&#8805;2). Incidence in high crowding index homes was 9.7% vs 4.5% in low crowding index homes (P < .001), while COVID-19 mortality was 2.7% vs 1.3%, respectively (P < .001). The likelihood of COVID-19 introduction did not differ (high = 31.3% vs low = 30.2%; P = .79). After adjustment for regional, nursing home, and resident covariates, the crowding index remained associated with an increased incidence of infection (relative risk [RR] = 1.73, 95% CI, 1.10-2.72) and mortality (RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.99-2.87). A propensity score analysis yielded similar conclusions for infection (RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.30-3.38) and mortality (RR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.09-3.08). Simulations suggested that converting all 4-bed rooms to 2-bed rooms would have averted 998 COVID-19 cases (19.1%) and 263 deaths (18.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort of Canadian nursing homes, crowding was common and crowded homes were more likely to experience larger and deadlier COVID-19 outbreaks.","Brown, Kevin A; Jones, Aaron; Daneman, Nick; Chan, Adrienne K; Schwartz, Kevin L; Garber, Gary E; Costa, Andrew P; Stall, Nathan M",,,284

332499,Global stability and cost-effectiveness analysis of COVID-19 considering the impact of the environment: using data from Ghana,2020,"BACKGROUND: On December 27th, 2020, the Israeli Defense Forces initiated a mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign aiming to vaccinate its personnel. This population upheld specific characteristics in terms of age and sex, lack of significant comorbidities, and a general scarcity of risk factors for sustaining a severe COVID-19 illness. We present the measures taken to increase vaccination compliance, and the vaccination rate that followed these actions. Our secondary goal was to compare between vaccination rates in frontline battalions and highly essential military units (group A) and rear administration and support military units (group B). METHODS: This was a retrospective review that included 70 military units that were composed of 18,719 individuals of both sexes, mostly free of significant comorbidities. We divided the challenges of maximizing vaccination rates into two main categories: vaccine compliance (including communication and information) and logistical challenges. We compared the vaccination rates in groups A and B using a multivariable linear regression model. A P-value of .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean age in 70 military units was 22.77 ± 1.35 (range 18-50) years, 71.13% males. A total of 726 (3.88%) individuals have been found positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1st, 2020 and February 18th, 2021. On February 18th, 2021, 54 days after the vaccination campaign was launched, 15,871 (84.79%) of the study population have been vaccinated by the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, expressing an 88.21% compliance rate (excluding recovered COVID-19 cases who were not prioritized to be vaccinated at this stage). Vaccination compliance in military units from group A was found to be higher when compared to group B (P < .001), leading to a 90.02% of group A population being either previously SARS-CoV-2 positive or COVID-19 vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: A designated army campaign led by a multidisciplinary team could rapidly achieve a high COVID-19 vaccination rate. The information presented can serve organizations worldwide with similar characteristics that plan a mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign.","Segal, David; Arzi, Yonatan Ilibman; Bez, Maxim; Cohen, Matan; Rotschield, Jacob; Fink, Noam; Karp, Erez",Mil. med,,284

Furthermore, we also report that B.1.351 can establish infection in wildtype mice, while B.1 cannot. B.1.351-challenged wildtype mice showed a milder infection than transgenic mice, confirmed by detectable viral loads in oropharyngeal swabs and tissues, lung pathology, immunohistochemistry and serology. In silico models supported these findings by demonstrating that the Spike mutations in B.1.351 resulted in increased affinity for both human and murine ACE2 receptors.

341478,Towards NIR-VIS Masked Face Recognition,2021,"To date, drugs to attenuate cytokine storm in severe cases of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are not available. In this study, we investigated the effects of intragastric and atomized administration of canagliflozin (CAN) on cytokine storm in lung tissues of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced mice. Results showed that intragastric administration of CAN significantly and widely inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines in lung tissues of LPS-induced sepsis mice. Simultaneously, intragastric administration of CAN significantly improved inflammatory pathological changes of lung tissues. Atomized administration of CAN also exhibited similar effects in LPS-induced sepsis mice. Furthermore, CAN significantly inhibited hypoxia inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) and phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) protein levels in LPS-treated lung tissues. These results indicated that CAN might attenuate cytokine storm and reduce the inflammatory symptoms in critical cases in COVID-19. Its action mechanism might involve the regulation of HIF-1&#945; and glycolysis in vivo. However, further studies about clinical application and mechanism analysis should be validated in the future.","Niu, Yaoyun; Chen, Yang; Sun, Pengbo; Wang, Yangyang; Luo, Jingyi; Ding, Yipei; Xie, Weidong",Int Immunopharmacol,,284

In response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, an enhanced surveillance system of hospitalised COVID-19 patients was established by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Victorian Healthcare Associated Infection Surveillance System Coordinating Centre. The system aimed to reduce workforce capacity constraints and increase situational awareness on the status of hospitalised patients. Methods: The system was evaluated, using guidelines from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, against eight attributes: acceptability; data quality; flexibility; representativeness; simplicity; stability; timeliness; and usefulness. Evidence was generated from stakeholder consultation, participant observation, document review, systems review, issues log review and audits. Data were collected and analysed over a period of up to three months, covering pre- and post-implementation from March to June 2020. Results: This system was rapidly established by leveraging established relationships and infrastructure. Stakeholders agreed that the system was important but was limited by a reliance on daily manual labour (including weekends), which impeded scalability. The ability of the system to perform well in each attribute was expected to shift with the severity of the pandemic; however, at the time of this evaluation, when there were an average 23 new cases per day (0.3 cases per 100,000 population per day), the system performed well. Conclusion: This enhanced surveillance system was useful and achieved its key DHHS objectives during the COVID-19 public health emergency in Victoria. Recommendations for improvement were made to the current and future systems, including the need to plan alternatives to improve the system's scalability and to maintain stakeholder acceptability.","Curtis, Stephanie J; Cutcher, Zoe; Brett, Judith A; Burrell, Simon; Richards, Michael J; Hennessy, Daneeta; Gang, Rebecca F; Lau, Colleen L; Rowe, Stacey",,,284

346852,The Navigation Design of Mobile Robot in the Man-Machine Environment for Service Assist,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19) has caused millions of deaths worldwide. It is well documented that troponin predicts the prognosis of patients. Myoglobin is not only an important marker of myocardial injury, but it indicates systemic muscle damage. However, its relationship with COVID-19 was rarely reported. The present study compared the predictive value of troponin and myoglobin on the final prognosis of COVID-19 patients by analyzing the clinical characteristics and serum levels of myoglobin and troponin in severe/critical COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We enrolled 499 consecutive eligible hospitalized patients with severe/critical COVID-19 from February 14 to March 24, 2020 at Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected and compared between the patients who died and survived. We analyzed the receiver operating characteristic curves of myoglobin and troponin. Then, the patients were divided into myo+ group, myo- group, tro+ group, and tro- group, and survival curves were analyzed. The prognostic predictable values of myoglobin and troponin were further analyzed using Cox multifactorial analysis. RESULTS: Myoglobin and troponin were significantly elevated in the death group (134.4 [interquartile range (IQR) 24.80, 605] vs 38.02 [IQR 3.87, 11.73]ng/ml, p<0.001), and troponin was also significantly elevated in the death group (0.01 [IQR 0.01, 0.01] vs 0.04 [IQR 0.02, 0.15]ng/ml, p<0.001). The ROC curves demonstrated that the area under the curve when using myoglobin to predict patient death was 0.911, with a threshold of 1.17, which was equivalent to troponin. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significantly lower survival curve in the myo+ group than the myo- group. Multifactor Cox survival analysis showed that troponin was no longer significant (HR=0.98, 95% CI 0.92-1.03, p=0.507), but elevated myoglobin was an independent predictor of death in COVID-19 patients (HR=1.001, 95% CI 1.001-1.002, p<0.001). The analysis of the Cox model for predicting patient death and plotting decision curves suggested that the single factor myoglobin model was superior to troponin, and the predictive value of the multifactor model was superior to the single-factor analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In severe/critical COVID-19 patients, myoglobin and troponin were predictors of mortality and the probability of conversion to critical illness, and myoglobin may be superior to troponin for predictive value.","Zhu, Feng; Li, Weifeng; Lin, Qiuhai; Xu, Mengdan; Du, Jiang; Li, Hongli",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,284

Oral and nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time viral PCR. During her admission, her breathing further deteriorated and she developed type 1 respiratory failure. A decision was made to trial treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as a means of avoiding intubation. The patient tolerated this well and made rapid improvements on this therapy. She was quickly weaned off and fully recovered before being discharged home. This case highlights the potential for CPAP to be used as a means of avoiding mechanical ventilation and iatrogenic preterm birth in COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy. Furthermore, it highlights the need for robust evidence to support this treatment.","Reindorf, Maxine; Newman, Joseph; Ingle, Tejas",BMJ case reports,,284

Participants were recruited by sending a survey through various social network channels via the snowball method. A voluntary sample of 420 individuals consisting of 199 men and 221 women from the Spanish national territory participated in this study. Some factors, such as being overweight and obese were related to the presence of a greater number of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Interestingly, it was observed that not performing moderate or vigorous PA increased the risk of COVID-19 symptoms. Consequently, when the effect of the practise of PA was evaluated in terms of the number of practises per week and in minutes per practise per week, a protective effect was observed, where moderate PA >150 min per week reported an inverse association with hospitalization for respiratory symptoms (RR: 95%CI: 0.24, 0.05-1.04, P = 0.05). Likewise, overweight (RR: 16.3, 95%CI: 1.93-137.9, P = 0.01), obesity (RR: 19.1, 95%CI: 1.63-222.5, P = 0.019) and non-performance of moderate PA (RR: 4.12, 95%CI; 0.95-17.76, P = 0.05) reported positive associations with hospitalization for respiratory symptoms. Thus, the practise of moderate PA (>150 min per week) is a protective factor against hospitalization for respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19 symptoms.","Latorre-Román, Pedro Ángel; Guzmán-Guzmán, Iris Paola; Delgado-Floody, Pedro; Herrador Sanchez, Julio; Aragón-Vela, Jerónimo; García Pinillos, Felipe; Párraga Montilla, Juan A",Res Sports Med,,284

OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the psychological responses toward COVID-19 among university students in three countries (Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand). METHODS: Using a cross-sectional online survey, university students from five public universities (two in Indonesia, two in Thailand, one in Taiwan) were recruited via popular social media sites, including Facebook, LINE, broadcast WhatsApp. All the students (938 in Indonesia, 734 in Thailand, 313 in Taiwan) completed questions concerning their anxiety, suicidal thoughts, confidence in COVID-19 pandemic control, risk perception in susceptibility to COVID-19, perceived support, resources for fighting COVID-19, and sources of COVID-19 information. RESULTS: Thai students had the highest levels of anxiety and suicidal thoughts but the lowest levels of confidence in pandemic control and available resources of fighting COVID-19 among the four student groups. Factors associated with higher anxiety and suicidal thoughts differed across countries. Less perceived satisfactory support was associated with more suicidal thoughts among Indonesian and Thai students. Taiwanese students were more negatively affected by information gathered from the internet and from medical staff.

The RECOVERY trial showed an absolute risk reduction in mortality by 2.8% with dexamethasone, and the ACTT-1 trial showed that treatment with remdesivir reduced the time to recovery by 4 days. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and lopinavir/ritonavir did not show any mortality benefit in either the RECOVERY or World Health Organization (WHO) Solidarity trials. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Brazilian HCQ trials did not show any benefit for HCQ based on the seven-point ordinal scale outcomes. The randomisation methodologies utilised in these controlled trials and the quality of published data were reviewed to examine their adaptability to treat patients. We found that the randomisation methodologies of these trials were suboptimal for matching the studied groups based on disease severity among critically-ill hospitalised COVID-19 patients with high mortality rates. The published literature is very limited regarding the disease severity metrics among the compared groups and failed to show that the data are without fatal sampling errors and sampling biases. We also found that there is a definite need for the validation of data in these trials along with additional important disease severity metrics to ensure that the trials' conclusions are accurate. We also propose proper randomisation methodologies for the design of RCTs for COVID-19 as well as guidance for the publication of COVID-19 trial results.","Emani, Venkata R; Goswami, Sanjeev; Nandanoor, Dheeraj; Emani, Shaila R; Reddy, Nidhi K; Reddy, Raghunath",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,284
355794,Application of Yolo on Mask Detection Task,2021-02-10,"Since December 2019, the world has been devastated by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Emergency Departments have been experiencing situations of urgency where clinical experts, without long experience and mature means in the fight against COVID-19, have to rapidly decide the most proper patient treatment. In this context, we introduce an artificially intelligent tool for effective and efficient Computed Tomography (CT)-based risk assessment to improve treatment and patient care. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven approach built on top of volume-of-interest aware deep neural networks for automatic COVID-19 patient risk assessment (discharged, hospitalized, intensive care unit) based on lung infection quantization through segmentation and, subsequently, CT classification. We tackle the high and varying dimensionality of the CT input by detecting and analyzing only a sub-volume of the CT, the Volume-of-Interest (VoI). Differently from recent strategies that consider infected CT slices without requiring any spatial coherency between them, or use the whole lung volume by applying abrupt and lossy volume down-sampling, we assess only the ""most infected volume"" composed of slices at its original spatial resolution. To achieve the above, we create, present and publish a new labeled and annotated CT dataset with 626 CT samples from COVID-19 patients. The comparison against such strategies proves the effectiveness of our VoI-based approach. We achieve remarkable performance on patient risk assessment evaluated on balanced data by reaching 88.88%, 89.77%, 94.73% and 88.88% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score, respectively.","Chatzitofis, Anargyros; Cancian, Pierandrea; Gkitsas, Vasileios; Carlucci, Alessandro; Stalidis, Panagiotis; Albanis, Georgios; Karakottas, Antonis; Semertzidis, Theodoros; Daras, Petros; Giannitto, Caterina; Casiraghi, Elena; Sposta, Federica Mrakic; Vatteroni, Giulia; Ammirabile, Angela; Lofino, Ludovica; Ragucci, Pasquala; Laino, Maria Elena; Voza, Antonio; Desai, Antonio; Cecconi, Maurizio; Balzarini, Luca; Chiti, Arturo; Zarpalas, Dimitrios; Savevski, Victor",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,284

After effective autoclaving, SARS-CoV-2 contaminated on the surface of medical waste bags was killed, but the average concentration of viral RNA residues was still 0.85 copies/cm2. It would not pose a health risk, but might contaminate the laboratory and affect the test results. When the sterilized medical waste bags were transferred directly by the operators without hand disinfection, re-contamination would happen, which might cause the virus to leak out of the laboratory. Furthermore, we found that sterilization effect monitoring and cooperation among operators were also very important. In summary, we investigated and analyzed the potential safety hazards during the medical waste disposal process in SARS-CoV-2 testing laboratory, and provided reasonable suggestions to ensure the safety of medical waste disposal.","Lv, Jun; Yang, Jin; Xue, Juan; Zhu, Ping; Liu, Lanfang; Li, Shan",,,284

Reducing inpatient violence is a major quality improvement (QI) priority for CNWL NHS Foundation Trust.MethodAs a Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, Nile Ward looks after male patients suffering from severe mental illness (SMI). This usually includes patients presenting with high levels of violent and aggressive behaviour. Prior to this QI project, there were high levels of patient assaults towards staff and other patients. This required a lot of medication use, including rapid tranquilisation, restraint and the use of seclusion. This QI project was started to allow the Nile MDT to explore ways to reduce serious incidents on the ward in the least restrictive manner.We implemented a number of change ideas within this project. Our change ideas included: 1. A new risk management tool : ‘Ragging', a daily risk assessment tool, was created to assess patients’ risk of violence and aggression to allow signposting of appropriate interventions to safely manage risk. 2. A brand new Staff Photo board : New photos of all permanent and bank staff displayed in the ward with no hierarchy of positions. 3. A new Patient Feedback board : Patient experience, comments and feedback displayed in common areas of the ward which are regularly updated. 4. Mutual Expectations between Staff and Patients: A set of expectations created in co-production with patients displayed in the communal areas of the ward to be followed by both staff and patients. 5. Gardening sessions : One of our newer change ideas during the COVID-19 pandemic was to provide a safe, socially distanced space for patients to be involved in growing and caring for the Nile Ward garden with our activities co-ordinator. 6. Optimisation of Physical Exercise : Focus on physical activity through garden fitness sessions and 1-1 fitness sessions in the gym. This was another change idea commenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions occur throughout the day with our fitness instructor and enable our patients to focus on their physical health & fitness. 7. Improved Ward Environment : Gym equipment were upgraded and the appearance of the ward gymnasium was enhanced using quality art created in co-production with patients.ResultThere was a 43% reduction in the number of violent incidents in the ward following QI interventions. The details of the results will be depicted in pictorial form in the poster.ConclusionOur patients are able to recover in a safe environment with a reduced level of violence and aggression resulting in patients receiving less rapid tranquilisation and restrictive interventions. We have had fewer assaults on staff which has made our staff feel safer to work in a busy PICU. Staff feel more confident in their role through the use of the new risk assessment tool . Patients and staff alike have given positive feedback to the changes implemented in this QI project, with violence being successfully reduced by 43%. We hope that our QI project can be used as an example to show how QI methodology can enable Violence Reduction within mental health services.","Rahman, Mehtab Taylor Claudia Roda Abdullahi Okwuokei Anthony Waugh Matthew Kaji Mahomed Magadlela Biganani",BJPsych Open,,284
357311,"Underpromise, overdeliver",2020,"As the proportion of multicultural family increases in Korea, there has been an acceleration in the emergence of a multicultural and multiracial society, resulting in more students with different cultural backgrounds in schools. Therefore, it is necessary to achieve harmony and integration among people from various cultures and backgrounds. The purpose of this study was to identify how multicultural acceptability affects self-concept and community consciousness by using longitudinal data collected for elementary and middle school students using a latent growth model, and to confirm the relationship between these variables. As a result of the study, first, it was confirmed that the multicultural acceptance of elementary and middle school students influences the development of self-concept and community consciousness. Second, a positive correlation was found between the three variables of multicultural acceptance, self-concept, and community consciousness. This study has implications for establishing educational measures relating to multicultural acceptance, self-concept, and community consciousness for adolescents, who are at the stage where perceptions and attitudes toward diverse races and different cultures are cultivated.","Eun-Ju, Choi Kyung-Hwa Lee",International Electronic Journal of Elementary Education,,284

360153,Community Corner,2020,"During the coronavirus pandemic, there have been significant challenges in the remote teaching and demonstration of experiments, especially those that require laboratory testing equipment. With a desire to give students a feel for our materials laboratory on open days and allow them to gain a deeper understanding of what materials science and engineering is about, we have designed an experiment focused on composite materials that can be performed remotely and without specialist equipment. This enabled students to experience a bend test sensorily through seeing, hearing and feeling it, creating a strong link to then being able to relate it to the pre-prepared experimental data taken in the laboratory. This fun, easy-to-run and engaging experiment allowed a shared experience and encouraged a discussion about students' observations, differences in results and implications of the bend strength of sandwich composites. We have found it not only works well universally by all ages but can be used with younger children to think about words such as 'stronger', 'stiffer' and 'flexible' and how materials can be different in different directions. © 2021 The Author(s).

369022,Statistical hypothesis testing versus machine-learning binary classification: distinctions and guidelines,2020-07-03,"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid changes in healthcare systems and at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital (RCWMCH), Cape Town, South Africa. Paediatric services in particular required adjustment, not only for the paediatric patients but also for their carers and the staff looking after them. Strategies were divided into streams, including the impact of COVID-19 on the hospital and the role of RCWMCH in Western Cape Province, communication strategies, adaptation of clinical services at the hospital, specifically with a paediatric-friendly approach, and staff engagement. Interventions utilised: (i) Specific COVID-19 planning was required at a children's hospital, and lessons were learnt from other international children's hospitals. A similar number of patients and staff were infected by the virus (244 patients and 212 staff members by 21 December 2020). (ii) Measures were put in place to assist creation of capacity at metro hospitals' adult services by accepting children with emergency issues directly to RCWMCH, as well as accepting adolescents up to age 18 years. (iii) The communication strategy was improved to include daily engagement with heads of departments/supervisors by earlymorning structured information meetings. There were also changes in the methods of communication with staff using media such as Zoom, MS Teams and WhatsApp. Hospital-wide information and discussion sessions were held both on social platforms and in the form of smallgroup physical meetings with senior hospital administrators (with appropriate distancing). Labour union representatives were purposefully directly engaged to assess concerns. (iv) Clinical services at the hospital were adapted. These included paediatric-friendly services and physical changes to the hospital environment. (v) Staff engagement was particularly important to assist in allaying staff anxiety, developing a staff screening programme, and provision and training in use of personal protective equipment, as well as focusing on staff wellness. In conclusion, visible management and leadership has allowed for flexibility and adaptability to manage clinical services in various contexts. It is important to utilise staff in different roles during a crisis and to consider the different perspectives of people involved in the services. The key to success, that included very early adoption of the above measures, has been hospital staff taking initiative, searching for answers and identifying and implementing solutions, effective communication, and leadership support. These lessons are useful in dealing with second and further waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Parbhoo, A N; Numanoglu, A; Argent, A C; Franken, M; Mukosi, M; McCulloch, M I",S Afr Med J,,284

375521,Pandemic Fiction Meets Political Science: A Simulation for Teaching Restorative Justice,2021,"In this analysis we discuss the change in criteria for triage of patients during three different phases of a pandemic like COVID-19, seen from the critical care point of view. Availability of critical care beds has become a hot topic, and in many countries, we have seen a huge increase in the provision of temporary intensive care bed capacity. However, there is a limit where the hospitals may run out of resources to provide critical care, which is heavily dependent on trained staff, just-in-time supply chains for clinical consumables and drugs and advanced equipment. In the first (good) phase, we can still do clinical prioritisation and decision-making as usual, based on the need for intensive care and prognostication: what are the odds for a good result with regard to survival and quality of life. In the next (bad phase), the resources are mostly available, but the system is stressed by many patients arriving over a short time period and auxiliary beds in different places in the hospital being used. We may have to abandon admittance of patients with doubtful prognosis. In the last (ugly) phase, usual medical triage and priority setting may not be sufficient to decrease inflow and there may not be enough intensive care unit beds available. In this phase different criteria must be applied using a utilitarian approach for triage. We argue that this is an important transition where society, and not physicians, must provide guidance to support triage that is no longer based on medical priorities alone.","Flaatten, Hans; Van Heerden, Vernon; Jung, Christian; Beil, Michael; Leaver, Susannah; Rhodes, Andrew; Guidet, Bertrand; deLange, Dylan W",J. med. ethics,,284
377876,"Automatic Diagnosis of COVID-19 Disease using Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Multi-Feature Channel from Respiratory Sound Data: Cough, Voice, and Breath",2021,"BACKGROUND: Neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and its neurological manifestations have now been confirmed. We aimed at describing delirium and neurological symptoms of COVID-19 in ICU patients. METHODS: We conducted a bicentric cohort study in two French ICUs of Strasbourg University Hospital. All the 150 patients referred for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 between March 3 and May 5, 2020, were included at their admission. Ten patients (6.7%) were excluded because they remained under neuromuscular blockers during their entire ICU stay. Neurological examination, including CAM-ICU, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in some of the patients with delirium and/or abnormal neurological examination. The primary endpoint was to describe the incidence of delirium and/or abnormal neurological examination. The secondary endpoints were to describe the characteristics of delirium, to compare the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay in patients with and without delirium and/or abnormal neurological symptoms. RESULTS: The 140 patients were aged in median of 62 [IQR 52; 70] years old, with a median SAPSII of 49 [IQR 37; 64] points. Neurological examination was normal in 22 patients (15.7%). One hundred eighteen patients (84.3%) developed a delirium with a combination of acute attention, awareness, and cognition disturbances. Eighty-eight patients (69.3%) presented an unexpected state of agitation despite high infusion rates of sedative treatments and neuroleptics, and 89 (63.6%) patients had corticospinal tract signs. Brain MRI performed in 28 patients demonstrated enhancement of subarachnoid spaces in 17/28 patients (60.7%), intraparenchymal, predominantly white matter abnormalities in 8 patients, and perfusion abnormalities in 17/26 patients (65.4%). The 42 electroencephalograms mostly revealed unspecific abnormalities or diffuse, especially bifrontal, slow activity. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed inflammatory disturbances in 18/28 patients, including oligoclonal bands with mirror pattern and elevated IL-6. The CSF RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 was positive in one patient. The delirium/neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients were responsible for longer mechanical ventilation compared to the patients without delirium/neurological symptoms. Delirium/neurological symptoms could be secondary to systemic inflammatory reaction to SARS-CoV-2.

To get insights into the possible role of the immune system upon COVID-19 infection, 2811 genes of the gene ontology term ""immune system process GO: 0002376"" were selected for coexpression analysis of the human targets of SARS-CoV-2 (HT-SARS-CoV-2) ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN in tissue samples from patients with cancer and diabetes mellitus. The network between HT-SARS-CoV-2 and immune system process genes was analyzed based on functional protein associations using STRING. In addition, STITCH was employed to determine druggable targets. DPP4 was the only immune system process gene, which was coexpressed with the three HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes, while eight other immune genes were at least coexpressed with two HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes. STRING analysis between immune and HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes plotted 19 associations of which there were eight common networking genes in mixed healthy (323) and pan-cancer (11003) tissues in addition to normal (87), cancer (90), and diabetic (128) pancreatic tissues. Using this approach, three commonly applicable druggable connections between HT-SARS-CoV-2 and immune system process genes were identified. These include positive associations of ACE2-DPP4 and TMPRSS2-SRC as well as a negative association of FURIN with ADAM17. Furthermore, 16 drugs were extracted from STITCH (score <0.8) with 32 target genes. Thus, an immunological network associated with HT-SARS-CoV-2 using bioinformatics tools was identified leading to novel therapeutic opportunities for COVID-19.","Subbarayan, Karthikeyan; Ulagappan, Kamatchi; Wickenhauser, Claudia; Bachmann, Michael; Seliger, Barbara",Front Immunol,,284
385560,Explainable COVID-19 Detection Using Chest CT Scans and Deep Learning,2020-11-09,"Recombination is a powerful evolutionary process that shapes the genetic diversity observed in the populations of many species. Reconstructing genealogies in the presence of recombination from sequencing data is a very challenging problem, as this relies on mutations having occurred on the correct lineages in order to detect the recombination and resolve the placement of edges in the local trees. We investigate the probability of recovering the true topology of ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs)under the coalescent with recombination and gene conversion. We explore how sample size and mutation rate affect the inherent uncertainty in reconstructed ARGs; this sheds light on the theoretical limitations of ARG reconstruction methods. We illustrate our results using estimates of evolutionary rates for several biological organisms; in particular, we find that for parameter values that are realistic for SARS-CoV-2, the probability of reconstructing genealogies that are close to the truth is low.","Hayman, Elizabeth; Ignatieva, Anastasia; Hein, Jotun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04848v1.pdf,284

386143,Lung Field Segmentation in Chest X-rays: A Deformation-Tolerant Procedure Based on the Approximation of Rib Cage Seed Points,2020,"BACKGROUND: Peak flow testing is a common procedure performed in ambulatory care. There are currently no data regarding aerosol generation during this procedure. Given the ongoing debate regarding the potential for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we aimed to quantify and characterize aerosol generation during peak flow testing. METHODS: Five healthy volunteers performed peak flow maneuvers in a particle-free laboratory space. Two devices continuously sampled the ambient air during the procedure. One device can detect ultrafine particles 0.02-1 µm in diameter, while the second device can detect particles 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10 µm in diameter. Five different peak flow meters were compared to ambient baseline during masked and unmasked tidal breathing. RESULTS: Ultrafine particles (0.02-1 µm) were generated during peak flow measurement. There was no significant difference in ultrafine particle mean concentration between peak flow meters (P = .23): Respironics (1.25 ± 0.47 particles/mL), Philips (3.06 ± 1.22), Clement Clarke (3.55 ± 1.22 particles/mL), Respironics Low Range (3.50 ± 1.52 particles/mL), and Monaghan (3.78 ± 1.31 particles/mL). Ultrafine particle mean concentration with peak flow testing was significantly higher than masked (0.22 ± 0.29 particles/mL) and unmasked tidal breathing (0.15 ± 0.18 particles/mL, P = .01), but the ultrafine particle concentrations were small compared to ambient particle concentrations in a pulmonary function testing room (89.9 ± 8.95 particles/mL). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, aerosol generation was present during peak flow testing, but concentrations were small compared to the background particle concentration in the ambient clinical environment. Surgical masks and eye protection are likely sufficient infection control measures during peak expiratory flow testing in asymptomatic patients with well controlled respiratory symptoms, but COVID-19 testing remains prudent in patients with acute respiratory symptoms prior to evaluation and peak expiratory flow assessment while the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 cases remains high.","Subat, Yosuf W; Guntupalli, Siva Kamal; Sajgalik, Pavol; Hainy, Matthew E; Torgerud, Keith D; Helgeson, Scott A; Johnson, Bruce D; Allison, Thomas G; Lim, Kaiser G; Niven, Alexander S",Respir Care,,284
387345,Data Augmentation for Motor Imagery Signal Classification Based on a Hybrid Neural Network,2020,"This research aims to explore the correlation between meteorological parameters and COVID-19 pandemic in New Jersey, United States. The authors employ extensive correlation analysis including Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, Kendall's rank correlation and auto regressive distributed lag (ARDL) to check the effects of meteorological parameters on the COVID new cases of New Jersey. In doing so, PM 2.5, air quality index, temperature (°C), humidity (%), health security index, human development index, and population density are considered as crucial meteorological and non-meteorological factors. This research work used the maximum available data of all variables from 1st March to 7th July 2020. Among the weather indicators, temperature (°C) was found to have a negative correlation, while humidity and air quality highlighted a positive correlation with daily new cases of COVID-19 in New Jersey. The empirical findings illustrated that there is a strong positive association of lagged humidity, air quality, PM 2.5, and previous infections with daily new cases. Similarly, the ARDL findings suggest that air quality, humidity and infections have lagged effects with the COVID-19 spread across New Jersey. The empirical conclusions of this research might serve as a key input to mitigate the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the United States.","Dogan, Buhari; Ben Jebli, Mehdi; Shahzad, Khurram; Farooq, Taimoor Hassan; Shahzad, Umer",Environ Res,,284

As of late August 2020, over 25 million persons had been infected, and we will see the global death toll exceed one million by the end of 2020. Both are minimum estimates. All segments of society have been drastically affected. Schools worldwide have been forced to close due to illness and absenteeism, transmission and risk to vulnerable members of the school community, and community concerns. The decision to reopen school during a pandemic will have a tremendous impact on children's safety, growth, and well-being. Not opening invites social isolation and suboptimal educational experiences, especially for youth whose computing assets and online access are limited and those with special needs. The opening has hazards as well, and the mitigation of these risks is the topic of this chapter. Opening schools requires careful considerations of benefits, risks, and precautions. Guiding principles for safety and strategic application of the principles in each educational niche are critical issues to consider during school reopening. The fundamental principles of disease control involve school-directed initiatives (physical distancing and mask use, hand/face and surface cleansing, administrative controls, engineering controls) and individual-level risk reduction approaches to maximize adherence to new guidelines. The school-initiated ""top-down"" approaches and the individual-level ""bottom-up"" approaches must be synergized, as no single method will ensure safety. We discuss how to effectively layer strategies in each educational space to increase safety. Since the vulnerability of children has been heightened during this pandemic crisis, we highlight the special considerations for mental health support that should be considered by schools. The safety principles, disease control strategies, and other critical issues discussed here will serve as a starting point for developing a safe, comprehensive, and feasible reopening plan.","Li, Dan; Lin, Elizabeth Z; Brault, Marie A; Paquette, Julie; Vermund, Sten H; Godri Pollitt, Krystal J",Adv Exp Med Biol,,284
389386,CovidCTNet: an open-source deep learning approach to diagnose covid-19 using small cohort of CT images,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an ongoing threat to society. Patients who develop the most severe forms of the disease have high mortality. The interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab has the potential to improve outcomes in these patients by preventing the development of cytokine release storm. AIMS: To evaluate the outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 disease treated with the interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, case-control, single-center study in patients with severe to critical COVID-19 disease treated with tocilizumab. Disease severity was defined based on the amount of oxygen supplementation required. The primary endpoint was the overall mortality. Secondary endpoints were mortality in non-intubated patients and mortality in intubated patients. RESULTS: A total of 193 patients were included in the study. Ninety-six patients received tocilizumab, while 97 served as the control group. The mean age was 60 years. Patients over 65 years represented 43% of the population. More patients in the tocilizumab group reported fever, cough and shortness of breath (83%, 80% and 96% vs. 73%, 69% and 71%, respectively). There was a non-statistically significant lower mortality in the treatment group (52% vs. 62.1%, P = 0.09). When excluding intubated patients, there was statistically significant lower mortality in patients treated with tocilizumab (6% vs. 27%, P = 0.024). Bacteremia was more common in the control group (24% vs. 13%, P = 0.43), while fungemia was similar for both (3% vs. 4%, P = 0.72). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a non-statistically significant lower mortality in patients with severe to critical COVID-19 disease who received tocilizumab. When intubated patients were excluded, the use of tocilizumab was associated with lower mortality.","Rojas-Marte, G; Khalid, M; Mukhtar, O; Hashmi, A T; Waheed, M A; Ehrlich, S; Aslam, A; Siddiqui, S; Agarwal, C; Malyshev, Y; Henriquez-Felipe, C; Sharma, D; Sharma, S; Chukwuka, N; Rodriguez, D C; Alliu, S; Le, J; Shani, J",QJM,,284

However, there are pediatric inflammatory conditions that have also been encountered. The aim of this report is to determine whether there is a relationship between COVID-19 and severe infections in the ear, nose, throat, and deep cervical area (ENT) in pediatric populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A compilation was made of all the cases of ENT area infections in the pediatric population per month attended to at the Niño Jesús University Children's Hospital from January 2010 to June 2020. Endemic channels and dispersion analysis were designed to analyze the incidence presented in the year 2020, compared to what was expected based on historical data from 2010 to 2019. Then, an epidemiological interview was conducted of the close contacts of COVID-19 of the children who presented a severe ENT infection in 2020. Finally, a serological test of IgG antibodies was performed on all of them to find out if they had overcome the COVID- 19. RESULTS: 620 patients from 1022 were eligible for the study. We observed a significant outbreak in the incidence of complicated mastoiditis and deep cervical infections with complications in the year 2020 (13 patients) linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. From these patients, 54% had been confirmed or had high suspicion of close contact with COVID-19.15.4% of children were positive in serological tests for IgG antibodies. CONCLUSION: There has been a significant increase in mastoiditis and deep cervical infections with complications in the first four months of 2020, which constitutes an outbreak. A considerable number (54%) of these complicated infections were related to close contact with COVID-19. Still, only 15.4% were positive in serological tests for IgG antibodies, so we cannot establish a direct categorical relationship. The limitations in primary care due to a shortage of human resources in dealing with the pandemic's initial onslaught and changes in help-seeking behavior could explain increased complicated infections.","Enrique, Guillén-Lozada; Margarita, Bartolomé-Benito; Ángel, Moreno-Juara; Saturnino, Santos-Santos; María Jesús, Domínguez-González de Rivera",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,284

Norway closed educational institutions, and banned sports and cultural activities; Sweden kept most institutions and training facilities open. We aimed to compare peoples' attitudes towards authorities and control measures, and perceived impact of the pandemic and implemented control measures on life in Norway and Sweden. METHODS: Anonymous web-based surveys for individuals age 15 or older distributed through Facebook using the snowball method, in Norway and Sweden from mid-March to mid-April, 2020. The survey contained questions about perceived threat of the pandemic, views on infection control measures, and impact on daily life. We performed descriptive analyses of the responses and compared the two countries. RESULTS: 3508 individuals participated in the survey (Norway 3000; Sweden 508). 79% were women, the majority were 30-49 years (Norway 60%; Sweden 47%), and about 45% of the participants in both countries had more than 4 years of higher education. Participants had high trust in the health services, but differed in the degree of trust in their government (High trust in Norway 17%; Sweden 37%). More Norwegians than Swedes agreed that school closure was a good measure (Norway 66%; Sweden 18%), that countries with open schools were irresponsible (Norway 65%; Sweden 23%), and that the threat from repercussions of the mitigation measures were large or very large (Norway 71%; Sweden 56%). Both countries had a high compliance with infection preventive measures (> 98%). Many lived a more sedentary life (Norway 69%; Sweden 50%) and ate more (Norway 44%; Sweden 33%) during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Sweden had more trust in the authorities, while Norwegians reported a more negative lifestyle during the pandemic. The level of trust in the health care system and self-reported compliance with preventive measures was high in both countries despite the differences in infection control measures.","Helsingen, Lise M; Refsum, Erle; Gjøstein, Dagrun Kyte; Løberg, Magnus; Bretthauer, Michael; Kalager, Mette; Emilsson, Louise",BMC Public Health,,284

Since students gain experience in clinical practice, it is assumed that their capacity for care is strengthened. This study aimed to verify whether there is a change in the competency of medical students after clinical practice. Methods: We assessed the clinical performance of 120 medical students who were enrolled in the fifth year over the academic years 2016-2018. Objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) was used to measure the clinical competency. Results: The OSCE scores for November fifth grade improved significantly compared to May fifth grade. The scores in September of sixth grade were slightly lower than those of November of fifth grade, but there was no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: It was confirmed that the clinical practice of fifth-year students improved their clinical competency, but it did not show any significant shift in the clinical competency of sixth-year students. The results of this study suggest that it is very important to organize the curriculum so that students can continue to experience patient-facing care throughout the entire clinical practice course to produce highly qualified physicians.","Yu, Jihye; Lee, Sukyung; Kim, Miran; Lee, Janghoon",Korean j. med. educ.

It had caused the onset of small disease outbreaks in China, and probably elsewhere as well, which failed to reach epidemic potential. The distant general origin of its zoonosis can be traced back to the ecosystem changes that have decreased biodiversity, greatly facilitating the contacts between humans and the animal reservoirs that carry pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. These reservoirs are the bats. The transition between the limited outbreaks that had occurred through 2019 and the epidemic explosion of December-January was made possible by the great amplification of the general negative conditions that had caused the preceding small outbreaks. In the light of what we have now learned, the explosion was predictable, and could have happened wherever the conditions that had allowed it, could be duplicated. What could not have been predicted was the second transition, from epidemic to pandemic. Research has now revealed that the globalization of the infection appears to have been caused by a mutation in the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2, that has dramatically increased its transmissibility.","Platto, Sara; Wang, Yanqing; Zhou, Jinfeng; Carafoli, Ernesto",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,284

396744,Monash Time Series Forecasting Archive,2021-05-14,"PD-L1 inhibitors are widely used in tumor immunotherapy, but their mechanism in colorectal cancer remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) regulation via the interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³)/janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling pathway, and its prognostic value in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). A cohort of 181 patients were recruited to determine the association between PD-L1 expression and CRC prognosis; the patients were newly diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma and had also undergone a physical tumorectomy. Immunohistochemical staining and survival analysis were used to evaluate the predictive value of PD-L1 protein expression in CRC. Gene set enrichment analysis, RT-qPCR and western blotting, etc were performed to confirm that PD-L1 is regulated by the IFN-Î³/JAK/STAT signaling pathway. PD-L1 up-regulation was more frequently observed in patients with larger tumors, positive vascular or lymphatic infiltration and a poorly differentiated stage in addition to being associated with a poor survival in patients with CRC. Following the stimulation with IFN-Î³, PD-L1 expression levels were revealed to be increased via the JAK2/STAT1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicated that the expression levels of PD-L1 may be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with CRC. In addition, the results suggested that the IFN-Î³-mediated overexpression of PD-L1 in CRC cells may be regulated by the JAK2/STAT1 signaling pathway.","Zhao, Tiancheng; Li, Yezhou; Zhang, Jiayu; Zhang, Bin",Oncol Lett,,284

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Early detection of this virus is necessary because of the unavailability of any specific drug. The researchers have developed different techniques for COVID-19 detection, but only a few of them have achieved satisfactory results. There are three ways for COVID-19 detection to date, those are real-time reverse transcription-polymerize chain reaction (RT-PCR), Computed Tomography (CT), and X-ray plays. In this work, we have proposed a less expensive computational model for automatic COVID-19 detection from Chest X-ray and CT-scan images. Our paper has a two-fold contribution. Initially, we have extracted deep features from the image dataset and then introduced a completely novel meta-heuristic feature selection approach, named Clustering-based Golden Ratio Optimizer (CGRO). The model has been implemented on three publicly available datasets, namely the COVID CT-dataset, SARS-Cov-2 dataset, and Chest X-Ray dataset, and attained state-of-the-art accuracies of 99.31%, 98.65%, and 99.44%, respectively.","Chattopadhyay, Soham; Dey, Arijit; Singh, Pawan Kumar; Geem, Zong Woo; Sarkar, Ram",Diagnostics (Basel),,284

The proportion of tested individuals who have tested positive (test-positive proportion, TPP) can potentially be used to inform trends in incidence. We propose a model for testing in a population experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19, and derive an expression for TPP in terms of well-defined parameters related to testing and presence of other pathogens causing COVID-19 like symptoms. In the absence of dramatic shifts of testing practices in time or between locations, the TPP is positively correlated with the incidence of infection. We show that the proportion of tested individuals who present COVID-19 like symptoms encodes similar information to the TPP but has different relationships with the testing parameters, and can thus provide additional information regarding dynamic changes in TPP and incidence. Finally, we compare data on confirmed cases and TPP from US states up to October 2020. We conjecture why states may have higher or lower TPP than average. Collection of symptom status and age/risk category of tested individuals can increase the utility of TPP in assessing the state of the pandemic in different locations and times.","Hitchings, Matt D T; Dean, Natalie E; Garcia-Carreras, Bernardo; Hladish, Thomas J; Huang, Angkana T; Yang, Bingyi; Cummings, Derek A T",Am. j. epidemiol,,284

Here we review strategies that could help stem the advance of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We focus on the role of lipid structures, such as lipid rafts and cholesterol, involved in the process, mediated by endocytosis, by which viruses attach to and infect cells. Previous studies have shown that many naturally derived substances, such as cyclodextrin and sterols, could reduce the infectivity of many types of viruses, including the coronavirus family, through interference with lipid-dependent attachment to human host cells. CONCLUSIONS: Certain molecules prove able to reduce the infectivity of some coronaviruses, possibly by inhibiting viral lipid-dependent attachment to host cells. More research into these molecules and methods would be worthwhile as it could provide insights the mechanism of transmission of SARS-COV-2 and, into how they could become a basis for new antiviral strategies.","Baglivo, Mirko; Baronio, Manuela; Natalini, Giuseppe; Beccari, Tommaso; Chiurazzi, Pietro; Fulcheri, Ezio; Petralia, Paolo Pietro; Michelini, Sandro; Fiorentini, Giovanni; Miggiano, Giacinto Abele; Morresi, Assunta; Tonini, Gerolamo; Bertelli, Matteo",Acta Biomed,,284
401788,A Combined Deep CNN-LSTM Network for the Detection of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Using X-ray Images,2020,"This paper is in response to the article entitled ""The process of designing for learning: understanding university teachers' design work"" (Bennett et al. in Educ Technol Res Dev 65(1):125-145, 2017). Design constitutes a fundamental part of what teachers do (Goodyear in HERDSA Rev Higher Educ 2:27-50, 2015). However, it has received negligible attention in the research literature. Bennett et al. make a significant contribution to knowledge by identifying and illustrating how university teachers engage in educational design. In particular, the paper identifies key areas for further support and the professional development of university teachers, including in the use of systematic design models and tools. This will help university teachers significantly, especially during the current pandemic has increased the design workload of university teachers as they endeavour to migrate and transtion their teaching online. Our response discusses Bennett et al. (2017) in the context of emergency remote teaching and the wholesale shift to new modalities of blended and online education. We also offer future suggestions arising from our review, including the importance of further international research on the topic.","Connolly, Cornelia; Hall, Tony",Educ Technol Res Dev,,284

403205,Attention-based VGG-16 model for COVID-19 chest X-ray image classification,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial aims to assess health benefits of a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cookfuel and stove intervention among women and children across four low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We measured exposure contrasts for women, achievable under alternative conditions of biomass or LPG cookfuel use, at potential HAPIN field sites in India, to aid in site selection for the main trial. METHODS: We recruited participants from potential field sites within Villupuram and Nagapattinam districts in Tamil Nadu, India, that were identified during a feasibility assessment. We performed. (i) cross-sectional measurements on women (N = 79) using either biomass or LPG as their primary cookfuel and (ii) before-and-after measurements on pregnant women (N = 41), once at baseline while using biomass fuel and twice - at 1 and 2 months - after installation of an LPG stove and free fuel intervention. We involved participants to co-design clothing and instrument stands for personal and area sampling. We measured 24 or 48-h personal exposures and kitchen and ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) using gravimetric samplers. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis, median (interquartile range, IQR) kitchen PM2.5 concentrations in biomass and LPG using homes were 134 µg/m3 [IQR:71-258] and 27 µg/m3 [IQR:20-47], while corresponding personal exposures were 75 µg/m3 [IQR:55-104] and 36 µg/m3 [IQR:26-46], respectively. In before-and-after analysis, median 48-h personal exposures for pregnant women were 72 µg/m3 [IQR:49-127] at baseline and 25 µg/m3 [IQR:18-35] after the LPG intervention, with a sustained reduction of 93% in mean kitchen PM2.5 concentrations and 78% in mean personal PM2.5 exposures over the 2 month intervention period. Median ambient concentrations were 23 µg/m3 [IQR:19-27). Participant feedback was critical in designing clothing and instrument stands that ensured high compliance. CONCLUSIONS: An LPG stove and fuel intervention in the candidate HAPIN trial field sites in India was deemed suitable for achieving health-relevant exposure reductions. Ambient concentrations indicated limited contributions from other sources. Study results provide critical inputs for the HAPIN trial site selection in India, while also contributing new information on HAP exposures in relation to LPG interventions and among pregnant women in LMICs.

Though well-intentioned, this nonspecific designation highlights stereotypes of older adults as frail and in need of protection, exacerbating negative age-based stereotypes that can have adverse effects on older adults' well-being. Healthcare stereotype threat (HCST) is concern about being judged by providers and receiving biased medical treatment based on stereotypes about one's identity - in this case age. Given the attention to older adults' physical vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults may be especially worried about age-based judgments from medical providers and sensitive to ageist attitudes about COVID-19. Online data collection (April 13 to May 15, 2020) with adults aged 50 and older (N = 2325, M = 63.11, SD = 7.53) examined age-based HCST. Respondents who worried that healthcare providers judged them based on age (n = 584) also reported more negative COVID-19 reactions, including perceived indifference toward older adults, young adults' lack of concern about health, and unfavorable media coverage of older adults. The results highlight the intersection of two pandemics: COVID-19 and ageism.

Here, we describe our institutional experience with a rapid influx of patients at the epicenter of the pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively review our experience with the departments of cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, anesthesia, and critical care medicine and summarize protocols developed in the midst of the pandemic. RESULTS: The rapid influx of patients requiring an intensive level of care required a complete restructuring of units, including the establishment of a new COVID-19 negative unit for the care of patients requiring urgent or emergent non-COVID-19 related care including open-heart surgery. This unique unit allowed for the delivery of safe and effective care in the epicenter of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrate the response of a large tertiary academic medical center to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we demonstrate how rapid structural changes can allow for the continued delivery of cardiac surgical care with similar outcomes as those reported before the pandemic.","Farrington, Woodrow J; Mack, Charles A; Karas, Maria G; Ivascu, Natalia S; Robinson, N Bryce; Iannacone, Erin; Lau, Christopher; Mick, Stephanie L; Girardi, Leonard N",J. card. surg,,284
410909,Dynamic analysis of a mathematical model with health care capacity for COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"There has been a surge in ""quarantine15"" social media posts during the self-isolation and lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic. Given the influence of other body and weight-centered social media content (e.g., Fitspiration, Fatspiration) on body image and weight stigmatizing thoughts and attitudes, characterizing the features of quarantine15 content is an imperative first step towards understanding its impact on those who view it. Therefore, the present study is a content analysis of quarantine15 content on Instagram. A total of 668 posts were sampled using the hashtag quarantine15, and systematically analyzed for features related to positive and negative body image, as well as weight stigma. The results showed that the posts containing human figures (57.5 %) showcased individuals who were perceived as lower-weight (88.8 %), White (70.3 %), and women (87 %). Approximately one-third (34.4 %) of the images containing individuals were considered objectifying. Posts also perpetuated the controllability of weight through diet (51.5 %) and physical activity (27.5 %), while 46.9 % expressed dislike towards higher-weight bodies. Future experimental research in this area will be important for understanding both the acute and long-term effects of viewing quarantine15 content on body image, weight stigmatizing attitudes and thoughts, and internalized weight stigma.","Lucibello, Kristen M; Vani, Madison F; Koulanova, Alyona; deJonge, Melissa L; Ashdown-Franks, Garcia; Sabiston, Catherine M",Body Image,,284

COVID-19 has led to closure and reduced hours of dental practices except for emergency and urgent services, limiting routine care and prevention. Dental care includes aerosol-generating procedures that can increase viral transmission. The pandemic offers an opportunity for the dental profession to shift more toward nonaerosolizing, prevention-centric approaches to care and away from surgical interventions.

411012,Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time-series Forecasting,2021-03-13,"In December 2019, clusters of atypical pneumonia with unknown etiology emerged in the city of Wuhan in China. In early January 2020, the Center for Disease Control in China announced that it was identified a new coronavirus, first tentatively named 2019-nCoV and officially named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. On 11 February 2020 the WHO identified the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease-19 based on the year of appearance). Although only a few months have passed since the beginning of this pandemic, numerous studies, case reports, reviews by leading international scientific and medical journals have been published. However, given the unpredictability of virus behaviour and the still limited knowledge about it, many aspects of the infection are still little known. A recent epidemiological study has shown the presence of dysphonia in some patients with COVID-19, with a minority reporting aphonia during the clinical course of the disease. This case study draws attention on a 50-year-old female nurse presented with a history of fatigue for small efforts and persistent dysphonia at the Occupational Health Department of a major University Hospital in central Italy. The patient had a history of COVID-19 infection, which lasted about two months with pulmonary and extrapulmonary symptoms. After two RT-PCR negativities for SARS-CoV-2, dysphonia and fatigue due to minor efforts persisted. The patient, following the persistence of the symptomatology, carried out numerous specialist examinations, which showed no organic alterations. Based on her clinical and instrumental history, we hypothesized a psychogenetic dysphonia related to COVID-19. This case report highlights the importance of personalized medicine with long-term follow-up and good psychological support in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and in particular in the categories at greatest risk of both contagion and adverse physical and mental outcomes like health care workers.","Buselli, Rodolfo; Corsi, Martina; Necciari, Gabriele; Pistolesi, Piero; Baldanzi, Sigrid; Chiumiento, Martina; Del Lupo, Elena; Guerra, Paolo Del; Cristaudo, Alfonso",Brain Behav Immun Health,,284

BBS is characterized by elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the early stages of adipocyte and retinal development. BBS expression in the CNS and indications of hippocampal dysgenesis suggest neural development abnormalities. However, the role of BBS in ER stress in neuronal cells has not yet been studied. Therefore, we aimed at studying the role of BBS4 in neuronal development under normal and ER stress conditions. ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) were studied in BBS4-silenced (SiBBS4) SH-SY5Y cells during differentiation under normal and stress states, using molecular and biochemical markers. ER stress was demonstrated at early neural differentiation, with significantly augmented expression of UPR markers corresponding to BBS4 expression. In the undifferentiated state, BBS4 silencing resulted in significantly reduced ER-stress markers' expression under normal and ER-stress states. Independent of ER stress, SiBBS4 cells demonstrated significant reduction in activated phospho-IRE1&#945;. Under BBS4 silencing, both sXBP-1 and activated ATF6&#945; p50 failed to translocate to the nucleus. Transcript levels of apoptosis markers were upregulated under BBS4 depletion and ER-stress induction, corresponding to decreased viability. BBS4 depletion in neuronal cells results in reduced sensitivity to ER stress during differentiation and under ER-stress induction, partly due to failure in translocation of ER-transcription factors (TF) sXBP-1 and ATF6&#945; p50 to the nucleus. Hence, BBS4 is essential for nuclear transport under ER-stress response in neuronal cells during early differentiation. Our studies shed light on molecular mechanisms through which BBS4 malfunction alters neuronal ER stress response.","Horwitz, Avital; Birk, Ruth",Mol. Neurobiol,,284

To this end, we conducted three studies in which we (1) systematically reviewed eight professional guidelines for TH family therapy, (2) examined replicated evidence for the efficacy of TH family therapy through systematic review of 20 studies and meta-analyses of 13 effects, and (3) synthesised clinical accommodations to TH methodology from a study of 12 experienced TH family therapists. The studies found (1) a predominant focus in existing TH guidelines on operational matters pertaining to TH and relative neglect of therapeutic process; (2) meta-analyses of efficacy for child behavioural problems (k = 8) and parental depression (k = 5) showed equivalent outcomes in TH and face-to-face therapy and enhanced outcomes in TH relative to treatment as usual, resource provision (i.e. written materials), or wait-list control. Narrative review of 20 studies for a range of relational and mental health outcomes aligned with these findings; and (3) therapists defined clear conditions for enhanced engagement and therapeutic process via TH and reflected on cautions and accommodations for purposes of rapport building and mitigating risk. Given moderate-strong evidence for the efficacy of TH methods of family therapy for a range of conditions, we offer recommendations for future implementation of TH for family therapy.","McLean, Siân A; Booth, Anna T; Schnabel, Alexandra; Wright, Bradley J; Painter, Felicity L; McIntosh, Jennifer E",Clin. child fam. psychol. rev,,284

We classify state and local government actions, and we study multiple proxies for social distancing based on data from smart devices. Mobility fell substantially in all states, even ones that have not adopted major distancing mandates. There is little evidence, for example, that stay-at-home mandates induced distancing. In contrast, early and information-focused actions have had bigger effects. Event studies show that first case announcements, emergency declarations, and school closures reduced mobility by 1-5% after 5 days and 7-45% after 20 days. Between March 1 and April 11, average time spent at home grew from 9.1 hours to 13.9 hours. We find, for example, that without state emergency declarations, event study estimates imply that hours at home would have been 11.3 hours in April, suggesting that 55% of the growth comes from emergency declarations and 45% comes from secular (non-policy) trends. State and local government actions induced changes in mobility on top of a large response across all states to the prevailing knowledge of public health risks. Early state policies conveyed information about the epidemic, suggesting that even the policy response mainly operates through a voluntary channel.","Sumedha, Gupta Nguyen T. D.; Rojas, F.

This study assessed the association between household food insecurity and self-perceived mental health status and anxiety symptoms among Canadians in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA AND METHODS: The Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 2 collected cross-sectional data from May 4 to 10, 2020, on Canadians aged 15 years or older residing in the ten provinces. The brief six-item Household Food Security Survey Module was used to measure participants' households as food secure or marginally, moderately or severely food insecure within the previous 30 days. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between food security status and self-perceived fair or poor mental health and moderate or severe anxiety symptoms, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. RESULTS: Approximately one in seven Canadians (14.6%) lived in a household that experienced some level of food insecurity. Of these individuals, 9.3% reported recently accessing free food from a community organization. About one in five Canadians self-perceived their mental health as fair or poor (22.0%), or self-reported moderate or severe anxiety symptoms (18.2%). With covariate adjustment, individuals in households with moderate food insecurity had nearly three times higher odds of reporting fair or poor mental health, and moderate or severe anxiety symptoms, compared with individuals in food-secure households. Among those with severe food insecurity, adjusted odds ratios were 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0 to 7.9) for fair or poor mental health, and 7.6 (95% CI: 3.9 to 14.7) for moderate or severe anxiety symptoms. DISCUSSION: In the early period of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada, household food insecurity was independently associated with poorer mental health outcomes.

Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern. It is assumed that COVID-19 has zoonotic origin based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet market in Wuhan City, China. The phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has significant sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, thus bats could be primary possible reservoir. The intermediate host and there subsequent transfer is not known yet, although human to human transfer is widely confirmed. The transmission of COVID-19 infection from one person to another resulted in the isolation of patients who were subsequently given a variety of treatments. To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc. No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet. However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery. In this article emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection along with potential therapeutic strategies are analyzed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hamid, Saima; Mir, Mohammad Yaseen; Rohela, Gulab Khan",New Microbes New Infect.,,284

425005,A Review of Deep Learning Methods for Irregularly Sampled Medical Time Series Data,2020-10-23,"The general assignment problem is a classical NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time) problem. In a warehouse, the constraints on the equipment and the characteristics of consecutive processes make it even more complicated. To overcome the difficulty in calculating the benefit of an assignment and in finding the optimal assignment plan, a simulation-based optimization method is introduced. We first built a simulation model of the warehouse with the object-oriented discrete-event simulation (O2DES) framework, and then implemented a random neighborhood search method utilizing the simulation output. With this method, the throughput and service level of the warehouse can be improved, while keeping the number of workers constant. Numerical results with real data demonstrate the reduction of discrepancy between inbound and outbound service level performance. With a less than 10% reduction in inbound service level, we can achieve an over 30% increase in outbound service level. The proposed decision support tool assists the warehouse manager in dealing with warehouse worker allocation problem under conditions of random daily workload.","Kundu, Kaustav Li Haobin",Algorithms,,284

This applies in different contexts, environments, and throughout life. This conceptual perspective is very necessary in the face of the SARS-CoV-2 virus emergency. This virus produces the Covid-19 disease, which has become a pandemic of devastating effects not only healthwise, but also, importantly, from an economic, political and social point of view. This essay seeks to establish the scientific evidence-based elements that guide public policies for prevention and control. Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence. This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents. All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility. Therefore, public health literacy is needed.","Lazcano-Ponce, Eduardo; Alpuche-Aranda, Celia",Salud Publica Mex,,284

Following a comprehensive internal root-cause investigation, it was hypothesized that prior prime-boost immunization of ferrets with a commercial canine C3 vaccine to protect against the canine distemper virus had resulted in primary immune response to fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the C3 preparation. Upon intranasal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus cultured in medium containing FBS, an allergic airway response occurred in 6 out of 56 of the ferrets. The 6 impacted ferrets were randomly dispersed across study groups, including different COVID-19 vaccine candidates, routes of vaccine candidate administration, and controls (placebo). The root-cause investigation and subsequent analysis determined that the allergic reaction was unrelated to the COVID-19 vaccine candidates under evaluation. Histological assessment suggested that the allergic response was characterized by eosinophilic airway disease; increased serum immunoglobulin levels reactive to FBS further suggested this response was caused by immune priming to FBS present in the C3 vaccine. This was further supported by in vivo studies demonstrating ferrets administered diluted FBS also presented clinical signs consistent with a hyperallergic response, while clinical signs were absent in ferrets that received a serum-free SARS-CoV-2 inoculum. It is therefore recommended that vaccine studies in higher order animals should consider the impact of welfare vaccination and use serum-free inoculum whenever possible.","Layton, Daniel; Burkett, Kathie; Marsh, Glenn A; Singanallur, Nagendrakumar B; Barr, Jennifer; Layton, Rachel; Riddell, Sarah-Jane; Brown, Sheree; Trinidad, Lee; Au, Gough G; McAuley, Alexander J; Lowther, Suzanne; Watson, James; Vasan, Seshadri S",ILAR j,,284

While most studies have focused on diabetes mellitus in male subjects, there have been cases on altered reproductive functions in females. These present study aims to investigate the effect of long term hyperglycemia on diabetic rats' ovary. Female Wistar rats were assigned into control and diabetic group, each consisting of five animals. The later was induced with STZ (50mg/Kg intraperitoneal injection) and the animals were sacrificed after 14 weeks. The blood glucose, body and organ weight, serum hormone level along with oxidative stress parameters of the ovary and uterus were determined. Histology of the ovary and expression levels of CD79 in the ovary was also assessed. The weight of the diabetic rats after the experiment was significantly lower (p<0.05) than the control. The level of Follicle Stimulating Hormone, Luteinizing hormone and estrogen was significantly lower in the diabetic group. The antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) were significantly lower in the diabetic ovary and uterus while the Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration significantly increased compared to the control group. Histological observation of the ovary showed signs of chronic inflammation and immunohistochemistry for CD79 showed positive expression in the diabetic ovary.

DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (US NHANES, 1988-94 and 1999-2014) and UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 44 462 US adults aged 20 years or older and 399 537 UK adults aged 37-73 years. EXPOSURES: SES was derived by latent class analysis using family income, occupation or employment status, education level, and health insurance (US NHANES only), and three levels (low, medium, and high) were defined according to item response probabilities. A healthy lifestyle score was constructed using information on never smoking, no heavy alcohol consumption (women &#8804;1 drink/day; men &#8804;2 drinks/day; one drink contains 14 g of ethanol in the US and 8 g in the UK), top third of physical activity, and higher dietary quality. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause mortality was the primary outcome in both studies, and CVD mortality and morbidity in UK Biobank, which were obtained through linkage to registries. RESULTS: US NHANES documented 8906 deaths over a mean follow-up of 11.2 years, and UK Biobank documented 22 309 deaths and 6903 incident CVD cases over a mean follow-up of 8.8-11.0 years. Among adults of low SES, age adjusted risk of death was 22.5 (95% confidence interval 21.7 to 23.3) and 7.4 (7.3 to 7.6) per 1000 person years in US NHANES and UK Biobank, respectively, and age adjusted risk of CVD was 2.5 (2.4 to 2.6) per 1000 person years in UK Biobank. The corresponding risks among adults of high SES were 11.4 (10.6 to 12.1), 3.3 (3.1 to 3.5), and 1.4 (1.3 to 1.5) per 1000 person years. Compared with adults of high SES, those of low SES had higher risks of all cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.13, 95% confidence interval 1.90 to 2.38 in US NHANES; 1.96, 1.87 to 2.06 in UK Biobank), CVD mortality (2.25, 2.00 to 2.53), and incident CVD (1.65, 1.52 to 1.79) in UK Biobank, and the proportions mediated by lifestyle were 12.3% (10.7% to 13.9%), 4.0% (3.5% to 4.4%), 3.0% (2.5% to 3.6%), and 3.7% (3.1% to 4.5%), respectively. No significant interaction was observed between lifestyle and SES in US NHANES, whereas associations between lifestyle and outcomes were stronger among those of low SES in UK Biobank. Compared with adults of high SES and three or four healthy lifestyle factors, those with low SES and no or one healthy lifestyle factor had higher risks of all cause mortality (3.53, 3.01 to 4.14 in US NHANES; 2.65, 2.39 to 2.94 in UK Biobank), CVD mortality (2.65, 2.09 to 3.38), and incident CVD (2.09, 1.78 to 2.46) in UK Biobank. CONCLUSIONS: Unhealthy lifestyles mediated a small proportion of the socioeconomic inequity in health in both US and UK adults; therefore, healthy lifestyle promotion alone might not substantially reduce the socioeconomic inequity in health, and other measures tackling social determinants of health are warranted. Nevertheless, healthy lifestyles were associated with lower mortality and CVD risk in different SES subgroups, supporting an important role of healthy lifestyles in reducing disease burden.","Zhang, Yan-Bo; Chen, Chen; Pan, Xiong-Fei; Guo, Jingyu; Li, Yanping; Franco, Oscar H; Liu, Gang; Pan, An",BMJ,,284

The arsenal of drugs available is limited, and prolonged use of such drugs makes parasite to become resistant. Therefore, it is very imperative to develop a safe, cost-effective and inexpensive vaccine against VL. Although in recent years many strategies have been pursued by researchers, but so far only some of the vaccine candidates reached for clinical trial and more than half of them are still in pipeline. There is now a broad consent among Leishmania researchers that the perseverance of parasite is very essential for eliciting a protective immune response and may perhaps be attained by live attenuated parasite vaccination. For making a live attenuated parasite it is very essential to ensure that the parasite is deficient of virulence and should further study genetically modified parasites to perceive the mechanism of pathogenesis. So it is believed that in the near future, a complete understanding of the Leishmania genome will explore clear strategies to discover a novel vaccine. This review describes the need for a genetically modified live attenuated vaccine against VL, and obstacles associated with its development.","Pandey, Satish Chandra; Kumar, Awanish; Samant, Mukesh",Parasite Immunol,,284

The maturity of mAb technologies now allow us to identify and advance neutralizing mAb products to the clinic at ""pandemic pace"", as the pipeline of mAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated. Ensuring global access to these products for passive immunization, however, will require both low manufacturing cost and multi-ton production capacity-particularly for those infectious diseases where the geographic burden falls mostly in low- and middle-income countries or those with pandemic potential. Analysis of process economics and manufacturing technologies for antibody and other parenteral protein therapeutics demonstrates the importance of economies of scale to reducing the cost of goods for drug substance manufacturing. There are major benefits to convergence on a standardized platform process for antibody production that is portable to most existing very large-scale facilities, carries low risk for complications during process transfer and scale-up, and has a predictable timeline and probability of technical and regulatory success. In the case of an infectious disease with pandemic potential which could be treated with an antibody, such as COVID-19 or influenza, these advantages are paramount.","Kelley, Brian; Renshaw, Todd; Kamarck, Michael",Biotechnol Prog,,284
435097,A deep learning model to screen for Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) from X-ray chest images,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The retail food industry, a major essential business, is among the very few thriving sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such prosperity on the store side does not guarantee a sufficient food supply for all populations. This study aims to understand if people's risk perception and food security status shaped their food procurement behaviors during the early outbreak of the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Extended from the theory of risk perception, food consumers may behave differently during a disastrous event in terms of store patronization. The study evaluates how food procurement behaviors are affected by perceived risk aversion, resource scarcity, and consumers' food security status. METHODS: The study examines how people with different food security statuses made grocery shopping decisions at the risk of epidemic exposure based on a nationwide survey of 2590 participants in the U.S. during the early break of the pandemic in April 2020. The study uses a moderated mediation analysis on in-store shopping frequency and food expenditure. RESULTS: People having a food-secure status before the pandemic spent significantly more as a result of the reduced shopping frequency (i.e., the secure-insecure subgroup ß = -0.18, P < .01; the secure-secure subgroup ß = -0.35, P < .01). The increase in food expenditure was insignificant for people who were food-insecure before the pandemic (i.e., the insecure-insecure subgroup, ß = -0.01, P > .05; the insecure-secure subgroup, ß = -0.11, P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The study reports that in general people reduced the frequency of grocery shopping trips to avoid epidemic exposure while increasing the food expenditure per trip. The increase in food expenditure was not statistically significant among the food-insecure populations likely due to their budget constraints.","Wang, Y; Chen, X; Yang, Y; Cui, Y; Xu, R",Public Health,,284

Static (Study 1) and dynamic (Study 2) facial expressions depicting eight emotion categories were paired with emotion labels that systematically varied in arousal (low and high). Participants rated the arousal, valence, and dominance of expressions paired with labels. Isolated faces and isolated labels were also rated. As predicted, the label presented influenced participants' judgments of the expressions. Across both studies, higher arousal labels were associated with: 1) higher ratings of arousal for sad, angry, and scared expressions, and 2) higher ratings of dominance for angry, proud, and disgust expressions. These results indicate that emotion labels influence judgments of facial expressions.","Barker, Megan S; Bidstrup, Emma M; Robinson, Gail A; Nelson, Nicole L",PLoS One,,284

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop, evaluate, and deploy an automatic natural language processing pipeline to collect user-generated Twitter data as a complementary resource for identifying potential cases of COVID-19 in the United States that are not based on testing and, thus, may not have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. METHODS: Beginning January 23, 2020, we collected English tweets from the Twitter Streaming application programming interface that mention keywords related to COVID-19. We applied handwritten regular expressions to identify tweets indicating that the user potentially has been exposed to COVID-19. We automatically filtered out ""reported speech"" (eg, quotations, news headlines) from the tweets that matched the regular expressions, and two annotators annotated a random sample of 8976 tweets that are geo-tagged or have profile location metadata, distinguishing tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19 from those that do not. We used the annotated tweets to train and evaluate deep neural network classifiers based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Finally, we deployed the automatic pipeline on more than 85 million unlabeled tweets that were continuously collected between March 1 and August 21, 2020. RESULTS: Interannotator agreement, based on dual annotations for 3644 (41%) of the 8976 tweets, was 0.77 (Cohen &#954;). A deep neural network classifier, based on a BERT model that was pretrained on tweets related to COVID-19, achieved an F1-score of 0.76 (precision=0.76, recall=0.76) for detecting tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19.

436509,How to improve revenue forecasts from strategic investments,2020,"Introduction: Italy, since the end of February 2020, is experiencing the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that may present as an acute respiratory infection. We report on COVID-19 pneumonia in the context of a complex case of Cushing's disease (CD). Case Report: A 67-year-old man with CD, who was admitted to our hospital, presented with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency with persistent hypotension and glycemia toward the lower limits. We progressively withdrew almost all treatments for diabetes and CD (pasireotide and metyrapone), and i.v. hydrocortisone was necessary. A tendency to hyperkalemia was probably associated to enoxaparin. We summarized the many possible interactions between medications of Cushing's syndrome (CS) and COVID-19. Conclusion: Adrenal insufficiency might be a clinical challenge that needs a prompt treatment also in CS patients during COVID-19 infection. We should consider the possibility to titrate or temporary halt medical therapies of CS in the context of COVID-19 infection. Unexpected hyperkalemia in CS patients under treatment with heparin might be the signal of aldosterone suppression.","Beretta, Federica; Dassie, Francesca; Parolin, Matteo; Boscari, Federico; Barbot, Mattia; Busetto, Luca; Mioni, Roberto; De Carlo, Eugenio; Scaroni, Carla; Fallo, Francesco; Vettor, Roberto; Maffei, Pietro",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,284
436555,Cost-Sensitive Machine Learning Classification for Mass Tuberculosis Verbal Screening,2020-11-14,"The COVID-19 pandemic is an extraordinary global emergency that has led to the implementation of unprecedented measures in order to stem the spread of the infection. Internationally, governments are enforcing measures such as travel bans, quarantine, isolation, and social distancing leading to an extended period of time at home. This has resulted in reductions in physical activity and changes in dietary intakes that have the potential to accelerate sarcopenia, a deterioration of muscle mass and function (more likely in older populations), as well as increases in body fat. These changes in body composition are associated with a number of chronic, lifestyle diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, osteoporosis, frailty, cognitive decline, and depression. Furthermore, CVD, diabetes, and elevated body fat are associated with greater risk of COVID-19 infection and more severe symptomology, underscoring the importance of avoiding the development of such morbidities. Here we review mechanisms of sarcopenia and their relation to the current data on the effects of COVID-19 confinement on physical activity, dietary habits, sleep, and stress as well as extended bed rest due to COVID-19 hospitalization. The potential of these factors to lead to an increased likelihood of muscle loss and chronic disease will be discussed. By offering a number of home-based strategies including resistance exercise, higher protein intakes and supplementation, we can potentially guide public health authorities to avoid a lifestyle disease and rehabilitation crisis post-COVID-19. Such strategies may also serve as useful preventative measures for reducing the likelihood of sarcopenia in general and in the event of future periods of isolation.","Kirwan, Richard; McCullough, Deaglan; Butler, Tom; Perez de Heredia, Fatima; Davies, Ian G; Stewart, Claire",Geroscience,,284

However, from the perspective of interaction design, those sensing systems suffer from several constraints and limitations such as, low usability and poor hygiene. For example, the elderly or the disabled normally have huge difficulties when interacting with these types of digital systems. Moreover, the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has made us rethink the way we interact with the digital devices. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel solution for digital interaction through a contactless model. This system can provide human gesture recognition and therefore it can be integrated into others to achieve contactless control. We have implemented a prototype based on cost efficient sensors to validate the idea's feasibility. Moreover, a sequence of real world experiments has also been conducted to evaluate its performance. This system is composed with 1) a 3d printed grid of ultrasound sensors to capture the distance information from a human body;2) software to analyse the data for gesture predictions. This analysis results will be transformed into control commands to interact with the attached system. The experimental results have shown that the proposed system is capable of providing a contactless Human Computer Interaction (HCI), and also has a great opportunity to replace existing touching interaction manner with a remote control scheme.","Melo, D.

439668,B5G and explainable deep learning assisted healthcare vertical at the edge: COVID-I9 perspective,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In March 2020, Australian state and federal governments introduced physical distancing measures alongside widespread testing to combat COVID-19. These measures may decrease people's sexual contacts and thus reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs). We investigated the impact of physical distancing measures due to COVID-19 on the sexual behavior of gay and bisexual men in Australia. METHODS: Between April 4, 2020, and April 29, 2020, 940 participants in an ongoing cohort study responded to questions to measure changes in sexual behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Men reported the date they become concerned about COVID-19 and whether they engaged in sexual behavior with regular or casual partners or ""fuckbuddies"" in the 6 months before becoming concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as ""before COVID-19""), and following the date, they become concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as ""since COVID-19""). Before and since COVID-19 was based on individual participants' own perceived date of becoming concerned about COVID-19. RESULTS: The mean age of was 39.9 years (SD: 13.4). Most participants (88.3%) reported sex with other men during the 6 months before COVID-19. Of the 587 men (62.4%) who reported sex with casual partners before COVID-19, 93 (15.8%) continued to do so in the period since COVID-19, representing a relative reduction of 84.2%. CONCLUSION: Gay and bisexual men in Australia have dramatically reduced their sexual contacts with other men since COVID-19. These behavioral changes will likely result in short-term reductions in new HIV and STI diagnoses. If sexual health screenings are undertaken before resuming sexual activity, this could present a novel opportunity to interrupt chains of HIV and STI transmission.","Hammoud, Mohamed A; Maher, Lisa; Holt, Martin; Degenhardt, Louisa; Jin, Fengyi; Murphy, Dean; Bavinton, Benjamin; Grulich, Andrew; Lea, Toby; Haire, Bridget; Bourne, Adam; Saxton, Peter; Vaccher, Stefanie; Ellard, Jeanne; Mackie, Brent; Batrouney, Colin; Bath, Nicky; Prestage, Garrett",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,,284
439886,Global Biological Threats: Novel Tools and Multi-Disciplinary Approaches to Sustainable Development,2020,BACKGROUND: Repeat prostate biopsy (PBx) is recommended under persistent suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) or in the face of the following findings: atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP); extense (&#8805;3 biopsy sites) high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN); or HGPIN with atypical glands; suspicious for adenocarcinoma (PIN-ATYP). Nowadays; multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and mpMRI targeted PBx (MRI-TBx) are recommended in repeat PBx. Our objective was to analyze the current value of ASAP; mHGPIN; PIN-ATYP and other histological findings to predict clinically significant PCa (csPCa) risk. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 377 repeat PBxs. MRI-TBx was performed when Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score >3 and 12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) systematic PBx when &#8804;2. ASAP; HGPIN; mHGPIN; PIN-ATYP; and 8 other histological findings were prospectively reported in negative PBx. CsPCa was defined as ISUP group grade >2. RESULTS: Incidence of ASAP; multifocal HGPIN (mHGPIN) and PINATYP was 4.2%; 39.7% and 3.7% respectively; and csPCa rate was statistically similar among men with these histological findings. However; the rate of csPCa was 22.2% when proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) was present; and 36.1% when it was not. PIA was the only histological finding which predicted lower risk of csPCa; with an OR of 0.54 (95%CI: 0.308-0.945; P = .031). In addition; PIA was an independent predictor of a model combining clinical variables and mpMRI which reached area under de ROC curve of 0.86 (95%CI: 0.83-0.90). CONCLUSION: PIA emerged as the only predictive histological finding of csPCa risk and can contribute to a predictive model. mHGPIN failed to predict csPCa risk. The low incidence of ASAP (4.2%) and PIN-ATYP (3.7%) prevented us from drawing conclusions.,"Schwartzmann, I; Celma, A; Regis, L; Planas, J; Roche, S; de Torres, I M; Semidey, M E; Morote, J",,,284

Following an outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002, and MERS-CoV about 10 years later, SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus in less than 20 years to cross the species barrier and start spreading by human-to-human transmission. It is the most infectious of the three, currently causing the COVID-19 pandemic. No treatment has been approved for COVID-19. We previously proposed targets that can serve as binding sites for antiviral drugs for multiple coronaviruses, and here we set out to find current drugs that can be repurposed as COVID-19 therapeutics.Aim. To identify drugs against COVID-19, we performed an in silico virtual screen with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a critical enzyme for coronavirus replication.Methodology. Initially, no RdRP structure of SARS-CoV-2 was available. We performed basic sequence and structural analysis to determine if RdRP from SARS-CoV was a suitable replacement. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to generate multiple starting conformations that were used for the in silico virtual screen. During this work, a structure of RdRP from SARS-CoV-2 became available and was also included in the in silico virtual screen.Results. The virtual screen identified several drugs predicted to bind in the conserved RNA tunnel of RdRP, where many of the proposed targets were located. Among these candidates, quinupristin is particularly interesting because it is expected to bind across the RNA tunnel, blocking access from both sides and suggesting that it has the potential to arrest viral replication by preventing viral RNA synthesis. Quinupristin is an antibiotic that has been in clinical use for two decades and is known to cause relatively minor side effects.Conclusion. Quinupristin represents a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic. At present, we have no evidence that this drug is effective against SARS-CoV-2 but expect that the biomedical community will expeditiously follow up on our in silico findings.","Pokhrel, Rudramani; Chapagain, Prem; Siltberg-Liberles, Jessica",J Med Microbiol,,284

COVID-19 has also negatively impacted the social and economic activities of many countries significantly. With no approved vaccine available at this moment, extensive testing of COVID-19 viruses in people are essential for disease diagnosis, virus spread confinement, contact tracing, and determining right conditions for people to return to normal economic activities. Identifying people who have antibodies for COVID-19 can also help select persons who are suitable for undertaking certain essential activities or returning to workforce. However, the throughputs of current testing technologies for COVID-19 viruses and antibodies are often quite limited, which are not sufficient for dealing with COVID-19 viruses' anticipated fast oscillating waves of spread affecting a significant portion of the earth's population. In this paper, we propose to use compressed sensing (group testing can be seen as a special case of compressed sensing when it is applied to COVID-19 detection) to achieve high-throughput rapid testing of COVID-19 viruses and antibodies, which can potentially provide tens or even more folds of speedup compared with current testing technologies.

453522,Chest X-ray lung and heart segmentation based on minimal training sets,2021-01-20,"The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature, including those that report findings on radiographs Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures Because a large portion of figures in COVID-19 articles are not CXR or CT, we designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved deep-learning (DL) performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT (2) We collected CT images of influenza, another common infectious respiratory illness that may present similarly to COVID-19, and fine-tuned a baseline deep neural network to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT (3) We fine-tuned an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared 15 clinical symptoms and 20 clinical findings of COVID-19 versus those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications Our database is unique, as the figures are retrieved along with relevant text with fine-grained descriptions, and it can be extended easily in the future We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic The dataset, code, and DL models are publicly available at https://github com/ncbi-nlp/COVID-19-CT-CXR","Peng, Y.; Tang, Y.; Lee, S.; Zhu, Y.; Summers, R.

454626,A Hybrid Natural Language Generation System Integrating Rules and Deep Learning Algorithms,2020-06-15,"Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is an important tool for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, performance concerns have emerged recently, notably regarding sensitivity. We hypothesized that the clinical, biological, and radiological characteristics of patients with a false-negative first RT-PCR test and a final diagnosis of COVID-19 might differ from those of patients with a positive first RT-PCR test. We conducted a multicenter matched case-control study in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a negative first RT-PCR test were matched to patients with a positive first RT-PCR test on age, sex, and initial admission unit (ward or intensive care). We included 80 cases and 80 controls between March 30, and June 22, 2020. Neither mortality at hospital discharge nor hospital stay length differed between the two groups (P = 0.80 and P = 0.54, respectively). By multivariate analysis, two factors were independently associated with a lower risk of a first false-negative test, namely, headache (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.07; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.01-0.49]; P = 0.007) and fatigue/malaise (aOR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.81; P = 0.027); two other factors were independently associated with a higher risk of a first false-negative test, namely, platelets > 207·103 mm-3 (aOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.10-13.16]; P = 0.034) and C-reactive protein > 79.8 mg·L-1 (aOR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.21-13.19; P = 0.023). Patients with suspected COVID-19 whose laboratory tests indicating marked inflammation were at higher risk of a first false-negative RT-PCR test. Strategies involving serial RT-PCR testing must be rigorously evaluated.","Lascarrou, Jean-Baptiste; Colin, Gwenhael; Le Thuaut, Aurélie; Serck, Nicolas; Ohana, Mickael; Sauneuf, Bertrand; Geri, Guillaume; Mesland, Jean-Baptiste; Ribeyre, Gaetane; Hussenet, Claire; Boureau, Anne Sophie; Gille, Thomas",Sci Rep,,284

Since then, up to 40% of non-traumatic abdominal emergencies have had unusual delayed treatment. Given the rapidly evolving situation and the absence of evidence to support recommendations during the pandemic, it is useful to assess how the current situation is influencing the management of elderly with acute appendicitis. METHODS: Between February 2020 and December 2020, all patients older than 68 years old undergone appendectomy were included. Surgical approach, hospital stay, post-operative complications, radiology reports, and histologic examination were included in the retrospective analysis and compared with a same sample of the same period before the pandemic. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis during the pandemic and 34 patients in the pre-outbreak period. Laparoscopic approach was completed in 51.8% of the cases, while conversion to laparotomy in 22.3% of patients and open procedure in the 25.9%, before the pandemic 73.6%, 14.7%, and 11.7%, respectively. During the pandemic, complicated appendicitis occurred in 59.3% of the cases (26.5% before the outbreak). One patient was treated for a pelvic abscess, while no minor complications were detected. No mortality rate was reported, with a mean hospital stay of 5.64 days during the outbreak and 4.21 days before the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our data highlighted a partial delay in diagnosis in the elderly group, and an increase in complicated appendicitis also demonstrated by the need for conversion to laparotomy.","Lisi, G; Campanelli, M; Mastrangeli, M R; Grande, S; Viarengo, M A; Garbarino, G M; Vanni, G; Grande, M",Int. j. colorectal. dis,,284

456067,COV-SNET: A deep learning model for X-ray-based COVID-19 classification,2021,"PURPOSE: To develop a deep learning-based method to assist radiologists to fast and accurately identify patients with COVID-19 by CT images. METHODS: We retrospectively collected chest CT images of 495 patients from three hospitals in China. 495 datasets were randomly divided into 395 cases (80%, 294 of COVID-19, 101 of other pneumonia) of the training set, 50 cases (10%, 37 of COVID-19, 13 of other pneumonia) of the validation set and 50 cases (10%, 37 of COVID-19, 13 of other pneumonia) of the testing set. We trained a multi-view fusion model using deep learning network to screen patients with COVID-19 using CT images with the maximum lung regions in axial, coronal and sagittal views. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated by both the validation and testing sets. RESULTS: The multi-view deep learning fusion model achieved the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.732, accuracy of 0.700, sensitivity of 0.730 and specificity of 0.615 in validation set. In the testing set, we can achieve AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.819, 0.760, 0.811 and 0.615 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on deep learning method, the proposed diagnosis model trained on multi-view images of chest CT images showed great potential to improve the efficacy of diagnosis and mitigate the heavy workload of radiologists for the initial screening of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Wu, Xiangjun; Hui, Hui; Niu, Meng; Li, Liang; Wang, Li; He, Bingxi; Yang, Xin; Li, Li; Li, Hongjun; Tian, Jie; Zha, Yunfei",Eur J Radiol,,284
456068,COV-SNET: A deep learning model for X-ray-based COVID-19 classification,2021,"Due to the airborne nature of viral particles, adequate ventilation has been identified as one suitable mitigation strategy for reducing their transmission. While 'dilution of air by opening the window' has been prescribed by national and international health agencies, unintended detrimental consequences might result in many developing countries with high ambient air pollution. In the present study, PM2.5 exposure concentration and probability of mortality due to PM2.5 in different scenarios were assessed. A COVID airborne infection risk estimator was used to estimate the probability of infection by aerosol transmission in various commuter micro-environments: (a) air conditioned (AC) taxi (b) non-AC taxi (c) bus and (d) autorickshaw. The following were the estimated exposure concentrations in the four types of vehicles during pre-lockdown, during lockdown, and lost-lockdown: AC taxi cars (17.16 µg/m3, 4.52 µg/m3, and 25.09 µg/m3); non-AC taxis: (28.74 µg/m3, 7.56 µg/m3, 42.01 µg/m3); buses (21.79 µg/m3, 5.73 µg/m3, 31.86 µg/m3) autorickshaws (51.30 µg/m3, 3.50 µg/m3, 75 µg/m3). Post-lockdown, the probability of mortality due to PM2.5 was highest for autorickshaws (5.67 × 10-3), followed by non-AC taxis (2.07 × 10-3), buses (1.39 × 10-3), and AC taxis (1.02 × 10-3). This order of risk is inverted for the probability of infection by SARS-COV-2, with the highest for AC taxis (6.10 × 10-2), followed by non-AC taxis (1.71 × 10-2), buses (1.42 × 10-2), and the lowest risk in autorickshaws (1.99 × 10-4). The findings of the present study suggest that vehicles with higher ventilation or air changes per hour (ACH) should be preferred over other modes of transport during COVID-19 pandemic.","Das, Darpan; Ramachandran, Gurumurthy",Environ Res,,284

459006,Meet the 2020 Bunche Fellows,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2) is a public health emergency of international concern that particularly affects older people. Brazil is one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, ranking second with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide as of mid-June 2020. The ELSI-COVID-19 initiative is based on telephone interviews with participants of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), conducted on a nationally representative sample of the population aged 50 or older. This initiative aims to provide information on adherence to preventive measures (social distancing, wearing masks, and handwashing/hygiene); reasons for leaving the house, when that was the case; difficulties obtaining medications, medical diagnosis of COVID-19, and receipt of confirmatory results; use of health-care services (recent care-seeking, care-seeking location, care receipt, among other aspects); and mental health (sleep, depression, and loneliness). The first round of telephone interviews was conducted between May 26 and June 8, 2020. The second and third rounds are expected to occur within the coming months. This article presents this initiative methodology and some sociodemographic characteristics of the 6,149 participants in the survey first round, relative the Brazilian population within the same age group.","Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Macinko, James; Andrade, Fabiola Bof de; Souza Júnior, Paulo Roberto Borges de; Vasconcellos, Maurício Teixeira Leite de; Oliveira, Cesar Messias de",Cad.

459263,PARRoT: Predictive Ad-hoc Routing Fueled by Reinforcement Learning and Trajectory Knowledge,2020-12-10,"OBJECTIVE: Pressure ulcers (PUs) involve the destruction of skin and underlying tissue due to prolonged pressure and shear forces. These ulcers are painful and significantly reduce a person's quality of life. PUs are also expensive to manage and impact negatively on the achievement of cost-effective, efficient care delivery. METHOD: Prone positioning is a postural therapy that aims to enhance respiratory function through increasing oxygenation levels. In contemporary clinical practice, ventilation in the prone position is indicated for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, despite its advantages in terms of respiratory function, several studies have examined complications of prone position ventilation and have identified PUs (facial PUs as well as PUs on other weight-bearing areas of the body) as a frequent complication in patients who are already in a precarious medical situation. International data suggest that up to 57% of patients nursed in the prone position develop a PU. The aim of this clinical review is to identify and review evidence-based recommendations developed to facilitate the selection and application of preventive interventions aimed at reducing PU development in patients ventilated in the prone position. Given the current COVID-19 crisis, this review is timely as intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 require ventilation in the prone position at a level that is disproportionate to the general intensive care population. Up to 28% of patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed infection due to severe COVID-19 are cared for in the prone position. The scope of this review is limited to adult individuals only. RESULTS: The skin assessment should be undertaken before proning and following positioning the patient back into the supine position. Although it is essential to keep the skin clean and moisturised, using pH-balanced cleansers, there is inconsistency in terms of the evidence to support the type of moisturiser. Use of positioning devices in addition to repositioning is recommended to offload pressure points on the face and body. Further, using dressings such as hydrocolloids, transparent film and silicone may be of benefit in decreasing facial skin breakdown. CONCLUSION: Given the importance of PU prevention in this cohort of patients, adopting a focused prevention strategy, including skin assessment and care, offloading and pressure redistribution, and dressings for prevention may contribute to a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of these largely preventable wounds.","Moore, Zena; Patton, Declan; Avsar, Pinar; McEvoy, Natalie L; Curley, Gerard; Budri, Aglecia; Nugent, Linda; Walsh, Simone; O039,; Connor, Tom",J Wound Care,,284
459453,The Effect of Sport in Online Dating: Evidence from Causal Machine Learning,2021-04-07,"AIMS: Intensive monitoring of medical patients for ADRs to assess prevalence, incidence, risk factors and fatality of ADRs leading to hospital admission or occurring in the hospital. Research design and methods Prospective cohort study on 1280 adult patients admitted to the medical wards of a tertiary institution over 12 months. Patients were assessed for ADRs during and throughout admission; causality and preventability of ADRs were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-seven (5.2%) patients had ADRs, 51(3.9%) caused hospitalisation while 17(1.3%) occurred during hospitalisation, and 42(62.7%) of total ADRs were preventable. NSAIDs, 14 (20.3%), antidiabetics, 12 (17.4%) and antibacterial, 11 (15.8%) were the most implicated drug classes. Gastrointestinal tract (37%), CNS (30.2%), and skin (24.7%) were the most affected organ/systems, while upper GI bleeding and hypoglycaemia were the most observed ADRs. ADRs led to deaths in 7(10.4%) patients, with an overall case fatality rate of 0.5%. The highest number of deaths were among patients with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome 2/7(28.6%) and hepatotoxicity 2/7(28.6%). Risk factors, AOR (95% CI) for ADRs leading to hospitalisation was male gender 3.11 (1.11, 8.73) while for ADRs during hospitalisation were number of drugs used before admission [AOR (95% CI) = 6.67(1.16, 38.47] and comorbidities [AOR (95% CI) = 3.0 (1.13, 8.01)]. Patients admitted with ADRs had prolonged hospital stay [AOR (95% CI) = 3.37(1.11, 8.71)]. CONCLUSIONS: Preventable ADRs are common and important causes of hospitalisation and inpatients' morbidity and mortality among medical patients in Nigeria. Upper GI bleeding and hypoglycaemia, resulting from NSAIDs and antidiabetic drugs were the most observed ADRs.","Adedapo, Aduragbenro D A; Adedeji, Waheed A; Adedapo, Ifetoluwanimi A; Adedapo, Kayode S",,,284

460762,IoT-enabled stacked ensemble of deep neural networks for the diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest CT scans,2021,"More than half a million people in the U.S. experience homelessness every day. Lacking other options, many turn to transit vehicles, stops, and stations for shelter. Many also ride public transit to reach various destinations. With affordable housing scarce and the numbers of unhoused individuals often surpassing the capacities of existing safety nets and support systems, transit operators face homelessness as a pressing issue on their systems and must implement policy measures from other realms beyond transportation to address it. Because of the health and safety implications for transit of the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated further rise in homelessness from the resulting economic downturn, studying and responding to the needs of these vulnerable travelers is critical.We conduct a comprehensive literature review to identify articles discussing homelessness in transit systems. While only a handful of articles exist from the 1990s, there is an emerging literature in the last 20 years that examines different aspects of homelessness in transit systems. We identify and review 63 articles on homelessness in transit systems and other public settings to better understand the extent of homelessness in the U.S., and how transit agencies perceive its impacts. We also summarise literature findings on the travel patterns of unsheltered individuals, which show that public transit represents an important and common mode of travel for them. Lastly, we focus on responses to homelessness from the part of transit operators. We find two types of responses: 1) punitive, in which criminalisation, policing and enforcement of laws and codes of conduct prevail, and 2) outreach-related, which aim towards providing help and support to unsheltered individuals. We conclude by summarising our findings as well as the existing gaps in the literature.

Individuals, health agencies, and governments are using Twitter to communicate about COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine key themes and topics of English-language COVID-19-related tweets posted by individuals and to explore the trends and variations in how the COVID-19-related tweets, key topics, and associated sentiments changed over a period of time from before to after the disease was declared a pandemic. METHODS: Building on the emergent stream of studies examining COVID-19-related tweets in English, we performed a temporal assessment covering the time period from January 1 to May 9, 2020, and examined variations in tweet topics and sentiment scores to uncover key trends. Combining data from two publicly available COVID-19 tweet data sets with those obtained in our own search, we compiled a data set of 13.9 million English-language COVID-19-related tweets posted by individuals. We use guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to infer themes and topics underlying the tweets, and we used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis to compute sentiment scores and examine weekly trends for 17 weeks. RESULTS: Topic modeling yielded 26 topics, which were grouped into 10 broader themes underlying the COVID-19-related tweets. Of the 13,937,906 examined tweets, 2,858,316 (20.51%) were about the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and markets, followed by spread and growth in cases (2,154,065, 15.45%), treatment and recovery (1,831,339, 13.14%), impact on the health care sector (1,588,499, 11.40%), and governments response (1,559,591, 11.19%). Average compound sentiment scores were found to be negative throughout the examined time period for the topics of spread and growth of cases, symptoms, racism, source of the outbreak, and political impact of COVID-19. In contrast, we saw a reversal of sentiments from negative to positive for prevention, impact on the economy and markets, government response, impact on the health care industry, and treatment and recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of dominant themes, topics, sentiments, and changing trends in tweets about the COVID-19 pandemic can help governments, health care agencies, and policy makers frame appropriate responses to prevent and control the spread of the pandemic.","Chandrasekaran, Ranganathan; Mehta, Vikalp; Valkunde, Tejali; Moustakas, Evangelos",J Med Internet Res,,284

We aimed to compare anxiety levels of quarantined and non-quarantined people and investigate factors affecting anxiety during the second COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1837 participants were included in this cross-sectional study. Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Participants were divided into the quarantined group (QG) and non-quarantined group (Non-QG). The mean STAI-S score in the QG was significantly higher than Non-QG (41.8 ± 11.2 vs 40.01 ± 9.9), so was the proportion of severe state anxiety (11.6% vs 5.5%). Males in the QG were significantly more anxious than females evaluated by both STAI-S and STAI-T. High income was independent protective factors while moderate or bad health status and high trait anxiety level were independent risk factors for severe state anxiety. In conclusion, the COVID-19 confinement could significantly increase anxiety of quarantined people. Males were more vulnerable to the quarantine of COVID-19 with significantly increased anxiety level than females. The results suggest that attention should be paid to anxiety during a second round of quarantine due to COVID-19 and are of help in planning psychological interventions.","Chen, Lili; Zhao, Hua; Razin, Delnur; Song, Tingting; Wu, Yan; Ma, Xiaopei; Wang, Gang; Wang, Manli; Yan, Lei",J Psychiatr Res,,284

475237,A numerical simulation of fractional order mathematical modeling of COVID-19 disease in case of Wuhan China,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Clostridiodes difficile infection is the leading cause of infectious diarrhea in the United States, with substantial morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infection is especially challenging, with each recurrence increasing the likelihood of a successive recurrence, leading to cycles of prolonged symptoms, frequent antimicrobial use, and decreased quality of life. Fecal microbiota transplantation to prevent recurrent infection is a promising intervention with a large effect size in observational studies, but with conflicting results from randomized controlled trials. We are conducting a Veterans Affairs-wide randomized controlled trial utilizing centralized case identification, with enrollment and fecal microbiota transplant administration occurring at the participant's home. This type of trial design significantly improves trial efficiency, greatly decreases trial cost, increases consistency of trial administration, and most importantly makes nationwide clinical trials in less-common diseases possible. METHODS: This is a randomized comparison of capsule-delivered fecal microbiota transplant for the prevention of recurrent Clostridiodes difficile infection, administered after successful initial treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection with standard therapy. The primary endpoint is the incidence of recurrent C. difficile infection or death. Cases are identified by searching the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse, with central study coordinators then reaching out to potential participants. Individuals meeting inclusion criteria and interested in participation are scheduled for in-home consent, randomization, and capsule administration, followed by telephone follow-up for 6 months. To mitigate risks of COVID-19, enrollment via video visits has been implemented. RESULTS: A total of 102 participants have been enrolled through January 2021. Centralized case identification and in-home enrollment has facilitated enrollment from 34 unique states, with 38% being from rural or highly rural areas. DISCUSSION: Centralized case identification and in-home enrollment is a feasible and innovative method of conducting randomized controlled trials in the Veterans Affairs system, improving access to clinical research for populations who may have difficulty engaging with the traditional model of clinical trials where enrollment is based at large hospitals in major metropolitan areas.","Drekonja, Dimitri M; Shaukat, Aasma; Zhang, Jane H; Reinink, Andrew R; Nugent, Sean; Dominitz, Jason A; Davis-Karim, Anne; Gerding, Dale N; Kyriakides, Tassos C",Clin Trials,,284

478038,Reimagining data responsibility: 10 new approaches toward a culture of trust in re-using data to address critical public needs,2021,"Introduction: The outbreak of the disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has been affecting society's routine and its patterns of interaction worldwide, in addition to the impact on the global economy. To date, there is still no clinically effective treatment for this comorbidity, and drug repositioning might be a good strategy considering the established clinical safety profile. In this context, since COVID-19 affects the respiratory tract, a promising approach would be the pulmonary drug delivery. Objective: Identify repurposing drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the data of ongoing clinical trials and in silico studies and also assess their potential to be applied in formulations for pulmonary administration. Method: A narrative literature review was conducted between June and July 2020, by extracting the results from Clinical Trials, PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct databases. Results: By crossing the results obtained from diverse sources, 21 common drugs were found, from which only 4 drugs presented studies of pulmonary release formulations, demonstrating the need for greater investment and incentive in this field. Conclusion: Even though the lung is a target that facilitates viral infection and replication, formulations for pulmonary delivery of suitable drugs are still lacking for COVID-19 treatment. However, it is indisputable that the pandemic constitutes a concrete demand, with a profound impact on public health, and that, with the appropriate investments, it will give the pharmaceutical industry an opportunity to reinforce the pulmonary delivery field.","Sarcinelli, Michelle Alvares; Martins da Silva, Thalita; Artico Silva, Andressa Daniele; Ferreira de Carvalho Patricio, Beatriz; Mendes Paiva, Flávia Costa; Santos de Lima, Raissa; Leal da Silva, Manuela; Antunes Rocha, Helvécio Vinícius",J Drug Deliv Sci Technol,,284

Here, we integrated the established platelet proteomes from six cohorts of healthy subjects, encompassing 5.2 k proteins, with two novel genome-wide transcriptomes (57.8 k mRNAs). For 14.8 k protein-coding transcripts, we assigned the proteins to 21 UniProt-based classes, based on their preferential intracellular localization and presumed function. This classified transcriptome-proteome profile of platelets revealed: (i) Absence of 37.2 k genome-wide transcripts. (ii) High quantitative similarity of platelet and megakaryocyte transcriptomes (R = 0.75) for 14.8 k protein-coding genes, but not for 3.8 k RNA genes or 1.9 k pseudogenes (R = 0.43-0.54), suggesting redistribution of mRNAs upon platelet shedding from megakaryocytes. (iii) Copy numbers of 3.5 k proteins that were restricted in size by the corresponding transcript levels (iv) Near complete coverage of identified proteins in the relevant transcriptome (log2fpkm > 0.20) except for plasma-derived secretory proteins, pointing to adhesion and uptake of such proteins. (v) Underrepresentation in the identified proteome of nuclear-related, membrane and signaling proteins, as well proteins with low-level transcripts. We then constructed a prediction model, based on protein function, transcript level and (peri)nuclear localization, and calculated the achievable proteome at ~ 10 k proteins. Model validation identified 1.0 k additional proteins in the predicted classes. Network and database analysis revealed the presence of 2.4 k proteins with a possible role in thrombosis and hemostasis, and 138 proteins linked to platelet-related disorders. This genome-wide platelet transcriptome and (non)identified proteome database thus provides a scaffold for discovering the roles of unknown platelet proteins in health and disease.","Huang, Jingnan; Swieringa, Frauke; Solari, Fiorella A; Provenzale, Isabella; Grassi, Luigi; De Simone, Ilaria; Baaten, Constance C F M J; Cavill, Rachel; Sickmann, Albert; Frontini, Mattia; Heemskerk, Johan W M",Sci Rep,,284
480469,Health is the Motive and Digital is the Instrument,2020,"Disruption of remyelination contributes to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in chronically disabled patients. Valproic acid (VPA) inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC) function and probably promotes oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation; however, the relevant molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, focal demyelinating lesions (FDLs) were generated in mice by two-point stereotactic injection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into the corpus callosum. Cognitive functions, sensorimotor abilities and histopathological changes were assessed for up to 28 days post-injury with or without VPA treatment. Primary OPCs were harvested and used to study the effect of VPA on OPC differentiation under inflammatory conditions. VPA dose-dependently attenuated learning and memory deficits and robustly protected white matter after FDL induction, as demonstrated by reductions in SMI-32 and increases in myelin basic protein staining. VPA also promoted OPC proliferation and differentiation and increased subsequent remyelination efficiency by day 28 post-FDL induction. VPA treatment did not affect HDAC1, HDAC2 or HDAC8 expression but reduced HDAC3 protein levels. In vitro, VPA improved the survival of mouse OPCs and promoted their differentiation into oligodendrocytes following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. LPS caused OPCs to overexpress HDAC3, which translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it directly interacted with the nuclear transcription factor PPAR-Î³ and negatively regulated PPAR-Î³ expression. VPA decreased the expression of HDAC3 and promoted remyelination and functional neurological recovery after FDL. These findings may support the use of strategies modulating HDAC3-mediated regulation of protein acetylation for the treatment of demyelination-related cognitive dysfunction.","Ding, Lingzhi; Zhou, Jiamin; Ye, Lisa; Sun, Yechao; Jiang, Zhenglin; Gan, Deqiang; Xu, Lihua; Luo, Qianqian; Wang, Guohua",Mol.

481220,Who Has Access to Your Smartphone Data?,2020,"Defects in histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are major contributing factors in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Heterozygous variants of SETD1A involved in histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation were previously identified in individuals with schizophrenia. Here, we define the clinical features of the Mendelian syndrome associated with haploinsufficiency of SETD1A by investigating 15 predominantly pediatric individuals who all have de novo SETD1A variants. These individuals present with a core set of symptoms comprising global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, subtle facial dysmorphisms, behavioral and psychiatric problems. We examined cellular phenotypes in three patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with three variants: p.Gly535Alafs*12, c.4582-2_4582delAG, and p.Tyr1499Asp. These patient cell lines displayed DNA damage repair defects that were comparable to previously observed RNAi-mediated depletion of SETD1A. This suggested that these variants, including the p.Tyr1499Asp in the catalytic SET domain, behave as loss-of-function (LoF) alleles. Previous studies demonstrated a role for SETD1A in cell cycle control and differentiation. However, individuals with SETD1A variants do not show major structural brain defects or severe microcephaly, suggesting that defective proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors is unlikely the single underlying cause of the disorder. We show here that the Drosophila melanogaster SETD1A orthologue is required in postmitotic neurons of the fly brain for normal memory, suggesting a role in post development neuronal function. Together, this study defines a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by dominant de novo LoF variants in SETD1A and further supports a role for H3K4 methyltransferases in the regulation of neuronal processes underlying normal cognitive functioning.","Kummeling, Joost; Stremmelaar, Diante E; Raun, Nicholas; Reijnders, Margot R F; Willemsen, Marjolein H; Ruiterkamp-Versteeg, Martina; Schepens, Marga; Man, Calvin C O; Gilissen, Christian; Cho, Megan T; McWalter, Kirsty; Sinnema, Margje; Wheless, James W; Simon, Marleen E H; Genetti, Casie A; Casey, Alicia M; Terhal, Paulien A; van der Smagt, Jasper J; van Gassen, Koen L I; Joset, Pascal; Bahr, Angela; Steindl, Katharina; Rauch, Anita; Keller, Elmar; Raas-Rothschild, Annick; Koolen, David A; Agrawal, Pankaj B; Hoffman, Trevor L; Powell-Hamilton, Nina N; Thiffault, Isabelle; Engleman, Kendra; Zhou, Dihong; Bodamer, Olaf; Hoefele, Julia; Riedhammer, Korbinian M; Schwaibold, Eva M C; Tasic, Velibor; Schubert, Dirk; Top, Deniz; Pfundt, Rolph; Higgs, Martin R; Kramer, Jamie M; Kleefstra, Tjitske",Mol. psychiatry,,284

As part of the growing public health response, the University of Arizona Student Aid for Field Epidemiology Response (SAFER) team was able to modify and increase case investigation efforts to assist local health departments. We outline the recommended logistical and management steps to include students in a public health response of this scope. METHODS: From April 1 through September 1, 2020, the SAFER team identified key components of a successful student team response: volunteer training, management that allows more senior students to manage newer students, adoption of case-management software, and use of an online survey platform for students to conduct interviews consistently and allow for data quality control and management. RESULTS: From April 1 through September 1, 2020, SAFER worked with 3 local health departments to complete 1910 COVID-19 case investigations through a virtual call center. A total of 233 volunteers and 46 hourly student workers and staff members were involved. As of September 2020, students were completing >150 interviews per week, including contact-tracing efforts. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Developing relationships between applied public health and academic programs can relieve the burden of low-risk, high-volume case investigations at local and state health departments. Furthermore, by establishing a virtual call center, health sciences faculty and students can volunteer remotely during a pandemic with no additional risk of infection.","Pogreba Brown, Kristen; Austhof, Erika; Rosa Hernández, Ayeisha M; McFadden, Caitlyn; Boyd, Kylie; Sharma, Jayati; Battaglia, Sarah; Shilen, Alexandra; Heslin, Kelly M",Public Health Rep,,284

483569,Preface on the 5th International Workshop on Traffic Measurements for Cybersecurity,2020,"Macrophages promote an early host response to infection by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), TNF, and IL-6. The bioactivity of interleukin-1ß is classically dependent upon NLRP3 inflammasome activation which culminates in caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis. Recent studies suggest a role for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in lung inflammation and fibrosis in both COVID-19 and SARS, and there is evidence of NLRP3 involvement in HIV-1 disease. Here, we show that GU-rich single-stranded RNA (GU-rich RNA) derived from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and HIV-1 trigger a TLR8-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine response from human macrophages in the absence of pyroptosis, with GU-rich RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggering the greatest inflammatory response. Using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, we show that the induction of mature IL-1ß is through a non-classical pathway dependent upon caspase-1, caspase-8, the NLRP3 inflammasome, potassium efflux, and autophagy while being independent of TRIF (TICAM1), vitamin D3, and pyroptosis.","Campbell, Grant R; To, Rachel K; Hanna, Jonathan; Spector, Stephen A",iScience,,284

Recent efforts are being made to evaluate different viral concentration methodologies to overcome supplier shortages during lockdowns. A set of 22-wastewater samples seeded with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, and the bacteriophage MS2, were used to characterize and compare two ultrafiltration-based methods: a centrifugal ultrafiltration device (Centricon® Plus-70) and the automated concentrating pipette CP-Select&#8482;. Based on the recovery efficiencies, significant differences were observed for MHV, with Centricon® Plus-70 (24%) being the most efficient method. Nevertheless, concentrations of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2, Human adenoviruses and JC polyomaviruses in these samples did not result in significant differences between methods suggesting that testing naturally occurring viruses may complement the evaluation of viral concentration methodologies.

To avoid the spread, several countries like China, Italy, Spain, America took strict measures like nationwide lockdown or by cordoning off the areas that were suspected of having risks of community spread. Taking cues from the foreign counterparts, the government of India undertook an important decision of nationwide full lockdown on March 25th which was further extended till May 4th, 2020 (47 days-full lockdown). Looking at the current situation government of India pushed the lockdown further with eased curbs, divided the nation into green, orange and red zones, rapid testing of citizens in containment area, mandatory wearing of masks and following social distancing among others. The outbreak of the pandemic, has led to the large economic shock to the world which was never been experienced since decades. Moreover it brought a great uncertainty over the world wide electricity sector as to slow down the spread of the virus, many countries have issued restrictions, including the closure of malls, educational institutions, halting trains, suspending of flights, implemented partial or full lockdowns, insisted work from home to the employees. In this paper, the impact analysis of electricity consumption of state Haryana (India) is done using machine learning conventional algorithms and artificial neural network and electricity load forecasting is done for a week so as to aid the electricity board to know the consumption of the area pre hand and likewise can restrict the electricity production as per requirement. Thus, it will help power system to secure electricity supply and scheduling and reduce wastes since electricity is difficult to store. For this the dataset from regional electricity boards of Haryana that is, Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam and Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam were analysed and electricity loads of state were predicted using python programming and as per result analysis it was observed that artificial neural network out performs conventional machine learning models.","Gulati, Payal; Kumar, Anil; Bhardwaj, Raghav",,,284

Cumulative confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 5 July 2020: notifications = 8,566, deaths = 106. Over the past fortnightly reporting period (22 June to 5 July), 897 cases were notified, with 4 deaths. The national incidence of COVID-19 remained low, with very few cases reported by most jurisdictions in this reporting period. The majority of the current cases reported over this fortnight are from Victoria, with an increasing number and proportion of cases reported as being locally acquired. Total case numbers have increased with an average of 54 cases reported on any one day, more than twice the average number reported in the previous reporting period. The number and proportion of deaths associated with COVID-19 remains low and it appears that vulnerable populations have not been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 overall. Testing rates continue to be high across all jurisdictions, with the nationwide positivity rate remaining very low at less than 0.3%. In this reporting period, the number of cases reported nationally has increased from 214 (8 June to 21 June) to 897 (22 June to 5 July). Of the cases notified in this reporting period, 87% (781 cases) were notified from Victoria and 89% of these cases were acquired locally. Of the remaining 116 cases reported from other jurisdictions only 6% were locally acquired. The increase in Victoria is attributable to multiple epidemiologically linked outbreaks across a range of settings and locations. A small proportion of cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care, with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.2%.

492881,Gravity Clustering: A Correlated Storage Location Assignment Problem Approach,2020,"ABSTRACT: Objectives: This study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of dental care procedures performed by the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) nationally and by regions. Considering that the most underprivileged population disproportionately suffers with the reduction in dental care provision, the study hypothesis suggests the presence of a syndemic nature. Methodology: The SUS Outpatient Information System (SIA-SUS) was assessed to gather data on dental care activities and procedures performed between April and July 2018, 2019, and 2020 by dentists registered in the SUS. The 30 most frequent activities and procedures performed by dentists were selected and classified into three categories (urgent dental care, nonemergency dental care, and case-dependent urgency procedures), based on the guidance for dental care during the pandemic published by the American Dental Association. Results: Results demonstrated a reduction in the provision of dental care of all categories during the pandemic. Urgency dental consultations and procedures in primary and specialized dental care services decreased by 42.5 and 44.1%, respectively, between 2020 and 2019. Non-urgent procedures decreased by 92.3%. Although decreases in dental care activities and procedures were reported in all Brazilian regions, the largest relative decreases in urgent procedures - that should have been maintained during the pandemic - occurred in the North and Northeast regions, which are the poorest regions of the country. Conclusions: These results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has a syndemic behavior. Further investigation into the pandemic-syndemic impacts on oral disease burden is necessary.","Cunha, Amanda Ramos da; Velasco, Sofia Rafaela Maito; Hugo, Fernando Neves; Antunes, José Leopoldo Ferreira",Rev. bras. epidemiol,,284

METHODS: This is an epidemiological mathematical modeling study conducted to analyze the dynamics of the accumulated cases of COVID-19, which used a logistic growth model that adds a term of withdrawal of individuals as a control measure. Three possible COVID-19 propagation scenarios were simulated based on three different rates of withdrawal of individuals. They were adjusted with real data of the infected and measures of control over the population. RESULTS: The lockdown would be the best scenario, with a lower incidence of infected people, when compared to the other measures. The number of infected people would grow slowly over the months, and the number of symptomatic individuals in this scenario would be 40,265 cases. We noticed that the State of Sergipe is still in the initial stage of the disease in the scenarios. It was possible to observe that the peak of cases and the equilibrium, in the current situation of social isolation, will occur when reaching the new support capacity, at the end of August in approximately 1,171,353 infected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We established that lockdown is the intervention with the highest ability to mitigate the spread of the virus among the population.","Góis, Aédson Nascimento; Laureano, Estevão Esmi; Santos, David da Silva; Sánchez, Daniel Eduardo; Souza, Luiz Fernando; Vieira, Rita de Cássia Almeida; Oliveira, Jussiely Cunha; Santana-Santos, Eduesley",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,,284

Mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs) were used as a model of the microvascular endothelium and were stimulated with LPS. Renal function, renal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) expression, cellular apoptosis, plasma and renal levels of NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members (p38, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2) were examined. Moreover, a calpain inhibitor, calpastatin overexpression adenoviruses and MAPK inhibitors were used. Significant renal dysfunction was induced by LPS stimulation, and recovery was observed in TEK/Capn4-/- and Tg-CAST mice but not in LYZ/Capn4-/- mice. Endothelial Capn4 knockout also abrogated the LPS-induced increases in renal iNOS expression, caspase-3 activity and apoptosis and plasma and renal NO and ROS levels but did not obviously affect renal eNOS expression. Moreover, LPS increased both calpain and caspase-3 activity, and only the expression of iNOS in PMECs was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. Inhibiting calpain activity or p38 phosphorylation alleviated the increased iNOS expression, NO/ROS production, and cellular apoptosis induced by LPS. These results suggest that endothelial calpain plays a protective role in LPS-induced AKI by inhibiting p38 phosphorylation, thus attenuating iNOS expression and further decreasing NO and ROS overproduction-induced endothelial apoptosis.","Liu, Zhifeng; Ji, Jingjing; Zheng, Dong; Su, Lei; Peng, Tianqing; Tang, Jing",Exp. mol. med,,284
499007,COVSeg-NET: A deep convolution neural network for COVID-19 lung CT image segmentation,2021,"Graph burning is a process of information spreading through the network by an agent in discrete steps. The problem is to find an optimal sequence of nodes which have to be given information so that the network is covered in least number of steps. Graph burning problem is NP-Hard for which two approximation algorithms and a few heuristics have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we propose three heuristics, namely, Backbone Based Greedy Heuristic (BBGH), Improved Cutting Corners Heuristic (ICCH) and Component Based Recursive Heuristic (CBRH). These are mainly based on Eigenvector centrality measure. BBGH finds a backbone of the network and picks vertex to be burned greedily from the vertices of the backbone. ICCH is a shortest path based heuristic and picks vertex to burn greedily from best central nodes. The burning number problem on disconnected graphs is harder than on the connected graphs. For example, burning number problem is easy on a path where as it is NP-Hard on disjoint paths. In practice, large networks are generally disconnected and moreover even if the input graph is connected, during the burning process the graph among the unburned vertices may be disconnected. For disconnected graphs, ordering of the components is crucial. Our CBRH works well on disconnected graphs as it prioritizes the components. All the heuristics have been implemented and tested on several bench-mark networks including large networks of size more than $50$K nodes. The experimentation also includes comparison to the approximation algorithms. The advantages of our algorithms are that they are much simpler to implement and also several orders faster than the heuristics proposed in the literature.","Gautam, Rahul Kumar; Kare, Anjeneya Swami; Bhavani, S.

Cancer patients, who have an immunocompromised status, may be at a higher risk of severe symptoms from infection with COVID-19. While information is rapidly evolving regarding COVID-19, Canada, both nationally and provincially, has been conveying new information to patients online. We assessed the content and readability of COVID-19-related online Canadian patient education material (PEM) for cancer patients to determine if the content of the material was written at a grade reading level that the majority of Canadians can understand. PEMs were extracted from provincial cancer agencies and the national Canadian Cancer Society, evaluated using 10 readability scales, qualitatively analyzed to identify their themes and difficult word content. Thirty-eight PEMs from both national and provincial cancers associations were, on average, written above the recommended 7th grade level. Each of the associations' average grade levels were: BC Cancer (11.00 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.27-13.38), CancerControl Alberta (10.46 95% CI 8.29-12.62), Saskatchewan Cancer Agency (11.08 95% CI 9.37-12.80), Cancer Care Manitoba (9.55 95% CI 6.02-13.01), Cancer Care Ontario (9.35 95% CI 6.80-11.90), Cancer Care Nova Scotia (10.95 95% CI 9.86-12.04), Cancer Care Eastern Health Newfoundland and Labrador (10.14 95% CI 6.87-13.41), and the Canadian Cancer Society (10.06 95% CI 8.07-12.05). Thematic analysis identified 4 themes: public health strategy, information about COVID-19, patient instructions during COVID-19, and resources. Fifty-three percent of the complex words identified were medical jargon.

We provide an overview of vaccine side effects and also examine the English literature and the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) from 2010 through 2020 for vaccine-implicated ocular adverse events. While reactions of eyelids and conjunctiva are commonly reported, the most frequently implicated serious adverse events are optic neuritis and various patterns of intraocular inflammation. Live attenuated vaccines have the potential to cause ocular infection from vaccine-strain organisms, particularly in those immunosuppressed.

In this paper, we have focused on reviewing the results of epidemiological modelling especially the fractional epidemic model and summarized different types of fractional epidemic models including fractional Susceptible-Infective-Recovered (SIR),Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR), Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Asymptomatic-Recovered (SEIAR) models and so on. Furthermore, we propose a general fractional SEIAR model in the case of single-term and multi-term fractional differential equations. A feasible and reliable parameter estimation method based on modified hybrid Nelder-Mead simplex search and particle swarm optimisation is also presented to fit the real data using fractional SEIAR model. The effective methods to solve the fractional epidemic models we introduced construct a simple and effective analytical technique that can be easily extended and applied to other fractional models, and can help guide the concerned bodies in preventing or controlling, even predicting the infectious disease outbreaks.","Chen, Yuli; Liu, Fawang; Yu, Qiang; Li, Tianzeng",Applied mathematical modelling,,284

The elevation of cytokines in blood is crucial to induce cytokine storm and immunosuppression in the transition of severity in COVID-19 patients. However, the comprehensive changes of serum proteins in COVID-19 patients throughout the SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. In this work, we developed a high-density antibody microarray and performed an in-depth proteomics analysis of serum samples collected from early COVID-19 (n = 15) and influenza (n = 13) patients. We identified a large set of differentially expressed proteins (n = 132) that participate in a landscape of inflammation and immune signaling related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the significant correlations of neutrophil and lymphocyte with the CCL2 and CXCL10 mediated cytokine signaling pathways was identified. These information are valuable for the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, identification of biomarkers and development of the optimal anti-inflammation therapy.","Hou, Xin; Zhang, Xiaomei; Wu, Xian; Lu, Minya; Wang, Dan; Xu, Meng; Wang, Hongye; Liang, Te; Dai, Jiayu; Duan, Hu; Xu, Yingchun; Yu, Xiaobo; Li, Yongzhe",Mol Cell Proteomics,,284

502462,Fuzzy mixed graphs and its application to identification of COVID19 affected central regions in India,2021,"Respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, present a serious threat to endangered wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) populations. In some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, chimpanzee tracking is a popular tourism activity, offering visitors a chance to view apes in their natural habitats. Chimpanzee tourism is an important source of revenue and thus benefits conservation; however, chimpanzee tracking may also increase the risk of disease transmission from people to chimpanzees directly (e.g., via aerosol transmission) or indirectly (e.g., through the environment or via fomites). This study assessed how tourist behaviors might facilitate respiratory disease transmission at a chimpanzee tracking site in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We observed tourists, guides, and student interns from the time they entered the forest to view the chimpanzees until they left the forest and noted behaviors related to disease transmission. Common behaviors included coughing, sneezing, and urinating, which respectively occurred during 88.1%, 65.4%, and 36.6% of excursions. Per excursion, individuals touched their faces an average of 125.84 ± 34.45 times and touched large tree trunks or branches (which chimpanzees might subsequently touch) an average of 230.14 ± 108.66 times. These results show that many pathways exist by which pathogens might move from humans to chimpanzees in the context of tourism. Guidelines for minimizing the risk of such transmission should consider tourist behavior and the full range of modes by which pathogen transmission might occur between tourists and chimpanzees.","Glasser, Darcey B; Goldberg, Tony L; Guma, Nelson; Balyesiima, Godfrey; Agaba, Hillary; Gessa, Simplicious J; Rothman, Jessica M",Am J Primatol,,284

In contrast, the second year of the pandemic was punctuated by the emergence of several variants that bore evidence of dramatic evolution. Here, we compare and contrast evolutionary patterns of various variants, with a focus on the recent Delta variant. Most variants are characterized by long branches leading to their emergence, with an excess of non-synonymous substitutions occurring particularly in the Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins. In contrast, the Delta variant that is now becoming globally dominant, lacks the signature long branch, and is characterized by a step-wise evolutionary process that is ongoing. Contrary to the ""star-like"" topologies of other variants, we note the formation of several distinct clades within Delta that we denote as clades A-E. We find that sequences from the Delta D clade are dramatically increasing in frequency across different regions of the globe. Delta D is characterized by an excess of non-synonymous mutations, mostly occurring in ORF1a/b, and also T140I in ORF7b, and G215C in Nucleocapsid. We conclude that the Delta surge these days is composed almost exclusively of Delta D, and discuss whether selection or random genetic drift has driven the emergence of Delta D.","Stern, Adi; Fleishon, Shay; Kustin, Talia; Mandelboim, Michal; Erster, Oran; sequencing, - Israel Consortium of SARS-CoV-2; Mendelson, Ella; Mor, Orna; Zuckerman, Neta",,,284

In this context, the present study investigates 8 flats in London to uncover if during a lockdown, (a) IAQ in the monitored flats deteriorated, (b) the patterns of window operation by occupants changed, and (c) more effective ventilation patterns could enhance IAQ without significant increases in heating energy demand. To this end, one-year?s worth of monitored data on indoor and outdoor environment along with occupant use of windows has been used to analyse the impact of lockdown on IAQ and infer probabilistic models of window operation behaviour. Moreover, using on-site CO2 data, monitored occupancy and operation of windows, the team has calibrated a thermal performance model of one of the flats to investigate the implications of alternative ventilation strategies. The results suggest that despite the extended occupancy during lockdown, occupants relied less on natural ventilation, which led to an increase of median CO2 concentration by up to 300?ppm. However, simple natural ventilation patterns or use of mechanical ventilation with heat recovery proves to be very effective to maintain acceptable IAQ.Practical application: This study provides evidence on the deterioration of indoor air quality resulting from homeworking during imposed lockdowns. It also tests and recommends specific ventilation strategies to maintain acceptable indoor air quality at home despite the extended occupancy hours.","Tahmasebi, Farhang Wang Yan Cooper Elizabeth Godoy Shimizu Daniel Stamp Samuel Mumovic Dejan",Building Services Engineering Research and Technology,,284

Passive immunity is based on recovering hyper-immune plasma from convalescent patients, or monoclonal antibodies with elevated titer of neutralizing antibodies with high antiviral activity, that have potential for both treatment and prevention. In this review, we focused on researching the potentiality of monoclonal antibodies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection. Our research review includes antibody-based immunotherapy, using human monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral protein regions, specifically the spike protein regions, and using hyper-immune plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients, in which monoclonal antibodies act as immunotherapy for the cytokine storm syndrome associated with the covid-19 infection. In addition, we will demonstrate the role of the monoclonal antibodies in the development of candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the recent progress of the diagnostic mouse monoclonal antibodies' role will be highlighted, as an accurate and rapid diagnostic assay, in the antigen detection of SARS-Cov-2. In brief, the monoclonal antibodies are the potential counter measures that may control SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, through immunotherapy and vaccine development, as well as viral detection.","Tabll, Ashraf A; Shahein, Yasser E; Omran, Mohamed M; Elnakib, Mostafa M; Ragheb, Ameera A; Amer, Khaled E",Hum. antibodies,,284

We aimed to assess changes in the number of visits and characterize the profiles of these patients. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we examined the number of psychiatric ED visits and their proportion among the total number of ED visits. We also evaluated psychiatric visits characteristics during a one-month period after the declaration of deconfinement, and we compared those characteristics to characteristics observed during the same month over the previous 4 years. RESULTS: The number of psychiatric visits to our emergency department during deconfinement was similar to the number observed in the same month of previous years. However, the proportion of psychiatric visits to our emergency department among all visits to the ED rose during deconfinement to a level never before observed. The mean proportion of psychiatric admissions to all ED admissions rose from 3.5% in past years to 5.3% during deconfinement (p = 0.013). Moreover, during deconfinement, more visits (80%) were without an acute intoxication compared to past years (58.5%; p = 0.031). Also, in the deconfinement period, more visits lacked a follow-up consultation organized at discharge (40%) compared to the historical period (25%, p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The deconfinement period after the first wave COVID-19 changed the number and type of psychiatric emergency medicine consultations at our hospital, suggesting a psychiatric impact of confinement during this pandemic. These findings will be of interest to practitioners and politicians in the coming months.","Flament, Julien; Scius, Nathan; Zdanowicz, Nicolas; Regnier, Maxime; De Cannière, Louis; Thonon, Henri",Am J Emerg Med,,284

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of these CTA findings and their relation to COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter institutional review board-approved study, assessment was made of CTA findings of code patients who had a stroke between March 16 and April 5, 2020 at six hospitals across New York City. Demographic data, comorbidities, COVID-19 status, and neurological findings were collected. Assessment of COVID-19 related lung findings on CTA was made blinded to COVID-19 status. Incidence rates of COVID-19 related apical findings were assessed in all code patients who had a stroke and in patients with a stroke confirmed by imaging. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of a total of 118 patients with mean±SD age of 64.9±15.7 years and 57.6% (68/118) were male. Among all code patients who had a stroke, 28% (33/118) had COVID-19 related lung findings. RT-PCR was positive for COVID-19 in 93.9% (31/33) of these patients with apical CTA findings.Among patients who had a stroke confirmed by imaging, 37.5% (18/48) had COVID-19 related apical findings. RT-PCR was positive for COVID-19 in all (18/18) of these patients with apical findings. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 related lung findings in stroke CTA scans was 28% in all code patients who had a stroke and 37.5% in patients with a stroke confirmed by imaging. Stroke teams should closely assess the lung apices during this COVID-19 pandemic as CTA findings may be the first indicator of COVID-19 infection.","Kihira, Shingo; Schefflein, Javin; Chung, Michael; Mahmoudi, Keon; Rigney, Brian; Delman, Bradley N; Mocco, J; Doshi, Amish; Belani, Puneet",J Neurointerv Surg,,284

510329,Navigating the narrow bridge to CAR T-cell therapy,2020,"COVID-19 has affected the United States leading to a national emergency with health care and economic impact, propelling the country into a recession with disrupted lifestyles not seen in recent history. COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis 1. Minimize regulatory burden by all agencies so that critically ill COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance.2. Institute appropriate safeguards to avoid negative consequences from unscrupulous actors.3. With proper informed consent from patients or proxy when necessary, and subject to accumulation of data in that cohort, allow the procedure to be initiated in critically ill patients who are not responding to conventional therapies.KEY WORDS: Coronavirus, COVID-19, cytokine storm, multiorgan failure, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.","Atluri, Sairam; Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Hirsch, Joshua A",Pain Physician,,284

Additional goals of the initiative were to improve workflow efficiency by reducing the amount of time spent donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) and to conserve PPE, which could be in short supply in a prolonged pandemic. The QI team developed a ""warm zone model"" that allowed staff members to wear the same mask, eye protection, and gown while moving between the rooms of patients who had tested positive for COVID-19. The risk of self-contamination while doffing PPE is well documented. Staff members were trained to conserve PPE and to properly change gloves and perform hand hygiene between exiting and entering patients' rooms. The warm zone model allowed multidisciplinary team members to reduce the times they donned and doffed PPE per shift while maintaining or increasing the times they entered and exited patients' rooms. Staff members believed that the model improved workflow and teamwork while maintaining staff members' personal safety.

513212,Generalized SHAP: Generating multiple types of explanations in machine learning,2020-06-12,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the accuracy of a new COVID-19 prognostic score based on lung ultrasound (LUS) and previously validated variables in predicting critical illness. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort development and internal validation study of the COVID-19 Worsening Score (COWS), based on a combination of the previously validated COVID-GRAM score (GRAM) variables and LUS. Adult COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) were enrolled. Ten variables previously identified by GRAM, days from symptom onset, LUS findings, and peripheral oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F) ratio were analyzed. LUS score as a single predictor was assessed. We evaluated GRAM model's performance, the impact of adding LUS, and then developed a new model based on the most predictive variables. RESULTS: Among 274 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 174 developed critical illness. The GRAM score identified 51 patients at high risk of developing critical illness and 132 at low risk. LUS score over 15 (range 0 to 36) was associated with a higher risk ratio of critical illness (RR, 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-2.77; area under the curve [AUC], 0.63; 95% CI 0.676-0.634). The newly developed COVID-19 Worsening Score relies on five variables to classify high- and low-risk patients with an overall accuracy of 80% and negative predictive value of 93% (95% CI, 87%-98%). Patients scoring more than 0.183 on COWS showed a RR of developing critical illness of 8.07 (95% CI, 4.97-11.1). CONCLUSIONS: COWS accurately identify patients who are unlikely to need intensive care unit (ICU) admission, preserving resources for the remaining high-risk patients.","Boero, Enrico; Rovida, Serena; Schreiber, Annia; Berchialla, Paola; Charrier, Lorena; Cravino, Marta Maria; Converso, Marcella; Gollini, Paola; Puppo, Mattia; Gravina, Angela; Fornelli, Giorgia; Labarile, Giulia; Sciacca, Santi; Bove, Tiziana; Karakitsos, Dimitrios; Aprà, Franco; Blaivas, Michael; Vetrugno, Luigi",Echocardiography,,284

DESIGN: Cohort study (daily time series of case counts). SETTING: Observational and population based. PARTICIPANTS: Confirmed COVID-19 cases nationally and across 20 states that accounted for >99% of the current cumulative case counts in India until 31 May 2020. EXPOSURE: Lockdown (non-medical intervention). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We illustrate the masking of state-level trends and highlight the variations across states by presenting evaluative evidence on some aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak: case fatality rates, doubling times of cases, effective reproduction numbers and the scale of testing. RESULTS: The estimated effective reproduction number R for India was 3.36 (95% CI 3.03 to 3.71) on 24 March, whereas the average of estimates from 25 May to 31 May stands at 1.27 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.28). Similarly, the estimated doubling time across India was at 3.56 days on 24 March, and the past 7-day average for the same on 31 May is 14.37 days. The average daily number of tests increased from 1717 (19-25 March) to 113 372 (25-31 May) while the test positivity rate increased from 2.1% to 4.2%, respectively. However, various states exhibit substantial departures from these national patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of change over lockdown periods indicate the lockdown has been partly effective in slowing the spread of the virus nationally. However, there exist large state-level variations and identifying these variations can help in both understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and formulating effective public health interventions. Our framework offers a holistic assessment of the pandemic across Indian states and union territories along with a set of interactive visualisation tools that are daily updated at covind19.org.","Salvatore, Maxwell; Basu, Deepankar; Ray, Debashree; Kleinsasser, Mike; Purkayastha, Soumik; Bhattacharyya, Rupam; Mukherjee, Bhramar",BMJ Open,,284

518402,COVID-Classifier: an automated machine learning model to assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in chest X-ray images,2021,"Metabolic reprogramming in cancer describes the multifaceted alterations in metabolism that contribute to tumorigenesis. Major determinants of metabolic phenotypes are the changes in signalling pathways associated with oncogenic activation together with cues from the tumor microenvironment. Therein, depleted oxygen and nutrient levels elicit metabolic stress, requiring cancer cells to engage adaptive mechanisms. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) act as regulatory elements within metabolic pathways and their widespread dysregulation in cancer contributes to altered metabolic phenotypes. Indeed, ncRNAs are the regulatory accomplices of many prominent effectors of metabolic reprogramming including c-MYC and HIFs that are activated by metabolic stress. By example, this review illustrates the range of ncRNAs mechanisms impacting these effectors throughout their DNA-RNA-protein lifecycle along with presenting the mechanistic roles of ncRNAs in adaptive responses to glucose, glutamine and lipid deprivation. We also discuss the facultative activation of metabolic enzymes by ncRNAs, a phenomenon which may reflect a broad but currently invisible level of metabolic regulation. Finally, the translational challenges associated with ncRNA discoveries are discussed, emphasizing the gaps in knowledge together with importance of understanding the molecular basis of ncRNA regulatory mechanisms.","Liu, Xiaoying; Feng, Shanshan; Zhang, Xu Dong; Li, Jinming; Zhang, Kaiguang; Wu, Mian; Thorne, Rick F",Cancer lett,,284

The government and public health agencies followed many strategies to counter the fatal virus. However, the virus severely affected the social and economic lives of the people. In this paper, we extract and study the opinion of people from the top five worst affected countries by the virus, namely USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and South Africa. We propose a deep language-independent Multilevel Attention-based Conv-BiGRU network (MACBiG-Net), which includes embedding layer, word-level encoded attention, and sentence-level encoded attention mechanism to extract the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. The embedding layer encodes the sentence sequence into a real-valued vector. The word-level and sentence-level encoding is performed by a 1D Conv-BiGRU based mechanism, followed by word-level and sentence-level attention, respectively. We further develop a COVID-19 Sentiment Dataset by crawling the tweets from Twitter. Extensive experiments on our proposed dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MACBiG-Net. Also, attention-weights visualization and in-depth results analysis shows that the proposed network has effectively captured the sentiments of the people.","Yadav, Ashima; Vishwakarma, Dinesh Kumar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10358v1.pdf,284

520018,Enhanced BB84 quantum cryptography protocol for secure communication in wireless body sensor networks for medical applications,2021,"Wastewater-based surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 has been used for the early warning of transmission or objective trending of the population-level disease prevalence. Here, we describe a new use-case of conducting targeted wastewater surveillance to complement clinical testing for case identification in a small community at risk of COVID-19 transmission. On 2 July 2020, a cluster of COVID-19 cases in two unrelated households residing on different floors in the same stack of an apartment building was reported in Singapore. After cases were conveyed to healthcare facilities and six healthy household contacts were quarantined in their respective apartments, wastewater surveillance was implemented for the entire residential block. SARS-CoV-2 was subsequently detected in wastewaters in an increasing frequency and concentration, despite the absence of confirmed COVID-19 cases, suggesting the presence of fresh case/s in the building. Phone interviews of six residents in quarantine revealed that no one was symptomatic (fever/respiratory illness). However, when nasopharyngeal swabs from six quarantined residents were tested by PCR tests, one was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positive case reported episodes of diarrhea and the case's stool sample was also positive for SARS-CoV-2, explaining the SARS-CoV-2 spikes observed in wastewaters. After the case was conveyed to a healthcare facility, wastewaters continued to yield positive signals for five days, though with a decreasing intensity. This was attributed to the return of recovered cases, who had continued to shed the virus. Our findings demonstrate the utility of wastewater surveillance as a non-intrusive tool to monitor high-risk COVID-19 premises, which is able to trigger individual tests for case detection, highlighting a new use-case for wastewater testing.","Wong, Judith Chui Ching; Tan, Joanna; Lim, Ying Xian; Arivalan, Sathish; Hapuarachchi, Hapuarachchige Chanditha; Mailepessov, Diyar; Griffiths, Jane; Jayarajah, Praveena; Setoh, Yin Xiang; Tien, Wei Ping; Low, Swee Ling; Koo, Carmen; Yenamandra, Surya Pavan; Kong, Marcella; Lee, Vernon Jian Ming; Ng, Lee Ching",Sci Total Environ,,284

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) technology cannot be implemented easily and in large scale in some communities due to lack of resources and infrastructures. Here, we report a simple colorimetric strategy derived from linker-based single-component assembly of gold nanoparticle core-spherical nucleic acids (AuNP-coreSNAs) for visual detection of PCR products of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) template. A palindromic linker is designed based on E gene of SARS-CoV-2 to program the identical colloidal SNAs into large assemblies along with a distinct red-to-purple color change. The linker acts as a probe of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in conventional PCR reaction. In the presence of the correct template, the palindromic linker, which is complementary to a short region within the amplicon, is cleaved by 5'-exonuclease activity of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase. Disintegrating the palindromic linker during the amplification process inhibits the post single-component assembly formation of SNAs. So, positive and negative viral samples produce simply red and purple colors in the post PCR colorimetric test, respectively. Evaluation of the samples obtained from cases with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed that our assay can rival with Real-time PCR method in sensitivity.","Karami, Abbas; Hasani, Masoumeh; Jalilian, Farid Azizi; Ezati, Razieh",Sens Actuators B Chem,,284

Initially, it affects the upper respiratory tract, induces viral infection in the lungs, and causes severe pneumonia in the COVID-19 infected patients. After the infection in the body, changes appear in other biomarkers in the body therby imbalancing the body response studied by the virus's pathophysiology. However, this infection starts comorbidity directly and indirectly in COVID-19 infected patients. During this period of infection, the immune system is also suppressed by the virus and initiates other diseases. The authors focus on the cardiovascular comorbidity study of COVID-19 in the current work. In the comorbidity study of COVID-19, the virus mainly affects hypertension patients. The risk factor of comorbidity of hypertension and cardiovascular disorder is 30.7%, and 11.9% with diabetes mellitus. In this study, we reveal the pathophysiology, treatment, and management of cardiovascular diseases, their risk factor, and medicine results on the COVID-19 infected patients. SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets ACE-2 receptors because this virus receives this receptor as a host for the cellular entry of the virus in the body, these shows down regulations in the maintenance of BP, and the body suffers from multi-organ failure. The other diseases related to CVS are Inflammatory cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, irregular heartbeat, embolism events, and Coronary infarction that also affect its pathophysiology.","Singh, Suruchi; Bhatt, Pankaj; Sharma, Satish Kumar; Kaur, Tejinder",Curr. diabetes rev.

Understanding how best to estimate state-level policy effects is important, and several unanswered questions remain, particularly about optimal methods for disentangling the effects of concurrently implemented policies. In this paper, we examined the impact of co-occurring policies on the performance of commonly used models in state policy evaluations. Data Sources. Outcome of interest (annual state-specific opioid mortality rate per 100,000) was obtained from 1999-2016 National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Multiple Cause of Death mortality files. Study Design. We utilized Monte Carlo simulations to assess the effect of concurrent policy enactment on the evaluation of state-level policies. Simulation conditions varied effect sizes of the co-occurring policies as well as the length of time between enactment dates of the co-occurring policies, among other factors. Data Collection. Longitudinal annual state-level data over 18 years from 50 states. Principal Findings. Our results demonstrated high relative bias (>85%) will arise when confounding co-occurring policies are omitted from the analytic model and the co-occuring policies are enacted in rapid succession. Moreover, our findings indicated that controlling for all co-occurring policies will effectively mitigate the threat of confounding bias; however, effect estimates may be relatively imprecise, with larger variance estimates when co-occurring policies were enacted in near succession of each other. We also found that the required length of time between co-occurring policies necessary to obtain robust policy estimates varied across model specifications, being generally shorter for autoregressive (AR) models compared to difference-in-differences (DID) models.","Griffin, Beth Ann; Schuler, Megan S.; Pane, Joseph; Patrick, Stephen W.; Smart, Rosanna; Stein, Bradley D.; Grimm, Geoffrey; Stuart, Elizabeth A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04304v1.pdf,284
521244,Early pleural effusion detection from respiratory diseases including COVID-19 via deep learning,2020,"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the infection-fatality risk (ie, risk of death among all infected individuals including those with asymptomatic and mild infections) is crucial for gauging the burden of death due to COVID-19 in the coming months or years. Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear. METHODS: In this model-based analysis, we developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using available case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the infection-fatality risk for all ages overall and for five age groups (<25, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and &#8805;75 years) separately, during the period March 1 to June 6, 2020 (ie, before the city began a phased reopening). FINDINGS: During the period March 1 to June 6, 2020, 205â639 people had a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 21â447 confirmed and probable COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of New York City. We estimated an overall infection-fatality risk of 1·39% (95% credible interval 1·04-1·77) in New York City. Our estimated infection-fatality risk for the two oldest age groups (65-74 and &#8805;75 years) was much higher than the younger age groups, with a cumulative estimated infection-fatality risk of 0·116% (0·0729-0·148) for those aged 25-44 years and 0·939% (0·729-1·19) for those aged 45-64 years versus 4·87% (3·37-6·89) for those aged 65-74 years and 14·2% (10·2-18·1) for those aged 75 years and older. In particular, weekly infection-fatality risk was estimated to be as high as 6·72% (5·52-8·01) for those aged 65-74 years and 19·1% (14·7-21·9) for those aged 75 years and older. INTERPRETATION: Our results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City than other places and thus probably reflect the true higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than that previously reported elsewhere. Given the high infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2, governments must account for and closely monitor the infection rate and population health outcomes and enact prompt public health responses accordingly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.

The evidence base underpinning such practices warrants examination. OBJECTIVES: To synthesize current guidance and systematic review evidence on extended use, reuse, or reprocessing of single-use surgical masks or filtering face-piece respirators. DATA SOURCES: We used the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public Health England websites to identify guidance. We used Medline, PubMed, Epistemonikos, Cochrane Database, and preprint servers for systematic reviews. METHODS: Two reviewers conducted screening and data extraction. The quality of included systematic reviews was appraised using AMSTAR-2. Findings were narratively synthesized. RESULTS: In total, 6 guidance documents were identified. Levels of detail and consistency across documents varied. They included 4 high-quality systematic reviews: 3 focused on reprocessing (decontamination) of N95 respirators and 1 focused on reprocessing of surgical masks. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation were highlighted as the most promising reprocessing methods, but evidence on the relative efficacy and safety of different methods was limited. We found no well-established methods for reprocessing respirators at scale. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the impact of extended use and reuse of surgical masks and respirators is limited, and gaps and inconsistencies exist in current guidance.

In the absence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), every pair of orthologs forms a reciprocal best match. Incorrect orthology assignments therefore are always false positives in the reciprocal best match graph. We consider duplication/loss scenarios and characterize unambiguous false-positive (u-fp) orthology assignments, that is, edges in the best match graphs (BMGs) that cannot correspond to orthologs for any gene tree that explains the BMG. Moreover, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to identify all u-fp orthology assignments in a BMG. Simulations show that at least [Formula: see text] of all incorrect orthology assignments can be detected in this manner.

Unfortunately, as people spend more time participating in Internet activities, they are more likely to encounter problematic internet use (PIU) issues. The main purpose of this study was to examine the association between two kinds of PIU [problematic smartphone use (PSU) and problematic social media use (PSMU)], psychological distress, and sleep problems. In addition, the moderating effect of sleep problems was examined. A total of 11014 school teachers completed the online survey. The participants were divided into two (high and low sleep problem) groups, according to the severity of their sleep problems, for comparison. The research conducted a comparison between the degree of PIU and psychological distress, and then provided correction for the two groups separately. The results indicated that the high sleep problem group exhibited significantly greater psychological distress [mean (SD)= 12.94 (11.29)] than the low sleep problem group [(mean (SD)= 3.42 (6.57)]. Both PSU and PSMU were positively correlated with psychological distress in the two groups. The moderating effect of sleep problems was supported and PSMU was more harmful to psychological distress in the high sleep problem group, while the effect of PSU on psychological distress was not significantly different between the two groups.","Lee, Zeng-Han; Chen, I-Hua",Sleep Epidemiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667343621000056?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667343621000056; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleepe.2021.100005,284

It is responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has cost the lives of 2.5 million people. Ergo, the global scientific community has been scrambling to repurpose or develop therapeutics to treat COVID-19. Dietary supplements and nutraceuticals are among those under consideration due to the link between nutritional status and patient outcomes. Overall, poor vitamin D status seems to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. Severely ill COVID-19 patients appear to be deficient or have suboptimal levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a measure of vitamin D status. Consequently, vitamin D is now the subject of several prophylactic and therapeutic clinical trials. In this review, the general status of nutraceuticals and dietary supplements amid the pandemic is appraised, with a particular focus on vitamin D. Consumers should be aware of misinformation and unsubstantiated promises for products marketed for COVID-19 protection. However, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle will likely maintain health including optimum immune function that may affect patient outcomes. Those who are deficient in key nutrients such as vitamin D should consider lifestyle changes and potentially supplementation in consultation with their physician and/or registered dieticians.","Lordan, Ronan",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13030740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33652653/,284

Research question What is the incidence of TC in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and what is the relationship between the dose of anticoagulant therapy and the incidence of TC? Study design and methods All consecutive patients referred to eight French intensive care units (ICU) for COVID-19 were included in our observational study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from ICU admission to day 14, including anticoagulation status and thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The effect of high dose prophylactic anticoagulation (either at intermediate or equivalent to therapeutic dose), defined using a standardized protocol of classification, was assessed using a time-varying exposure model using inverse probability of treatment weight. Results Out of 538 patients included, 104 patients developed a total of 122 TC with an incidence of 22.7 % (19.2-26.3). Pulmonary embolism accounted for 52 % of the recorded TC. High dose prophylactic anticoagulation was associated with a significant reduced risk of TC (HR 0.81 [0.66-0.99]) without increasing the risk of bleeding (HR 1.11 [0.70-1.75]). Interpretation High dose prophylactic anticoagulation is associated with a reduction in thrombotic complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients without an increased risk of hemorrhage. Randomized controlled trials comparing prophylaxis with higher doses of anticoagulants are needed to confirm these results.","Tacquard, Charles; Mansour, Alexandre; Godon, Alexandre; Godet, Julien; Poissy, Julien; Garrigue, Delphine; Kipnis, Eric; Hamada, Sophie Rym; Mertes, Paul Michel; Steib, Annick; Ulliel-Roche, Mathilde; Bouhemad, Bélaïd; Nguyen, Maxime; Reizine, Florian; Gouin-Thibault, Isabelle; Besse, Marie Charlotte; Collercandy, Nived; Mankikian, Stefan; Levy, Jerrold H.; Gruel, Yves; Albaladejo, Pierre; Susen, Sophie; Godier, Anne",Chest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465342/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369221000477?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.01.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369221000477,284
595144,An evolutionary game modeling to assess the effect of border enforcement measures and socio-economic cost: Export-importation epidemic dynamics,2021-04-08,"BACKGROUND: Overcoming coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will likely require mass vaccination. With vaccination scepticism rising in many countries, assessing the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 is of crucial global health importance. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine how personal and family COVID-19 risk and ICU (intensive care unit) availability just before the pandemics influence the acceptance of future COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: A two-leg survey was carried out for comparing vaccination attitudes pre-and post-COVID-19. UK residents were surveyed in October 2019 about their vaccination attitudes, and again in a follow-up survey in April 2020, containing the previous questions and further ones related to COVID-19 exposure and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. The study combined survey results with local COVID-19 incidence and pre-COVID-19 measures of ICU capacity and occupancy. Regression analysis of the impact of individual and public health factors on attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination was performed. RESULTS: The October 2019 survey included a nationally representative sample of 1,653 UK residents. All of them were invited for the follow-up survey in April 2020, and 1,194 (72%) participated. The April 2020 sample remained nationally representative. Overall, 85% of respondents (and 55% of vaccine sceptics) would be willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Higher personal and family risk for COVID-19 was associated with stronger COVID-19 vaccination willingness, whereas low pre-COVID-19 ICU availability was associated with lower trust in medical experts and lower COVID-19 vaccine support. Further, general vaccination support has risen during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Support for COVID-19 vaccination is high amongst all groups, even vaccine sceptics, boding well for future vaccination take-up rates. Vaccination willingness is correlated with health care availability during the COVID-19 crisis, suggesting a powerful synergy between health care system performance during crisis and the general population’s trust in the medical profession – as reflected in vaccination support.","Blanchard-Rohner, Géraldine; Caprettini, Bruno; Rohner, Dominic; Voth, Hans-Joaquim",J Virus Erad,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jve.2021.100044; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2055664021000170?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026244/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2055664021000170,284

L’organisation d’une consultation dite « post-COVID » initiée en mai 2020 et son évaluation constitue l’objectif de cette étude. Matériels et méthodes Étude rétrospective de cohorte des patients>18 ans, présentant une histoire clinique compatible avec une infection à SARS-COV-2, une symptomatologie persistante≥30 j du j0 et vus en consultation post-COVID entre mai–juin 2020. Le diagnostic d’infection à SARS-COV-2 a été définie par une RT-PCR SARS-COV-2 positive et/ou une sérologique positive en IgG (Architect, Abbott ; sensibilité 100 % [IC95 : 95,8–100 %] ; spécificité 99,6 % [IC95 : 99,0–99,9 %]). Les variables continues sont présentées en médiane et IQR. L’analyse présentée compare les caractéristiques des patients confirmés au SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19 positif) à ceux non confirmés (COVID-19 négatif). Résultats Un total de 83 patients (71 femmes [86 %], 46 ans [38–52]) ont consulté dans un délai 61jours (j) (49–78) après le début des symptômes. Les manifestations cliniques persistantes après j30 les plus fréquentes étaient : asthénie/myalgies (n =58, 70 %), toux (n =34, 41 %), dyspnée (n =45, 54 %) et douleur thoracique (n =43, 52 %). Parmi eux, 32/83 (39 %) avaient eu une PCR SARS-COV-2 positive et 51/83 (61 %) n’avait pas de preuve virologique d’infection. Une sérologie réalisée chez 78 patients (27 avec PCR positive antérieure et 51 sans preuve virologique) montre la présence d’Ac anti-SARS-CoV chez 37/78 (47 %) : 26/27 (97 %) des patients avec PCR initiale positive et 11/51 (22 %) des patients sans preuve virologique initiale. Au total, 43/83 (52 %) patients de la consultation post-COVID ont eu un COVID-19 confirmé. Le groupe COVID-19 positif (n =43, 33 femmes [77 %], 49 ans [44–59]) était significativement plus âgé (p =0,005) avec un délai de consultation plus court par rapport au j0 (55 j [45–70] vs 73 j [53–82], p =0,007) que les COVID-19 négatif (n =40, 29 femmes [73 %], 42 ans [35–49]) avec à j0, significativement plus souvent de la toux (n =36 [84 %] vs n =25 [63 %], p =0,028), une anosmie/dysgueusie (n =29 [67 %] vs n =8 [20 %], p <0,0001), des céphalées (n =26 [61 %] vs n =13 [33 %], p =0,010) et une hospitalisation plus fréquente (28 % vs 2,5 %, p =0,001). L’évolution clinique du groupe COVID-19 positif montrait la persistance majoritairement d’asthénie/myalgies (n =31, 72 %), toux et dyspnée (n =22, 51 %).

Understanding how this increase occurs locally is crucial in informing appropriate food insecurity-related responses. Analyzing 2-1-1 call data is one way to examine food insecurity-related needs at a zip code level. The purpose of this work was to: (1) examine overall call trend data to 2-1-1 from March through July 2019 and March through July 2020, (2) examine changes in food need call volume to 2-1-1 during COVID-19 by zip code, and (3) identify areas with unmet food needs during COVID-19 in central Texas. Data for 2-1-1 calls from Travis County zip codes for March through July 2020 were compared to calls for March through July 2019 and categorized by reason for calling. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were used to analyze food need calls by zip code and mapped using ArcGIS. Communities with high food call volume and no emergency food assets located within the zip code were categorized as areas with unmet food needs. Results indicated there were more overall calls to 2-1-1 in 2020 (N=37,572) than in 2019 (N=28,623), and significantly more food need calls in 2020 than in 2019 (p<0.01). Eastern Travis County, a racially and ethnically diverse and lower-income area, had the largest increase in food need calls. Two zip codes were identified as having unmet food needs, which informed the strategic placement of emergency food assets. This study illustrates how 2-1-1 data can result in rapid translation of research to policy and program implementation.","Janda, Kathryn M.; Hood, Raven; Price, Amy; Night, Samantha; Marty, William Edwin; Rohlich, Amanda; Hanson, Kacey; Espinoza, Marianna; van den Berg, Alexandra E.",J Agric Food Syst Community Dev,https://doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2021.103.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367719/,284

Its unique properties and diverse applications present it as the material for the future. The aim of this study is to presents the relative applications of nanomaterial in some aspects of agriculture production. The study discussed nanotechnology applicability in climate control and photosynthesis in the greenhouse farming, hydroponic systems, solar drying, fabrication of crop processing machine components, oxygen scavengers in crop packaging, and micro-organism stimulant in anaerobic digestion for agro biomass conversion. Some highlights from the review revealed that Nanotechnology can be applied to increase water surface area to volume ratio and heat transfer in the air moving into a greenhouse farming. Water cluster can be changed when treated with nanoparticles through ultraviolet absorption spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy resulting in lower micelles to manipulate water delivery in green house farming. Nano-fluids or Nano-composites can be used to recombine the reactive parts of thermal storage materials after broken at elevated temperature to recover the stored heat for drying purpose during the off-sunshine periods in solar drying of crops. Nanomaterials can be a source of electroluminescence light in hydroponic system and act as coatings and surface hardener in crop processing machinery for post-harvest machines.

This research adopted a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative approaches and surveyed 102 people, interviewed 13 participants, and conducted two focus-groups within its research design. Analysis of data indicates that former Afghan refugees gradually settled down and integrated within Australian society. They value safety and security, open democracy and orderly society of Australia, as well as accessing to education and healthcare services and opportunity for social mobility. However, since the integration is a long process, they are also facing some challenges in this area. Findings of this study show that Afghan-Australians require more support from Australian governments to overcome some of these challenges particularly securing employment within their area of interests and professional occupations that they have qualifications and experiences from Afghanistan. They are also experiencing broader challenges in the area of socio-cultural issues within Australian society.

This study proposed a novel approach based on a dynamic time-varying transmission rate with a control rate governing the speed of disease spread, which may be associated with the information related to infectious disease intervention. Integration of multiple sources of data with disease modelling has the potential to improve modelling performance. Taking the global mobility trend of vehicle driving available via Apple Maps as an example, this study explored different ways of processing the mobility trend data and investigated their relationship with the control rate. The proposed method was evaluated based on COVID-19 data from six European countries. The results suggest that the proposed model with dynamic transmission rate improved the performance of model fitting and forecasting during the early stage of the pandemic. Positive correlation has been found between the average daily change of mobility trend and control rate. The results encourage further development for incorporation of multiple resources into infectious disease modelling in the future.","Jing, Min; Ng, Kok Yew; Namee, Brian Mac; Biglarbeigi, Pardis; Brisk, Rob; Bond, Raymond; Finlay, Dewar; McLaughlin, James",J Biomed Inform,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34481056/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421002343?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046421002343,284

It is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which plays a key role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process, is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that recognizes and binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while the S2 subunit mediates viral cell membrane fusion. Hence, it is a key target for developing neutralizing antibodies. Here, we have performed phylogenetic analysis and structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which is found highly conserved. The overall percent protein sequence identity from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences from the NCBI database was 99.68%. The functional domains of the S protein reveal that the S1 subunit was highly conserved (99.70%) than the S2 subunit (99.66%). Further, the 319–541 residues (RBD) of amino acids within the S1 domain were 100% similar among the spike protein. The 3D modeling of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein indicated that S protein has four domains with five protein units and the S1 subunit from 1 to 289 amino acid of domain 1 is highly conserved without any change in the ligand interaction site. This analysis clearly suggests that the S1 subunit (RBD 319–541) can be used as a target region for stable and safe vaccine development.","S.N., Nagesha; B.N., Ramesh; C., Pradeep; K.S., Shashidhara; Ramakrishnappa, Thippeswamy; B.T., Krishnaprasad; S.M., Jnanashree; M., Manohar; N., Arunkumar; Yallappa; D., Dhanush Patel; T.V., Rakesh; E., Girish; Bagoji, Mahantesh; Chandaragi, Shreeram S.",Mater Today Proc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785321050227?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2021.07.163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307057/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214785321050227,284

610016,"Translational research on Myology & Mobility Medicine: 2021 semi-virtual PDM3 from Thermae of Euganean Hills, May 26-29, 2021",2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND: Risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases with age, is greater in males, and is associated with decreased numbers of blood lymphoid cells. Though the reasons for these robust associations are unclear, effects of age and sex on innate and adaptive lymphoid subsets, including on homeostatic innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) implicated in disease tolerance, may underlie the effects of age and sex on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to quantitate subsets of blood lymphoid cells from people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), comparing those hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (n=40) and those treated as outpatients for less severe disease (n=51). 86 healthy individuals served as controls. The relationship between abundance of specific blood lymphoid cell types, age, sex, hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, and elevation of blood markers for systemic inflammation, was determined using multiple regression. RESULTS: After accounting for effects of age and sex, hospitalization for COVID-19 was associated with 1.78-fold fewer ILCs (95%CI: 2.34–1.36; p = 4.55 × 10(−5)) and 2.31-fold fewer CD16(+) natural killer (NK) cells (95%CI: 3.1–1.71; p = 1.04 × 10(−7)), when compared to uninfected controls. Among people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the odds ratio for hospitalization, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of symptoms, was 0.413 (95%CI: 0.197–0.724; p = 0.00691) for every 2-fold increase in ILCs. In addition, higher ILC abundance was associated with less time spent in the hospital and lower levels of blood markers associated with COVID-19 severity: each two-fold increase in ILC abundance was associated with a 9.38 day decrease in duration of hospital stay (95% CI: 15.76–3.01; p = 0.0054), and decrease in blood C-reactive protein (CRP) by 46.29 mg/L (95% CI: 71.34–21.24; p = 6.25 × 10(−4)), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) by 11.04 mm/h (95% CI: 21.94–0.13; p = 0.047), and the fibrin degradation product D-dimer by 1098.52 ng/mL (95% CI: 1932.84–264.19; p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Both ILCs and NK cells were depleted in the blood of people hospitalized for severe COVID-19, but, among lymphoid cell subsets, only ILC abundance was independently associated with the need for hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, and severity of inflammation. These results indicate that, by promoting disease tolerance, homeostatic ILCs protect against morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggest that reduction in the number of ILCs with age and in males accounts for the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in these demographic groups.","Silverstein, Noah J.; Wang, Yetao; Manickas-Hill, Zachary; Carbone, Claudia C.; Dauphin, Ann; Li, Jonathan Z.; Walker, Bruce D.; Yu, Xu G.; Luban, Jeremy",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469605/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249839v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.14.21249839,284

Racial and ethnic health disparities such as these are frequently aggravated by inequitable access to healthcare resources in disadvantaged communities. Yet, no known studies have investigated disadvantaged communities' access to COVID-19-related healthcare resources. The current study accordingly examined racial and ethnic differences in (1) April 2020 COVID-19 total and positive viral test rates across 177 New York City (NYC) ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA); and (2) November 2019–April 2020 licensed and intensive care unit (ICU) hospital bed access across 194 NYC ZCTAs. Pairwise analyses indicated higher COVID-19 total and positive test rates per 1000 persons in majority Black and Hispanic vs. majority White ZCTAs (CI [0.117, 4.55]; CI [2.53, 5.14]). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that higher percentage of Black and Hispanic residents predicted more total COVID-19 tests per 1000 persons (p < 0.05). In contrast, majority Black and Hispanic ZCTAs had fewer licensed and ICU beds (CI [6.50, 124.25]; CI [0.69, 7.16]), with social disadvantage predicting lower licensed and ICU bed access per 1000 persons (p < 0.01). While anecdotal reports of inequitable access to COVID-19-related healthcare resources in ethnocultural minority communities have emerged, this is the first study to reveal that social disadvantage may be a major driver of hospital resource inequities in Black and Hispanic communities. Thus, it will be imperative to enact policies that ensure equitable allocation of healthcare resources to socially disadvantaged communities to address current and future public health crises.","Douglas, Jason A.; Subica, Andrew M.",Prev Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091743520303066; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743520303066?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035550/,284

Physical, psychological and nutritional outcomes are important pre-operatively. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate these outcomes in patients with PM before and after CRS-HIPEC. METHODS: Between June 2018 and November 2019, participants were recruited to a single-centre study. Primary outcome was cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) variables oxygen uptake (VO(2)) at anaerobic threshold (AT) and at peak. Secondary outcome measures were upper and lower body strength, health related quality of life (HRQoL) and the surgical fear questionnaire. Exploratory outcomes included body mass index, nutrient intake and post-operative outcome. All participants were asked to undertake assessments pre CRS-HIPEC and 12 weeks following the procedure. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were screened, 38 were eligible and 16 were recruited. Ten female and 6 male, median (IQR) age 53 (42–63) years. Of the 16 patients recruited, 14 proceeded with CRS-HIPEC and 10 competed the follow up assessment at week 12. Pre-operative VO(2) at AT and peak was 16.8 (13.7–18) ml.kg(-1).min(-1) and 22.2 (19.3–25.3) ml.kg(-1).min(-1), upper body strength was 25.9 (20.3–41.5) kg, lower body strength was 14 (10.4–20.3) sec, HRQoL (overall health status) was 72.5 (46.3–80) % whilst overall surgical fear was 39 (30.5–51). The VO(2) at AT decreased significantly (p = 0.05) and HRQoL improved (p = 0.04) between pre and post- CRS-HIPEC. There were no significant differences for any of the other outcome measures. CONCLUSION: This pilot study showed a significant decrease in VO(2) at AT and an improvement in overall HRQoL at the 12 week follow up. The findings will inform a larger study design to investigate a prehabilitation and rehabilitation cancer survivorship programme.","Loughney, Lisa; McCaffrey, Noel; Timon, Claire M.; Grundy, Joshua; McCarren, Andrew; Cahill, Ronan; Moyna, Niall; Mulsow, Jurgen",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242816; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296392/,284

Indeed, co-culture allows for the study of cell morphology (infected and not infected), the ultrastructure of the inoculated virus, and the different steps of the virus infectious cycle. Most EM methods for studying virus cycles are applied after infected cells are produced in large quantities and detached to obtain a pellet. Here, cell culture was performed in sterilized, collagen-coated single-break strip wells. After one day in culture, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Wells of interest were fixed at different time points, from 2 to 36 h post-infection. Microwave-assisted resin embedding was accomplished directly in the wells in 4 h. Finally, ultra-thin sections were cut directly through the infected-cell monolayers. Our methodology requires, in total, less than four days for preparing and observing cells. Furthermore, by observing undetached infected cell monolayers, we were able to observe new ultrastructural findings, such as cell–cell interactions and baso-apical cellular organization related to the virus infectious cycle. Our innovative methodology thus not only saves time for preparation but also adds precision and new knowledge about viral infection, as shown here for SARS-CoV-2.","Le Bideau, Marion; Wurtz, Nathalie; Baudoin, Jean-Pierre; La Scola, Bernard",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073053/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9061194,284

Current therapies of LSCD are focused on the transplantation of donor corneas or tissue equivalents produced from autologous limbal stem cells. Every year there are waiting millions of patients for the cornea transplantation all over the world and the list is growing due to the relatively low number of cornea donors. On the other hand, the transplantation of tissue or cells into the recipient’s body is associated with the higher risk of possible side effects. The possibility of the application of an indirect treatment using the properties of the paracrine activity of stem cells, would be beneficial for the patients with transplant failures. This study was to evaluate the paracrine effect of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (ADSC) on the viability of limbal epithelial stem cells (LESC). The paracrine effect was assessed by treating LESC with conditioned medium collected from ADSC culture. Cell viability, cytotoxicity, apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated using in vitro assays in standard conditions and induced inflammation. After the exposure to the examined conditions, the expression of genes related to pro- and anti- inflammatory factors was evaluated and compared to the secretion of selected cytokines by ELISA test. Moreover, the changes in LESC phenotype were assessed using of phenotype microarrays. Our findings suggest that paracrine activity of ADSC on LESC promotes its proliferation and has a potential role in mitigation of the adverse impact of inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide.","Sikora, Bartosz; Skubis-Sikora, Aleksandra; Prusek, Agnieszka; Gola, Joanna",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99435-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620960/,284

We included consecutive hospitalized patients from 1 February to 31 May 2020 with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 Italian tertiary referral centers (derivation cohort, n = 187 patients; validation cohort, n = 62 patients). Serum biomarker levels were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lung tissue from 9 patients was stained for angiopoietin-2, Tie2, CD68, and CD34. Cox model was used to identify risk factors for mortality and nonresolving pulmonary condition. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to assess the accuracy of 3- and 10-day angiopoietin-2 for in-hospital mortality and nonresolving pulmonary condition, respectively. Three-day angiopoietin-2 increase of at least twofold from baseline was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 6.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-24.19; P = .004) with AUROC = 0.845 (95% CI, 0.725-0.940). Ten-day angiopoietin-2 of at least twofold from baseline was instead significantly associated with nonresolving pulmonary condition by multivariate analysis (HR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.34-11.77; P ≤ .0001) with AUROC = 0.969 (95% CI, 0.919-1.000). Patients with persistent elevation of 10-day angiopoietin-2 levels showed severe reticular interstitial thickening and fibrous changes on follow-up computed tomography scans. Angiopoietin-2 and Tie2 were diffusely colocalized in small-vessel endothelia and alveolar new vessels and macrophages. Angiopoietin-2 course is strongly associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and nonresolving pulmonary condition.

618492,A model based study on the dynamics of COVID-19: Prediction and control,2020-05-13,"Societal responses crucially shape the course of a pandemic, but are difficult to predict. Mitigation measures such as social distancing are here assumed to minimize a utility function that consists of two conflicting sub-targets, the disease related mortality and the multifaceted consequences of mitigation. The relative weight of the two sub-targets defines the mitigation readiness H, which entails the political, social, and psychological aspects of decision making. The dynamics of social and behavioral mitigation thus follows an adaptive rule, which in turn is mediated by a non-adaptive dynamics of H. This framework for social dynamics is integrated into an epidemiological model and applied to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Unperturbed simulations accurately reproduce diverse epidemic and mitigation trajectories from 2020 to 2021, reported from 11 European countries, Iran, and 8 US states. High regional variability in the severity and duration of the spring lockdown and in peak mortality rates of the first SARS-CoV-2 wave can be explained by differences in the reconstructed readiness H. A ubiquitous temporal decrease of H has greatly intensified second and third waves and slowed down their decay. The unprecedented skill of the model suggests that the combination of an adaptive and a non-adaptive rule may constitute a more fundamental mode in social dynamics. Its implementation in an epidemic context can produce realistic long-term scenarios relevant for strategic planning, such as on the feasibility of a zero-infection target or on the evolutionary arms race between mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and social responses.","Wirtz, Kai",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93248-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230560/,284

With the resumption of surgical activity, patients undergoing surgery were one of the first population groups to be systematically tested for PCR. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers after the resumption of non-essential surgical activity. Methods: Retrospective multicenter observational study of patients scheduled for surgery or undergoing emergency surgery in Catalonia between 20 April and 31 May 2020. The microbiological results of preoperative PCR tests and clinical records were reviewed, and an epidemiological survey was conducted on patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results: A total of 10838 patients scheduled for surgery or who underwent emergency surgery were screened for COVID-19. One hundred and eighteen patients (1.09%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the 72 hours prior to surgery. The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers was 0.7% (IC95%: 0.6% - 0.9%). The first week of the study presented the highest prevalence of asymptomatic carriers [1.9% (CI95%:1.1%-3.2%)]. Conclusions: The low levels of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 infection obtained in the surgical population of hospitals in Catalonia after the resumption of surgical activity, shows that most patients were able to undergo surgical procedures without the risks of COVID-19 associated complications in the perioperative period.","de Miguel, M; González-Tallada, A.; de Nadal, M; Biarnes, A.; Manrique, S.; Campins, M.; Álvarez, A.; Castellnou, J.; Pedregosa, A.; Rouras, G; Martínez-Cabañero, J.; Osorio, E.; Montero, A.; Saludesh jsaludes, J.; Binagui, AV; Farré, C.; Baumgartner, ML; Cadena, M.; Lacambra, M.; Faural faur, A.; Ibánez, NF; Delgado, R.; Santiveri, FJ; Escolano, F.; Tejedor, A.; Derios, C.; Remartínez, F.; Tobito, J.; Moret, MLl; Salmerón, O.; Isern, X.; Villalba, N.",Cir Esp,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009739X21000361?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33610261/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009739X21000361; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2021.01.014,284

RNA extracted from whole blood of COVID-19 cases was analysed by microarray analysis. Moderate and severe cases were compared with healthy controls and differentially regulated genes (DEGs) categorized into cellular pathways. DEGs in COVID-19 cases were mostly related to host immune activation and cytokine signaling, pathogen uptake, host defenses, blood and vasculature genes, and SARS-CoV-2- and other virus- affected pathways. The DEGs in these pathways were increased in severe compared with moderate cases. In a severe COVID-19 patient with an unfavourable outcome we observed dysregulation of genes in platelet homeostasis and cardiac conduction and fibrin clotting with disease progression.","Masood, K.

METHODS: : Mortality risk was calculated in micromorts with covid-19 data for January–October 2020, derived from the BC Centre for Disease Control, and illicit drug toxicity deaths for January 2010–September 2020, derived from the BC Coroners Service. Age-stratified covid-19 incidence and deaths per 100,000 and age-stratified illicit drug toxicity death rates per 100,000 were calculated. A micromort is a unit of risk equivalent to a one-in-a-million chance of death. RESULTS: : During the covid-19 pandemic, illicit drug toxicity deaths reached 1.0 micromorts per day, representing an increase of 0.5 micromorts per day relative to 2019 rates. In comparison, covid-19 mortality risk was 0.05 micromorts per day among individuals from the general population living in British Columbia and 21.1 micromorts per day among those infected with covid-19. Covid-related mortality risk was significantly lower among individuals aged <60 years, relative to older adults, whereas drug toxicity-related mortality was highest for individuals aged 30–59 years. CONCLUSIONS: : The mortality associated with covid-19 is apparent and distributed unevenly across subpopulations. The mortality due to overdose has increased during covid-19 and exceeds mortality due to covid-19. Our results instantiate the triple threat caused by covid-19 (i.e., the public health crisis, economic crisis and mental health crisis) and quantitatively highlight the externality of increased mortality due to deaths of despair in response to public health efforts to reduce covid-related mortality.","Lee, Yena; Lui, Leanna M.W.; Brietzke, Elisa; Liao, Yuhua; Lu, Ciyong; Ho, Roger; Subramaniapillai, Mehala; Mansur, Rodrigo B.; Rosenblat, Joshua D.; McIntyre, Roger S.",J Affect Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.09.059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34656039/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032721010181; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721010181?v=s5,284

Excluded typical manifestation of pneumonia and acute respiratory symptoms, COVID‐19 patients also have abnormal D‐dimer concentration in the serum, but the results are controversial. METHOD: A meta‐analysis first aims to explored the connection between D‐dimer concentration and COVID‐19 patients. RESULTS: Our results found a significant relationship between D‐dimer and COVID‐19, with a pooled OR of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.32‐2.48; P < .001). The pooled data were calculated with the REM as a high heterogeneity within the studies. The sensitivity analysis results showed that the WMD ranged from 1.69 (95% CI: 1.15 to 2.23) to 2.06 (95% CI: 1.51 to 2.62) and there was no publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta‐analysis showed that the severity of patients with COVID‐19 significance related to D‐dimer concentrations. Meanwhile, the severe COVID‐19 patients tend to have a higher concentration of D‐dimer when compared with non‐severe patients. REVIEW CRITERIA: We used MASH word and searched the online database and followed the inclusion and exclusion standard. The detailed information can be found in the text.

It is, therefore, crucial to understand its enzymatic activity, including activation and inhibition mechanisms. This enzyme may also be partially involved in the “cytokine storm” that is characteristic of COVID-19 disease (SARS-CoV-2), as well as in the molecular mechanisms responsible for lung fibrosis. Due to the variety of processing pathways involving MMP-9 in biological systems and its uniqueness due to the O-glycosylated domain (OGD) and fibronectin-like (FBN) domain, specific interactions with its natural TIMP-1 inhibitor should be carefully studied, because they differ significantly from other homologous systems. In particular, earlier experimental studies have indicated that the newly characterised circular form of a proMMP-9 homotrimer exhibits stronger binding properties to TIMP-1 compared to its monomeric form. However, molecular structures of the complexes and the binding mechanisms remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to fill in the gaps in knowledge. Molecular modelling methods are applied to build the inhibitory and non-inhibitory MMP-9–TIMP-1 complexes, which allows for a detailed description of these structures and should allow for a better understanding of the regulatory processes in which MMP-9 is involved.","Charzewski, Łukasz; Krzyśko, Krystiana A.; Lesyng, Bogdan",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183752/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92881-x,284

Compared to many countries, New Zealand has had relatively few COVID-19 cases, many of which were caused by infections acquired overseas. This makes it difficult to use standard methods to estimate Reff. In this work, we use a stochastic model to simulate COVID-19 spread in New Zealand and report the values of Reff from simulations that gave best fit to case data. We estimate that New Zealand had an effective reproduction number Reff = 1.8 for COVID-19 transmission prior to moving into Alert Level 4 on March 25 2020 and that after moving into Alert level 4 this was reduced to Reff = 0.35. Our estimate Reff = 1.8 for reproduction number before Alert Level 4, is relatively low compared to other countries. This could be due, in part, to measures put in place in early- to mid-March, including: the cancellation of mass gatherings, the isolation of international arrivals, and employees being encouraged to work from home.","Binny, Rachelle N; Lustig, Audrey; Brower, Ann; Hendy, Shaun C; James, Alex; Parry, Matthew; Plank, Michael J; Steyn, Nicholas",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.10.20172320v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.10.20172320,284

The online landscape and patterns of information consumption, however, have notably changed over the past decade necessitating an updated examination of health-related internet use (HRIU) among cancer survivors. METHODS: Using survey data from 2003, 2005, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) iterations, the objectives of this study were to report prevalence, trends, and user profiles in HRIU in terms of emailing doctors, buying medicine online, and support group participation. Descriptive analyses and weighted multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Cancer survivors who reported not using the internet were more likely to be older, belong to ethnic minorities, be less educated, and reside in rural areas as compared with those who reported using the internet. Except for participation in online support groups, all other types of HRIU increased in prevalence across the years. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the increased penetration of the internet and the altered online health communication landscape, we found increased prevalence of HRIU among cancer survivors. However, the digital divide persists in terms of internet access. These findings can inform initiatives to bridge the gap among survivors of varying profiles in using the internet for their health needs. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: There is increased reliance on online platforms to obtain and communicate health-related information.

Due to the general public’s reluctance to seek psychological help and the low psychiatrist-to-population ratio in Singapore, this study aims to examine the preliminary efficacy, perceptions, and acceptability of a trained volunteer-led community-based intervention on community-dwelling older adults. Twenty-one participants (control: n = 11; intervention: n = 10) completed the randomized pilot study. A mixed-methods approach (questionnaires, semistructured interviews, examining blood samples, intervention fidelity) was adopted. No significant differences were found between the intervention and the control groups in depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, friendship, and quality of life. However, there was a positive change in quality-of-life scores from baseline to 6 months in the intervention group. The control group had significantly higher cortisol levels and lower annexin-A1 levels at 6 months, while the intervention group did not. Three themes emerged from the interviews: (1) impact of the intervention on older adults’ well-being, (2) attitudes toward intervention, and (3) a way forward. However, intervention efficacy could not be established due to small sample size caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Future randomized controlled trials should evaluate volunteer-led, technology-based psychosocial interventions to support these older adults.","Shorey, Shefaly; Kua, Ee Heok; Tam, Wilson; Chan, Valerie; Goh, Yong Shian; Lim, Hong Meng; Lim, Lina Hsiu Kim; Tian, Cheong Sing; Mahendran, Rathi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574438/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189514,284

We investigated the association of ARB or ACEI use with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related outcomes in US Veterans with treated hypertension using an active comparator design, appropriate covariate adjustment, and negative control analyses. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this retrospective cohort study of Veterans with treated hypertension in the Veterans Health Administration (01/19/2020-08/28/2020), we compared users of (A) ARB/ACEI vs. non-ARB/ACEI (excluding Veterans with compelling indications to reduce confounding by indication) and (B) ARB vs. ACEI among (1) SARS-CoV-2+ outpatients and (2) COVID-19 hospitalized inpatients. The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization or mortality (outpatients) and all-cause mortality (inpatients). We estimated hazard ratios (HR) using propensity score-weighted Cox regression. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between exposure groups after weighting. Among outpatients, there were 5.0 and 6.0 primary outcomes per 100 person-months for ARB/ACEI (n = 2,482) vs. non-ARB/ACEI (n = 2,487) users (HR 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73–0.99, median follow-up 87 days). Among outpatients who were ARB (n = 4,877) vs. ACEI (n = 8,704) users, there were 13.2 and 14.8 primary outcomes per 100 person-months (HR 0.91, 95%CI 0.86–0.97, median follow-up 85 days). Among inpatients who were ARB/ACEI (n = 210) vs. non-ARB/ACEI (n = 275) users, there were 3.4 and 2.0 all-cause deaths per 100 person months (HR 1.25, 95%CI 0.30–5.13, median follow-up 30 days). Among inpatients, ARB (n = 1,164) and ACEI (n = 2,014) users had 21.0 vs. 17.7 all-cause deaths, per 100 person-months (HR 1.13, 95%CI 0.93–1.38, median follow-up 30 days). CONCLUSIONS: This observational analysis supports continued ARB or ACEI use for patients already using these medications before SARS-CoV-2 infection. The novel beneficial association observed among outpatients between users of ARBs vs. ACEIs on hospitalization or mortality should be confirmed with randomized trials.","Derington, Catherine G.; Cohen, Jordana B.; Mohanty, April F.; Greene, Tom H.; Cook, James; Ying, Jian; Wei, Guo; Herrick, Jennifer S.; Stevens, Vanessa W.; Jones, Barbara E.; Wang, Libo; Zheutlin, Alexander R.; South, Andrew M.; Hanff, Thomas C.; Smith, Steven M.; Cooper-DeHoff, Rhonda M.; King, Jordan B.; Alexander, G.

Methods: Assuming PCR to be the gold standard, we used a convenience sampling of mostly symptomatic COVID-19 suspect hospital patients who had already been tested for internal validation and guideline development purposes by both PCR and POCT to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of POCT with Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: During the study period, 113 paired patient samples met eligibility criteria. The sensitivity of POCT in this population was calculated to be 94.1% [CI 71.31-99.85%] and the specificity was 99.0% [CI 94.33-99.97%]. Conclusions: Based on the lower sensitivity of POCT and the estimated prevalence of COVID-19 in our symptomatic and asymptomatic hospital patients, we recommend a two-pronged testing approach in which COVID-19 suspect patients are tested by the more sensitive PCR, while asymptomatic patients with a low pre-test probability of infection are tested with POCT supplemented by PCR confirmation of positive results.

We tested whether (−)-strand subgenomic RNAs might initially be synthesized from the input single-stranded (+)-strand genomic RNA prior to the production of subgenomic mRNAs. We used a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNA, from which subgenomic RNA was produced in DI RNA-replicating cells, because this DI RNA had a functional MHV intergenic region inserted in its interior. MHV samples containing the DI particles were irradiated with UV-light and then superinfected into cells that had been infected with MHV 4 h prior to superinfection. Northern blot analysis of intracellular RNAs that were extracted 3 h after superinfection showed that genomic DI RNA and subgenomic DI RNA had similar UV-target sizes, indicating that (−)-strand genomic DI RNA synthesis from input genomic DI RNA probably occurred prior to the subgenomic-size DI RNA synthesis. We discuss why, in the course of coronavirus transcription, (−)-strand genomic-length coronavirus RNA synthesis might occur before subgenomic-sized RNAs of either polarity are made.","Maeda, Akihiko; An, Sungwhan; Makino, Shinji",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170298000902; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170298000902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9833884/,284

METHODS: . We searched articles in Medline, Embase, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. Random-effects meta-analyses on the proportions of individuals with symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and PD were generated and between-group differences for gender, healthcare workers (HCWs), and regions where studies were conducted. RESULTS: . A total of 2189 articles were screened, 136 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Fifty-five peer-reviewed studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis (N=189,159). The prevalence of depression (k=46) was 15.97% (95%CI, 13.24-19.13). The prevalence of anxiety (k=54) was 15.15% (95%CI, 12.29-18.54). The prevalence of insomnia (k=14) was 23.87% (95%CI, 15.74-34.48). The prevalence of PTSD (k=13) was 21.94% (95%CI, 9.37-43.31). Finally, the prevalence of psychological distress (k=19) was 13.29% (95%CI, 8.80-19.57).

HBV-infected blood and bloodstains were stored for up to 60 days at room temperature and subsequently screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA. In addition, HBV-positive postmortem blood was added to a cell line and the production of HBV virions was examined over a period of 7 days. HBsAg and HBV DNA were detected in all samples stored for 60 days at room temperature. HBV-positive postmortem blood successfully infected the cell line and progeny viruses were produced for up to 6 days.

However, we still have limited data on long-term effects and lingering symptoms of post COVID-19 recovery. Despite predilection of COVID-19 for lungs, multiple extra-pulmonary manifestations appear in multiple organs and biological systems and with continued infection and recovery worldwide. It is necessary that clinicians provide patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with expectations of long-term effects during or after recovery from COVID-19. Herein, we review the long-term impact of COVID-19 on different organ systems reported from different clinical studies. Understanding risk factors and signs and symptoms of long-term consequences after recovery from COVID-19 will allow for proper follow-up and management of the disease post recovery.","Zarei, Mohammad; Bose, Deepanwita; Nouri-Vaskeh, Masoud; Tajiknia, Vida; Zand, Ramin; Ghasemi, Mehdi",Reviews in medical virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34499784/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2289,284
641210,A re-organizing biosurveillance framework based on fog and mobile edge computing,2020-05-23,"Vitamin D plays an active role in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses as well as in the protection against respiratory pathogens. Evidence for this immunomodulatory and protective role is derived from observational studies showing an association between vitamin D deficiency, chronic airway diseases and respiratory infections, and is supported by a range of experimental studies using cell culture and animal models. Furthermore, recent intervention studies have now shown that vitamin D supplementation reduces exacerbation rates in vitamin D-deficient patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma and decreases the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections. The active vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D), is known to contribute to the integrity of the mucosal barrier, promote killing of pathogens (via the induction of antimicrobial peptides), and to modulate inflammation and immune responses. These mechanisms may partly explain its protective role against infections and exacerbations in COPD and asthma patients. The respiratory mucosa is an important site of local 1,25(OH)(2)D synthesis, degradation and signaling, a process that can be affected by exposure to inflammatory mediators. As a consequence, mucosal inflammation and other disease-associated factors, as observed in e.g., COPD and asthma, may modulate the protective actions of 1,25(OH)(2)D. Here, we discuss the potential consequences of various disease-associated processes such as inflammation and exposure to pathogens and inhaled toxicants on vitamin D metabolism and local responses to 1,25(OH)(2)D in both immune- and epithelial cells. We furthermore discuss potential consequences of disturbed local levels of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2)D for chronic lung diseases. Additional insight into the relationship between disease-associated mechanisms and local effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D is expected to contribute to the design of future strategies aimed at improving local levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D and signaling in chronic inflammatory lung diseases.","Schrumpf, Jasmijn A.; van der Does, Anne M.; Hiemstra, Pieter S.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32754156/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01433,284

There is a need to develop a comprehensive platform to explore the dynamics of age-related gene expression and immune profiles across tissues in genome-wide studies. Here, we collected RNA-Seq datasets from GTEx project, containing 16 704 samples from 30 major tissues in six age groups ranging from 20 to 79 years old. Dynamic gene expression along with aging were depicted and gene set enrichment analysis was performed among those age groups. Genes from 34 known immune function categories and immune cell compositions were investigated and compared among different age groups. Finally, we integrated all the results and developed a platform named ADEIP (http://gb.whu.edu.cn/ADEIP or http://geneyun.net/ADEIP), integrating the age-dependent gene expression and immune profiles across tissues. To demonstrate the usage of ADEIP, we applied two datasets: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and human mesenchymal stem cells-assoicated genes. We also included the expression and immune dynamics of these genes in the platform. Collectively, ADEIP is a powerful platform for studying age-related immune regulation in organogenesis and other infectious or genetic diseases.","Liu, Xuan; Chen, Wenbo; Fang, Yu; Yang, Siqi; Chang, Liuping; Chen, Xingyu; Ye, Haidong; Tang, Xinyu; Zhong, Shan; Zhang, Wen; Dong, Zhiqiang; Han, Leng; He, Chunjiang",Brief Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34254996/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab274,284
642794,AI-RADS: An Artificial Intelligence Curriculum for Residents,2020-10-16,"ABSTRACT New emerging and re-emerging threats, the weight of public opinion and new technology for surveillance and treatment are likely to impact on how, and if, effective surveillance can be performed in the future. If surveillance fails to address the needs of practitioners and policy-makers, it is likely that there will be loss of confidence. Current surveillance systems are reasonably effective at detecting significant events that are localised in time and space. It is more difficult to detect diffuse and progressive events with a slow increase over time or sporadic and widespread events without obvious links to time, place or person. Detection of these events relies on good data collection, comparative background data and sophisticated analytical tools. To improve surveillance systems, we need methods with the appropriate sensitivity and specificity for the outputs desired. Targeted surveillance should enable better ascertainment of those cases which must be considered and those which can be dismissed. New methods, such as mathematical modelling and geographical information systems, support conventional surveillance in moving events into the known and predictable category. It is important to integrate surveillance across local, regional and international levels and to base surveillance on local public health structures. The purpose and value of data aggregation at each level and the amount of detail needed at each level must be carefully evaluated. The key to all these improvements is developing the workforce. Surveillance needs individuals with a broad range of skills: clinical, epidemiological, anthropological, and mathematical; in particular, people who can think laterally. These individuals must be encouraged through effective training courses, good mentorship, networking and clear career structures.","Weinberg, J.",Clinical Microbiology and Infection,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15300173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15760438/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X15300173,284

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were collected at a single time-point from patients at an urban, public hospital August - November 2020 and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR, viral culture, and anti-Spike pan-Ig antibody testing. Participant demographics and symptoms were collected through interview. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to identify associations between RT-PCR and serology results with presence of viable virus and frequency of symptoms. RESULTS: Among 592 participants, 129 (21.8%) had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR or serology. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was strongly associated with lack of viable virus (p-value=0.016). COVID-19 symptom frequency was similar for patients testing RT-PCR positive/seronegative and patients testing RT-PCR positive/seropositive. Patients testing RT-PCR positive/seronegative reported headaches, fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting at rates not statistically significantly different from those testing RT-PCR negative/seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: While patients testing SARS-CoV-2 seropositive were unlikely to test positive for viable virus and were therefore low-risk for forward transmission, COVID-19 symptoms were common. Paired SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and antibody testing provides more nuanced understanding of patients' COVID-19 status.","Shragai, Talya; Smith-Jeffcoat, Sarah E; Koh, Mitsuki; Schechter, Marcos C; Rebolledo, Paulina A; Kasinathan, Vyjayanti; Wang, Yun; Hoffman, Adam; Miller, Halie; Tejada-Strop, Alexandra; Jain, Shilpi; Tamin, Azaibi; Harcourt, Jennifer L; Thornburg, Natalie J; Wong, Phili; Medrzycki, Magdalena; Folster, Jennifer M; Semenova, Vera; Steward-Clark, Evelene; Drobenuic, Jan; Biedron, Caitlin; Stewart, Rebekah J; da Silva, Juliana; Kirking, Hannah L; Tate, Jacqueline E",J. infect. dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34216468/,284

Although the pandemic is far from over, it has been effectively controlled in China. The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to study the influence of governmental prevention and control response on orthopedic trauma in minors. METHODS: We collected and reviewed data and information on minor’s orthopedic trauma from 1 January to 30 June of the past three year (2018, 2019 and 2020). The data were divided according to the time of prevention and control response level in 2020 (the first level response is from January 24 to March 22, the second level response is from March 23 to May 7, and the third level response is May 8 to now). By comparing the relevant data from orthopedic emergency and operating rooms from the past three years, the influence of governmental pandemic prevention measures on orthopedic trauma in minors was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 36,301 minors were included in the study cohort. Before the prevention and control response, the data of the orthopedic emergency department of National Children Medical Center (Shanghai) in 2020 was the same as the previous two years. The condition of children undergoing surgery at the time of injury is significantly different under different levels of prevention and control response. Under the first-level response, the number of fractures, open injuries, radial head subluxation, and surgery were significantly reduced, and the severity of patients with surgery was also significantly reduced. Under the second-level response, the number of operations began to increase, and the severity of the disease also began to rise. Under the third-level response control, the number of fractures, open injuries, and operations have returned to the levels of the previous two years. The severity of the operation has also returned to its previous level. The number of subluxations of the radial head is still different from before. CONCLUSION: The prevention and control response for the pandemic of COVID-19 can reduce the incidence of orthopedic trauma in minors by strengthening the guardian’s care and restricting children’s outdoor activities. With the control of the pandemic, the amount of orthopedic trauma in minors will not be affected by low-level prevention and control.","Qian, Chuang; Zheng, Yiming; Meng, Junrong; Li, Hao; Wang, Dahui",Arch Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-021-00672-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404475/,284

Operational challenges such as supply problems and personnel shortages have led to these bottlenecks and inhibited the scale-up of testing to needed levels. This paper uses operational simulations to facilitate rapid scale-up of testing capacity during this public health emergency. Specifically, discrete event simulation models were developed to represent the RT-PCR testing process in a large University of Maryland testing center, which retrofitted high-throughput molecular testing capacity to meet pandemic demands in a partnership with the State of Maryland. The simulation models support analyses that identify process steps which create bottlenecks, and evaluate “what-if” scenarios for process changes that could expand testing capacity. This enables virtual experimentation to understand the trade-offs associated with different interventions that increase testing capacity, allowing the identification of solutions that have high leverage at a feasible and acceptable cost. For example, using a virucidal collection medium which enables safe discarding of swabs at the point of collection removed a time-consuming “deswabbing” step (a primary bottleneck in this laboratory) and nearly doubled the testing capacity. The models are also used to estimate the impact of demand variability on laboratory performance and the minimum equipment and personnel required to meet various target capacities, assisting in scale-up for any laboratories following the same process steps. In sum, the results demonstrate that by using simulation modeling of the operations of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, preparedness planners are able to identify high-leverage process changes to increase testing capacity.","El Hage, Jad; Gravitt, Patti; Ravel, Jacques; Lahrichi, Nadia; Gralla, Erica",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34324577/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255214,284

As a result of buying the previous items, the household spending per month will be increase during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Aims: To calculate the average costs of each extra item involved in households spending during COVID-19 pandemic and to predict the total average extra costs spending by households. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at High Institute of Public Health (HIPH), University Alexandria. Exponential snowball sampling was used to recruit students at HIPH and their friends. Trimming costs was done to remove extreme low and high values. A regression tree modelling was implemented to predict the total extra costs spending during COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Most of the respondents were female (81%) and aged between 30 and 40 (56.3%). About 63.1% of families had the same monthly income while 35.4% had a decrease in monthly income. A significant reduction in days of leaving home before and after COVID-19 pandemic was observed (before; mean= 5.86, after; mean = 4.66, P=0.000).

All samples were selected and matched for age in these 2 groups. For the positive group, samples were selected for the detected viral species. RESULTS: Among the factors influencing the cellularity were the type of sample (p < 0.0001); patient age (p < 0.001); viral positive or negative nature of the sample (p = 0.002); and, for the positive samples, the number of viral targets detected (0.004 < p < 0.049) and viral species. CONCLUSION: The cellular load of upper respiratory samples is multifactorial and occurs for many in the sensitivity of molecular detection. However it was not possible to determine a minimum cellularity threshold allowing molecular viral detection.

However, there is limited evidence available to inform alcohol policies during such events. In this commentary, we present the range of government actions to control public access to alcohol during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in provinces and territories across Canada. Liquor retailers, including both private and government-run retailers, have been designated as essential services in all jurisdictions, operating under an evolving set of rules. From a public health perspective, keeping liquor retailers open during pandemic-related lockdown restrictions is a delicate decision which poses new risks and considerations about the best strategy for minimizing alcohol-related harms. We discuss the need to strike a balance between supplying public access to alcohol, particularly to those living with dependence, and unintentionally sending the message that alcohol is essential in our lives and encouraging consumption. Given the far-reaching effects of alcohol on health, social, psychological, economic, and work safety outcomes, we describe international guidance for minimizing alcohol-related harms and suggest that a nuanced and evidence-informed discussion about the considerations and impacts of alcohol control measures during a public health emergency should be undertaken.","Hobin, Erin; Smith, Brendan",Can J Public Health,https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00360-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32557350/,284

However, questions remain regarding clinical quality and safety. Video-mediated consultations are sometimes criticized for being not as good as face-to-face, but there has been little previous in-depth research on their interactional dynamics, and no agreement on what a good video consultation looks like. OBJECTIVE: Using conversation analysis, this study aimed to identify and analyze the communication strategies through which video-mediated consultations are accomplished and to produce recommendations for patients and clinicians to improve the communicative quality of such consultations. METHODS: We conducted an in-depth analysis of the clinician-patient interaction in a sample of video-mediated consultations and a comparison sample of face-to-face consultations drawn from 4 clinical settings across 2 trusts (1 community and 1 acute care) in the UK National Health Service. The video dataset consisted of 37 recordings of video-mediated consultations (with diabetes, antenatal diabetes, cancer, and heart failure patients), 28 matched audio recordings of face-to-face consultations, and fieldnotes from before and after each consultation. We also conducted 37 interviews with staff and 26 interviews with patients. Using linguistic ethnography (combining analysis of communication with an appreciation of the context in which it takes place), we examined in detail how video interaction was mediated by 2 software platforms (Skype and FaceTime). RESULTS: Patients had been selected by their clinician as appropriate for video-mediated consultation. Most consultations in our sample were technically and clinically unproblematic. However, we identified 3 interactional challenges: (1) opening the video consultation, (2) dealing with disruption to conversational flow (eg, technical issues with audio and/or video), and (3) conducting an examination. Operational and technological issues were the exception rather than the norm. In all but 1 case, both clinicians and patients (deliberately or intuitively) used established communication strategies to successfully negotiate these challenges. Remote physical examinations required the patient (and, in some cases, a relative) to simultaneously follow instructions and manipulate technology (eg, camera) to make it possible for the clinician to see and hear adequately. CONCLUSIONS: A remote video link alters how patients and clinicians interact and may adversely affect the flow of conversation. However, our data suggest that when such problems occur, clinicians and patients can work collaboratively to find ways to overcome them. There is potential for a limited physical examination to be undertaken remotely with some patients and in some conditions, but this appears to need complex interactional work by the patient and/or their relatives. We offer preliminary guidance for patients and clinicians on what is and is not feasible when consulting via a video link.

This means that, also during this pandemic, fetal anomalies will be detected, and that discussions regarding invasive genetic testing and possibly fetal therapy will need to take place. For patients, concerns about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome‐Corona Virus 2 will add to the anxiety caused by the diagnosis of a serious fetal anomaly. Yet, also for fetal medicine teams the situation gets more complex as they must weigh up the risks and benefits to the fetus as well as the mother, while managing a changing evidence base and logistic challenges in their healthcare system.","Deprest, Jan; Van Ranst, Marc; Lannoo, Lore; Bredaki, Emma; Ryan, Greg; David, Anna; Richter, Jute; Van Mieghem, Tim",Prenat Diagn,https://doi.org/10.1002/pd.5702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32277490/,284

Viruses, as a member of microbial contaminants, seriously threaten human health due to their high environmental resistance, having small sizes, and causing an extensive range of diseases. Therefore, selecting an appropriate technology to remove viral contaminants from the air, water, and foods is of prominent significance. Traditional methods for viral disinfection have not proven to be highly practical and effective because they need high energy resources and operational expenses. In recent years, semiconductor-based photocatalysis has attracted more attention in the field of microorganism inactivation due to its outstanding performance and mild reaction conditions. Therefore, this review primarily concentrates on the recent development in viral inactivation/disinfection by heterogeneous photocatalysts. Moreover, the photocatalytic viral inactivation of waterborne, airborne, and foodborne viruses is discussed. Given the appealing merits of heterogeneous photocatalytic disinfection of viruses, there is no doubt that this technology will be an impressively active research field and a source of comfort and confidence to humans in battling against viruses.","Habibi-Yangjeh, Aziz; Asadzadeh-Khaneghah, Soheila; Feizpoor, Solmaz; Rouhi, Afsar",J Colloid Interface Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979720309255?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021979720309255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32711201/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.07.047,284

Air travel provides the means for such diseases to spread internationally at extraordinary rates because infected passengers jump from coast to coast and continent to continent within hours. Outbreaks of diseases that spread from person to person test the effectiveness of current public health responses. This research used a mixed methods approach, including use of the Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeler, to model the spread of diseases, evaluate the impact of air travel on disease spread, and analyze the effectiveness of different public health strategies and travel policies. Modeling showed that the spread of Ebola and pneumonic plague is minimal and should not be a major air travel concern if an individual becomes infected. H1N1 and SARS have higher infection rates and air travel will facilitate the spread of disease nationally and internationally. To contain the spread of infectious diseases, aviation and public health authorities should establish tailored preventive measures at airports, capture contact information for ticketed passengers, expand the definition of “close contact,” and conduct widespread educational programs. The measures will put in place a foundation for containing the spread of infectious diseases via air travel and minimize the panic and economic consequences that may occur during an outbreak.","Sevilla, Nereyda L.",Transp Res Rec,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285452/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0361198118799709,284

Therefore, pregnancy in women with vasculitis has become a more frequent consideration or event. Literature on pregnancy outcomes in this population has grown and allowed us, in this article, to review the effects of pregnancy on disease activity, as well as maternal and fetal outcomes for each type of vasculitides. RECENT FINDINGS: Successful pregnancies in patients with vasculitides are possible, especially when conception is planned, and the disease is in remission. The risk of vasculitis flare is highly dependent on the type of vasculitis, but overall limited. The most frequent complication associated with large-vessel vasculitis (mainly Takayasu arteritis) is hypertension and preeclampsia. Preterm deliveries and intrauterine growth restriction occur more frequently with small- and medium-vessel vasculitis. SUMMARY: Pregnancies in patients with vasculitis should be considered high risk and followed by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in the field. Flares should be managed as in the non-pregnant population, while avoiding medications with unknown safety in pregnancy or known teratogens. Although commonly prescribed for the prevention of preeclampsia, there is limited evidence supporting the use of low-dose aspirin for pregnant women with vasculitis. Prospective registries or studies are needed, to better assess the value of aspirin, the place and long-term impact of new biologics and, to identify predictors of pregnancy outcomes other than disease status at conception.","Ross, Carolyn; D’Souza, Rohan; Pagnoux, Christian",Curr Rheumatol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32845412/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11926-020-00940-5,284
667010,Analysis of epidemic spreading process in multi-communities,2018-03-20,"Social distancing measures implemented by governments worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic have proven an effective intervention to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. There is a growing literature on predictors of adherence behaviours to social distancing measures, however, there are no comprehensive insights into the nature and types of non-adherence behaviours. To address this gap in the literature, we studied non-adherence in terms of counts of infringements and people's accounts on their behaviours in a representative sample of North London residents. We focused on the following social distancing rules: keeping 2 mts. distancing, meeting family and friends, and going out for non-essential reasons. A mixed-methods explanatory sequential design was used comprising an online survey (1st - 31st May 2020) followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews held with a purposive sample of survey respondents (5th August - 21st September 2020). A negative binomial regression model (quantitative) and Framework Analysis (qualitative) were undertaken. 681 individuals completed the survey, and 30 individuals were interviewed. We integrated survey and interview findings following three levels of the Social Ecological model: individual, interpersonal and community levels. We identified non-adherence behaviours as unintentional (barriers beyond individual's control) and intentional (deliberate decision). Unintentional adherence was associated with and reported as emotional inability to stay at home, lack of controllability in keeping 2 mts. distancing, social responsibility towards the community and feeling low risk. Intentional non-adherence included individual risk assessment and decision-making on the extent to following the rules, support from friends, and perceived lack of adherence in the local area. Our findings indicate that unintentional and intentional non-adherence should be improved by Government partnerships with local communities to build trust in social distancing measures; tailored messaging to young adults emphasising the need of protecting others whilst clarifying the risk of transmission; and ensuring COVID-secured environments by working with environmental health officers.","Eraso, Y.; Hills, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256444; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.04.21256444v1?rss=1,284

Notable departures in health outcomes starting around puberty suggest that burdens associated with influenza and other causes are reduced relative to the two emergent coronaviruses over much of adult life. Two possible hypotheses could explain this: protective adaptive immunity for influenza and other infections, or greater sensitivity to immunosenescence in the coronaviruses. Comparison of sex differences suggest an important role for adaptive immunity; but immunosenescence might also be relevant, if males experience faster immunosenescence. Involvement of the renin-angiotensin-system in SARS-CoV-2 infection might drive high sensitivity to disruptions of homeostasis. Overall, these results highlight the long tail of vulnerability in the age profile relevant to the emergent coronaviruses, which more transmissible variants have the potential to uncover at the younger end of the scale, and aging populations will expose at the other end of the scale.","Metcalf, C.

In Brazil, 110 thousand cases and 5,901 deaths were confirmed by the end of April 2020. The scarcity of laboratory resources, the overload on the service network, and the broad clinical spectrum of the disease make it difficult to document all the deaths due to COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the mortality rate in Brazilian capitals with a high incidence of COVID-19. METHODS: We assessed the weekly mortality between epidemiological week 1 and 16 in 2020 and the corresponding period in 2019. We estimated the expected mortality at 95% confidence interval by projecting the mortality in 2019 to the population in 2020, using data from the National Association of Civil Registrars (ARPEN-Brasil). RESULTS: In the five capitals with the highest incidence of COVID-19, we identified excess deaths during the pandemic. The age group above 60 years was severely affected, while 31% of the excess deaths occurred in the age group of 20-59 years. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.94) between excess deaths and the number of deaths confirmed by epidemiological monitoring. The epidemiological surveillance captured only 52% of all mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the cities examined. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the simplicity of the method and its low cost, we believe that the assessment of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic should be used as a complementary tool for regular epidemiological surveillance.","Freitas, André Ricardo Ribas; de Medeiros, Nicole Montenegro; Frutuoso, Livia Carla Vinhal; Beckedorff, Otto Albuquerque; de Martin, Lucas Mariscal Alves; Coelho, Marcela Montenegro de Medeiros; de Freitas, Giovanna Gimenez Souza; Lemos, Daniele Rocha Queiróz; Cavalcanti, Luciano Pamplona de Góes",Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,https://doi.org/10.1590/0037-8682-0558-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33174964/,284

Data were from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (n = 14,376). Inverse-probability weighting was used to estimate confounder-adjusted population-average effects of centre and non-centre-based childcare (compared to parental care only) between ages 26–31 months on (age 3): internalising and externalising symptoms, pro-social behaviour, independence, emotional dysregulation, vocabulary, school readiness, and body mass index. To assess impacts on inequalities, controlled direct effects of low parental education and lone parenthood on all outcomes were estimated under two hypothetical scenarios: 1) universal take-up of centre-based childcare; and 2) parental care only. On average, non-centre based childcare improved vocabulary and centre-based care improved school readiness, with little evidence of other benefits. However, socio-economic inequalities were observed for all outcomes and were attenuated in scenario 1 (universal take-up). For example, inequalities in externalising symptoms (according to low parental education) were reduced from a confounder-adjusted standard deviation difference of 7.8 (95% confidence intervals: 6.7–8.8), to 1.7 (0.6–2.7). Inequalities by parental education in scenario 2 (parental care only) were wider than in scenario 1 for externalising symptoms (at 3.4; 2.4–4.4), and for emotional dysregulation and school readiness. Inequalities by lone parenthood, which were smaller, fell in scenario 1, and fell further in scenario 2. Universal access to centre-based pre-school care may alleviate inequalities, while restricted access (e.g. during lockdown for a pandemic such as Covid-19) may widen some inequalities in socioemotional and cognitive development.","Green, Michael J.; Pearce, Anna; Parkes, Alison; Robertson, Elaine; Katikireddi, S.Vittal",SSM Popul Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33768138/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100776,284

The knowledge gained has been used to develop new vaccines with specific, reactive antigens which elicit protective immune mediated responses (humoral and/or cell mediated) in the host. These vaccines should not burden the immune system by initiating responses against non-essential antigens. However, the efficacy of these vaccines is only as good as the delivery technology or route used to present them to the immune system. Some vaccines, traditionally given by the parenteral route, are now given by the natural route; either orally or intranasally. Two major advantages, often interrelated, are the rapid onset of immunity and stimulation of the local, mucosal immunity. These new technologies are now making an impact on current vaccine development. The balance has to be found between what is technologically feasible and what will provide at least as good a protective immunity as current, conventional vaccines. As new and emerging diseases appear globally, new opportunities arise for molecular and conventional technologies to be applied to both the development and delivery of novel vaccines, as well as the improvement of vaccines in current use.","Chalmers, W.S.K.",Vet Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113506001404; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113506001404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16723197/,284

In this paper, we report the significant benefits of add on Ayurvedic intervention as observed in an oxygen dependent COVID-19 patient in the post hospitalization period. Main symptoms and important clinical findings: A 75-year-old gentleman approached his Ayurvedic general practitioner with complaints of low oxygen saturation and oxygen dependency five days after being discharged from hospital, where he was treated for COVID-19 related bilateral pneumonitis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome as well as Acute Renal Failure. Patient reported breathing difficulty, generalized weakness, reduced appetite and severe constipation. Pulse Oximetry readings were fluctuating between 80 and 85% even with home oxygen support. Blood pressure was found to be 150/100 mm Hg, LDH slightly raised at 463 IU/L and HbA1c at 8.7 % indicated poor control of diabetes. The patient was administered micro-doses of a combination of Ayurvedic formulations sublingually every ten minutes for one day.

Some cardiac defects may be associated with a poor COVID-19 outcome. Risk estimation in ACHD is currently based on expert opinion. The aim of this study was to collect clinical outcome data and to identify risk factors for a complicated course of COVID-19 in patients with ACHD. METHODS: Twenty-five ACHD centres in nine European countries participated in the study. Consecutive patients with ACHD diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting to one of the participating centres between 27 March and 6 June 2020 were included. A complicated disease course was defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 requiring non-invasive or invasive ventilation and/or inotropic support, or a fatal outcome. RESULTS: Of 105 patients with a mean age of 38±13 years (58% women), 13 had a complicated disease course, of whom 5 died. In univariable analysis, age (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, per 5 years), ≥2 comorbidities (OR 7.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 24.5), body mass index of >25 kg/m(2) (OR 7.2, 95% CI 1.9 to 28.3) and cyanotic heart disease (OR 13.2, 95% CI 2.5 to 68.4) were associated with a complicated disease course. In a multivariable logistic regression model, cyanotic heart disease was the most important predictor (OR 60.0, 95% CI 7.6 to 474.0). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ACHD, general risk factors (age, obesity and multiple comorbidities) are associated with an increased risk of complicated COVID-19 course.

However, this effect is moderated by formal bank regulation (e.g., deposit insurance), ownership structure (e.g., foreign and government ownership), and informal institutions (e.g., culture and trust).","Duan, Yuejiao; Ghoul, Sadok El; Guedhami, Omrane; Li, Haoran; Li, Xinming",J Bank Financ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2021.106299; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037842662100251X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548746/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037842662100251X,284

673338,"Mathematical modeling, analysis and numerical simulation of the COVID-19 transmission with mitigation of control strategies used in Cameroon",2020-09-18,"The present review describes COVID-19 severity in diabetes and diabetic kidney disease. We discuss the crucial effect of COVID-19-associated cytokine storm and linked injuries and associated severe mesenchymal activation in tubular epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages that influence neighboring cell homeostasis, resulting in severe proteinuria and organ fibrosis in diabetes. Altered microRNA expression disrupts cellular homeostasis and the renin-angiotensin-system, targets reno-protective signaling proteins, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and MAS1 receptor (MAS), and facilitates viral entry and replication in kidney cells. COVID-19-associated endotheliopathy that interacts with other cell types, such as neutrophils, platelets, and macrophages, is one factor that accelerates prethrombotic reactions and thrombus formation, resulting in organ failures in diabetes. Apart from targeting vital signaling through ACE2 and MAS, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are also associated with higher profibrotic dipeptidyl transferase-4 (DPP-4)-mediated mechanisms and suppression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in kidney cells. Lowered DPP-4 levels and restoration of AMPK levels are organ-protective, suggesting a pathogenic role of DPP-4 and a protective role of AMPK in diabetic COVID-19 patients. In addition to standard care provided to COVID-19 patients, we urgently need novel drug therapies that support the stability and function of both organs and cell types in diabetes.","Srivastava, Swayam Prakash; Srivastava, Rohit; Chand, Subhash; Goodwin, Julie E.",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14080751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451848/,284

There has been little scrutiny of alcohol use behaviors resulting in hospital visits, which is essential to guide pandemic public policy. We aimed to determine whether COVID‐19 peak restrictions were associated with increased hospital visits for alcohol use or withdrawal. Secondary objectives were to describe differences based on age, sex and race, and to examine alcohol‐related complication incidence. DESIGN: Multi‐center, retrospective, pre–post study. SETTING: New York City health system with five participating hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Adult emergency department encounters for alcohol use, alcoholic gastritis or pancreatitis or hepatitis, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, withdrawal seizure or delirium tremens. MEASUREMENTS: Age, sex, race, site and encounter diagnosis. Encounters were compared between 2019 and 2020 for 1 March to 31 May. FINDINGS: There were 2790 alcohol‐related visits during the 2019 study period and 1793 in 2020, with a decrease in total hospital visits. Of 4583 alcohol‐related visits, median age was 47 years, with 22.3% females. In 2020 there was an increase in percentage of visits for alcohol withdrawal [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07–1.67] and withdrawal with complications (aOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.14–1.72), and a decline in percentage of hospital visits for alcohol use (aOR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.59–0.85) and use with complications (aOR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.58–0.88). It is unknown whether use visit changes mirror declines in other chief complaints. The age groups 18–29 and 60–69 years were associated with increased visits for use and decreased visits for withdrawal, as were non‐white race groups. Sex was not associated with alcohol‐related visit changes despite male predominance. CONCLUSIONS: In New York City during the initial COVID‐19 peak (1 March to 31 May 2020), hospital visits for alcohol withdrawal increased while those for alcohol use decreased.","Schimmel, Jonathan; Vargas‐Torres, Carmen; Genes, Nicholas; Probst, Marc A.; Manini, Alex F.",Addiction,https://doi.org/10.1111/add.15589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34060168/,284

Such analysis of tourism is important because diplomacy and trade continues to be conducted on a nation-to-nation basis despite a growing shift towards multilateralism in free trade blocks such as the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Further, Bilateralism is important because countries have reduced abilities to control tourism imports in an era of growing globalization.

675080,Automated Detection of Covid-19 from Chest X-ray scans using an optimized CNN architecture,2021-02-24,"Rationale: Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is an immune regulator and an important driver of fibrosis in chronic lung injury, however, its role in acute lung injury (ALI) remains unknown. Previous work has shown that global deletion of galectin-3 reduces collagen deposition in a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model (MacKinnon et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 2012, 185, 537–46). An inhaled Gal-3 inhibitor, GB0139, is undergoing Phase II clinical development for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This work aims to elucidate the role of Gal-3 in the myeloid and mesenchymal compartment on the development of acute and chronic lung injury. Methods:LgalS3(fl/fl) mice were generated and crossed with mice expressing the myeloid (LysM) and mesenchymal (Pdgfrb) cre drivers to yield LysM-cre (+/-) /LgalS3 (fl/fl) and Pdgfrb-cre (+/-) /LgalS3 (fl/fl) mice. The response to acute (bleomycin or LPS) or chronic (bleomycin) lung injury was compared to globally deficient Gal-3 (−/−) mice. Results: Myeloid depletion of Gal-3 led to a significant reduction in Gal-3 expression in alveolar macrophages and neutrophils and a reduction in neutrophil recruitment into the interstitium but not into the alveolar space. The reduction in interstitial neutrophils corelated with decreased levels of pulmonary inflammation following acute bleomycin and LPS administration. In addition, myeloid deletion decreased Gal-3 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and reduced lung fibrosis induced by chronic bleomycin. In contrast, no differences in BAL Gal-3 levels or fibrosis were observed in Pdgfrb-cre (+/-) /LgalS3 (fl/fl) mice. Conclusions: Myeloid cell derived Galectin-3 drives acute and chronic lung inflammation and supports direct targeting of galectin-3 as an attractive new therapy for lung inflammation.","Humphries, Duncan C.; Mills, Ross; Dobie, Ross; Henderson, Neil C.; Sethi, Tariq; Mackinnon, Alison C.",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34526900/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.715986,284

The ventilator system consists of a blower-hose-patient system and patient's lung model with nonlinear lung compliance. The AFSMC is based on two components: singleton control action and a discontinuous term. The singleton control action is based on fuzzy logic with adjustable tuning parameters to approximate the perfect feedback linearization control. The switching control law based on the sliding mode principle aims to minimize the estimation error between approximated single fuzzy control action and perfect feedback linearization control. The proposed control strategy manipulated the airway flow delivered by the ventilator such that the peak pressure will remain under critical values in presence of unknown patient-hose-leak parameters and patient breathing effort. The closed-loop stability of AFSMC will be proven in the sense of Lyapunov. For comparative analysis, classical PID and sliding mode controllers are also designed and implemented for mechanical ventilation problems. For performance analysis, numerical simulations were performed on a mechanical ventilator simulator. Simulation results reveal that the proposed controller demonstrates better tracking of targeted airway pressure compared with its counterparts in terms of faster convergence, less overshoot, and small tracking error. Hence, the proposed controller provides useful insight for its application to real-world scenarios.","Mehedi, Ibrahim M.; Shah, Heidir S.

We previously observed that membrane potential depolarization enhances the release of HIV-1 viruses. Because membrane polarization affects the biomembrane directly, here we examined the effects of KCNK3/9/15 on the budding of nonviral vesicles. We found that depolarization by knocking down endogenous KCNK3/9/15 promoted secretion of cell-derived vesicles. We further used Vpu (an antagonist of KCNK3) as a model for the in vivo study of depolarization-stimulated secretion. Vpu is a HIV-1-encoded, ion channel-like protein (viroporin) capable of enhancing virus release and depolarizing the cell membrane potential. We found that Vpu could also promote nonviral vesicle release, perhaps through a similar mechanism that Vpu utilizes to promote viral particle release. Notably, T cells expressing Vpu alone became pathologically low in intracellular K(+) and insensitive to extracellular K(+) or membrane potential stimulation. In contrast, heterologous expression of KCNK3 in T cells stabilized the cell potentials by maintaining intracellular K(+). We thus concluded that KCNK3/9/15 expression limits membrane depolarization and depolarization-induced secretion at least in part by maintaining intracellular K(+).","Huang, Daniel Tsung-Ning; Chi, Naiwen; Chen, Shiou-Ching; Lee, Ting-Ying; Hsu, Kate",Cell Biochem Biophys,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21761257/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12013-011-9241-1,284

The focus of the Q-methodology is to discover research participants’ subjective viewpoints. In May 2021, 50 Korean nursing students from first year to fourth year were selected to participate in the study, and data were collected by asking them to classify 37 selected Q-statements in a normal distribution on a 9-point scale. In the final analysis, a P-sample of 38 nursing students was used. The emotional responses of the Korean nursing students were categorized into four types: self-protection (Type 1), pessimism about the current situation (Type 2), realistic optimism (Type 3), and developmental-seeking (Type 4). The four factors accounted for 39% of the total variance. The individual explanatory powers of the four factors were 8%, 12%, 13%, and 6%, respectively.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables unbiased detection of all potential pathogens. To apply mNGS in viral diagnostics, sensitive and simultaneous detection of RNA and DNA viruses is needed. Herein, were studied the performance of an in-house mNGS protocol for routine diagnostics of viral respiratory infections with potential for automated pan-pathogen detection. The sequencing protocol and bioinformatics analysis were designed and optimized, including exogenous internal controls. Subsequently, the protocol was retrospectively validated using 25 clinical respiratory samples. The developed protocol using Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing showed high repeatability. Use of the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s RefSeq database as opposed to the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s nucleotide database led to enhanced specificity of classification of viral pathogens. A correlation was established between read counts and PCR cycle threshold value. Sensitivity of mNGS, compared with PCR, varied up to 83%, with specificity of 94%, dependent on the cutoff for defining positive mNGS results. Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS, not present in the routine diagnostic workflow, were influenza C, KI polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and enterovirus. Sensitivity and analytical specificity of this mNGS protocol were comparable to PCR and higher when considering off-PCR target viral pathogens.

The epidemiology of emotional disorders is greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence rate and socio-demographic correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese students aged 12–18 years during the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to conduct rapid assessment. A total of 8079 participants were involved in the study. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, assess students’ awareness of COVID-19, and assess depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, respectively. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 43.7%, 37.4%, and 31.3%, respectively, among Chinese high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our findings show there is a high prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescents, which are negatively associated with the level of awareness of COVID-19.

Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis have been particularly affected by this pandemic due to their need to travel multiple times a week to receive treatment. Although patients on home dialysis are able to avoid such exposure, they face their own unique challenges. In this review, we will discuss the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic for patients on home dialysis, the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of their care, and the resultant rapid adaptations in policy/health care delivery mechanisms with implications for the future care of home dialysis patients.","Yerram, Preethi; Misra, Madhukar",Adv Chronic Kidney Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1548559520301117; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1548559520301117?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ackd.2020.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308511/,284

However, studies often rely on data stored in a centralized repository, where analysis is done with full access to the sensitive underlying content. Recent advances in federated learning enable building complex machine-learned models that are trained in a distributed fashion. These techniques facilitate the calculation of research study endpoints such that private data never leaves a given device or healthcare system. We show—on a diverse set of single and multi-site health studies—that federated models can achieve similar accuracy, precision, and generalizability, and lead to the same interpretation as standard centralized statistical models while achieving considerably stronger privacy protections and without significantly raising computational costs. This work is the first to apply modern and general federated learning methods that explicitly incorporate differential privacy to clinical and epidemiological research—across a spectrum of units of federation, model architectures, complexity of learning tasks and diseases. As a result, it enables health research participants to remain in control of their data and still contribute to advancing science—aspects that used to be at odds with each other.","Sadilek, Adam; Liu, Luyang; Nguyen, Dung; Kamruzzaman, Methun; Serghiou, Stylianos; Rader, Benjamin; Ingerman, Alex; Mellem, Stefan; Kairouz, Peter; Nsoesie, Elaine O.; MacFarlane, Jamie; Vullikanti, Anil; Marathe, Madhav; Eastham, Paul; Brownstein, John S.; Arcas, Blaise Aguera y.; Howell, Michael D.; Hernandez, John",NPJ Digit Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34493770/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-021-00489-2,284
690515,Combined Digital Economic-Epidemic Model for the Evaluation of Economic Results of Several Scenarios of Quarantine Measures,2021-02-03,"Neither war nor recession or any kind of prior disaster has been considered a prelude to the looming threat of climate change over the past era as coronavirus (hereafter COVID-19) has in only a few months. Although numerous studies have already been published on this topic, there has not been compelling evidence critically assessing the impact of COVID-19 by and on climate change. The present study fills this gap by taking a more holistic approach to elaborate factors, e.g., natural and anthropogenic factors, ocean submesoscales, radiative forces, and greenhouse gas/CO(2) emissions, that may affect climate change in a more prevalent and pronounced manner. Based on the statistical data collected from the NASA Earth Observatory, the European Space Agency, and the Global Carbon Project, the findings of this study reveal that the climate/environment has improved during COVID-19, including better environmental quality and water quality with low carbon emissions and sound pollution. In the lockdown during the epidemic, the emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) significantly decreased because of the lower usage of transportation, decreased electricity demand, and halted industrial activities. The policy implications of this study suggested that keeping the climate healthy even in the post-COVID-19 era is a serious concern that needs to be addressed by investing in clean and green projects, ensuring green energy evolution, dealing with a large volume of medical waste, building health-ensuring and livable societies, and halting the funding of pollution. For governmental and regulatory bodies, these factors will provide a strong foundation to build safer, healthier, and environmentally friendly societies for generations to come.","Usman, Muhammad; Husnain, Mudassir; Riaz, Aimon; Riaz, Areej; Ali, Yameen",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14088-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934308/,284
