1994,1994,1994,Lung ultrasonography for the diagnosis of 11 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to bird flu H7N9 infection,16.214169,13.14236,2015-10-26,"BACKGROUND: A novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus was found to infect three Chinese residents, the first H7N9 infection in humans in Asia. Chest computed tomography (CT) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis is not only expensive but also exposes patients to radiation and might cause patients to be at risk of infection during transportation; in addition, chest radiography cannot be used to monitor the lung repeatedly in real time. Therefore, the routine use of bedside lung ultrasonography for critically ill patients with ARDS is especially valuable. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of ultrasound for lung examination in patients with ARDS. METHODS: Eleven patients infected with H7N9 avian influenza who developed ARDS were diagnosed by lung ultrasonography. RESULTS: Six patients who had severe ARDS showed a diffuse comet tail sign or a consolidation score ≥ 7 and a lung ultrasound score ≥ 20 points. A diffuse comet tail sign or a consolidation score ≤ 6 and a lung ultrasound score < 25 were observed in four patients. One patient showed a diffuse comet tail sign or consolidation area in four lung areas, with an ultrasound score of 14. Among all 11 patients studied, 6 patients had thoracic puncture and drainage of pleural effusion and 2 patients had pneumothorax puncture drainage. CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasound could be useful for monitoring ARDS caused by the influenza virus A H7N9 strain in clinical applications.","Zhang, Yu-kun; Li, Jian; Yang, Jian-ping; Zhan, Ying; Chen, Jun",Virol J,332,9
2074,2074,2074,Acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute myocarditis developed in a previously healthy adult with influenza B,16.322065,13.031716,2016-01-04,"BACKGROUND: Influenza B virus infection is generally considered to be mild and is rarely associated pulmonary cardiovascular involvement in adults. However fatal complications may occur. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old previously healthy Taiwanese male came to our emergency department due to high fever, chills, general malaise and myalgia for about 4 days. An influenza rapid test from a throat swab was negative. Chest radiography showed mild left lung infiltration and levofloxacin was prescribed. However, progressive shortness of breath and respiratory failure developed 48 h later after hospitalization. Emergent intubation was performed and he was transferred to the intensive care unit where oseltamivir (Tamiflu, Roche) 75 mg orally twice daily was given immediately. In the intensive care unit, cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries. However, a markedly elevated cardiac enzyme level (Troponin I level was up to 71.01 ng/ml), a positive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings and no coronary artery stenosis led to the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Subsequent real-time polymerase chain reaction of endotracheal aspirates was positive for influenza B. His condition gradually improved and he was successfully weaned from the ventilator on day 22. He was discharged without prominent complications on day 35. CONCLUSION: Influenza B infection is not always a mild disease. Early detection, early administration of antiviral agents, appropriate antibiotics and best supportive care, is still the gold standard for patients such as the one reported.","Chang, Hsu-Liang; Hsu, Jui-Feng; Tsai, Ying-Ming; Lin, Shang-Yi; Kuo, Hsuan-Fu; Yang, Chih-Jen",BMC Pulm Med,332,9
2785,2785,2785,"Surfactants in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Infants and Children: Past, Present and Future",16.10083,13.113002,2017-05-16,"There is a lack of definitive data on the effective management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in infants and children. The development and validation of the Berlin definition (BD) for ARDS and the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) recommendations in children represented a major advance in optimizing research and treatment, mainly due to the introduction of a severe ARDS category. Proposed reasons for the lack of consistent results with surfactants in children and infants compared with neonates include different causes, type of lung damage (direct or indirect), timing and mode of administration as well as the type of surfactant used. Secretory phospholipase A2 plays an important role in inflammation and possible dysfunction of surfactants in ARDS. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with normal saline and surfactant allows the removal of inhaled material, the recruitment of non-ventilating areas and the maintenance of the surfactant pool size. BAL with diluted surfactant allows rapid absorption of the surfactant at the air/liquid interface, which blocks the progression of pathological lung disease and in turn disrupts the inflammatory cycle. Importantly, it is now recognized that the type of surfactant, the time of administration and the method of administration could all play an important role in the management of ARDS, and there is evidence that surfactant is effective and well tolerated in children and infants with ARDS.","Amigoni, Angela; Pettenazzo, Andrea; Stritoni, Valentina; Circelli, Maria",Clin Drug Investig,332,9
3248,3248,3248,Implementation of preemptive fluid strategy as a bundle to prevent fluid overload in children with acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis,16.356272,13.189889,2018-06-26,"BACKGROUND: Fluid overload (FO) is associated with unfavorable outcomes in critically ill children. Clinicians are encouraged to avoid FO; however, strategies to avoid FO are not well-described in pediatrics. Our aim was to implement a bundle strategy to prevent FO in children with sepsis and pARDS and to compare the outcomes with a historical cohort. METHODS: A quality improvement initiative, known as preemptive fluid strategy (PFS) was implemented to prevent early FO, in a 12-bed general PICU. Infants on mechanical ventilation (MV) fulfilling pARDS and sepsis criteria were prospectively recruited. For comparison, data from a historical cohort from 2015, with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, was retrospectively reviewed. The PFS bundle consisted of 1. maintenance of intravenous fluids (MIVF) at 50% of requirements; 2. drug volume reduction; 3. dynamic monitoring of preload markers to determine the need for fluid bolus administration; 4. early use of diuretics; and 5. early initiation of enteral feeds. The historical cohort treatment, the standard fluid strategy (SFS), were based on physician preferences. Peak fluid overload (PFO) was the primary outcome. PFO was defined as the highest FO during the first 72 h. FO was calculated as (cumulative fluid input – cumulative output)/kg*100. Fluid input/output were registered every 12 h for 72 h. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in the PFS group (54% male, 6 mo (IQR 2,11)) and 39 with SFS (64%male, 3 mo (IQR1,7)). PFO was lower in PFS (6.31% [IQR4.4–10]) compared to SFS (12% [IQR8.4–15.8]). FO was lower in PFS compared to CFS as early as 12 h after admission [2.4(1.4,3.7) v/s 4.3(1.5,5.5), p < 0.01] and maintained during the study. These differences were due to less fluid input (MIVF and fluid boluses). There were no differences in the renal function test. PRBC requirements were lower during the first 24 h in the PFS (5%) compared to SFS (28%, p < 0.05). MV duration was 81 h (58,98) in PFS and 118 h (85154) in SFS(p < 0.05). PICU LOS in PFS was 5 (4, 7) and in SFS was 8 (6, 10) days. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a bundle to prevent FO in children on MV with pARDS and sepsis resulted in less PFO. We observed a decrease in MV duration and PICU LOS. Future studies are needed to address if PFS might have a positive impact on health outcomes.

7139,7139,7139,Higher incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in cardiac surgical patients with elevated serum procalcitonin concentration: a prospective cohort study,16.135654,13.03967,2020-03-30,"BACKGROUND: During the erythrocytic cycle, Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites express P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1) that anchor the infected erythrocytes (IE) to the vascular lining of the host. The CIDRα1 domain of PfEMP1 is responsible for binding host endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and increasing evidence support that this interaction triggers severe malaria, accounting for the majority of malaria-related deaths. In high transmission regions, children develop immunity to severe malaria after the first few infections. This immunity is believed to be mediated by antibodies targeting and inhibiting PfEMP1, causing infected erythrocytes to circulate and be cleared in the spleen. The development of immunity to malaria coincides with acquisition of broad antibody reactivity across the CIDRα1 protein family. Altogether, this identifies CIDRα1 as an important vaccine target. However, the antigenic diversity of the CIDRα1 domain family is a challenge for vaccine development. METHODS: Immune responses in mice vaccinated with Virus-Like Particles (VLP) presenting CIDRα1 antigens were investigated. Antibody reactivity was tested to a panel of recombinant CIDRα1 domains, and the antibodies ability to inhibit EPCR binding by the recombinant CIDRα1 domains was tested in Luminex-based multiplex assays. RESULTS: VLP-presented CIDRα1.4 antigens induced a rapid and strong IgG response capable of inhibiting EPCR-binding of multiple CIDRα1 domains mainly within the group A CIDRα1.4–7 subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The study observations mirror those from previous CIDRα1 vaccine studies using other vaccine constructs and platforms. This suggests that broad CIDRα1 antibody reactivity may be achieved through vaccination with a limited number of CIDRα1 variants. In addition, this study suggest that this may be achieved through vaccination with a human compatible VLP vaccine platform.","Harmsen, Charlotte; Turner, Louise; Thrane, Susan; Sander, Adam F.; Theander, Thor G.; Lavstsen, Thomas",Malar J,332,9

Structure-based virtual screening was employed using MTiOpenScreen server and top four compounds selected with the most negative docking scores. Conformations were redocked using AutoDock Vina; these complexes showed mechanistic interactions with Arg(474), Gly(605), Asp(668), and Trp(800) residues in the active site of jRdRp, i.e., guanosine-5′-triphosphate. Furthermore, 100 ns classical molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation showed stability of docked bioflavonoids in the active jRdRp pocket and significant contribution of van-der-Waals interactions for docked complex stability during simulation. Therefore, this study predicted the anti-viral activity of Gedunin, Nimbolide, Ohchinin acetate, and Kulactone against jRdRp and can be considered for further antiviral drug development.","Dwivedi, Vivek Dhar; Singh, Ankita; El-Kafraway, Sherif Aly; Alandijany, Thamir A.; Faizo, Arwa A.; Bajrai, Leena Hussein; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad; Azhar, Esam Ibraheem",Sci Rep,332,9

It uses data from the National Expert Survey (NES–GEM). A total of 1771 national entrepreneurship experts representing 44 countries were included in the analysis. Using Laeven and Valencia (2013)’s criteria, 20 countries were considered as most affected by the global economic crisis (group 1) and 24 as less affected (included in group 2) in order to test if opportunity perceptions are significantly affected in times of recovery. In terms of findings, the study confirms that institutional factor conditions strongly impact on the opportunity to create a new business regardless of how damaged the economy of countries hit by the crisis was. Among the six institutional factors studied, four are found to be statistically significant and two are partially significant. The interacting effects of systemic banking crisis and the exposure to international conditions kept the previous relationship relatively unchanged. In terms of contributions, the study first highlights the importance of the institutional view in explaining the opportunities to start-up in the aftermath of a crisis. Second, the study compares the proposed relationships between four sub-sample data sets based on trade openness and banking crisis severity. From a practical and government perspective, this study provides a useful picture of the yet limited understanding of the role that institutions and trade openness can play in entrepreneurs’ perceptions and thus in economic recovery dynamics.","Pinho, José Carlos; de Lurdes Martins, Maria",J Int Entrep,332,9

Our program adopted the SCORE curriculum in 2015 following poor ABS In-Training Examination (ABSITE) performance and lowest quartile ABS Certifying Exam (CE) and Qualifying Exam (QE) first-time pass rates. We examined the association of SCORE utilization with ABSITE performance and ABS board exam first-time pass rate. METHODS At a single institution, a retrospective review of surgery residents' SCORE metrics and ABSITE percentile was conducted for academic year 2015 to 2019. Metrics analyzed on SCORE web portal were mean total minutes and total visits per resident for all residents using SCORE that year. First-time pass rates of the ABS QE and CE were examined from 2013 to 2019. Chi-square and linear regression analysis were performed, and a 95% level of confidence was assumed (alpha=.05).

This retrospective study evaluated RFA of 36 renal tumours in 32 patients (M = 21, F = 11). The mean patient age was 70 years (range, 39-89 years). Ablations were performed by using either multi-tined applicators or cooled and/or cluster applicators under US guidance. Applicator size varied from 2-5 cm, depending on the size of the index tumour. Conscious sedation was administered by an anesthetist. Follow-up imaging by using contrast-enhanced CT was performed 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after RFA, and yearly thereafter. The mean tumour follow-up time was 12 months (range, 1-35 months). The mean tumour size was 2.7 cm (range, 1-5 cm). Primary effectiveness was achieved in 31 cases (86.1%), with patients in 5 cases (11.1%) demonstrating residual disease. Three patients had repeated sessions, which were technically successful. The remaining 2 patients were not re-treated because of patient comorbidities. As a result, secondary effectiveness was achieved in 34 patients (94.4%). In 1 patient, a new lesion developed in the same kidney but remote from the 2 prior areas of treatment. Hydrodissection was performed in 3 patients (8.3%), manipulation or electrode repositioning in 11 patients (30.6%), and ureteric cooling in 1 patient (2.8%). Minor and major complications occurred in 3 (8.3%) and 3 (8.3%) patients, respectively. Correlation coefficients were calculated for distance from skin to tumour and risk of complication as well as compared with primary and secondary effectiveness.

LE is also alternative to anterior rectal resection in selected patients suffering from major comorbidities and limits for major abdominal procedure. Furthermore, LE results in less pain, reduced impact on bowel function, shorter duration of hospital stay, and lower rates of morbidity, mortality and stoma creation. In particular, early data on transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) are promising, but they come from single centre case series related to small groups of patients and more data are needed to draw a final conclusion on the safety of this novel approach for transanal resection. CASE PRESENTATION A 62-year-old woman, following a positive faecal occult blood test and with unremarkable medical history, was admitted to hospital for excision of a large flat neoplastic lesion. Endoscopic biopsy demonstrated a tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia and was decided to proceed with surgical excision by TAMIS. After surgery, short-term outcomes revealed prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, undetectable factor XII activity, fever, and partial dehiscence of rectal wall defect suture. Cross-mixing studies of patient plasma show no correction in either the immediate or incubated activated partial thromboplastin time, indicating the presence of an acquired factor XII inhibitor. Activated partial thromboplastin time and factor XII improved in the following weeks without any specific therapy in addition to antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION This is the first report in which acquired inhibitor of coagulation factor XII is associated with a specific surgical procedure. This case has shown how trans-anal excision of rectal lesions, even when performed by minimally invasive means such as in case of TAMIS, is not free of complications. We consider the acute infection, resulting from early dehiscence of the suture, the trigger in an abnormal immune response, and inhibitor development.","Cozzi, Maria Rita; Lauretta, Andrea; Vettori, Roberto; Steffan, Agostino",World journal of surgical oncology,332,19

We have previously shown that an antagonist analog of bombesin RM26 conjugated to 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N',N''-triacetic acid (NOTA) via a diethyleneglycol (PEG2) spacer (NOTA-PEG2-RM26) and labeled with 68Ga can be used for imaging of GRPR-expressing tumors. In this study, we evaluated if a variation of mini-PEG spacer length can be used for optimization of targeting properties of the NOTA-conjugated RM26. A series of analogs with different PEG-length (n = 2, 3, 4, 6) was synthesized, radiolabeled and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The IC50 values of natGa-NOTA-PEGn-RM26 (n = 2, 3, 4, 6) were 3.1 ± 0.2, 3.9 ± 0.3, 5.4 ± 0.4 and 5.8 ± 0.3 nM, respectively. In normal mice all conjugates demonstrated similar biodistribution pattern, however 68Ga-NOTA-PEG3-RM26 showed lower liver uptake. Biodistribution of 68Ga-NOTA-PEG3-RM26 was evaluated in nude mice bearing PC-3 (prostate cancer) and BT-474 (breast cancer) xenografts. High uptake in tumors (4.6 ± 0.6%ID/g and 2.8 ± 0.4%ID/g for PC-3 and BT-474 xenografts, respectively) and high tumor-to-background ratios (tumor/blood of 44 ± 12 and 42 ± 5 for PC-3 and BT-474 xenografts, respectively) were found already at 2 h p.i. of 68Ga-NOTA-PEG3-RM26. Results of this study suggest that variation in the length of the PEG spacer can be used for optimization of targeting properties of peptide-chelator conjugates.

Eighty-nine patients (79.46%) were managed in ward or special care units and 23 patients (20.5%) received treatment in intensive care unit (ICU). The overall mortality in our study was 15/112 (13.4%) with the mortality rate of ICU patients being 47.8% while the mortality rate of patients treated in special care units and wards was only 4.5%. The mean age of patients with influenza infection was 58.1 years (±16.6). Influenza virus type A was found in 87 patients (77.6%), while influenza type B was present in only 25 (22.4%) patients. Out of the 15 non-survivors, 14 had influenza A. Only 17 patients (15.2%) were found to have positive culture of respiratory specimen, out of which 3 were non-survivors and 14 were survivors. Our analysis identified septic shock (odds ratio 45.24; 95%, confidence interval 6.20-330; p<0.001), renal failure (odds ratio 10.88; 95%, confidence interval 1.61-73.52; p=0.01) and ICU stay (odds ratio 17.22; 95%, confidence interval 2.68-110.5; p=0.003) as independent risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality.","Khanum, Iffat; Ahmed, Amber Sabeen; Awan, Safia; Bano, Sabiha; Jamil, Bushra",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,332,1

Diagnosis errors in chronic parenchymal parotitis are frequent and important but represent an underemphasized and understudied area of patient safety. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to elaborate the most effective and acceptable strategies for the diagnosis of chronic parenchymal parotitis in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied the histories of 211 patients with a primary diagnosis of chronic parenchymal parotitis. All patients underwent ultrasound diagnostic, as well as medical and genetic counseling and examination of 1st degree relatives and probands. RESULTS After additional examinations, 100 children were given other diagnoses. Having analyzed the results of medical-genetic and echographic examinations of 111 patients with chronic parenchymal parotitis and their family members, we have developed a pattern of chronic parenchymal parotitis inheritance. All patients were divided into 3 groups according to the type of inheritance: monogenic inheritance, multifactorial inheritance, and sporadic cases. CONCLUSION A complex approach to the differential diagnosis of chronic parenchymal parotitis is what is needed to reduce the frequency of diagnostic errors.","Klinovskaya, A S; Smislenova, M V; Gurgenadze, A P; Abrahamyan, K D; Bazikyan, O A",Stomatologiia,332,29

DESIGN Cohort study. SETTING Tertiary referral centre. POPULATION Two hundred and eleven pregnant women with influenza A/H1N1 (2009) infection diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODS Obstetric patients presenting to our centre were recruited and followed up. Data collected included demographic and clinical information. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES H1N1 and pregnancy complications, and hospitalisation needs. RESULTS The median age of the cohort was 29.0 years (range 16-42 years), the median gestation at referral was 23.0 weeks (range 4-38 weeks), the median time interval between illness onset and presentation was 2.0 days (range 1-7 days), and the median time interval between illness onset and commencement of oseltamivir was 2.0 days (range 1-11 days). Hospital admission was significantly associated with the presence of co-morbidity (OR 4.14, 95% CI 1.82-9.37, P = 0.0001), breathlessness (OR 5.2, 95% CI 2.19-12.41, P = 0.0003) and sore throat (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.73, P = 0.005). There were two cases of pneumonia complicating H1N1 infection, but no mortality. Nine cases developed pregnancy complications. All women recovered. CONCLUSIONS The need for hospitalisation was significantly associated with breathlessness and co-morbidity. There was minimal morbidity and no mortality observed. We attribute this to early presentation, diagnosis and treatment.","Lim, M L; Chong, C Y; Tee, W S N; Lim, W Y; Chee, J J",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,332,17

Even with early intervention, the management of open-globe injuries remains a challenge for ophthalmologists, mostly due to inadequate or suboptimal current therapies. To aid in the development of novel therapeutics and track toxicological and pathophysiological changes, this article details an open-globe injury platform capable of inducing injuries in enucleated porcine eyes. The injury platform relies on a high-speed solenoid device to mimic explosive injury scenarios, allowing for large, complex injury shapes and sizes that are often observed in casualties and are more difficult to treat. The system can be implemented with precise computer control of the injury mechanism to allow for more complex setups. Also, the system can make use of real-time intraocular pressure measurement to track changes during injury induction and to assess therapeutic efficacy for restoring intraocular pressure and the integrity of the eye.

For psychotic disorders, these issues were partly addressed in current versions, but additional modifications are thought to be needed. Changes should be evidence based. We reviewed categorical, modified-categorical, and continuum-based models versus factor-based models of psychosis. Factors are clusters of symptoms or single prominent aspects of illness. Consistent evidence from studies of the genetics, pathobiology, and clinical presentation of psychotic disorders all support an underlying structure of factors, not categories, as best characterizing psychoses. Factors are not only the best fit but also comprehensive, as they can encompass any key feature of illness, including symptoms and course, as well as determinants of risk or response. Factors are inherently dimensional, even multidimensional, as are the psychoses themselves, and they provide the detail needed for either grouping or distinguishing patients for treatment decisions. The tools for making factor-based diagnoses are available, reliable, and concordant with actual practices used for clinical assessments. If needed, factors can be employed to create categories similar to those in current use. In addition, they can be used to define unique groupings of patients relevant to specific treatments or studies of the psychoses. Lastly, factor-based classifications are concordant with other comprehensive approaches to psychiatric nosology, including personalized (precision treatment) models and hierarchical models, both of which are currently being explored.

We present 4 cases of ruptured BPAs treated either conservatively or by flow diverter deployment and review the literature. METHODS Patients (age 78, 59, 53, and 62 years) presented with World Federation of Neurological Societies grade I-IV and Fisher grade 3-4 subarachnoid hemorrhage. Initial angiography results were normal in 3 patients and necessitated a second angiography. BPA diameter was 0.5-3 mm; BPAs were located in the mid-third of the basilar artery in 2 patients and the upper third in 2 patients. RESULTS All patients were managed conservatively. One patient experienced rebleeding 10 days after initial ictus, which required the deployment of a flow diverter in the basilar artery. One patient developed a severe spontaneous pontine ischemic stroke with severe quadriparesis and refused further imaging. He was clinically stable at 1-year clinical follow-up. The other 3 patients showed complete resolution of BPAs on control follow-up imaging. CONCLUSIONS Ruptured BPAs are rare lesions that may heal spontaneously or be associated with spontaneous ischemic brainstem stroke or rerupture.

Switzerland was severely hit by the virus, with 43,000 confirmed cases as of 1 September 2020. AIM In cooperation with the Federal Office of Public Health, we set up a surveillance database in February 2020 to monitor hospitalised patients with COVID-19, in addition to their mandatory reporting system. METHODS Patients hospitalised for more than 24 hours with a positive polymerase chain-reaction test, from 20 Swiss hospitals, are included. Data were collected in a customised case report form based on World Health Organisation recommendations and adapted to local needs. Nosocomial infections were defined as infections for which the onset of symptoms was more than 5 days after the patient’s admission date. RESULTS As of 1 September 2020, 3645 patients were included. Most patients were male (2168, 59.5%), and aged between 50 and 89 years (2778, 76.2%), with a median age of 68 (interquartile range 54–79). Community infections dominated with 3249 (89.0%) reports. Comorbidities were frequently reported, with hypertension (1481, 61.7%), cardiovascular diseases (948, 39.5%) and diabetes (660, 27.5%) being the most frequent in adults; respiratory diseases and asthma (4, 21.1%), haematological and oncological diseases (3, 15.8%) were the most frequent in children. Complications occurred in 2679 (73.4%) episodes, mostly respiratory diseases (2470, 93.2% in adults; 16, 55.2% in children), and renal (681, 25.7%) and cardiac (631, 23.8%) complications for adults. The second and third most frequent complications in children affected the digestive system and the liver (7, 24.1%).

To this end, we describe how a computer-based monitoring system can support the delivery of the New Beginnings Program (NBP), a parent-focused evidence-based prevention program for divorcing parents. METHOD We present NBP from a novel systems approach that incorporates social system informatics and engineering, both necessary when utilizing feedback loops, ubiquitous in implementation research and practice. Examples of two methodological challenges are presented: how to monitor implementation, and how to provide feedback by evaluating system-level changes due to implementation. RESULTS We introduce and relate systems concepts to these two methodologic issues that are at the center of implementation methods. We explore how these system-level feedback loops address effectiveness, efficiency, and equity principles. These key principles are provided for designing an automated, low-burden, low-intrusive measurement system to aid fidelity monitoring and feedback that can be used in practice. DISCUSSION As the COVID-19 pandemic now demands fewer face-to-face delivery systems, their replacement with more virtual systems for parent training interventions requires constructing new implementation measurement systems based on social system informatics approaches. These approaches include the automatic monitoring of quality and fidelity in parent training interventions. Finally, we present parallels of producing generalizable and local knowledge bridging systems science and engineering method.

We aimed to assess the association between collateral status and EVT outcomes and to investigate whether collateral status modified the effect of successful reperfusion on EVT outcomes. METHODS We used data from the ongoing, prospective, multicenter Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke (ETIS) Registry. Collaterals were graded according to the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology (ASITN/SIR) guidelines. Patients were divided into two groups based on angiographic collateral status: poor (grade 0-2) versus good (grade 3-4) collaterals. RESULTS Among 2020 patients included in the study, 959 (47%) had good collaterals. Good collaterals were associated with favorable outcome (90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2) (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.88). Probability of good outcome decreased with increased time from onset to reperfusion in both good and poor collateral groups. Successful reperfusion was associated with higher odds of favorable outcome in good collaterals (OR 6.01, 95% CI 3.27 to 11.04) and poor collaterals (OR 5.65, 95% CI 3.32 to 9.63) with no significant interaction. Similarly, successful reperfusion was associated with higher odds of excellent outcome (90-day mRS 0-1) and lower odds of mortality in both groups with no significant interaction. The benefit of successful reperfusion decreased with time from onset in both groups, but the curve was steeper in the poor collateral group. CONCLUSIONS Collateral status predicted functional outcome after EVT. However, collateral status on the pretreatment angiogram did not decrease the clinical benefit of successful reperfusion.","Anadani, Mohammad; Finitsis, Stephanos; Clarençon, Frédéric; Richard, Sébastien; Marnat, Gaultier; Bourcier, Romain; Sibon, Igor; Dargazanli, Cyril; Arquizan, Caroline; Blanc, Raphael; Lapergue, Bertrand; Consoli, Arturo; Eugene, Francois; Vannier, Stephane; Spelle, Laurent; Denier, Christian; Boulanger, Marion; Gauberti, Maxime; Liebeskind, David S; de Havenon, Adam; Saleme, Suzana; Macian, Francisco; Rosso, Charlotte; Naggara, Olivier; Turc, Guillaume; Ozkul-Wermester, Ozlem; Papagiannaki, Chrisanthi; Viguier, Alain; Cognard, Christophe; Le Bras, Anthony; Evain, Sarah; Wolff, Valerie; Pop, Raoul; Timsit, Serge; Gentric, Jean-Christophe; Bourdain, Frédéric; Veunac, Louis; Maier, Benjamin; Gory, Benjamin",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,332,7

This also occurs with tapping of the radial bone, and it has been suggested that vibration is a stimulus for deep tendon reflexes. We investigated whether the normal stimulus for the deep tendon reflex is a sudden stretch, a phasic vibration, or both. Furthermore, we investigated the importance of forearm position for the reflex response in controls and stroke patients. METHODS We investigated 50 neurological outpatients without clinical signs of neurological disorders in the arms. The biceps tendon and distal radius were tapped with the forearm in the midway (90°), supinated, and pronated positions. In 10 of these patients, the two reflexes were also investigated with quantitative electromyography (EMG) measurements in the 3 positions. Another 10 patients were investigated clinically when stretch of elbow was eliminated and 17 patients were examined when prestretching of the biceps tendon was avoided. Finally, we examined 32 patients that had experienced stroke. RESULTS In 94% (47/50) of patients, after a radial tap, the biceps contraction disappeared in the supinated forearm, and the median peak-to-peak amplitude of the surface EMG response (n = 10) decreased from 1.1 to 0.2 mV (p < .01). Elimination of elbow stretch as well as pressure on the biceps tendon did not change the reflex response. In 84% (27/32) of stroke patients, after a radial tap, the biceps contraction persisted in supination in the arm with hyperreflexia. CONCLUSION The combined clinical and EMG results are consistent with the concept that the deep tendon reflexes in man can be elicited by both stretch and phasic vibration. Clinicians should be aware that the brachioradial reflex depends on the forearm position.","Tfelt-Hansen, Peer; Meritam Larsen, Pirgit; van Deurs, Ulla; Fabricius, Martin",Brain and behavior,332,1

The Oxylator is an FDA approved, fist-size, ultra-light, portable ventilation device developed for out-of-hospital emergency ventilation. It has not been tested in conditions of severe lung injury or with added PEEP. OBJECTIVES 1) To assess the performance and reliability of the device in simulated and experimental conditions of severe lung injury, and 2) to derive monitoring methods allowing the delivery of a safe individualized ventilation during situations of surge. METHODS Functioning of the device with added PEEP valve was extensively tested on a bench, mimicking adult patients with various respiratory mechanics during controlled ventilation, spontaneous breathing, and prolonged unstable conditions where mechanics and/or breathing effort was changed at every breath. The device was further tested on a porcine model (n=4) with normal lungs and after inducing lung injury and was compared with conventional ventilation modes. RESULTS The device was stable and predictable: it delivered a constant flow (30 L/min) and cycled automatically at the inspiratory pressure set (minimum of 20 cmH2O) above auto-PEEP. Changes in respiratory mechanics manifested as changes in respiratory timing, allowing prediction of tidal volumes from respiratory rate. Simulating lung injury resulted in relatively low tidal volumes (330 mL with compliance of 20 mL/cmH2O). In the porcine model, arterial oxygenation, CO2 and pH were comparable to conventional modes of ventilation. CONCLUSION The Oxylator is a simple device that delivers stable ventilation with tidal volumes within a clinically acceptable range in bench and porcine lung models with low compliance. External monitoring of respiratory timing is advisable, allowing tidal volume estimation and recognition of changes in respiratory mechanics. The device can be an efficient, low-cost practical rescue solution for providing ventilatory support as a temporary bridge but requires a caregiver at bedside.","Jonkman, Annemijn H; Katira, Bhushan H; Schreiber, Annia; Lu, Cong; Engelberts, Doreen; Vieira, Fernando; Marquez, Alexandra; Slutsky, Arthur S; Dorian, Paul; Brochard, Laurent",Respiratory care,332,19

Among these compounds, ebselen was identified as a covalent, destabilizing ligand of 14-3-3 isoforms ζ, ε, γ and η. Ebselen bonding decreased 14-3-3ζ binding to its partner Ser19-phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase. Characterization of site-directed mutants at cysteine residues in 14-3-3ζ (C25, C94, and C189) by DSF and mass spectroscopy revealed covalent modification by ebselen of all cysteines. C25 was identified as the preferential site of ebselen interaction in vitro, whereas modification of C94 was mainly responsible for the protein destabilization. At therapeutic relevant concentrations ebselen caused a decrease of 14-3-3 levels in both SHSY5Y cells and zebrafish brain, accompanied with an increased degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Moreover, ebselen-treated zebrafish displayed a freezing phenotype and reduced mobility, resembling the effects of lithium, in line with the proposed action of ebselen as a potentially safer lithium-mimetic drug. Ebselen has recently emerged as a promising drug candidate in several medical areas, including cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders and infectious diseases, including Covid-19. Its pleiotropic actions are attributed to antioxidant effects, and the formation of selenosulfides with critical cysteine residues in proteins. Our work indicates that a destabilization of 14-3-3 may affect the protein interaction networks of this protein family, contributing to the therapeutic potential of ebselen. Significance Statement There is currently great interest in the repurposing of established drugs for new indications and therapeutic targets. This study shows that ebselen, which is a promising drug candidate against cancer, bipolar disorder and the virus infection Covid-19, covalently bonds to cysteine residues in 14-3-3 adaptor proteins, triggering 14-3-3 destabilization and degradation in cells and intact brain tissue when used in therapeutic concentrations, potentially explaining the behavioral and anti-neoplastic effects of this drug.","Waløen, Kai; Jung, Kunwar K C; Vecchia, Elisa D; Pandey, Sunil; Gasparik, Norbert; Døskeland, Anne; Patil, Sudarshan; Kleppe, Rune; Hritz, Jozef; Norton, William H J; Martinez, Aurora; Haavik, Jan",Molecular pharmacology,332,1

The relation of these factors to prolonged injury symptoms and later visits into psychiatric care was assessed. METHODS Demographic information, pre-injury learning status, and neuropsychological test results of 120 patients aged 7-16 years were retrospectively collected from the hospital medical records. Data were compared with self- or parent-reported injury symptoms at 1-3 months post-injury and later visits to psychiatric care. RESULTS According to medical records, 14.2% of the children with mTBI had a diagnosed neurobehavioral or psychiatric condition pre-injury. Additionally, 53.3% of the children had some neurobehavioral or psychiatric concerns or traits prior to the injury. Over half (56.7%) of the children studied were symptomatic at 1-3 months following the injury. Female gender and presence of prolonged symptoms were predictive for later visit into psychiatric care. CONCLUSIONS Pre-injury neurobehavioral or psychiatric problems may predict prolonged injury symptoms following pediatric mTBI. In this retrospective patient series, prolonged symptoms and female gender seem to predict the need for later psychiatric care. Monitoring the recovery of children with mTBI and pre-injury risk factors is important for timely interventions.","Saarinen, M; Erkinjuntti, N; Koskinen, S; Himanen, L; Vahlberg, T; Tenovuo, O; Lähdesmäki, T",Brain injury,332,31

Expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and B7-H1 were studied during acute and persistent infection to examine whether this negative regulatory mechanism contributes to CNS viral persistence. The majority of CNS-infiltrating CD8 T cells expressed PD-1, with the highest levels on virus-specific CD8 T cells. Moreover, despite control of infectious virus, CD8 T cells within the CNS of persistently infected mice maintained high PD-1 expression. Analysis of virus-susceptible target cells in vivo revealed that B7-H1 expression was regulated in a cell type-dependent manner. Oligodendroglia and microglia up-regulated B7-H1 following infection; however, although B7-H1 expression on oligodendroglia was prominent and sustained, it was significantly reduced and transient on microglia. Infection of mice deficient in the IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha/beta receptor demonstrated that B7-H1 expression on oligodendroglia is predominantly regulated by IFN-gamma. Ab blockade of B7-H1 on oligodendroglia in vitro enhanced IFN-gamma secretion by virus-specific CD8 T cells. More efficient virus control within the CNS of B7-H1-deficient mice confirmed inhibition of CD8 T cell function in vivo. Nevertheless, the absence of B7-H1 significantly increased morbidity without altering demyelination. These data are the first to demonstrate glia cell type-dependent B7-H1 regulation in vivo, resulting in adverse effects on antiviral CD8 T cell function. However, the beneficial role of PD-1:B7-H1 interactions in limiting morbidity highlights the need to evaluate tissue-specific intervention strategies.","Phares, Timothy W; Ramakrishna, Chandran; Parra, Gabriel I; Epstein, Alan; Chen, Lieping; Atkinson, Roscoe; Stohlman, Stephen A; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of immunology,332,16

This study aims to investigate the mental health of patients with COVID-19 in Changsha. METHODS We took cross-section investigation for the mental health of 112 patients with COVID-19 via questionnaires. Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test were performed to compare general and clinical data between the slight-ordinary patients and severe patients. Single sample t-tests were used to compare the difference between the factor scores of the Symptom Check-List 90 (SCL-90) in COVID-19 patients with the norm of 2015 and factor scores of SCL-90 in patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS The obsessive-compulsive, depression, sleep and eating disorders had the highest frequency among the positive symptoms of SCL-90 in patients with COVID-19 in Changsha. The factor scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, phobia anxiety, sleep and eating disorders in patients with COVID-19 were higher than those of the norm (P≤0.001 or P<0.05). Slight-ordinary patients with COVID-19 in Changsha showed lower factor scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, and hostility compared with the patients with SARS (P<0.001 or P<0.05). There was no difference in factor scores of SCL-90 between the patients with severe COVID-19 and those with SARS(P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS The levels of somatization, depression, anxiety, phobia anxiety, sleep and eating disorders in patients with COVID-19 in Changsha are higher than those of the norm. However, the mental health of slight-ordinary patients with COVID-19 is better than that of patients with SARS.

We analyzed original monthly data on all-cause deaths by county for the 83 counties of Michigan and interpreted the results in the context of what is known about the pandemic. Counties in Michigan experienced up to four waves of excess mortality over a span of two years, including a severe one in early 1920. Some counties experienced two waves in late 1918 while others had only one. The 1920 wave propagated across the state in a different manner than the fall and winter 1918 waves. The twin waves in late 1918 were likely related to the timing of the statewide imposition of a three-week social distancing order.

How to learn, access, and retrieve such patterns is crucial in Hopfield networks and the more recent transformer architectures. We show that the attention mechanism of transformer architectures is actually the update rule of modern Hop-field networks that can store exponentially many patterns. We exploit this high storage capacity of modern Hopfield networks to solve a challenging multiple instance learning (MIL) problem in computational biology: immune repertoire classification. Accurate and interpretable machine learning methods solving this problem could pave the way towards new vaccines and therapies, which is currently a very relevant research topic intensified by the COVID-19 crisis. Immune repertoire classification based on the vast number of immunosequences of an individual is a MIL problem with an unprecedentedly massive number of instances, two orders of magnitude larger than currently considered problems, and with an extremely low witness rate. In this work, we present our novel method DeepRC that integrates transformer-like attention, or equivalently modern Hopfield networks, into deep learning architectures for massive MIL such as immune repertoire classification. We demonstrate that DeepRC outperforms all other methods with respect to predictive performance on large-scale experiments, including simulated and real-world virus infection data, and enables the extraction of sequence motifs that are connected to a given disease class.

Methods: We quantified all-cause excess mortality in India, comparing deaths during the peak of the first and second COVID waves (Jul-Dec 2020 and April-June 2021) with month wise deaths in 2015-19 from three sources: Civil Registration System (CRS) mortality reports from 15 states or cities with 37% of India's population; deaths in 0.2 million health facilities; and a representative survey of 0.14 million adults about COVID deaths. Results: During the first viral wave, the median excess mortality compared to CRS baseline was 22% and 41%, respectively, in included states and cities, rising to 46% and 85% during the second wave. In settings with 10 or more months of data across the two waves, the median excess mortality was 32% and 37% for states and cities, respectively. Deaths in health facilities showed a 27% excess mortality from July 2020-May 2021, reaching 120% during April-May 2021. The national survey found 3.5% of adults reported a COVID death in their household in April-June 2021, approximately doubling the 3.2% expected overall deaths. The national survey showed 29-32% excess deaths from June 1, 2020 to June 27, 2021, most of which were likely to be COVID. This translates to 3.1-3.4 million COVID deaths (including 2.5-2.8 million during April-June 2021).

We find that although conventional quantum annealing is difficult for the optimization of constrained topological problems, a generalized algorithm -- the sweeping quantum annealing method -- can be designed and solve the problem with better efficiency than both conventional quantum and thermal annealing algorithms. The sweeping quantum annealing algorithm, therefore, opens up a promising avenue for quantum computing of constrained problems and can be readily employed on the optimizations in quantum material design, engineering, and even social sciences.","Yan, Zheng; Zhou, Zheng; Wang, Yan-Cheng; Meng, Zi Yang; Zhang, Xue-Feng",,332,25

To this end, we apply inequality indices over regions to incidences, infection related mortality, and infection fatality rates. If avoiding of inequality in health is an important political goal, a metric must be implemented to track geographical inequality over time. METHODS: The relative and absolute Gini index as well as the Theil index are used to quantify inequality. Data are taken from international data bases. Absolute counts are transformed to rates adjusted for population size. RESULTS: Comparing continents, the absolute Gini index shows an unfavorable development in four continents since February 2020. In contrast, the relative Gini as well as the Theil index support the interpretation of less inequality between European countries compared to other continents. Infection fatality rates within the EU as well as within the U.S. express comparable improvement towards more equality (as measured by both Gini indices). CONCLUSIONS: The use of inequality indices to monitor changes in geographic inequality over time for key health indicators is a valuable tool to inform public health policies. The absolute and relative Gini index behave complementary and should be reported simultaneously in order to gain a meta-perspective on very complex dynamics.","Manz, Kirsi M; Mansmann, Ulrich",PLoS One,332,23

Untreated OUD is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality-notably, overdose, infectious complications of injecting drug use, and profoundly diminished quality of life. Withdrawal management and medication tapers are ineffective and are associated with increased rates of relapse and death. Pharmacotherapy is the evidence based mainstay of OUD treatment, and many studies support its integration into primary care settings. Evidence is strongest for the opioid agonists buprenorphine and methadone, which randomized controlled trials have shown to decrease illicit opioid use and mortality. Discontinuation of opioid agonist therapy is associated with increased rates of relapse and mortality. Less evidence is available for the opioid antagonist extended release naltrexone, with a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showing decreased illicit opioid use but no effect on mortality. Treating OUD in primary care settings is cost effective, improves outcomes for both OUD and other medical comorbidities, and is highly acceptable to patients. Evidence on whether behavioral interventions improve outcomes for patients receiving pharmacotherapy is mixed, with guidelines promoting voluntary engagement in psychosocial supports, including counseling.

Airborne transmission has been recognized as one of the major transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating the effectiveness of multi-scale IAQ control strategies in mitigating the infection risk in different scenarios. The IAQ control strategies across multiple scales from a whole building to rooms, and to cubical and personal microenvironments and breathing zone, are introduced, including elevated outdoor airflow rates, high-efficiency filters, advanced air distribution strategies, standalone air cleaning technologies, personal ventilation and face masks. The effectiveness of these strategies for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection are evaluated for specific indoor spaces, including long-term care facility, school and college, meat plant, retail stores, hospital, office, correctional facility, hotel, restaurant, casino and transportation spaces like airplane, cruise ship, subway, bus and taxi, where airborne transmission are more likely to occur due to high occupancy densities. The baseline cases of these spaces are established according to the existing standards, guidelines or practices. Several integrated mitigation strategies are recommended and classified based on their relative cost and effort of implementation for each indoor space. They can be applied to help meet the current challenge of ongoing COVID-19, and provide better preparation for other possible epidemics and pandemics of airborne infectious diseases in the future.","Shen, Jialei; Kong, Meng; Dong, Bing; Birnkrant, Michael J; Zhang, Jianshun",Build Environ,332,2

One of the methods used to inactivate viruses is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation to damage their nucleic acids. While gamma (Î³) rays effectively induce lesions in the RNA, envelope proteins are also highly damaged in the process. This in turn may alter their antigenic properties, affecting their capacity to induce an adaptive immune response able to confer effective protection. Here, we modeled the effect of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation on SARS-CoV-2 using the Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA. With a realistic 3D target virus model, we calculated the expected number of lesions in the spike and membrane proteins, as well as in the viral RNA. Our findings showed that Î³ rays produced significant spike protein damage, but densely ionizing charged particles induced less membrane damage for the same level of RNA lesions, because a single ion traversal through the nuclear envelope was sufficient to inactivate the virus. We propose that accelerated charged particles produce inactivated viruses with little structural damage to envelope proteins, thereby representing a new and effective tool for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses.","Francis, Ziad; Incerti, Sebastien; Zein, Sara A; Lampe, Nathanael; Guzman, Carlos A; Durante, Marco",Radiat. res,332,16

In this work we study novel extensions of the t-walk algorithm, an existing MCMC method that is inexpensive and invariant to affine transformations of the state space, for dealing with multimodal distributions.

Imaging plays a complementary role in the management of patients with COVID-19. Computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) are the two dominant screening tools. However, difficulty in eliminating the risk of disease transmission, radiation exposure and not being costeffective are some of the challenges for CT and CXR imaging. This fact induces the implementation of lung ultrasound (LUS) for evaluating COVID-19 due to its practical advantages of noninvasiveness, repeatability, and sensitive bedside property. In this paper, we utilize a deep learning model to perform the classification of COVID-19 from LUS data, which could produce objective diagnostic information for clinicians. Specifically, all LUS images are processed to obtain their corresponding local phase filtered images and radial symmetry transformed images before fed into the multi-scale residual convolutional neural network (CNN). Secondly, image combination as the input of the network is used to explore rich and reliable features. Feature fusion strategy at different levels is adopted to investigate the relationship between the depth of feature aggregation and the classification accuracy.

METHOD: A UV lamp (PADNUT 38 W, 253 nm UV-C light tube) and UV-C dosimeter (GENERAL UV-C Digital Light Meter No. UV512C) were used to measure irradiance throughout the inner bore of a CT scanner gantry. Irradiance (units µW/cm2 ) was related to the time required to achieve 6-log viral kill (10-6 survival fraction). RESULTS: A warm-up time of ~120 s was required for the lamp to reach stable irradiance. Irradiance at the scan plane (z = 0 cm) of the CT scanner was 580.9 µW/cm2 , reducing to ~350 µW/cm2 at z = ±20 cm toward the front or back of the gantry. The angular distribution of irradiation was uniform within 10% coefficient of variation. A conservative estimate suggests at least 6-log kill (survival fraction &#8804; 10-6 ) of viral RNA within ±20 cm of the scan plane with an irradiation time of 120 s from cold start. More conservatively, running the lamp for 180 s (3 min) or 300 s (5 min) from cold start is estimated to yield survival fraction <<10-7 survival fraction within ±20 cm of the scan plane. CONCLUSION: Ultraviolet irradiation of the inner bore of the CT gantry can be achieved with a simple UV-C lamp attached to the CT couch. Such practice could augment manual wipe-down procedures, improve safety for CT technologists or housekeeping staff, and could potentially reduce turnover time between scanning sessions.","Mahesh, Mahadevappa; Siewerdsen, Jeffrey H",J. appl. clin. med. phys,332,27

Drawing on Survival Psychology and Maslow's motivation theories, this study introduced a theoretical model to establish the factors affecting consumers' PB and investigate their interrelationships. An online survey was designed and administered to 508 respondents in Singapore. Then, structural equation modelling was implemented to study the survey data. The results indicated that the effects of several constructs namely, normative social influence, observational learning, perceived severity, and perceived scarcity, with mediation by control, impose significant influence on consumers' PB. Analysis of total effects showed that normative social influence has the strongest effect on PB. This is followed by perceived scarcity, control, social trust, observational learning, and perceived severity. Two diverse research paradigms centring on Survival Psychology and Maslow's motivation theories were integrated to offer a logical explanation of the motivation driving PB. By utilising a theory-driven approach, the current study has offered a unique approach to interpreting consumers' PB. Overall, this study enhances current research on consumers' PB, offers new insights into understanding the motivating factors behind consumers' PB, and implicates policies on tackling hoarding situations in the event of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yuen, Kum Fai Leong Joey Zu Er Wong Yiik Diew Wang Xueqin",International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,332,16

The objectives of this paper are to now provide quantitative reusable product benefits on a U.S. national environmental and economic basis. This is the first quantitative, novel multi-user economic evaluation of selecting cleanroom reusables over disposables. For personal protection equipment (PPE), these cost and environmental-benefits indicate there is also an improved environmental and economic aspect to the increased national demand for reusables related to Covid-19, while easily achieving necessary cleaning with approved detergents. The current reusable cleanroom market (14.1 million packages) was estimated to be 60% nonsterile and 40% sterilized. The total market is about 50% reusable and 50% disposable. This research documents there is an annual cost reduction of about 58% when selecting reusables over disposables giving an economic savings to the U.S. cleanroom sector from reusables of about $1.2 billion in the next decade. This is also saving the total U.S. about 136 million MJ natural resource energy/year (38 million kWh) and about 8.4 million kg CO2eq annually (removal of about 1,650 cars/yr). In a maximum hypothetical case for reusables at 87.5% of the market (12.5% are mandatory Hazmat disposable) would yield a U.S. national savings of nearly $2.1 billion/decade to the cleanroom sector bottom line, as well as 2.4 billion MJ nre savings in energy or removal of about 29,000 cars/decade.

The effects of those interventions on hospital use have not been systematically evaluated. The investigation could provide data-driven evidence to potentially improve the implementation of public health interventions in the future. OBJECTIVE: We aim to study two representative areas in the United States and one area in China (New York State, Ohio State, and Hubei Province), and investigate the effects of their public health interventions by time periods according to key interventions. METHODS: This observational study evaluated the numbers of infected, hospitalized, and death cases in New York and Ohio from March 16 through September 14, 2020, and Hubei from January 26 to March 31, 2020. We developed novel Bayesian generalized compartmental models. The clinical stages of COVID-19 were stratified in the models, and the effects of public health interventions were modeled through piecewise exponential functions. Time-dependent transmission rates and effective reproduction numbers were estimated. The associations of interventions and the numbers of required hospital and intensive care unit beds were studied. RESULTS: The interventions of social distancing, home confinement, and wearing masks significantly decreased (in a Bayesian sense) the case incidence and reduced the demand for beds in all areas. Ohio's transmission rates declined before the state's ""stay at home"" order, which provided evidence that early intervention is important. Wearing masks was significantly associated with reducing the transmission rates after reopening, when comparing New York and Ohio. The centralized quarantine intervention in Hubei played a significant role in further preventing and controlling the disease in that area. The estimated rates that cured patients become susceptible in all areas were small (<0.0001), which indicates that they have little chance to get the infection again. CONCLUSIONS: The series of public health interventions in three areas were temporally associated with the burden of COVID-19-attributed hospital use. Social distancing and the use of face masks should continue to prevent the next peak of the pandemic.","Wang, Xiaofeng; Ren, Rui; Kattan, Michael W; Jehi, Lara; Cheng, Zhenshun; Fang, Kuangnan",JMIR Public Health Surveill,332,16

VISITECT®CD4's diagnostic performance in identifying individuals with CD4 counts &#8804;350 cells/µL was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) taking flow cytometry as the reference. RESULTS: The overall agreement between VISITECT®CD4 and flow cytometry was 89.5% using venous blood and 81.5% using finger-prick blood. VISITECT®CD4 showed better performance using venous blood [sensitivity: 96.6% (95% confidence interval: 92.1%-98.9%), specificity: 70.9% (57.1%-82.4%), PPV: 89.7% (83.9%-94.0%) and NPV: 88.6% (75.4%-96.2%)] than using finger-prick blood [sensitivity: 84.8% (77.9%-90.2%), specificity: 72.7% (59.0%-83.9%), PPV: 89.1% (82.7%-93.8%) and NPV: 64.5% (51.3%-76.3%)]. CONCLUSION: VISITECT®CD4 performed well using venous blood, demonstrating its potential utility in decentralization of CD4 testing services in resource-constrained settings.","Vidhyavathi, Vairamohan; Iqbal, Hussain Syed; Kanthamani, Kannaiyan; Solomon, Sunil Suhas; Nandagopal, Paneerselvam; Luchters, Stanley; Pham, Minh D; Forbes, James; Crowe, Suzanne M; McMurran, Christopher; Anderson, David A; Balakrishnan, Pachamuthu",J Int Med Res,332,33

Case Report,16.359026,13.118176,2021,"Objective: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of novel coronavirus positive cases including confirmed cases with clinical symptoms and asymptomatic infected cases in Guangzhou. Methods: Epidemiological data were collected on the nucleic acid positive cases of COVID-19 in Guangzhou from January to September 2020. The epidemiological characteristics, the distribution of time intervals between the confirmed/isolation date and the date of the first positive detection were analyzed, at last the influencing factors for the confirmed cases and asymptomatic infected persons were discussed. Results: From January 7 to September 4 in 2020, a total of 1 097 nucleic acid positive cases were identified, including 658 confirmed cases (59.98%) and 439 asymptomatic infected cases (40.02%). Among the 658 confirmed cases, the median age was 42 years old, the cases indicated two significant peaks. one of the peaks was related to the imported and associated cases from Hubei province, and the other peak was connected with individuals from overseas. In terms of 439 asymptomatic infected cases, the median age was 32 years old. There were two stages in these cases. The first stage followed the second peak of confirmed cases, and the second stage overlapped with the confirmed cases in Guangzhou when the epidemic was in a period of normal prevention and control, mainly related to imported cases from abroad. The asymptomatic infected persons accounted for 57.32% in all the imported infected cases. In both of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, the positive rate of pharyngeal swabs was higher than that of nasopharyngeal swabs and anal swabs. There were statistically significant differences in age, source of infection and gender composition between confirmed cases and asymptomatic infected persons (P&lt;0.05). Older age groups were more likely to have clinical symptoms, with ≥40 years being the risk factor for confirmed cases (OR=2.334, P=0.001), and 20-39 years less likely to have clinical symptoms (OR=0.620, P=0.047), compared with the 0-19 years old group. Compared with those infected in China, those infected abroad were less likely to develop clinical symptoms and became confirmed cases (OR=0.723, P=0.013). Women were more likely to have clinical symptoms than men (OR=1.574, P=0.001). Conclusions: At present, asymptomatic infected persons and confirmed patients with clinical symptoms co-existed, and the number of asymptomatic infected patients was higher than that of confirmed cases in Guangzhou. High age, domestic infection and female may be risk factors for confirmed cases. It was of great value to further explore these underlying mechanisms for the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19.","He, P.; Zhang, J.; Ma, Y.; Wu, X.; Wang, A.; Di, B.; Jing, Q.; Li, K.; Bai, Z.",Chinese Journal of Microbiology and Immunology (China),332,3

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the PMI rates according to various definitions, their clinically relevant association with all-cause mortality at 10 years, and their impact on composite endpoints at 5 years in the SYNTAXES (Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery Extended Survival) trial. METHODS: PMI was classified as a myocardial infarction occurring within 48 h of the procedure according to definitions of the SYNTAX (TAXUS Drug-Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for the Treatment of Narrowed Arteries), ISCHEMIA (International Study Of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical And Invasive Approaches), and EXCEL (Evaluation of XIENCE versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) trials; the Fourth Universal Definition of MI; and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI). Of the 1,800 patients enrolled, 1,652 with creatine kinase and/or creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) post-procedure were included. The association between PMI and mortality was analyzed by Cox regression. RESULTS: PMI rates according to the SYNTAX and Fourth Universal Definition of MI, both of which required CK-MB elevation and electrocardiographic evidence of permanent myocardial damage, were 2.7% and 3.0%, respectively, in the PCI arm versus 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively, in the CABG arm. PMI rates according to the SCAI or EXCEL definition were higher in the PCI (5.7%) and CABG (16.5%) arms. PMIs according to the SYNTAX and Fourth Universal Definition of MI were more strongly associated with mortality than EXCEL and SCAI PMIs defined by isolated enzyme elevation when CK-MB was more than 10 times ULN. The impact of these ""enzyme-driven events"" on time-to-event curves and the composite endpoints was greater in the surgical cohort. PMIs after PCI were associated with 10-year mortality regardless of definition, whereas their impact on mortality after CABG was limited to 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of PMI are highly dependent on their definition, which affects time-to-event curves, composite endpoints, and their lethal prognostic relevance.

But the bioactive compounds and potential mechanisms of XBJ for COVID-19 prevention and treatment are unclear. This study aimed to examine the potential effector mechanisms of XBJ on COVID-19 based on network pharmacology. Methods: We searched Chinese and international papers to obtain the active ingredients of XBJ. Then, we compiled COVID-19 disease targets from the GeneCards gene database and via literature searches. Next, we used the SwissTargetPrediction database to predict XBJ's effector targets and map them to the abovementioned COVID-19 disease targets in order to obtain potential therapeutic targets of XBJ. Cytoscape software version 3.7.0 was used to construct a ""XBJ active-compound-potential-effector target"" network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and then to carry out network topology analysis of potential targets. We used the ClueGO and CluePedia plugins in Cytoscape to conduct gene ontology (GO) biological process (BP) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway enrichment analysis of XBJ's effector targets. We used AutoDock vina and PyMOL software for molecular docking. Results: We obtained 144 potential COVID-19 effector targets of XBJ. Fourteen of these targets-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), albumin (ALB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), Caspase-3 (CASP3), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), MAPK8, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), JUN, interleukin-2 (IL-2), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and MAPK14 had degree values > 40 and therefore could be considered key targets. They participated in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1, ERK2) cascade, the T-cell receptor signaling pathway, activation of MAPK activity, cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, and other inflammation- and immune-related BPs. XBJ exerted its therapeutic effects through the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), nuclear factor &#954;-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B), MAPK, phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), toll-like receptor (TLR), TNF, and inflammatory-mediator regulation of transient receptor potential (TRP) signaling pathways to ultimately construct a ""drug-ingredient-target-pathway"" effector network. The molecular docking results showed that the core 18 effective ingredients had a docking score of less than - 4.0 with those top 10 targets. Conclusion: The active ingredients of XBJ regulated different genes, acted on different pathways, and synergistically produced anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory effects, which fully demonstrated the synergistic effects of different components on multiple targets and pathways. Our study demonstrated that key ingredients and their targets have potential binding activity, the existing studies on the pharmacological mechanisms of XBJ in the treatment of sepsis and severe pneumonia, could explain the effector mechanism of XBJ in COVID-19 treatment, and those provided a preliminary examination of the potential effector mechanism in this disease.","Zheng, Wen-Jiang; Yan, Qian; Ni, Yong-Shi; Zhan, Shao-Feng; Yang, Liu-Liu; Zhuang, Hong-Fa; Liu, Xiao-Hong; Jiang, Yong",BioData Min,332,20

A Case Report,16.35558,13.368564,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world. Although in many cases the infection causes very weak symptoms, it can be severe in patient with diverse chronical diseases and immunological compromising patients. Pregnancy is a unique condition in which mother and fetus peacefully collaborate. Diverse endocrine-immune mechanisms, mostly under progesterone control work together to protect the fetus from maternal immunocompetent cell activation driven rejection. The physiological shift to Th2 dominant environment, while favourable for fetus, it makes mothers susceptible to infective pathogens, making pregnancy during COVID-19 pandemic challenging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies involving COVID-19 in pregnancy and those analysing changes of immune system induced by COVID-19 were searched in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect. Databases were searched using a keyword COVID-19/coronavirus, that was combined with following terms: immune system, pregnancy, oestrogen, or progesterone. Search included studies published up to 01.07.2020. Almost 1,500 articles were found, but only 18 met criteria. RESULTS: Most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 in mothers infected in the late pregnancy were fever and cough accompanied with lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein. Mothers reported to have severe disease had comorbidities and were obese. Low rate of neonatal complications of maternal Sars-Coc-2 infection without neonatal mortality was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available data didn't show significant relationship between COVID-19 severity and pregnancy and there is no strong evidence that mother's infection can lead to adverse pregnancy outcome, but further studies are needed to determinate the possible effects of COVID-19 gained during earlier pregnancy.","Gulic, Tamara; Blagojevic Zagorac, Gordana",Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig,332,12

On the one hand, antirheumatic drugs can increase the risk of infection and potentially deteriorate the course of an infection. On the other hand, an active inflammatory rheumatic disease can also increase the risk for an infection. In the recommendations of the German Society for Rheumatology (www.dgrh.de), it is recommended that our patients continue the antirheumatic therapy to maintain remission or low state of activity despite the pandemic. In this study, patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease were asked in the first weeks of the pandemic on their opinion of their immunomodulating therapy. The result shows that over 90% of the patients followed the recommendation of the rheumatologist to continue the antirheumatic therapy, and only a small percentage of the patients terminated the therapy on their own. This result was independent of the individual anti-rheumatic therapy.

Although small ruminants are not sanitary affected by this virus, the short-term economic impact derived by COVID-19 on Spanish flocks is estimated in this study, using data provided by producers and two major slaughterhouses. Milk prices of dairy goat flocks suffered a substantial drop in April 2020, close to 4.5 cts EUR/liter compared to the previous month. In contrast, the monthly milk prices in sheep remained almost stable during this period, and even increases of more than EUR 6 cts were reported in comparison with the previous year. Nevertheless, economical differences are reported by areas where producers could receive a higher income, close to EUR 0.3 per liter of milk. Global data provided by feedlots affecting 2750 Spanish flocks evidenced a lamb price drop ranging from 16.8% to 26.9% after the pandemic arrival; in line with the data directly reported by a limited sample of producers (ranging from 11.0% to 23.7%). The goat kid meat market also suffered a reduction in prices per kg, near 12.5%; although, for some flocks, losses reached up to 40%. In the same line, 2 slaughterhouses reported a sudden sacrifice drop around 27% for lambs and goat kids sacrifices in April, in contrast with the usual sacrifice figures from the beginning of 2020. Moreover, our study showed a temporary and unexpected retention of lambs and goat kids at farms due to a reduction in animals slaughtered during this period. In conclusion, data evidenced a considerable negative economic impact on Spanish small ruminant flocks, throughout the first 60 days after COVID-19's pandemic declaration. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term economic consequences, in order to establish contingency plans and avoid the collapse of small ruminant industries when a crisis of these characteristics occurs.","Vidaurreta, Irene; de la Fe, Christian; Orengo, Juan; Gómez-Martín, Ángel; Benito, Bernardino",,332,1

This, together with data that suggest that a large cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 patients have better outcomes if we can avoid intubating them, creates a need for a safe method of NIV or high-flow oxygen delivery during transport. Commonly used and successful in-hospital regimens for these patients are high-flow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure. In some studies, helmet NIV has been shown to be a viable, if not superior, alternative to these therapies for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

The urinary protein level reached 2.18 g/gCr; hence, a renal biopsy was conducted. Light microscopy revealed mild proliferation of mesangial cells, and immunofluorescence analysis revealed IgG and C3 depositions in the mesangial area. Electron microscopy revealed electron-dense deposition in the paramesangial area, partial podocyte foot process effacement, and segmental endothelial cell swelling with a slight expansion of the subendothelial space. Dasatinib was discontinued, and within 3 weeks, the proteinuria disappeared, with improvements in her renal function. After switching to bosutinib, a new second-generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, the proteinuria remained negative. The rapid cessation of proteinuria following dasatinib discontinuation indicated that proteinuria was induced by the long-term administration of dasatinib.

During the passage of the virus through affected populations, it has undergone mutations, some of which have recently been linked with increased viral load and prognostic complexities. Several of these variants are point mutations that are difficult to diagnose using the gold standard quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method and necessitates widespread sequencing which is expensive, has long turn-around times, and requires high viral load for calling mutations accurately. Here, we repurpose the high specificity of Francisella novicida Cas9 (FnCas9) to identify mismatches in the target for developing a lateral flow assay that can be successfully adapted for the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as for detecting point mutations in the sequence of the virus obtained from patient samples. We report the detection of the S gene mutation N501Y (present across multiple variant lineages of SARS-CoV-2) within an hour using lateral flow paper strip chemistry. The results were corroborated using deep sequencing on multiple wild-type (n = 37) and mutant (n = 22) virus infected patient samples with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 97%.

A key factor contributing to the sustained spreading is the presence of a large number of asymptomatic or hidden spreaders, who mix among the susceptible population without being detected or quarantined. Here we propose an effective non-pharmacological intervention method of detecting the asymptomatic spreaders in contact-tracing networks, and validated it on the empirical COVID-19 spreading network in Singapore. We find that using pure physical spreading equations, the hidden spreaders of COVID-19 can be identified with remarkable accuracy. Specifically, based on the unique characteristics of COVID-19 spreading dynamics, we propose a computational framework capturing the transition probabilities among different infectious states in a network, and extend it to an efficient algorithm to identify asymptotic individuals. Our simulation results indicate that a screening method using our prediction outperforms machine learning algorithms, e.g. graph neural networks, that are designed as baselines in this work, as well as random screening of infection's closest contacts widely used by China in its early outbreak. Furthermore, our method provides high precision even with incomplete information of the contract-tracing networks.

We demonstrate here that heterotypic cell-in-cell structures with lymphocytes inside multinucleate syncytia are prevalent in the lung tissues of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. These unique cellular structures are a direct result of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is sufficient to induce a rapid (~45.1 nm/s) membrane fusion to produce syncytium, which could readily internalize multiple lines of lymphocytes to form typical cell-in-cell structures, remarkably leading to the death of internalized cells. This membrane fusion is dictated by a bi-arginine motif within the polybasic S1/S2 cleavage site, which is frequently present in the surface glycoprotein of most highly contagious viruses. Moreover, candidate anti-viral drugs could efficiently inhibit spike glycoprotein processing, membrane fusion, and cell-in-cell formation.

Despite many advances in our understanding of these diseases, the direct mechanism through which tau contributes to neurodegeneration remains poorly understood. Previously, our laboratory implicated the histone demethylase LSD1 in tau-induced neurodegeneration by showing that LSD1 localizes to pathological tau aggregates in Alzheimer's disease cases, and that it is continuously required for the survival of hippocampal and cortical neurons in mice. Here, we utilize the P301S tauopathy mouse model to demonstrate that pathological tau can exclude LSD1 from the nucleus in neurons. In addition, we show that reducing LSD1 in these mice is sufficient to highly exacerbate tau-mediated neurodegeneration and tau-induced gene expression changes. Finally, we find that overexpressing LSD1 in the hippocampus of tauopathy mice, even after pathology has formed, is sufficient to significantly delay neurodegeneration and counteract tau-induced expression changes. These results suggest that inhibiting LSD1 via sequestration contributes to tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Thus, LSD1 is a promising therapeutic target for tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease.","Engstrom, Amanda K; Walker, Alicia C; Moudgal, Rohitha A; Myrick, Dexter A; Kyle, Stephanie M; Bai, Yu; Rowley, M Jordan; Katz, David J",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,332,24

To mitigate the potential negative effects of COVID-19 on surgical education, it is important to quantify how the pandemic influenced resident operative volume. Objective: To examine the association of the pandemic with general surgical residents' operative experience by postgraduate year (PGY) and case type and to evaluate if certain institutional characteristics were associated with a greater decline in surgical volume. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective review included residents' operative logs from 3 consecutive academic years (2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020) from 16 general surgery programs. Data collected included total major cases, case type, and PGY. Faculty completed a survey about program demographics and COVID-19 response. Data on race were not collected. Operative volumes from March to June 2020 were compared with the same period during 2018 and 2019. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted for within-program correlations. Main Outcome and Measures: Total major cases performed by each resident during the first 4 months of the pandemic. Results: A total of 1368 case logs were analyzed. There was a 33.5% reduction in total major cases performed in March to June 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019 (45.0 [95% CI, 36.1-53.9] vs 67.7 [95% CI, 62.0-72.2];P &lt; .001), which significantly affected every PGY. All case types were significantly reduced in 2020 except liver, pancreas, small intestine, and trauma cases. There was a 10.2% reduction in operative volume during the 2019-2020 academic year compared with the 2 previous years (192.3 [95% CI, 178.5-206.1] vs 213.8 [95% CI, 203.6-223.9];P &lt; .001). Level 1 trauma centers (49.5 vs 68.5;27.7%) had a significantly lower reduction in case volume than non-level 1 trauma centers (33.9 vs 63.0;46%) (P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of operative logs of general surgery residents in 16 US programs from 2017 to 2020, the first 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significant reduction in operative experience, which affected every PGY and most case types. Level 1 trauma centers were less affected than non-level 1 centers. If this trend continues, the effect on surgical training may be even more detrimental.","Purdy, A. C.; de Virgilio, C.; Kaji, A.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of RNF2 expression in SCC and adjacent tissues from patients. The protein and gene expression levels of RNF2 in SCC and adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot analysis and semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT) PCR. Single factor analysis was used to study the association between RNF2 expression level and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with SCC. Multifactor Cox survival analysis was used to examine the association between RNF2 expression and the overall survival rate of postoperative patients with SCC. The results from IHC staining demonstrated that the positive expression rate of RNF2 was 84.68% (210/248) and 56.05% (139/248) in SCC and in adjacent tissues, respectively. Furthermore, results from western blot analysis demonstrated that RNF2 protein expression in SCC tissues was significantly higher compared with that in the adjacent tissues (P<0.05). The positive rate of RNF2 mRNA in SCC was 81.05% (201/248), which was significantly higher compared with that in the adjacent tissues 54.44% (135/248; P<0.05). Furthermore, RNF2 protein and gene expression levels were associated with tumor diameter, tumor stage, tumor metastasis and the degree of tumor differentiation in patients with SCC. Patients exhibiting higher RNF2 protein expression in SCC tissues had a significantly shorter disease-specific survival rate compared with patients with low RNF2 expression. In addition, RNF2 protein expression, tumor diameter, tumors site and tumor stage were independent factors affecting the overall survival rate of postoperative patients. High protein and gene expression levels of RNF2 in SCC tissues may be associated with the occurrence and development of SCC and prognosis of patients. The results form this study may serve the development of novel therapeutic options and diagnostic strategies for patients with SCC.","Ling, Bai; Yao, Ming; Li, Gongqi; Liu, Jun; Liu, Bin; Wang, Wei; Jiang, Bin",Oncol Lett,332,16

The use of long-term drug therapies for treatment is controversial, and the evidence to support positive outcomes is limited. Instead, guidelines recommend non-pharmacological sleep interventions for SD. Hand self-shiatsu (HSS) is a drug-free, pragmatic, easy-to-learn self-management technique that provides patients with an intervention they can actively control, thus contributing to feelings of self-efficacy. The objective of this work was to examine whether a prescribed HSS intervention would result in improved objectively and subjectively measured sleep. Methods: This was a non-randomized controlled study. Objective (actigraphy) measures and standardized self-report questionnaires were applied at baseline and at four and eight weeks post-intervention. Participants also completed a detailed sleep log. Results: No significant differences were found in the actigraphy sleep dimensions across the three measurement time points in either the intervention or the control group. With respect to the self-report measures, a significant change was detected for sleep disturbance (χ22 = 10 [n = 25], p = 0.007) for the intervention group, and 77% stated they would recommend HSS to others. A significant change in two self-report measures was noted in the control group, a potential artifact of the sub-optimal recruitment to this group imposed by the COVID-19 restrictions. Discussion: Although actigraphy data did not support the hypothesis, the self-report measures and qualitative information from participants’ end-of-study interviews indicated endorsement of HSS for the management of sleep difficulties and increased self-efficacy. © 2021 Izvestiya of Saratov University.

The study aimed to monitor in-depth the feasibility of the regulations and their impact on the well-being of residents, their visitors, and healthcare staff. DESIGN: Mixed-methods study in 5 of the 26 facilities; the facilities were affiliated to an academic network of nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: Visitors and healthcare professionals. INTERVENTION: Allowing visitors using local regulations based on national guidelines. MEASUREMENTS: Digital questionnaire, analyzing documentation such as infection prevention control protocols, attending meetings of COVID-19 crisis teams, in-depth telephone or in-person interviews with visitors and healthcare professionals, and on-site observations. RESULTS: National guidelines were translated with great variety into local care practice. Healthcare professionals agreed that reopening would increase the well-being of the residents and their loved ones. However, there were also great worries for increasing workload, increasing the risk of emotional exhaustion, and the risk of COVID-19 infections. Compliance with local regulations was generally satisfactory, but maintaining social distance and correctly wearing face masks appeared to be difficult. Care staff remained ambivalent for fear of infections. In general, allowing visitors was experienced as having a positive impact on the well-being of all stakeholders. Nevertheless, some residents with dementia showed negative effects. CONCLUSION: The complete lockdown of Dutch nursing homes had a substantial impact on the well-being of the residents. The reopening was welcomed by all stakeholders, but provided a high organizational workload as well as feelings of ambivalence among care staff. In the second wave, a more tailored approach is being implemented. However, facilities are sometimes still struggling to find the right balance between infection control and well-being.","Koopmans, Raymond T C M; Verbeek, Hilde; Bielderman, Annemiek; Janssen, Meriam M; Persoon, Anke; Lesman-Leegte, Ivonne; Sizoo, Eefje M; Hamers, Jan P H; Gerritsen, Debby L",Int Psychogeriatr,332,24

Research conducted during past epidemics found that pregnant women are more vulnerable psychologically. The aim of this study was to investigate antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms during this pandemic in Greece. METHODS: All women receiving routine antenatal care, during a three-month period, starting one week after the total lockdown in Greece, in a University department, were asked to fill in two questionnaires, the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: Overall, 505 women (93.3% of the eligible population) agreed to participate. The prevalence of antenatal depression (EPDS score&#8805;13) in the population of the study was 13.5%. Unplanned pregnancy (OR: 2.447; 95% CI: 1.235-4.846), smoking (OR: 2.268; 95% CI: 1.166-4.411) and antenatal anxiety (OR: 5.074; 95% CI: 2.898-8.883) increased the risk of antenatal depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. State (current)-anxiety affected 34.1% of the participants, whereas Trait (lifetime)-anxiety affected 15.8%. The State-anxiety score (median) was significantly higher than the Trait-anxiety (median) (41 vs. 36; p<0.001), revealing an increase in the levels of anxiety in the pandemic, while there was also a positive linear correlation between the two scales (rho=0.592; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased anxiety, but not depression levels of pregnant women in Greece. Population level interventions to address adverse effects on anxiety status in the initial phases of similar situations may be helpful in the future.","Tsakiridis, Ioannis; Dagklis, Themistoklis; Mamopoulos, Apostolos; Athanasiadis, Apostolos; Pearson, Rebecca; Papazisis, Georgios",J. perinat. med,332,29

However, there is a lack of studies on developmental toxicity of azithromycin. In this study, we observed the developmental toxicity of fetal liver induced by prenatal azithromycin exposure (PAE) in mice and explored the potential mechanism. Pregnant Kunming mice were intraperitoneally injected with azithromycin (37.5 and 150 mg/kg·d) from gestational day (GD) 9 to 18. After PAE, the bodyweight gain rates of pregnant mice and the birthweights of the offspring were decreased, and the liver morphology, development indexes and metabolic function were all altered in different degree in the PAE fetuses. Meanwhile, PAE decreased the fetal serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels and liver IGF1 signal pathway expression, accompanied by glucocorticoid receptor-CCAAT enhancer-binding protein &#945; (GR-C/EBP&#945;) signal enhancement. Furthermore, azithromycin disturbed hepatocyte differentiation, maturation and metabolic function via upregulating GR-C/EBP&#945; signal and reducing the expression and secretion levels of IGF1 in HepG2 cells. These changes could be reversed by GR siRNA or exogenous IGF1. These results indicated that PAE could cause fetal liver developmental toxicity in mice, and one of the main mechanisms was that azithromycin activated the GR-C/EBP&#945; signal, inhibited the IGF1 signal pathway, and then disturbed the hepatic proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and glycose and lipid metabolism.","Liu, Kexin; Wang, Guihua; Li, Li; Chen, Guanghui; Gong, Xiaohan; Zhang, Qi; Wang, Hui",Biochem Pharmacol,332,1

DESCRIPTION: The COVID-19 was first detected in China in December of 2019 and by March 2020 spread to the United States. As this virus has been associated with severe illness, it poses a threat to vulnerable populations-including pregnant women. The obstetric population already faces multiple barriers to receiving quality healthcare due to personal, environmental and economic barriers, now challenged with the additional risks of COVID-19 exposure and limited care in times much defined by social distancing. ASSESSMENT: The current prenatal care framework requires patients to attend multiple in-office prenatal visits that can exponentially multiply depending on maternal and fetal comorbidities. To decrease the rate of transmission of the COVID-19 and limit exposure to patients, providers in Hillsborough County, Florida (and nationwide) are rapidly transitioning to telehealth. The use of a virtual care model allows providers to reduce in-person visits and incorporate virtual visits into the schedule of prenatal care. CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, implementation of telehealth and telehealth have become crucial to ensure the safe and effective delivery of obstetric care. This implementation is one that will continue to require attention to planning, procedures and processes, and thoughtful evaluation to ensure the sustainability of telehealth and telehealth post COVID-19 pandemic.","Fryer, Kimberly; Delgado, Arlin; Foti, Tara; Reid, Chinyere N; Marshall, Jennifer",Matern Child Health J,332,16

As the commitment to promote a people-centred model of care for TB grows, the use of facility-based DOT has been questioned as issues of freedom, privacy, and human rights have been raised. The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown measures have fast-tracked the need to find alternative methods to provide treatment to people with TB. In this study, we present quantitative and qualitative findings from a global community-based survey on the challenges of administering facility-based DOT during a pandemic as well as potential alternatives. Our results found that decreased access to transportation, the fear of COVID-19, stigmatization due to overlapping symptoms, and punitive measures against quarantine violations have made it difficult for persons with TB to receive treatment at facilities, particularly in low-resource settings. Potential replacements included greater focus on community-based DOT, home delivery of treatment, multi-month dispensing, and video DOT strategies. Our study highlights the need for TB programs to re-evaluate their approach to providing treatment to people with TB, and that these changes must be made in consultation with people affected by TB and TB survivors to provide a true people-centred model of care.","Zimmer, Alexandra J.; Heitkamp, Petra Malar James Dantas Cintia O039; Brien, Kate Pandita Aakriti Waite Robyn C.",Journal of Clinical Tuberculosis and Other Mycobacterial Diseases,332,20

This social discrimination has contributed to delay in diagnosis and treatment. Also, it may increase the suffering of the patients leading to poor outcome of the illness. Stigma can be assessed with the use of a valid and reliable instrument developed and adapted to our culture. Our objective was to analyze the psychometric properties of COVID-19 Infection Stigma Scale (CISS) for measuring the social stigma among patients with COVID-19 in Egypt. A cross-sectional study that included 182 COVID-19 patients was carried out. The reliability, the convergent validity, and the external and internal consistency of the scale were measured. Factor analysis was used to exclude the weak items. RESULTS: The mean of the COVID-19 Infection Stigma Scale scores was 34.97±10.35 which was higher than 50% of the score. Absence of the floor and ceiling effects was observed. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for scale reliability ranged from 0.75 to 0.94 with 0.82 for the total score. The convergent validity coefficients ranged from 0.36 to 0.63. Test-retest validity Pearson’s correlation coefficients ranged from 0.72 to 0.92 with 0.89 for the total score. The split half correlation coefficient was 0.86, and the reliability coefficient was 0.92. Both were acceptable correlation coefficients for internal consistency of the scale. Factor analysis showed two factors had latent root greater than 1. The rotated component matrix of the 2 factors revealed that all questions had r value more than 0.30, which means that no need to exclude any of them. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the COVID-19 Infection Stigma Scale is a valid and reliable instrument for the Egyptian people.

To date, SARS-CoV-2 has infected up to 26 million people worldwide; yet, there is no clinically approved drug or vaccine available. Therefore, a rapid and coordinated effort to re-purpose clinically approved drugs that prevent or disrupt these critical entry pathways of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction with human ACE2, could potentially accelerate the identification and clinical advancement of prophylactic and/or treatment options against COVID-19, thus providing possible countermeasures against viral entry, pathogenesis and survival. Herein, we discovered that Ambroxol hydrochloride (AMB), and its progenitor, Bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH), both clinically approved drugs are potent effective modulators of the key interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2. We also found that both compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect at micromolar concentrations. Therefore, in addition to the known TMPRSS2 activity of BHH; we report for the first time that the BHH and AMB pharmacophore has the capacity to target and modulate yet another key protein-protein interaction essential for the two known SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways into host cells. Altogether, the potent efficacy, excellent safety and pharmacologic profile of both drugs along with their affordability and availability, makes them promising candidates for drug repurposing as possible prophylactic and/or treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Olaleye, Omonike A.; Kaur, Manvir; Onyenaka, Collins C.",bioRxiv,332,16

Therapeutic approaches need to be underpinned by sound biological rationale. We evaluated whether serum levels of a range of proposed coronavirus disease 2019 therapeutic targets discriminated between patients with mild or severe disease. DESIGN: A search of ClinicalTrials.gov identified coronavirus disease 2019 immunological drug targets. We subsequently conducted a retrospective observational cohort study investigating the association of serum biomarkers within the first 5 days of hospital admission relating to putative therapeutic biomarkers with illness severity and outcome. SETTING: University College London, a tertiary academic medical center in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were recruited, 44 (51%) with mild disease and 42 (49%) with severe disease. We measured levels of 10 cytokines/signaling proteins related to the most common therapeutic targets (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-α2a, interferon-β, interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, interleukin-6, interleukin-7, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-α), immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against either coronavirus disease 2019 spike protein or nucleocapsid protein, and neutralization titers of antibodies. Four-hundred seventy-seven randomized trials, including 168 different therapies against 83 different pathways, were identified. Six of the 10 markers (interleukin-6, interleukin-7, interleukin-8, interferon-α2a, interferon-β, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) discriminated between patients with mild and severe disease, although most were similar or only modestly raised above that seen in healthy volunteers. A similar proportion of patients with mild or severe disease had detectable spike protein or nucleocapsid protein immunoglobulin G antibodies with equivalent levels between groups. Neutralization titers were higher among patients with severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: Some therapeutic and prognostic biomarkers may be useful in identifying coronavirus disease 2019 patients who may benefit from specific immunomodulatory therapies, particularly interleukin-6. However, biomarker absolute values often did not discriminate between patients with mild and severe disease or death, implying that these immunomodulatory treatments may be of limited benefit.","Arulkumaran, Nishkantha; Snow, Timothy Arthur Chandos; Kulkarni, Adarsh; Brealey, David; Rickman, Hannah; Rees-Spear, Chloe; Spyer, Moira J.; Heaney, Judith; Garr, Edmund; Williams, Bryan; Cherepanov, Peter; Kassiotis, George; Lunn, Michael; Houlihan, Catherine; McCoy, Laura E.; Nastouli, Eleni; Singer, Mervyn",Crit Care Explor,332,21

We report a case of a patient that developed an acute aortoiliac thrombosis and acute limb ischemia despite high-dose VTE prophylaxis and was subsequently found to have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old male with coronary artery disease and diabetes was admitted to the intensive care unit for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from COVID-19 pneumonia. He was treated with Remdesivir, dexamethasone 6mg daily, and enoxaparin 30mg twice daily. On hospital day 5, he developed acute left lower extremity pain with sensory and motor loss and bilateral lower extremities became cold and pale. He had no palpable femoral or popliteal pulses and posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were not detected by doppler. A CTA demonstrated an acute, nearly occlusive thrombus at the level of the distal infrarenal aorta with extension to bilateral iliac and femoral arteries. The patient was taken emergently to the operating room and underwent percutaneous thrombectomy and left lower extremity fasciotomy. On further review, he was noted to have significant lymphocytosis (83% on admission), an unexpected finding for a patient with COVID-19. As a result, peripheral flow cytometry was performed and demonstrated CD5 positive B-cell leukemia. The patient eventually discharged to acute rehab after a 42-day hospitalization. DISCUSSION: Since the start of the pandemic, the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 have been a major research focus given the high incidence and associated increased risk of mortality. Most of the research has centered around VTE as the incidence among ICU patients with COVID-19 is estimated at 20-30%. The rate of AT is much less with an overall incidence between 2-4% and only 0.4% associated with acute limb ischemia. Our patient was at higher risk for thrombotic complications given his underlying but undiagnosed CLL. His lymphocytosis was striking, particularly because lymphopenia is the usual finding in patients with COVID-19, and further work up revealed the CLL diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombotic complications are common and carry a higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. While the rate of AT is much less compared with VTE, critical care practitioners must remain vigilant, particularly when patients are receiving mechanical ventilation and unable to report symptoms, and be mindful of other conditions, potentially undiagnosed, that may further predispose to thrombosis.

Understanding communities’ responses to the forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines is important. We applied the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with behavioral intention to receive self-financed or free COVID-19 vaccinations among Chinese factory workers who resumed work during the pandemic. We examined the effects of factors including sociodemographics, perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination, exposure to information about COVID-19 vaccination through social media, and COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by individuals and factories. METHODS: Participants were full-time employees 18 years or older who worked in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive a physical examination annually. Eligible workers attending six physical examination sites were invited to complete a survey on September 1-7, 2020. Out of 2653 eligible factory workers, 2053 (77.4%) completed the online survey. Multivariate two-level logistic regression models and ordinal logistic regression models were fitted.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged ≥17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5(th) to 14(th) March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score>5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Totally, near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3 ± 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%-16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0 ± 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6 ± 1.2h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years old, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep quality was common and there was a shorter sleep duration among returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Possible risk factors identified from this study can be of great importance in developing proper intervention for the targeted population to improve the sleep health during such public health emergency.","Yang, Yu; Zhu, Jian-fu; Yang, Shu-yue; Lin, Hai-jiang; Chen, Yue; Zhao, Qi; Fu, Chao-wei",Sleep Med,332,33

A descriptive, cross-sectional, self-reported study was conducted among 198 Saudi nursing students. Knowledge, attitude, and practice of hand hygiene were assessed using the WHO Hand Hygiene Knowledge Questionnaire for Health-Care Workers and its adopted scales. A regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of hand hygiene practice. The respondents demonstrated moderate knowledge of hand hygiene (mean 13.20 ± 2.80). The majority displayed a moderate attitude toward hand hygiene (52.1%), while only a few reported a poor attitude (13.1%). Approximately 68.7%, 29.8%, and 1.5% of the respondents reported moderate, good, and poor practice of hand hygiene, respectively. Having a good attitude toward hand hygiene, being male, being aware that hand hygiene is an effective intervention in preventing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), attendance at hand hygiene trainings and seminars, and being in the lower academic level of nursing education were identified as predictors of better hand hygiene practice. The importance of ensuring a positive attitude toward hand hygiene and improving awareness of hand hygiene is emphasized, as are educational interventions.

Therefore, we have started studying on the characteristics of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to know about the truth of infectious disease and our future. After detailed studies on the characteristics of the SIR model for the various parameter dependencies with respect to such as the outing restriction (lockdown) ratio and vaccination rate, we have finally noticed that the second term (isolation term) in the differential equation of the number of the infected is quite similar to the ""helium ash particle loss term"" in deuterium-tritium (D-T) nuclear fusion. Based on this analogy, we have found that isolation of the infected is not actively controlled in the SIR model. Then we introduce the isolation control time parameter q and have studied its effect on this pandemic. Required isolation time to terminate the COVID-19 can be estimated by this proposed method. To show this isolation control effect, we choose Tokyo for the model calculation because of high population density. We determine the reproduction number and the isolation ratio in the initial uncontrolled phase, and then the future number of the infected is estimated under various conditions. If the confirmed case can be isolated in 3~8 days by widely performed testing, this pandemic could be suppressed without awaiting vaccination. If the mild outing restriction and vaccination are taken together, the isolation control time can be longer.

The majority of front-line medical staff suffered from adverse effects, but their real health status during COVID-19 epidemic was still unknown. The aim of the study was to explore the latent relationship of the physical and mental health of front-line medical staff during this special period. METHODS: A total of 115 military medical staff were recruited between February 17th and February 29th, 2020 and asked to complete questionnaires assessing socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, self-reported sleep status, fatigue, resilience and anxiety. RESULTS: 55 medical staff worked within Intensive Care and 60 worked in Non-intensive Care, the two groups were significantly different in general fatigue, physical fatigue and tenacity (P<0.05). Gender, duration working in Wuhan, current perceived stress level and health status had significant differences in fatigue scores (P<0.05), the current perceived health status (P<0.05) impacted on the resilience and anxiety of participants. The structural equation modeling analysis revealed resilience were negatively associated with fatigue (β=-0.52, P<0.01) and anxiety (β=-0.24, P<0.01), and fatigue had direct association with the physical burden (β=0.65, P<0.01); Fatigue mediated the relationship between resilience and anxiety (β=-0.305, P=0.039) as well as resilience and physical burden (β=-0.276, P=0.02). CONCLUSION: During an explosive pandemic, motivating the effect of protective resilience and taking tailored interventions against fatigue are promising ways to protect the physical and mental health of the front-line medical staff.","Wang, Jinyao; Li, Danhong; Bai, Xiumei; Cui, Jun; Yang, Lu; Mu, Xin; Yang, Rong",Eur J Integr Med,332,16

PURPOSE: To examine the vaccine-related beliefs and behaviors associated with likely hesitancy toward vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among nonelderly adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2020. Responses were sought from Tennessee adults 18 to 64 years of age who were not healthcare providers. The survey instrument focused on vaccine-related beliefs, prior and planned influenza and pneumococcal vaccine use, and attitudes toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. Inferential statistics assessed survey responses, and logistic regression determined predictors of the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 1,000 completed responses were analyzed (a 62.9% response rate), and respondents were mostly White (80.1%), insured (79.6%), and/or actively working (64.2%); the sample was well balanced by gender, age, income, and political leaning. Approximately one-third (34.4%) of respondents indicated some historical vaccine hesitancy, and only 21.4% indicated always getting a seasonal influenza vaccination. More than half (54.1%) indicated at least some hesitancy toward vaccination against COVID-19, with 32.1% citing lack of evidence of vaccine effectiveness as the leading reason. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was more likely among those with more moderate (odds ratio [OR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.749-3.607) or conservative (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.048-4.421) political leanings, Black Americans (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.182-2.742), and residents of nonmetropolitan areas (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.386-2.865). CONCLUSION: Subgroups of the population may prove more challenging to vaccinate against COVID-19, requiring targeted approaches to addressing hesitancy to ensure more-vulnerable populations are adequately covered.","Gatwood, Justin; McKnight, Madison; Fiscus, Michelle; Hohmeier, Kenneth C; Chisholm-Burns, Marie",Am J Health Syst Pharm,332,27

Thus, we aimed to develop a rapid viability RT-qPCR procedure to infer SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in clinical specimens and environmental samples. Methods: We screened monoazide dyes and platinum compounds as viability molecular markers on five SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets. A platinum chloride-based viability RT-qPCR was then optimized using genomic RNA, and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 particles inoculated in buffer, stool, and urine. Our results were finally validated in nasopharyngeal swabs from persons who tested positive for COVID-19 and in wastewater samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Findings: We established a rapid viability RT-qPCR that selectively detects potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in complex matrices. In particular, the confirmed positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs following the viability procedure suggests their potential infectivity, while the complete prevention of amplification in wastewater indicated either non-infectious particles or free RNA. Interpretation: The viability RT-qPCR approach provides a more accurate ascertainment of the infectious viruses detection and it may complement analyses to foster risk-based investigations for the prevention and control of new or re-occurring outbreaks with a broad application spectrum.

However, current evidence is inconclusive and the potential role of cancer or anti-neoplastic treatments in COVID19 course remains to be elucidated. Our results may indicate that due to differential immune cell profile of cancer patients who are treated with immunomodulatory agents the host response to the SARS-COV2 may lessen symptom severity. Delineating COVID-19 infection trends in asymptomatic healthcare workers as well as a cohort of cancer patients who are on active anti-cancer treatment will lend credence to tailor future healthcare policy in the next phases of the pandemic. ABSTRACT: Background: The risk of cancer patients to develop COVID19 infection is unclear. We aimed to prospectively study cancer patients and oncology healthcare workers for COVID19 serology. In IgG+ cases, immune profile was determined to portray the pattern of immune response to SARS-CoV2. Methods: Cancer patients on active treatment and healthcare workers were enrolled. During the study period (3/2020–6/2020), demographic data and blood were collected at three time points. Expression of IgG, IgM, and IgA were assessed. In SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ cases and matched negative cases, we performed mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) analysis on the basis of the expression of surface markers. Results: The study included 164 cancer patients on active intravenous treatment and 107 healthcare workers at the cancer center. No symptomatic cases were reported during the study period. Serology analysis revealed four IgG+ patients (2.4%) and two IgG+ healthcare workers (1.9%)—all were asymptomatic. CyTOF analysis demonstrated substantial reduction in myeloid cells in healthcare workers who were SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ compared to those who were SARS-CoV-2 IgG-, whereas in cancer patients, the reduction was relatively milder (≈50% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ cancer patients compared with ≈90% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ workers). Conclusion: Our results indicate a similar rate of asymptomatic COVID19 infection in cancer patients and healthcare workers in a longitudinal study throughout the pandemic time. Due to differential immune cell profiles of cancer patients who are treated with immunomodulatory agents, the host response to the SARS-COV2 may play a role in COVID19 course and representation. The immunological perspective of cancer treatments on the risk for COVID19 infection should be further explored.","Goshen-Lago, Tal; Szwarcwort-Cohen, Moran; Benguigui, Madeleine; Almog, Ronit; Turgeman, Ilit; Zaltzman, Nelly; Halberthal, Michael; Shaked, Yuval; Ben-Aharon, Irit",Cancers (Basel),332,20

We performed a genome-wide comparison between the adaptive evolution of R5 and X4 variants from HIV-1 subtypes B and C. The results showed that R5 and X4 variants experienced differential evolutionary patterns and different HIV-1 genes encountered various positive selection pressures, suggesting that complex selection pressures are driving HIV-1 evolution. Compared with other hypervariable regions of Gp120, significantly more positively selected sites were detected in the V3 region of subtype B X4 variants, V2 region of subtype B R5 variants, and V1 and V4 regions of subtype C X4 variants, indicating an association of positive selection with co-receptor recognition/binding. Intriguingly, a significantly higher proportion (33.3% and 55.6%, P<0.05) of positively selected sites were identified in the C3 region than other conserved regions of Gp120 in all the analyzed HIV-1 variants, indicating that the C3 region might be more important to HIV-1 adaptation than previously thought. Approximately half of the positively selected sites identified in the env gene were identical between R5 and X4 variants. There were three common positively selected sites (96, 113 and 281) identified in Gp41 of all X4 and R5 variants from subtypes B and C. These sites might not only suggest a functional importance in viral survival and adaptation, but also imply a potential cross-immunogenicity between HIV-1 R5 and X4 variants, which has important implications for AIDS vaccine development.","Zhang, ChiYu; Ding, Na; Chen, KePing; Yang, RongGe",Sci China Life Sci,332,6

This is integral to the maintenance of healthy lungs, which are free from infection and efficient at gaseous exchange. An important component of innate immunity for identifying viruses is the family of C-type collagen-containing lectins, also known as collectins. These secreted, soluble proteins are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including viral glycoproteins. These innate immune proteins are composed of trimerized units which oligomerise into higher-order structures and facilitate the clearance of viral pathogens through multiple mechanisms. Similarly, many viral surface proteins form trimeric configurations, despite not showing primary protein sequence similarities across the virus classes and families to which they belong. In this review, we discuss the role of the lung collectins, i.e., surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) in viral recognition. We focus particularly on the structural similarity and complementarity of these trimeric collectins with the trimeric viral fusion proteins with which, we hypothesise, they have elegantly co-evolved. Recombinant versions of these innate immune proteins may have therapeutic potential in a range of infectious and inflammatory lung diseases including anti-viral therapeutics.","Watson, Alastair; Phipps, Maximillian J.S.; Clark, Howard W.; Skylaris, Chris-Kriton; Madsen, Jens",J Innate Immun,332,3

SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenic microorganism liable for the recent COVID-19 outbreak, is extremely contagious in nature resulting in an unusual number of infections and death globally. The lack of clinically proven therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 has dragged the world’s healthcare system into the biggest challenge. Therefore, development of an efficient treatment scheme is now in great demand. Screening of different biologically active plant-based natural compounds could be a useful strategy for combating this pandemic. In the present research, a collection of 43 flavonoids of 7 different classes with previously recorded antiviral activity was evaluated via computational and bioinformatics tools for their impeding capacity against SARS-CoV-2. In silico drug likeness, pharmacophore and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) profile analysis of the finest ligands were carried out using DataWarrior, DruLiTo and admetSAR programs, respectively. Molecular docking was executed by AutoDock Vina, while molecular dynamics simulation of the target protein–ligand bound complexes was done using nanoscalable molecular dynamics and visual molecular dynamics software package. Finally, the molecular target analysis of the selected ligands within Homo sapiens was conducted with SwissTargetPredcition web server. RESULTS: Out of the forty-three flavonoids, luteolin and abyssinone II were found to develop successful docked complex within the binding sites of target proteins in terms of lowest binding free energy and inhibition constant. The root mean square deviation and root mean square fluctuation values of the docked complex displayed stable interaction and efficient binding between the ligands and target proteins. Both of the flavonoids were found to be safe for human use and possessed good drug likeness properties and target accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusively, the current study proposes that luteolin and abyssinone II might act as potential therapeutic candidates for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In vivo and in vitro experiments, however, should be taken under consideration to determine the efficiency and to demonstrate the mechanism of action.","Shawan, Mohammad Mahfuz Ali Khan; Halder, Sajal Kumar; Hasan, Md.

Our simulations discover a phenomenon that, with the fixed predictive controller parameters, the spreading dynamics become more and more stable when p decreases from a larger value to a smaller one, and the suitable controller parameters can effectively suppress the spreading behaviors even when p varies within the whole spectrum, and the unsuitable controller parameters can lead to oscillation when p lies within a certain range.","Bao, Z.J.; Jiang, Q.Y.; Yan, W.J.; Cao, Y.J.",Phys Lett A,332,1

Main funding source(s): BIOTRONIK SE & Co. KG ONBEHALF: BIO|STREAM.HF Background At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in spring 2020, governments around the world issued curfews and other stay at home orders (‘lockdown’) to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV19 virus. This may have forced people to decrease their physical activity. Physical inactivity as well as social stress is known to be especially deleterious for heart failure (HF) patients. The BIO|STREAM.HF study enrolled such HF patients into a prospective registry with Home Monitoring. PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the impact of the lockdown during the first Covid-19 pandemic wave on physical activity and arrhythmia burden of heart failure patients. METHODS: We analysed daily transmitted data of patients enrolled into a large international registry (BIO|STREAM.HF) being implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices. Patients with NYHA ≥ II and LVEF ≤ 40% before CRT implantation were selected. Intra-individual weekly mean and median values were calculated for the following daily transmitted parameters: physical activity (measured as % of the day during which the patient moves), atrial arrhythmia burden, mean heart rate (at rest), PP variability, PVC burden, and rate of biventricular pacing. Values were calculated for 12 weeks before and 12 weeks after the country-specific effective date of most rigorous restrictions in spring 2020 to visualize the general trend of parameter changes. Moreover, values for intra-individual changes between three 28-days periods (before, during, and after the lockdown) were calculated. RESULTS: Of 444 patients, 76% were male. They had a mean age of 69 ± 10 years and LVEF of 28.2 ± 6.7%. HF was of ischemic etiology in 42% of cases and they were in NYHA class II (47.5%), III (50.0%) or IV (2.5%). On average, patients were active for 9% of the day (2 h 10 min). The physical activity decreased by approx. 10% with the onset of the lockdown (figure 1) and recovered within the following eight weeks. Comparison of the 28-days periods before, during and after the lockdown showed a statistically significant intra-individual decrease in physical activity (mean decrease 9 min per day) during the lockdown compared to pre- and post-lockdown values and a trend toward reduced mean heart rates. In parallel, a significant increase in device detected atrial arrhythmia burden (mean increase 17 min per day) was observed. All other parameters did not change significantly. Conclusion Our results show that patients reduced their physical activity during the Covid-19 related lockdown in spring 2020. This was associated with an increase in atrial arrhythmia burden and a reduction of the mean heart rate. Prognostic implications of these results will further be analysed.","Schmitt, J; De Sousa, J; Bulava, A; Golovchiner, G; Hatala, R; Anguera, I; Reinke, F; Wenzel, B; Noelker, G",Europace,332,24

At 25/05/2020 Russia ranked third by the incidence of COVID-19 and the number of confirmed cases was 344,481 with 3,541(1%) deaths. Aim: To describe the epidemiological characteristics and survival of patients with hematological diseases (HD) and COVID-19. Patients: Between 20/04/2020-25/05/2020, all hospitalized patients at NRCH were tested for COVID-19 before hospitalization and with once-weekly follow-up (or in case of fever). Nasal swab samples were studied by RT-PCR. The study population included 46 patients (pts) with HD and confirmed SARS-CoV-2. All pts were observed at ten departments. 15 pts who shared the same wards (3-4 patients in one ward) at one department were infected. Ten infected pts resided in single-bed wards and 21 pts were observed at the outpatient department. All pts with positive SARS-CoV-2 were treated either in COVID-19-specialized centers (29 (63%) pts) or at home (17 (37%) pts). Results: The most common symptom at the onset of illness was fever (26 (57%) pts), the other pts were asymptomatic. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 27 pts. All 17 pts who were treated at home recovered. Out of 8 pts who required treatment at the ICU, 5 pts died. Thirty-eight pts were treated without ICU (1 pt died due to sudden death). As of 25/05/2020, 10 out of 29 pts were still hospitalized. Totally, 13 pts were discharged, and 6 pts died. Out of the 8 pts who were admitted to the ICU, 1 pt was still at the ICU, 1 pt was discharged and returned home, 1 pt was transferred to the general wards, and 5 pts died. Six (13%) of 46 pts required IMV; of them, 5 pts died and 1 pt still remains. Conclusion: In this single-center analysis of 46 pts with HD and confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 1-month OS was 82%, the median follow-up was 18 days, and mortality was 13%. Compared to the general population with COVID-19 in Russia, the mortality in patients with HD was higher (13% vs 1%) with the comparable median age (40 vs 45 years). The COVID-19 pandemic dictates new epidemiological conditions for the management of pts with HD: mandatory SARS-CoV-19 testing in all pts before hospitalization followed by weekly testing, treatment in single-room wards and compliance with strict epidemiological measures.","Gavrilina, Olga; Gaponova, Tatyana; Troitskaya, Vera; Parovichnikova, Elena; Galstyan, Gennadiy; Danishyan, Karen; Luchkin, Anton; Fidarova, Zalina; Tupoleva, Tatyana; Tikhomirov, Dmitriy; Sysoeva, Elena; Mangasarova, Yana; Zvonkov, Eugine; Gribanova, Elena; Anikin, Alexey; Julhakyan, Hunan; Sivakova, Olga; Mil'ko, Oleg; Efimov, Grigoriy; Boitsov, Sergey; Savchenko, Valeriy",Clinical Lymphoma Myeloma and Leukemia,332,33

Using routinely collected data, the use of CPAP as a supportive non-invasive ventilatory treatment is described in 35 patients with COVID infection. Patients given early CPAP and in particular within 48 hours of admission, are shown to have a better outcome (a significant probability of lower mortality) than patients who received late CPAP (more than 48 hours after admission). Although the analysis is affected by a small sample size, the results have shown good evidence that supports the early use of CPAP in patients with COVID-19 infection.","Ashish, A.; Unsworth, A.; Martindale, J.; Sundar, R.; Sedda, L.; Farrier, M.",,332,16

METHODS: We built an e-version Chinese and Western medication adherence scale based on the Wen-JuanXing platform. CKD subjects’ responses were applied to test the scale’s validity and internal consistency. We retested some of the participants two weeks later randomly. We also tested the clinical application. RESULTS: Of the 434 recruited patients, 228 responded. In exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy = 0.8 and Bartlett’s approx. Chi-Square = 1340.0 (df = 105, p < 0.001). We extracted four common factors which could explain 61.47% of the variance. However, Item 15 “Have you changed a traditional Chinese medicine prescription yourself within the past month?” had factor loading = 0.3 and measure of sampling adequacy (MSA) = 0.5, meaning we could not enter it into the factor analysis.
