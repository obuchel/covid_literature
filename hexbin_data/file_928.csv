114783,Identification of educational needs in the management of overweight and obesity: results of an international survey of attitudes and practice.,2015,"Automatic medical image segmentation plays an important role as a diagnostic aid in the identification of diseases and their treatment in clinical settings. Recently proposed models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their potential in image processing tasks, including some medical image analysis tasks. Those methods can learn various feature representations with numerous weight-shared convolutional kernels, however, the missed diagnosis rate of regions of interest (ROIs) is still high in medical image segmentation. Two crucial factors behind this shortcoming, which have been overlooked, are small ROIs from medical images and the limited context information from the existing network models. In order to reduce the missed diagnosis rate of ROIs from medical images, we propose a new segmentation framework which enhances the representative capability of small ROIs (particularly in deep layers) and explicitly learns global contextual dependencies in multi-scale feature spaces. In particular, the local features and their global dependencies from each feature space are adaptively aggregated based on both the spatial and the channel dimensions. Moreover, some visualization comparisons of the learned features from our framework further boost neural networks' interpretability. Experimental results show that, in comparison to some popular medical image segmentation and general image segmentation methods, our proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the liver tumor segmentation task with 91.18% Sensitivity, the COVID-19 lung infection segmentation task with 75.73% Sensitivity and the retinal vessel detection task with 82.68% Sensitivity. Moreover, it is possible to integrate (parts of) the proposed framework into most of the recently proposed Fully CNN-based architectures, in order to improve their effectiveness in medical image segmentation tasks.","Pang, Shuchao; Du, Anan; Yu, Zhenmei; Orgun, Mehmet A",Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2021.05.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34029714/,928
162370,The impact of the digital technological platforms on the institutional system of the higher education during the COVID 19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) has a significant incidence of long-term failure, which may require an alternative revisional bariatric procedure to remediate. Unfortunately, there is few data pinpointing which specific revisional procedure most effectively addresses failed gastric banding. Recently, it has been observed that laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a promising primary bariatric procedure; however, its use as a revisional procedure has been limited. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LSG performed concomitantly with removal of a poor-outcome LAGB. METHODS A retrospective review was performed on patients who underwent LAGB removal with concomitant LSG at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia between September 2007 and April 2012. Patient body mass index (BMI), percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), duration of operation, length of hospital stay, complications after LSG, and indications for revisional surgery were all reviewed and compared to those of patients who underwent LSG as a primary procedure. RESULTS Fifty-six patients (70 % female) underwent conversion of LAGB to LSG concomitantly, and 128 (66 % female) patients underwent primary LSG surgery. The revisional and primary LSG patients had similar preoperative ages (mean age 33.5 ± 10.7 vs. 33.6 ± 9.0 years, respectively; p = 0.43). However, revisional patients had a significantly lower BMI at the time of surgery (44.4 ± 7.0 kg/m(2) vs. 47.9 ± 8.2; p < 0.01). Absolute BMI postoperative reduction at 24 months was 14.33 points in the revision group and 18.98 points in the primary LSG group; similar %EWL was achieved by both groups at 24 months postoperatively (80.1 vs. 84.6 %). Complications appeared in two (5.5 %) revisional patients and in nine (7.0 %) primary LSG patients. No mortalities occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS Conversion of LAGB by means of concomitant LSG is a safe and efficient procedure and achieves similar outcomes as primary LSG surgery alone.","Alqahtani, Aayed R; Elahmedi, Mohamed; Alamri, Hussam; Mohammed, Rafiuddin; Darwish, Fatima; Ahmed, Ali M",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-013-0895-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23462858/,928
162443,Digital education facing COVID - 19 pandemic: Technological university experience,2021,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest and most pharmacologically targeted membrane protein family. Here, we used the visual receptor rhodopsin as an archetype for understanding the influences of membrane lipids on conformational changes involved in GPCR activation. Visual rhodopsin was recombined with lipids varying in their degree of acyl chain unsaturation and polar headgroup size using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero- and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerophospholipids with phosphocholine (PC) or phosphoethanolamine (PE) headgroups. The receptor activation profile following light excitation was measured using time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy. We discovered that more saturated POPC lipids back shifted the equilibrium to the inactive state, while the small-headgroup, highly unsaturated DOPE lipids favored formation of the active state. Increasing unsaturation or decreasing headgroup size have similar effects that combine to yield control of rhodopsin activation. Membrane effects persist even after electrostatic influences of charged groups at the membrane are taken into account, and necessitate the involvement of factors beyond changes in proteolipid solvation energy. Hence, we consider a balance of curvature free energy with hydrophobic matching and demonstrate how our data support a flexible surface model (FSM) of lipid-protein coupling interactions. The FSM is based on the Helfrich formulation of membrane bending energy as previously first applied to lipid-protein interactions. Membrane elasticity and curvature strain are induced by lateral pressure imbalances between the constituent lipids and drive key physiological processes at the membrane level. Spontaneous negative monolayer curvature towards water is mediated by unsaturated, small-headgroup lipids and couples directly to GPCR activation upon light absorption by rhodopsin. For the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrate this modulation in both the equilibrium and pre-equilibrium evolving states using a time-resolved approach.","Fried, Steven D E; Lewis, James W; Szundi, Istvan; Martinez-Mayorga, Karina; Mahalingam, Mohana; Vogel, Reiner; Kliger, David S; Brown, Michael F",Biophysical journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.11.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217383/,928

Responses regarding ‘general feelings of preparedness’ had a weak negative association with ‘feelings of frustration about one’s circumstance’ (r= -0.39, p<0.001). Weak negative associations were found between feelings of ‘access to adequate review materials’ and ‘overall stress levels’ (r= -0.31, p<0.001). A moderate positive association was found between ‘feelings of access to adequate review materials’ and ‘feeling on top of one’s work responsibilities’ (r= 0.40, p< 0.001).ConclusionsThe majority of respondents did not feel adequately prepared to care for patients with COVID-19 prior to deployment and had both high stress levels and fear of contracting COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Tauber, J.; Tingley, J.; Rabbanifar, S.; Bitners, A.; Shrivastava, A.; Skae, C.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1778,928
170618,Business Development in Latin American SMEs: A look at entrepreneurship before COVI-19,2021,"The type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which share use of an IL-4 receptor alpha chain and its nuclear induction of the transcription factor STAT6, are crucial in elicitation and maintenance of allergic conditions that include asthma. Prior work has shown a physical and functional association of STAT6 with PARP14, an ADP-ribosyl monotransferase. Moreover, elimination of all PARP14 expression by gene targeting led to altered recall antibody responses and attenuation of ovalbumin-specific allergic lung inflammation with no apparent health issues for mice lacking this protein. However, an unanswered question is whether or not inhibition of the catalytic function has any biological consequence since PARP14 has multiple functional domains apart from the portion that catalyzes ADP-ribosylation. As reported separately, iterative structural analyses and medicinal chemistry fostered the generation of a compound, RBN2759, that is highly selective in its inhibition of PARP14 with negligible impact on other members of the PARP gene family. We show here that administration of this compound to mice previously sensitized to the allergen Alternaria alternata achieved biochemically active levels and altered physiological responses to the antigen. These results show for the first time that in vivo administration of a specific inhibitor of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity encoded by PARP14 is sufficient to alter biological responses. Specifically, the orally absorbable pharmaceutical compound decreased allergen-induced mucus, blunted the induced increases in circulating IgE, and prevented suppression of IgG2a. We conclude that the catalytic activity can contribute to pathogenesis in allergic processes and propose that other biological endpoints that depend on ADP-ribosylation by PARP14 can be targeted using selective inhibition.","Eddie, Alex M.; Chen, Kevin; Schenkel, Laurie B.; Swinger, Kerren K.; Molina, Jennifer R.; Kunii, Kaiko; Raybuck, Ariel L.; Keilhack, Heike; Niepel, Mario; Peebles, R.

Myelination during infancy has been studied with histology, but postmortem data cannot evaluate the longitudinal trajectory of white matter development. Here, we obtained longitudinal diffusion MRI and quantitative MRI measures of R1 in 0, 3 and 6 months-old human infants, and (ii) developed an automated method to identify white matter bundles and quantify their properties in each infant’s brain. We find that R1 increases from newborns to 6-months-olds in all bundles. R1 development is nonuniform: there is faster development in white matter that is less mature in newborns, and along inferior-to-superior as well as anterior-to-posterior spatial gradients. As R1 is linearly related to myelin fraction in white matter bundles, these findings open new avenues to elucidate typical and atypical white matter myelination in early infancy, which has important implications for early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders.","Grotheer, Mareike; Rosenke, Mona; Wu, Hua; Kular, Holly; Querdasi, Francesca R.; Natu, Vaidehi; Yeatman, Jason D.; Grill-Spector, Kalanit",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.29.437583,928
178271,Modern telecommunication systems and messengers as the alternative didactic platforms after Covid-19 pandemic lockdown,2021,"Introduction. Immunomodulator Galavit® is a promising domestic drug for the prevention and treatment of various infectious diseases. Earlier, the authors have developed and investigated in vitro its new dosage form - transdermal therapeutic system (TTS). Positive results from experiments made it possible to proceed to the study of the pharmacokinetic parameters of Galavit® TTS in animals. Objective: to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of intramuscular and transdermal administration of immunomodulator Galavit® in animal experiments. Materials and methods. Sodium aminodihydrophthalazinedione was used as a substance in the form of a powder to prepare a solution for intramuscular administration of 100 mg (trade name Galavit®, manufacturer SELVIM LLC). The pharmacokinetics of transdermal and intramuscular injections were studied in male Chinchilla rabbits weighing 4.5-5.0 kg. Serum sodium aminodihydrophthalazinedione concentrations in animals were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using a specially developed technique. Results. In contrast to the injection method, a prolonged and uniform inflow of the drug substance (MP) into the body is observed for percutaneous administration of sodium aminodihydrophthalazinedione. The maximum serum Galavit® concentration for a 40 mg dose (0.172 ± 0.054 μg/mL) and for a 80 mg dose (1.16 ± 0.22 μg/mL) remained at a constant level for 9 and 8 hours, respectively. The relative bioavailability of the Galavit® transdermal therapeutic system was 0.65 and 1.06 for the same doses. Conclusion. Application of Galavit® 80 mg transdermal therapeutic system provides bioavailability that is similar to the intramuscular administration of this drug at the same dose. At the same time, its maximum serum concentration significantly decreases and the retention time of Galavit® in the body increases by more than 10 times, which can contribute to prolongation of the drug effect. Due to the current growing interest in the use of immunomodulator Galavit® for coronavirus infection COVID-19, the development and study of a new dosage form is a promising task.","Kuznetsova, E.

205620,"Fostering social resilience via online neighborhood social networks during the CoviD-19 pandemic and beyond: Status quo, design dilemmas and research opportunities",2021,"Prior research has shown that narrative coherence is associated with more positive emotional responses in the face of traumatic or stressful experiences. However, most of these studies only examined narrative coherence after the stressor had already occurred. Given the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 in March 2020 in Belgium and the presence of data obtained two years before (February 2018), we could use our baseline narrative coherence data to predict emotional well-being and perceived social support in the midst of the pandemic. In a sample of emerging adults (NT1 = 278, NT2 = 198), higher baseline coherence of narratives about positive autobiographical experiences predicted relative increases in emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the relation between the coherence of positive narratives and emotional well-being was partially mediated by perceived social support. These findings suggest that narrative coherence could be an enhancement factor for adaptive emotional coping with stressful situations, in part by evoking more supportive social reactions. This study demonstrates the importance of researching cognition (narrative coherence) and emotion (well-being) to shed light on pressing societal matters such as the global COVID-19 pandemic.","Vanaken, Lauranne; Bijttebier, Patricia; Fivush, Robyn; Hermans, Dirk",Cogn Emot,,928

The patches are connected through the mobility of individuals, and we assume that disease transmission and recovery are possible during travel. Moreover, the migration terms are assumed to depend on the distance between patches and the perceived severity of the disease. The positivity and boundedness of the model solutions are discussed. We analytically show the existence and global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium. We study three different network topologies numerically and find that underlying network structure is crucial for disease transmission. Further numerical simulations reveal that infection during travel has the potential to change the stability of disease-free equilibrium from stable to unstable. The coupling strength and transmission coefficients are also very crucial in disease propagation. Different exit screening scenarios indicate that the patch with the highest prevalence may have adverse effects but other patches will be benefited from exit screening. Furthermore, while studying the multi-strain dynamics, it is observed that two co-circulating strains will not persist simultaneously in the community but only one of the strains may persist in the long run. Transmission coefficients corresponding to the second strain are very crucial and show threshold like behavior with respect to the equilibrium density of the second strain.","Ghosh, Indrajit; Nadim, Sk Shahid; Raha, Soumyendu; Pal, Debnath",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02430v2.pdf,928

223178,Practice-Based Education in Engineering Addressing Real-business Problems amid the Covid-19 Crisis,2021,"Growing evidence suggests that ABO blood group may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with group O individuals less likely to test positive and group A conferring a higher susceptibility to infection and propensity to severe disease. The level of evidence supporting an association between ABO type and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 ranges from small observational studies, to genome-wide-association-analyses and country-level meta-regression analyses. ABO blood group antigens are oligosaccharides expressed on red cells and other tissues (notably endothelium). There are several hypotheses to explain the differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection by ABO type. For example, anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies (e.g. present in group O individuals) could bind to corresponding antigens on the viral envelope and contribute to viral neutralization, thereby preventing target cell infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus and SARS-CoV spike (S) proteins may be bound by anti-A isoagglutinins (e.g. present in group O and group B individuals), which may block interactions between virus and angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2-receptor, thereby preventing entry into lung epithelial cells. ABO type-associated variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 activity and levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII could also influence adverse outcomes, notably in group A individuals who express high VWF levels. In conclusion, group O may be associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and group A may be associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection along with severe disease. However, prospective and mechanistic studies are needed to verify several of the proposed associations. Based on the strength of available studies, there are insufficient data for guiding policy in this regard.","Goel, Ruchika; Bloch, Evan M; Pirenne, France; Al-Riyami, Arwa Z; Crowe, Elizabeth; Dau, Laetitia; Land, Kevin; Townsend, Mary; Jecko, Thachil; Rahimi-Levene, Naomi; Patidar, Gopal; Josephson, Cassandra D; Arora, Satyam; Vermeulen, Marion; Vrielink, Hans; Montemayor, Celina; Oreh, Adaeze; Hindawi, Salwa; van den Berg, Karin; Serrano, Katherine; So-Osman, Cynthia; Wood, Erica; Devine, Dana V; Spitalnik, Steven L",Vox sang,,928

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are tissue-resident macrophages located within the lung. They play a key role in the early phases of an immune response to respiratory viruses. AMs are likely the first immune cells to encounter SARS-CoV-2 during an infection, and their reaction to the virus will have a profound impact on the outcome of the infection. Interferons (IFNs) are antiviral cytokines and among the first cytokines produced upon viral infection. In this study, AMs from non-infectious donors are challenged with SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that challenged AMs are incapable of sensing SARS-CoV-2 and of producing an IFN response in contrast to other respiratory viruses, like influenza A virus and Sendai virus, which trigger a robust IFN response. The absence of IFN production in AMs upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 could explain the initial asymptotic phase observed during COVID-19 and argues against AMs being the sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines later during infection.","Dalskov, Louise; Møhlenberg, Michelle; Thyrsted, Jacob; Blay-Cadanet, Julia; Poulsen, Ebbe Toftgaard; Folkersen, Birgitte Holst; Skaarup, Søren Helbo; Olagnier, David; Reinert, Line; Enghild, Jan Johannes; Hoffmann, Hans Jürgen; Holm, Christian Kanstrup; Hartmann, Rune",EMBO Rep,,928

The R0 of COVID-19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases. The 30-day probable incidence and cumulative incidence were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis was done using 'earlyR' and 'projections' packages in R software. The maximum-likelihood value of R0 was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1-3.4) for the COVID-19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI 1.03-1.25) by the end of day 42. The expected average number of new cases in Shahroud was 9.0 ± 3.8 cases/day, which means an estimated total of 271 (95% CI: 178-383) new cases for the period between 02 April to 03 May 2020. By day 67 (27 April), the effective reproduction number (Rt), which had a descending trend and was around 1, reduced to 0.70. Based on the Rt for the last 21 days (days 46-67 of the epidemic), the prediction for 27 April to 26 May is a mean daily cases of 2.9 ± 2.0 with 87 (48-136) new cases. In order to maintain R below 1, we strongly recommend enforcing and continuing the current preventive measures, restricting travel and providing screening tests for a larger proportion of the population.","Khosravi, A; Chaman, R; Rohani-Rasaf, M; Zare, F; Mehravaran, S; Emamian, M H",Epidemiol Infect,,928

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the current evidence. METHODS: A search of published and preprint databases in all languages was performed. Included studies described &#8805;1 relevant clinical outcome for &#8805;5 patients who were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and were treated with antirheumatic disease therapy between January 1, 2019 and May 29, 2020. Pairs of reviewers screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. A meta-analysis of effect sizes using random-effects models was performed when possible. RESULTS: The search identified 3,935 articles, of which 45 were included (4 randomized controlled trials, 29 cohort studies, and 12 case series). All studies evaluated hospitalized patients, and 29 of the 45 studies had been published in a peer-reviewed journal. In a meta-analysis of 3 cohort studies with a low risk of bias, hydroxychloroquine use was not significantly associated with mortality (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 1.41 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.83, 2.42]). In a meta-analysis of 2 cohort studies with some concerns/higher risk of bias, anakinra use was associated with lower mortality (pooled HR 0.25 [95% CI 0.12, 0.52]). Evidence was inconclusive with regard to other antirheumatic disease therapies, and the majority of other studies had a high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, hydroxychloroquine use was not associated with benefit or harm regarding COVID-19 mortality.

In most laboratories antigens CD133+, CD34+, VEGFR-2+ (CD 309) or combination of these are used to identify EPCs. The process of EPCs mobilization and migration is controlled by molecular signals from immune cells located in the damage area. Stromal cell factor 1 (SDF-1), produced by the bone marrow and many other tissues, is an important chemoattractant for EPCs which express its receptors. The results of studies carried out in 2020 indicate that SARS-Cov-2 infects both hematopoietic stem cells, transforming into EPCs, and directly circulating EPCs, causing inflammatory and procoagulant reactions that complicate the COVID-19 course. There is no consensus on the mechanism of EPCs infection with coronavirus – directly through the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor or through an ACE2-independent mechanism. Today there is no effective therapy for COVID-19. The use of the EPCs regenerative potential, and the search for ways to enhance the EPCs mobilization from the depot, and increase their functional activity may become a promising approach to the prevention of severe complications and mortality from COVID-19. © 2021, Remedium Group Ltd.

Several thousand healthcare workers have already been infected, mainly in China. Preventing intra-hospital transmission of the communicable disease is therefore a priority. Based on the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, the strategies and measures to protect healthcare workers in an acute tertiary hospital are described along the domains of work task, technologies and tools, work environmental factors, and organizational conditions. The principle of zero occupational infection remains an achievable goal that all healthcare systems need to strive for in the face of a potential pandemic.","Hoe Gan, Wee; Wah Lim, John; Koh, David",,,928

The BOAST guidelines on outpatient orthopaedic fracture management took a pragmatic approach. At Great Western Hospital, Swindon, a closed loop audit was performed looking at a selection of these guidelines, to assess if our initial changes were sufficient and what could be improved. METHOD: An audit was designed around fracture immobilisation, type of initial fracture clinic assessment, default virtual follow up clinic and late imaging. Interventions were implemented and re-audited. RESULTS: Initially 223 patients were identified over 4 weeks. Of these, 100% had removable casts and 99% did not have late imaging. 96% of patients were initially assessed virtually or had initial orthopaedic approval to be seen in face to face clinic. 97% had virtual follow up or had documented reasons why not. The 26 patients who were initially seen face to face were put through a simulated virtual fracture clinic. 22 appointments and 13 Xray attendances could have been avoided. We implemented a change of requiring all patients to be assessed at consultant level before having a face to face appointment. The re-audit showed over 99% achievement in all areas. CONCLUSION: Virtual fracture clinics, both triaging new patients and follow-up clinics have dramatically changed our outpatient management, helping the most appropriate patients to be seen face to face. Despite their limitations, they have been well tolerated by patients and improved patient safety and treatment.","Dunkerley, Sarah; Kurar, Langhit; Butler, Katherine; James, Magnus; Lowdon, Ian",Injury,,928

The experiences that he recounts, especially his fruitful teaching partnership with the Very Reverend Dr. Kelly Brown Douglas - the inaugural dean of the Episcopal Divinity School at Union Theological Seminary and the Canon Theologian of Washington Cathedral - underscore the importance of conversation and dialogue. Garrett states that his task is to interrogate the six phases that he has outlined, from his perspective as a middle-aged white theologian who feels called upon to ""be awake, to pay attention, to look through new lenses, to see what really is as opposed to what we would like to or have been encouraged to see"" (p. 3). 3) Similarly, the white father in Guess Who's coming to dinner plays the conventional role of White Savior insofar as the plot revolves around gaining his approval for the marriage of his daughter to the black physician played by Sidney Poitier. 4) The opening soundtrack of Do the Right Thing, which runs throughout the credits, introduces the audience to its discursive and narrative space by juxtaposing Branford Marsalis's rendition of ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" with Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power"" and thereby sets up the conflict between two visions of race and progress. 5) Although Crash exhibits a ""casual multiculturalism"" it also points out the contradictions, for example, when a racist white man saves a young black woman whom he had earlier tried to rape. 6) Get Out subverts certain racist tropes, such as the myth of the ferocious black man, and the conventions of the horror genre, such as the haunted house.","Reinhartz, Adele",Journal of Religion and Film,,928

This article uses artificial intelligence-assisted medical imaging diagnosis as the research object, combines artificial intelligence and CT medical imaging diagnosis, introduces an intelligent COVID-19 detection system, and uses it to achieve COVID-19 disease screening and lesion evaluation. CT examination has the advantages of fast speed and high accuracy, which can provide a favorable basis for clinical diagnosis. This article collected 32 lung CT scan images of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Two professional radiologists analyzed the CT images using traditional imaging diagnostic methods and artificial intelligence-assisted imaging diagnostic methods, and the comparison showed the gap between the two methods. According to experiments, CT imaging diagnosis assisted by artificial intelligence only takes 0.744 min on average, which can save a lot of time and cost compared with the average time of 3.623 min for conventional diagnosis. In terms of comprehensive test accuracy, it can be concluded that the combination of artificial intelligence and imaging diagnosis has extremely high application value in COVID-19 diagnosis.","Zhang, Dandan; Liu, Xiaoya; Shao, Mingyue; Sun, Yaping; Lian, Qingyuan; Zhang, Hongmei",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,,928

Yet, the impact of the enforcement and subsequent loosening of these policies on the spread of COVID-19 is not well understood. Accordingly, we measure the impact of NPIs on mitigating disease spread by exploiting the spatio-temporal variations in policy measures across the 16 states of Germany. While this quasi-experiment does not allow for causal identification, each policy's effect on reducing disease spread provides meaningful insights. We adapt the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model for disease propagation to include data on daily confirmed cases, interstate movement, and social distancing. By combining the model with measures of policy contributions on mobility reduction, we forecast scenarios for relaxing various types of NPIs. Our model finds that in Germany policies that mandated contact restrictions (e.g., movement in public space limited to two persons or people co-living), closure of educational institutions (e.g., schools), and retail outlet closures are associated with the sharpest drops in movement within and across states. Contact restrictions appear to be most effective at lowering COVID-19 cases, while border closures appear to have only minimal effects at mitigating the spread of the disease, even though cross-border travel might have played a role in seeding the disease in the population. We believe that a deeper understanding of the policy effects on mitigating the spread of COVID-19 allows a more accurate forecast of disease spread when NPIs are partially loosened and gives policymakers better data for making informed decisions.","Aravindakshan, Ashwin; Boehnke, Jörn; Gholami, Ehsan; Nayak, Ashutosh",Sci Rep,,928
350326,"The vulnerability of COVID-19 pandemic based on urban density (a case study of the core urban area in Cirebon City, West Java)",2020,"BACKGROUND: CKD is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients is still poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 on hemodialysis patients. METHOD: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 66 hemodialysis patients. Nasopharyngeal swab PCR and serology for SARS-CoV-2, blood analysis, chest radiography, treatment, and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in 50 patients: 38 (76%) were PCR-positive and 12 (24%) were PCR-negative but developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. By contrast, 17% of PCR-positive patients failed to develop detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among PCR-positive patients, 5/38 (13%) were asymptomatic, while among PCR-negative patients 7/12 (58%) were asymptomatic (p = 0.005) for a total of 12/50 (24%) asymptomatic patients. No other differences were found between PCR-positive and PCR-negative patients. No differences in potential predisposing factors were found between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients except for a lower use of ACE inhibitors among asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic patients had laboratory evidence of milder disease such as higher lymphocyte counts and oxygen saturation and lower troponin I and interleukin-6 levels than symptomatic patients. Overall mortality was 7/50 (14%) and occurred only in symptomatic PCR-positive patients in whom mortality was 7/33 (21%). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common in hemodialysis patients, especially among patients with initial negative PCR that later seroconvert. Thus COVID-19 mortality in hemodialysis patients may be lower than previously estimated based on PCR tests alone.","Pizarro-Sánchez, Maria Soledad; Avello, Alejandro; Mas-Fontao, Sebastian; Stock da Cunha, Teresa; Goma-Garcés, Elena; Pereira, Mónica; Ortíz, Alberto; González-Parra, Emilio",Kidney Blood Press Res,,928

386635,A Portfolio Selection using Safety First Model for US Blue Chip and Top 30 Companies under NYSE list during COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: A more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, the variant of concern 202012/01 or lineage B.1.1.7, has emerged in the UK. We aimed to estimate the risk of critical care admission, mortality in patients who are critically ill, and overall mortality associated with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with non-B.1.1.7. We also compared clinical outcomes between these two groups. METHODS: For this observational cohort study, we linked large primary care (QResearch), national critical care (Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre Case Mix Programme), and national COVID-19 testing (Public Health England) databases. We used SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with S-gene molecular diagnostic assay failure (SGTF) as a proxy for the presence of lineage B.1.1.7. We extracted two cohorts from the data: the primary care cohort, comprising patients in primary care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 26, 2021, and known SGTF status; and the critical care cohort, comprising patients admitted for critical care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 27, 2021, and known SGTF status. We explored the associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection with and without lineage B.1.1.7 and admission to a critical care unit (CCU), 28-day mortality, and 28-day mortality following CCU admission. We used Royston-Parmar models adjusted for age, sex, geographical region, other sociodemographic factors (deprivation index, ethnicity, household housing category, and smoking status for the primary care cohort; and ethnicity, body-mass index, deprivation index, and dependency before admission to acute hospital for the CCU cohort), and comorbidities (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and hypertension for the primary care cohort; and cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, metastatic disease, and immunocompromised conditions for the CCU cohort). We reported information on types and duration of organ support for the B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 groups. FINDINGS: The primary care cohort included 198 420 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 117 926 (59·4%) had lineage B.1.1.7, 836 (0·4%) were admitted to CCU, and 899 (0·4%) died within 28 days. The critical care cohort included 4272 patients admitted to CCU. Of these, 2685 (62·8%) had lineage B.1.1.7 and 662 (15·5%) died at the end of critical care. In the primary care cohort, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 2·15 (95% CI 1·75-2·65) for CCU admission and 1·65 (1·36-2·01) for 28-day mortality for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with the non-B.1.1.7 group. The adjusted HR for mortality in critical care, estimated with the critical care cohort, was 0·91 (0·76-1·09) for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with those with non-B.1.1.7 infection. INTERPRETATION: Patients with lineage B.1.1.7 were at increased risk of CCU admission and 28-day mortality compared with patients with non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2. For patients receiving critical care, mortality appeared to be independent of virus strain. Our findings emphasise the importance of measures to control exposure to and infection with COVID-19.

Especially the neoliberal myth as the only way of human progress, and technological development as the essence of social progress and main reason for scientific research. Among the significant revelations is the dismantling of the Welfare state and public health services, which render the population's vulnerability in the face of pandemics. Planetary devastation favors its emergence, and the correlation between the despondency of human activities and the (fleeting) improvement of planetary life, which denotes the radical incompatibility between the permanence of neoliberal capitalism that degrades everything and preservation and care of life in its infinite diversity, including human life! Another notion of human progress is proposed: the rise of values involved in the coexistence, and the spiritual, intellectual, and moral growth of the human condition in harmony with the planetary ecosystem. Regarding the deep reasons for the catastrophe, it is argued that it is humanity itself by its way of being, thinking, acting, living together and relating to the planet. Therefore, the conclusion reached is the urgent need to undertake an alternative path in the search for another possible world, hospitable and dignifying for all forms of life.","Viniegra-Velázquez, Leonardo",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,928

414593,Risk Mitigation Measures for Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, an important pathogen for humans. There is an urgent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In Iran, the first case of the COVID-19 was reported after spread from China and other countries. Fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms of this virus. In worldwide, the incubation period of COVID-19 was 3 to 7 days and approximately 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. To mount an antiviral response, the innate immune system recognizes molecular structures that are produced by the invasion of the virus. COVID-19 infection induces IgG antibodies against N protein that can be detected by serum as early as day 4 after the onset of disease and with most patients seroconverting by day 14. Laboratory evidence of clinical patients showed that a specific T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 is important for the recognition and killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the main treatments are supportive. In this review, we investigated the innate and acquired immune responses in patients who recovered from COVID-19, which could inform the design of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapy for the future.","Rokni, Mohsen; Ghasemi, Vida; Tavakoli, Zahra",Rev Med Virol,,928
423412,Portfolio Selection on Airlines and Cruise Ship Industry during Pandemic,2021,"One of the challenges today is to face fake news (false information) in health due to its potential impact on people's lives. This article contributes to a new application of social impact in social media (SISM) methodology. This study focuses on the social impact of the research to identify what type of health information is false and what type of information is evidence of the social impact shared in social media. The analysis of social media includes Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. This analysis contributes to identifying how interactions in these forms of social media depend on the type of information shared. The results indicate that messages focused on fake health information are mostly aggressive, those based on evidence of social impact are respectful and transformative, and finally, deliberation contexts promoted in social media overcome false information about health. These results contribute to advancing knowledge in overcoming fake health-related news shared in social media.","Pulido, Cristina M; Ruiz-Eugenio, Laura; Redondo-Sama, Gisela; Villarejo-Carballido, Beatriz",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,928
424718,How to design the application of science in primary school during the Covid-19 pandemic?,2021,"PURPOSE: Due to the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) global pandemic, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) recommended that medical students be removed from contact with patients testing positive or patients under suspicion (PUIs) for COVID-19. As a result of Detroit being a highly affected area, the Wayne State University (WSU) medical students assigned to hospital clerkships during this time were essentially prevented from performing any direct patient care activities. A model for the Internal Medicine (IM) clerkship was developed incorporating a clinical telehealth component, in order to create a safe environment for students to continue to perform meaningful patient care. OBJECTIVES: To model a curriculum whereby students have a diverse patient care experience while increasing their skill and confidence in the performance of telehealth, as measured by self-report in a required pre- and post-clerkship assessment. Participant population: Twenty, third-year medical students at the end of their academic year, assigned to the IM clerkship at the Detroit Medical Center. METHODS: Students were instructed to complete the American College of Physicians (ACP) module on telehealth, given an orientation via the Zoom online platform by clinical faculty, and placed on a weekly telehealth clinic schedule, precepted by residents and attendings in IM. Survey data was collected covering students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes surrounding telehealth at the beginning of the rotation. A mid-clerkship feedback session was held with the clerkship director, and the resultant qualitative data was assessed for themes to be compared against the baseline assessment. Determination of incremental change between pre- and post-assessment reports will be evaluated at the completion of the clerkship, with that data forthcoming. RESULTS: Baseline survey revealed that 90% of students believed the telemedicine experience would be a valuable addition to their IM clerkship. Most were confident that, with training, they could effectively complete a telemedicine visit and 80% felt that telehealth would play an important role in their future careers. Students were pleased with the telemedicine visit logistics and with their role in actively assisting patients with the Zoom online platform. Despite initial anxiety over effectively communicating with patients prior to beginning the telemedicine experience, students demonstrated a common trend towards comfort with that aspect of the visit. Students were impressed with the amount of guidance given by resident and attending physicians in expressing empathy via a virtual platform. Overall, students were pleased with the variety of cases seen and the prompt feedback they received from resident and attending physicians after the telemedicine encounters. At the midpoint assessment, students expressed satisfaction with the overall experience and appreciated the opportunity to continue interacting with patients despite the limitations the pandemic imposed. CONCLUSIONS: Little is formally taught about telehealth in either medical school or medical residency, and integration into a formal curriculum is rare. The AAMC is underway with the development of competencies for telehealth, and, once released, the teaching of this format will become an expectation. We successfully developed a robust model in which medical students not only actively participated in, but also actively delivered, telehealth care to our patients.","Abraham, Heather N; Opara, Ijeoma N; Dwaihy, Renee L; Acuff, Candace; Brauer, Brittany; Nabaty, Renieh; Levine, Diane L",Cureus,,928

448871,A Census of Swedish Government Administrative Authority Employee Communications on Cybersecurity during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: To report and compare the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients on ECMO. METHODS: We performed an international retrospective study of COVID-19 patients on ECMO from 13 intensive care units from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Demographic data, ECMO characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was to assess the complication rate and 28-day mortality; the secondary outcome was to compare patient and ECMO characteristics between COVID-19 patients on ECMO and non-COVID-19 related ARDS patients on ECMO (non-COVID-19; January 1, 2018 until July 31, 2019). RESULTS: During the study period 71 COVID-19 patients received ECMO, mostly veno-venous, for a median duration of 13 days (IQR 7-20). ECMO was initiated at 5 days (IQR 3-10) following invasive mechanical ventilation. Median PaO2/FiO2 ratio prior to initiation of ECMO was similar in COVID-19 patients (58 mmHg [IQR 46-76]) and non-COVID-19 patients (53 mmHg [IQR 44-66]), the latter consisting of 48 patients. 28-day mortality was 37% in COVID-19 patients and 27% in non-COVID-19 patients. However, Kaplan-Meier curves showed that after a 100-day follow-up this non-significant difference resolves. Non-surviving COVID-19 patients were more acidotic prior to initiation ECMO, had a shorter ECMO run and fewer received muscle paralysis compared to survivors. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in outcomes were found between COVID-19 patients on ECMO and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients on ECMO. This suggests that ECMO could be considered as a supportive therapy in case of refractory respiratory failure in COVID-19.","Raasveld, Senta Jorinde; Delnoij, Thijs S R; Broman, Lars M; Lansink-Hartgring, Annemieke Oude; Hermans, Greet; De Troy, Erwin; Taccone, Fabio S; Diaz, Manuel Quintana; der Velde, Franciska van; Miranda, Dinis Dos Reis; Scholten, Erik; Vlaar, Alexander P J",J Intensive Care Med,,928

As we report below, this author presented consistent evidence associating C. doriaeto fruits of Ficus, a resource that may play a keystone role in tropical forests (Terbogh, 1986, Shanahan et al. 2001). However, very few data on the feeding habits of this bat have appeared in the literature and the feeding specialization reported by Taddei (1973, 1980) has been largely overviewed (Nowak 1994, Eisenberg & Redford 1999, Shanahan et al. 2001).","R.
