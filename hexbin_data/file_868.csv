64996,Epidemiological clinical profile of COVID-19 cases in a municipality of Northeast Brasil.,2020-05-01,"PURPOSE To retrospectively evaluate radiofrequency (RF) ablation of lung tumors performed via the transosseous approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve lung tumors (mean diameter, 1.0 cm; range, 0.4-1.6 cm) in 12 patients were treated by RF ablation via a transscapular and/or transrib route with the use of a bone biopsy needle under computed tomographic fluoroscopy guidance. Therapeutic outcomes evaluated included feasibility, safety, and local efficacy. Complications were assessed based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. RESULTS The transosseous route was successfully employed in all patients, and the electrode was successfully advanced into all tumors with this approach. The mean distance of penetrated bone was 0.57 cm (range, 0.19-1.16 cm). Complications occurred in eight RF ablation sessions, including six grade 1 events (two cases of pneumothorax and one case each of asymptomatic rib fracture 6 mo after treatment, neuralgia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and hemothorax), two grade 2 events (pneumonia and high fever), and one grade 3 event (pneumothorax requiring pleurodesis). No adverse events of grade ≥ 4 occurred. The mean and median tumor follow-up periods were 19.5 and 15.2 mo (range, 3.0-41.5 mo). Local progression occurred in two cases at 3 and 12 mo after treatment and was successfully treated with a second RF ablation procedure. The technique efficacy rates were 91.7% at 6 mo, 81.5% at 1 y, and 81.5% at 2 y. CONCLUSIONS The transosseous approach was feasible in computed tomographic fluoroscopy-guided RF ablation of select lung tumors when no other option was available.","Iguchi, Toshihiro; Hiraki, Takao; Ishii, Hiroaki; Gobara, Hideo; Fujiwara, Hiroyasu; Matsui, Yusuke; Kanazawa, Susumu",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2015.08.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26432461/,868

87447,Executive Summary: 2020 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations.,2020-10-20,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Nonhealing wounds are a significant problem in the healthcare system all over the world. The present review focuses on some recent developments and promising clinical progresses in wound management. RECENT FINDINGS New findings have increased our knowledge in several wound areas. In the treatment of wounds, the new trend in the wound device marked is to produce dressings containing compounds or drugs. This could be local antiseptics (silver, other antiseptics, honey) and pain relieving drugs such as ibuprofen and morphine. New treatments such as anti-tumor necrosis factor alfa (anti-TNFalpha) and Lactobacillus plantarum cultures have also been successfully used in hard to heal, atypical wounds. Knowledge on influencing factors as smoking and biofilm on the healing process has also been improved. Smoking results in delayed healing and increased risk of postoperative infection, whereas the role of biofilm is still at an exploratory level. Organizing models for optimal wound management are constantly being developed and refined. SUMMARY Recent knowledge on the importance of new dressing materials containing active substances, new treatments for atypical wounds, influencing factors on the healing process and organization in the wound area are increasingly been launched. This may in the coming years significantly improve the treatment outcome of problem wounds.","Gottrup, Finn; Jørgensen, Bo; Karlsmark, Tonny",Current opinion in supportive and palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1097/spc.0b013e328331d40c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19730105/,868

91478,Allocation of pharmaceutical resources in maternal and child healthcare institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020,"The effects of intravenous sedation with midazolam on the cerebral function of elderly patients with severe dementia are unclear. This study aimed to evaluate its effects on parameters such as brainwaves and cerebral blood flow (CBF) and compare them between elderly individuals with dementia and without cognitive impairment. Ten patients with severe dementia and 10 without cognitive impairment were registered. The bispectral index (BIS) and normalized tissue hemoglobin index (nTHI), which reflects CBF using near-infrared spectroscopy, were measured. Midazolam was administered until a Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score of 2 was reached. The chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and Friedman tests and multiple regression analysis were used for comparisons. Whereas a similar decline in BIS values was observed in both groups after midazolam administration (P < 0.018), there was a significant decrease by 9% in the nTHI of the dementia-positive group (P < 0.013). However, there was no significant difference in the nTHI between the dementia-positive and dementia-negative group according to the multiple regression analysis (P = 0.058). In the dementia-negative group, none of the measured values differed from the baseline values. In the dementia-positive group, sedation with midazolam resulted in a 9% decrease in the CBF.","Tatsuno, Yuichi; Morimoto, Yoshinari; Hayashi, Megumi; Iida, Takatoshi",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83122-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33574437/,868

This was part of a larger project to develop an International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Set for use in primary care. DESIGN A scoping review was conducted. Articles dealing with functioning in older adults were searched and assessed for eligibility. The study population included community-dwelling adults (≥75 years) without dementia, living in high-resource countries. Relevant concepts were extracted from assessment instruments and linked to the ICF using standardised linking rules. Finally, a frequency analysis was conducted. SETTING Home, primary care. PARTICIPANTS Community-dwelling adults aged 75 years and above. RESULTS From 5060 identified publications, 68 were included and 30 assessment instruments extracted. Overall, 1182 concepts were retrieved. Most were linked to the 'activities and participation' component. The most frequently identified categories were 'memory functions', 'dressing' and 'changing basic body position'. CONCLUSIONS This review provides a list of relevant ICF categories from the research perspective that will be used for developing an ICF Core Set for older primary care patients.

121555,The doctor-patient relationship in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-infected pneumonia (novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia [NCIP]) is a new viral illness initially identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. According to the daily report on the epidemic situation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) issued by the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China on March 23, 2020: COVID-19 is highly infectious, causing extremely high incidence of NCIP throughout Wuhan and has spread swiftly to 34 provinces within China and >100 other countries around the world between January and March 2020. Up to August 11, 2020, there have been 89,383 cases diagnosed as coronavirus-infected pneumonia; and 4,696 deaths in China (mortality rate of 5.25%) and worldwide reports have confirmed 19,936,210 cases and 732,499 deaths. These figures have been increasing daily. The treatment of viral conditions is well established within the context of Chinese Medicine. We report 2 successful cases in this study showing the patient's chest computed tomography scans and temperature charts made on before, during, and after treatment to demonstrate proof of the positive benefits achieved. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) demonstrates a positive effect in the treatment for COVID-19. It is highly recommended that TCM be incorporated early on in the treatment schedule for COVID-19.","Zheng, Zi Zhou; Ma, Ning Ning; Li, Lily; Jiang, Dan",Medical acupuncture,https://doi.org/10.1089/acu.2020.1432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33613817/,868
123625,Recommendations for radiotherapy during the novel coronavirus pandemic.,2020-03-01,"Growing evidence shows that a homozygous 6.7-kb deletion of the novel anti-inflammatory molecule leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor A3 (LILRA3) is associated with many autoimmune disorders. However, its effects on pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have not been clarified yet. LILRA3 is mainly expressed in monocytes, whereas its effects on biological behaviors of monocytes have not been systematically reported. To investigate the association between LILRA3 polymorphism and IBD susceptibility, LILRA3 polymorphism was assessed in 378 IBD patients and 509 healthy controls in our study, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were employed to detect the LILRA3 expression in IBD patient blood and intestinal samples. Human U937 monocyte cell line was employed to establish LILRA3-overexpressing cells and the effects of LILRA3 on the biological behaviors of U937 cells were systematically explored. Despite no association of the polymorphism with IBD development was found, LILRA3 expression was markedly increased in IBD patients compared with healthy controls. Overexpression of LILRA3 in monocytes led to significant decreases in secretion of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Additionally, LILRA3 abated monocyte migration by reducing the expression of several chemokines and enhanced monocyte phagocytosis by increasing CD36 expression. Furthermore, LILRA3 promoted monocyte proliferation through a combination of Akt and MEK/Erk signaling pathways. We report for the first time that LILRA3 is related to IBD and functions as an anti-inflammatory modulator in U937 cells.","Lan, Xiucai; Liu, Fenghua; Ma, Jiaming; Chang, Ying; Lan, Xiuhua; Xiang, Li; Shen, Xizhong; Zhou, Feng; Zhao, Qiu",Clinical and experimental immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006756/,868

In this study, we aimed to demonstrate its efficacy following a supraorbital approach for tumor resection. METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was conducted of eight patients (7 female, 1 male) with anterior cranial fossa meningiomas resected via a supraorbital approach followed by cranioplasty involving adjunctive or sole use of calcium phosphate cement. RESULTS Cranioplasty was achieved in all patients. No patient developed an incisional leak. The cohort had a mean follow-up of approximately 3.1 months (range: 0.5-7 months) in which time no further complications were noted. No patients developed post-surgical infections. CONCLUSION In our experience, a low incidence of infection or CSF leaks has been noted after the use of calcium phosphate cement retromastoid cranioplasty. Extending this technique to supraorbital craniotomies may minimize incisional CSF leak.","Feroze, Rafey A; Agarwal, Nitin; Sekula, Raymond F",The International journal of neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2018.1492573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29952679/,868

METHOD We reviewed the medical records of 3 patients who experienced TUS after RAKT and who underwent RATUR between 2017 and 2020. The patients' RAKT, post-transplant clinical course, endourological interventions, reoperation, and recovery were assessed. RESULTS All patients diagnosed with TUS presented with deterioration of kidney function after RAKT. Method of diagnosis included ultrasound, antegrade ureterogram, and CT scan. All 3 patients had a short (<1 cm) area of TUS and underwent RATUR. For 2 patients, distal strictures were bypassed with modified Lich-Gregoir ureteroneocystostomy reimplantation. One patient was treated with pyelo-ureterostomy to the contralateral native ureter. No intraoperative complications, conversions to open surgery, or significant operative blood loss requiring blood transfusion for any patient were observed. Also, no patients had urine leaks in the immediate or late postoperative period. After RATUR, 2 patients developed Clavien grade II complications with rectus hematoma or urinary tract infection. CONCLUSION RATUR is a technically feasible operation for kidney transplant patients with TUS after RAKT. This procedure may provide the same benefits of open operation without promoting certain comorbidities that may occur from open surgical procedures.","Malinzak, Lauren; McEvoy, Tracci; Denny, Jason; Kim, Dean; Stracke, Joel; Jeong, Wooju; Yoshida, Atsushi",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2021.05.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34058240/,868
139737,Beyond ventilatory support: challenges in general practice and in the treatment of critically Ill children and adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection.,2020-04-01,"One of the biggest challenges of public health worldwide is reducing the number of events and deaths related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a carboxypeptidase that degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7, has been identified as a potent receptor for SARSCoV-2. In the last decades, ACE inhibition has assumed a central role in reducing cardiovascular and renal events. However, with the advent of COVID-19, attention has been turned to ACE-2 as a possible target to reduce virus binding to different human cells. This review aims to discuss recent developments related to medicinal properties of natural compounds as ACE/ACE-2 inhibitors, which should be highlighted in the future development of studies looking for modulators in SARSCoV-2 infection. Data show that bioactive compounds isolated from several natural products act by inhibiting ACE/ACE2, which changes the entire axis of this system. Of the compounds addressed in this review, 7 phenolic compounds, including quercetin, curcumin, naringenin, luteolin, hesperidin, mangiferin, and gallic acid showed binding affinity with molecular ACE-2 target in silico, and 1, esculetin, decreased ACE-2 expression in vivo. Regarding terpenoids and alkaloids, nimbin, withaferin A, andrographolide, zingiberene and, berberine, piperine and thebaine, respectively, showed binding affinity with molecular ACE-2 target in silico. These findings reinforce the need for future preclinical and clinical studies on these compounds and specific inhibitory effects on ACE-2 of all the other compounds described herein only as nonspecific ACE inhibitors. It is important to mention that some natural compounds such as magnolol, resveratrol, rosmarinic acid, tanshinone IIA, and nicotine have also demonstrated the potential to increase the activity or expression of ACE-2, and could therefore aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Junior, Arquimedes Gasparotto; Tolouei, Sara Emília Lima; Dos Reis Lívero, Francislaine Aparecida; Gasparotto, Francielli; Boeing, Thaise; de Souza, Priscila",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612827666210114150607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33459225/,868

Nonetheless, there is paucity of research on paramedics.ObjectivesTo estimate the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression in frontline paramedics in the Athens region, Greece, and to investigate the coping skills that are associated with less favourable mental health outcomesMethodsA total of 100 ambulance paramedics participated in the study. The online questionnaire encompassed the DASS-21 for assessing mental health outcomes and the Brief-COPE for measuring coping skills. Information about socio-demographic characteristics and personal/relatives’ vulnerability to COVID-19 was also gleaned.ResultsThe prevalence for moderate to severe cases was found to be 7.2% for stress, 9.4% for anxiety and 11.3% for depression. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that men demonstrated significantly higher stress [B = -2.28, 95%CI = -3.88 - -0.68] and depression compared to women [B = -1.69, 95%CI = -3.19 - -0.19]. Similarly, the use of denial was found to be associated with higher stress [B = 0.69, 95%CI = 0.11 -1.37] and anxiety [B= 0.55, 95%CI = 0.13 – 0.98]. Moreover, emotional support was linked to heightened anxiety [B= 0.71, 95%CI = 0.36 – 1.06] and self-distraction to depression [B = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.16 – 1.04]. Personal or relatives’ vulnerability to COVID-19 did not impinge on mental health outcomes.ConclusionsHealthcare initiatives should be tailored at the mental health needs of frontline paramedics, especially men. Psychosocial interventions should target maladaptive coping, especially the use of denial.","Peppou, L.

185951,A Comprehensive Review of COVID-19 Associated Neurological Manifestations.,2020-12-01,"Corticosteriods (CSs) remain the standard of care for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP);however, many patients relapse after initial treatment, and long-term CS use is associated with considerable toxicity and tolerability issues (Provan et al. Blood 2010). Clinically, there is a need for a less toxic regimen that will provide sustained response. Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) currently approved in the United States for the treatment of ITP in patients who have had an insufficient response to CSs, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. Limited evidence from retrospective studies and the phase II ESTIT study (NCT02402998) suggests that earlier use of TPO-RAs after ITP diagnosis may allow a larger proportion of patients to achieve sustained responses after tapering off drug (Červinek et al. Int J Hematol 2015;Gonzalez-Lopez et al. Am J Hematol 2015;Newland et al. Br J Haematol 2016;Lucchini, et al. Haematologica 2019). TAPER (NCT03524612) is an ongoing phase II, open-label, prospective, single-arm study assessing sustained response off treatment in adult patients with ITP receiving eltrombopag, who had relapsed or failed to respond to initial CS treatment. Eligible patients are adults (≥ 18 years old) with ITP who are not responsive to or are in relapse after first-line CS therapy ± immunoglobulins used as rescue therapy, with platelet counts < 30×109/L, and assessed as needing treatment. Patients receive a starting dose of 50 mg eltrombopag QD (East/Southeast Asian ancestry: 25 mg QD;Japanese patients treated in Japan: 12.5 mg QD per approved starting dose in the Japanese prescribing information). The primary endpoint is the number (%) of patients with sustained responses off treatment by Month 12. Sustained response is defined as a complete response (platelet count ≥ 100×109/L) with platelet counts ≥ 70×109/L maintained for 2 months, followed by dose reduction and treatment discontinuation while maintaining platelet counts ≥ 30×109/L, without bleeding or rescue therapy, until Month 12. Platelet counts are assessed weekly during the first 8 weeks of treatment, and biweekly thereafter, depending on patient response. Rescue therapy is permitted within the first 14 days of study treatment and does not preclude patients from reaching the primary endpoint criteria, if successful discontinuation of eltrombopag is reached and maintained at Month 12. The proportion of patients who reach the primary endpoint will be summarized with the 95% confidence interval (Clopper-Pearson method). A binomial test for one proportion, H0: P = 0.15 vs. H1: P > 0.15 will be performed to test if the proportion of remission patients is greater than 15%, using a target alpha level of 0.05. Patients who meet the primary endpoint at 12 months will be followed up for an additional 12 months.Patients who relapse between Months 12 and 24 will be offered retreatment with eltrombopag until the end of Month 24. Secondary endpoints will include measures of quality of life, and exploratory endpoints will include biomarker assessments of immunomodulation. Here, we report an update on trial recruitment and patient baseline characteristic data from an early data cut (November 15, 2019). An estimated 101 patients across 50 sites will be enrolled;47 sites are currently active and 3 are pending site initiation visits. As of November 15, 2019, 66 patients had been screened, 53 of whom had been enrolled and had undergone treatment. Of the patients enrolled, 60.4% were female and the mean (± standard deviation) age was 49.4 (± 19.0) years. The majority of patients were White (88.7%). On June 24, 2020, patients from 15 countries worldwide were committed to screening (Figure 1);the number of patients screened had risen to 98, with 82 patients enrolled. The planned study timeline has been disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Enrollment is expected to complete in November 2020, with final results expected in 2023. Conclusion: The purpose of this trial is to assess sustained response off treatment following eltrombopag therap in patients with ITP who failed to respond to or have relapsed after initial treatment with steroids. The data generated by TAPER will provide insights into whether eltrombopag could be a viable treatment option after first-line steroid treatment. If this were confirmed, the earlier use of eltrombopag could have the potential to reduce the toxicity from repeated steroid exposure in patients with ITP.

There are considerable genetic diversities within coronaviruses due to their wide rang hosts and their special gene replication and transcription mechanisms. During this process, gene recombinations often occur, resulting in novel subtype or coronavirus emerge constantly. Of note are SARS-like-CoVs and novel HCoV-EMC identified in 2012. This minireview summarized major advances of recently identified coronaviruses, focusing on the genome structures and interspecies jumping mechanism of coronavirus.","Geng, He-Yuan; Tan, Wen-Jie",Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23547382/,868
188506,Adolescent Vaping and COVID-19: When an Epidemic Meets a Pandemic.,2021-02-01,"OBJECTIVE Human coronavirus (CoV)-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) was first isolated by Woo et al in Hong Kong. Several successive reports confirmed retrospectively that this new human coronavirus was circulating in different countries worldwide. However, the impact and the role of the emerging HCoV-HKU1 were not defined in children with ARTI. The objective of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 infection in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. METHOD Nasopharyngeal aspiration (NPA) samples were collected from 301 children with ARTI at the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Gansu Province, China, between November 2007 and October 2008. Demographic data and clinical findings of these children were collected at the same time. The informed consent was obtained from their parents. This study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics committee. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to screen HCoV-HKU1. Furthermore, other common respiratory viruses were screened in HCoV-HKU1 positive samples. All PCR positive products were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was conducted. RESULT The overall frequency of HCoV-HKU1 infection was 5.0% (15/301). The HCoV-HKU1 pol gene sequences shared a 95.8% - 99.6% nucleotide identity with the human coronavirus-HKU1 strain, whereas the amino acid identity was 90.7% - 99.3%. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the HCoV-HKU1 strain pol gene clustered with the HCoV-HKU1 strain N15 genotype B (no. DQ415911); 11 of 15 HCoV-HKU1 positive sample tested were mixed-infection. HCoV-HKU1 was detected only from November to April. Positive specimens peaked in November. Children with HCoV-HKU1 infection varied in age from 15 day to 12-years (median age, 10 months). The clinical diagnoses of HCoV-HKU1 positive patients included those with AURI and LURI. The clinical presentations of HCoV-HKU1 positive children included fever, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, vomiting; pharynx engorgement, crackles, and wheezing. The mean hospital stay of the 14 patients was 9.9 days. Six of 15 HCoV-HKU1 positive patients had an underlying illness, and they were all inpatients (hospital stay, mean, 11.2 days). There was no statistically significant difference in the detection rate between the two groups with and without underlying illnesses. CONCLUSION Human CoV-HKU1 infection exists in children with respiratory tract infections in Lanzhou region. A single HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating locally. The symptoms and clinical diagnoses of those infected with HCoV-HKU1 had no specificity as compared with patients with other common respiratory viruses infection.","Song, Jing-rong; Jin, Yu; Duan, Zhao-jun; Yuan, Xin-hui; Yan, Kun-long; Zhao, Yang; Xie, Zhi-ping; Gao, Han-chun",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21176481/,868

METHODS The clinical data of 20 children who were diagnosed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 20 to March 4, 2020 were analyzed. RESULTS Among the 20 children, there were 7 boys (35%) and 13 girls (65%), aged 8 months to 14 years (mean 8±5 years). All these children had no clinical manifestations and attended the hospital for an epidemiological history of SARS-CoV-2. Nineteen children were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nasopharyngeal swabs were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in all 20 children. There were 4 children (20%) of mild type, 16 children (80%) of common type, and no children of severe type or critical type. The mean peripheral blood leukocyte count was (6.8±3.5)×109/L, and 7 children had an abnormal peripheral blood leukocyte count, with an increase in 5 children and a reduction in 2 children. One child had a decreased absolute value of lymphocytes (0.87×109/L), 3 children had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20-42 mm/h), 7 children had an increased lactate dehydrogenase level (>400 U/L), and 4 children had an increased blood lactate level (>1.6 mmol/L). Chest CT showed single or multiple small nodule shadows, patchy shadows, and ground-glass shadows in the middle or lateral lobe of lungs or under the pleura in 13 children. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly occur with family aggregation. Most of the children with asymptomatic infection have no obvious abnormalities in blood routine and other laboratory tests. Changes in chest CT scan can be used as an aid for early diagnosis of asymptomatic infection in children.","Chen, Jun; Wang, Xian-Feng; Zhang, Pei-Fa",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434633/,868
194301,"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Needs: Assessing the COVID-19 Impact in Rural America.",2020-11-01,"We present a general analytical result for the probability that a newly introduced pathogen will evolve adaptations that allow it to maintain itself within any novel host population, as a function of disease life-history parameters. We demonstrate that this probability of ""evolutionary emergence"" depends on two key properties of the disease life history: (i) the basic reproduction number and (ii) the expected duration of an infection. These parameters encapsulate all of the relevant information and can be combined in a very simple expression, with estimates for the rates of adaptive mutation, to predict the probability of emergence for any novel pathogen. In general, diseases that initially have a large reproductive number and/or that cause relatively long infections are the most prone to evolutionary adaptation.","André, Jean-Baptiste; Day, Troy",Proceedings.

194415,Autoimmune Hepatitis Associated with COVID-19 Infection - A Diagnostic and Therapeutic Dilemma.,2020-11-01,"Curcumin is an active component of turmeric, which is derived from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is a natural compound extracted from liquorice. Both curcumin and GA are widely used as anticancer agents for treating many human cancers. In this study, curcumin and GA were used separately and in combination to treat human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells. MTT assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was carried out to measure cell apoptosis and determine cell cycle progression. Western blot analyses were applied to determine the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), B-cell associated X protein (Bax), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (Akt). The results showed that combined treatment with curcumin and GA resulted in a significant reduction in proliferation and an increase in apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest in HepG-2 cells. A xenograft tumour model showed that curcumin and GA suppressed HCC development in vivo. Moreover, by knocking down the expression of PTEN, we confirmed that curcumin and GA exert their anticancer effects by inhibiting the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Collectively, these results indicate that the combination of curcumin and GA could effectively inhibit the development of HepG2 cells by inhibiting PTEN/PI3K/Akt signalling and could be a promising treatment strategy for patients with HCC.","Chang, Mingxiang; Wu, Meimei; Li, Hanmin",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29312508/,868

As antigen for detection of SARS-CoV, the nucleocapsid protein (N) showed high sensitivity and strong reactivity with all samples from SARS-CoV patients and cross-reacted with all serum samples from healthy subjects, with either those obtained from China (10 samples) or those obtained from France (38 serum samples), giving then a significant rate of false positives. Specifically, our data indicated that the two subunits, S1 (residues 14 to 760) and S2 (residues 761 to 1190), resulted from the divided spike reacted with all samples from SARS-CoV patients and without any cross-reactivity with any of the healthy serum samples. Consequently, these data revealed the nonspecific nature of N protein in serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV compared with the S1 and S2, where the specificity is of 100%. Moreover, the reported results indicated that the use of one single protein as a detection antigen of SARS-CoV infection may lead to false-positive diagnosis. These may be rectified by using more than one protein for the serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV.","Maache, Mimoun; Komurian-Pradel, Florence; Rajoharison, Alain; Perret, Magali; Berland, Jean-Luc; Pouzol, Stéphane; Bagnaud, Audrey; Duverger, Blandine; Xu, Jianguo; Osuna, Antonio; Paranhos-Baccalà, Glaucia",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16522785/,868

METHODS:: A survey of a nationally representative sample of US adults (1629 respondents) revealed which emergency supplies and plans they had in place; their perceived level of preparedness and that of their local health care system; the likelihood of 7 terrorist and 4 naturally occurring events, whether they would evacuate their home; shelter in place at home and work; be quarantined, vaccinated, or take medication; and whether they believed that these actions would increase their chances for survival. RESULTS:: Having supplies was predicted by being male, older, wealthier, and white, living in the western United States, and being exposed to national news. Having plans was related to living in the western United States, having children, and being exposed to national news. Compliance was associated with being female and ill. Holding demographic factors constant, preparedness and compliance with government requests were associated with the perceived likelihood of a natural but not a terrorist event, the perceived efficacy of requested actions, and belief in one's local health care system. CONCLUSIONS:: A focus on natural as opposed to terrorist events and people's perceived efficacy of emergency actions and local health care systems may increase their preparedness and compliance with government requests.","Murphy, Sheila T; Cody, Michael; Frank, Lauren B; Glik, Deborah; Ang, Alfonso",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19590429/,868

However, recent weeks have seen the publication of the results of various studies into the effectiveness of treatment with HCQ and CQ in patients with COVID-19. On the basis of these results, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to consider HCQ and CQ as meaningful treatment options in patients with COVID-19.

257579,A Comprehensive Review of COVID-19 Associated Neurological Manifestations,2020,"In a prospective study, we sought to determine acceptability of linkage of administrative and clinical trial data among Canadian patients and Research Ethics Boards (REBs). The goal is to develop a more harmonized approach to data, with potential to improve clinical trial conduct through enhanced data quality collected at reduced cost and inconvenience for patients. On completion of the original LY.12 randomized clinical trial in lymphoma (NCT00078949), participants were invited to enrol in the Long-term Innovative Follow-up Extension (LIFE) component. Those consenting to do so provided comprehensive identifying information to facilitate linkage with their administrative data. We prospectively designed a global assessment of this innovative approach to clinical trial follow-up including rates of REB approval and patient consent. The pre-specified benchmark for patient acceptability was 80%. Of 16 REBs who reviewed the research protocol, 14 (89%) provided approval; two in Quebec declined due to small patient numbers. Of 140 patients invited to participate, 115 (82%, 95% CI 76 to 88%) from across 9 Canadian provinces provided consent and their full name, date of birth, health insurance number and postal code to facilitate linkage with their administrative data for long-term follow-up. Linkage of clinical trial and administrative data is feasible and acceptable. Further collaborative work including many stakeholders is required to develop an optimized secure approach to research. A more coordinated national approach to health data could facilitate more rapid testing and identification of new effective treatments across multiple jurisdictions and diseases from diabetes to COVID-19.","Hay, Annette E; Mittmann, Nicole; Crump, Michael; Cheung, Matthew C; Sleeth, Jessica; Needham, Judy; Broekhoven, Mike; Djurfeldt, Marina; Shepherd, Lois E; Meyer, Ralph M; Chen, Bingshu E; Pater, Joseph L",Curr Oncol,,868

We aimed to assess characteristics of journal articles, preprint articles, and registered trial protocols about COVID-19 and its causal agent SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We analyzed characteristics of journal articles with original data indexed by March 19, 2020, in World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 collection, articles published on preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv by April 3, 2010. Additionally, we assessed characteristics of clinical trials indexed in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) by April 7, 2020. RESULTS: Among the first 2118 articles on COVID-19 published in scholarly journals, 533 (25%) contained original data. The majority was published by authors from China (75%) and funded by Chinese sponsors (75%); a quarter was published in the Chinese language. Among 312 articles that self-reported study design, the most frequent were retrospective studies (N = 88; 28%) and case reports (N = 86; 28%), analyzing patients' characteristics (38%). Median Journal Impact Factor of journals where articles were published was 5.099. Among 1088 analyzed preprint articles, the majority came from authors affiliated in China (51%) and were funded by sources in China (46%). Less than half reported study design; the majority were modeling studies (62%), and analyzed transmission/risk/prevalence (43%). Of the 927 analyzed registered trials, the majority were interventional (58%). Half were already recruiting participants. The location for the conduct of the trial in the majority was China (N = 522; 63%). The median number of planned participants was 140 (range: 1 to 15,000,000). Registered intervention trials used highly heterogeneous primary outcomes and tested highly heterogeneous interventions; the most frequently studied interventions were hydroxychloroquine (N = 39; 7.2%) and chloroquine (N = 16; 3%). CONCLUSIONS: Early articles on COVID-19 were predominantly retrospective case reports and modeling studies. The diversity of outcomes used in intervention trial protocols indicates the urgent need for defining a core outcome set for COVID-19 research. Chinese scholars had a head start in reporting about the new disease, but publishing articles in Chinese may limit their global reach. Mapping publications with original data can help finding gaps that will help us respond better to the new public health emergency.","Fidahic, Mahir; Nujic, Danijela; Runjic, Renata; Civljak, Marta; Markotic, Filipa; Lovric Makaric, Zvjezdana; Puljak, Livia",BMC Med Res Methodol,,868

Thus, the purpose of this experiment is to develop and verify a tomato transpiration model by correcting the relationship between the transpiration rate and environmental factors by measuring the actual transpiration rate. The actual crop transpiration rate, which is measured using a load cell, and the weight changes calculated at 10-min intervals, are applied to the development of the transpiration model. The experimental results show that the transpiration rate has no linear relationship with the radiation amount (Rad) or vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The relationship between Rad and VPD with transpiration rate was fitted by the exponential rise to maximum, and gaussian peak curve, respectively. This allowed a transpiration model to be developed by compensating the Rad and VPD based on the existing Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation. The developed transpiration model showed higher regression constant values than the existing one. The developed transpiration model from the experiment can be utilized for precise irrigation control.","Jo, Won Jun; Shin, Jong Hwa",Plant Physiol Biochem,,868

Data regarding in-hospital mortality and its risk factors, as well as the impact of hospital overcrowding in Latin America has not been thoroughly explored. Methods and findings: In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled consecutive adult patients hospitalized with severe confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia at a SARS-CoV-2 referral center in Mexico City from February 26th, 2020, to June 5th, 2020. A total of 800 patients were admitted with confirmed diagnosis, mean age was 51.9 +or- 13.9 years, 61% were males, 85% were either obese or overweight, 30% had hypertension and 26% type 2 diabetes. From those 800, 559 recovered (69.9%) and 241 died (30.1%). Among survivors, 101 (18%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 458 (82%) were managed outside the intensive care unit (ICU);mortality in the ICU was 49%. From the non-survivors, 45.6% (n = 110) did not receive full support due to lack of ICU bed availability. Within this subgroup the main cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 95% of the cases, whereas among the non-survivors who received full (n = 105) support the main cause of death was septic shock (45%) followed by ARDS (29%). The main risk factors associated with in-hospital death were male sex (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.34-3.12), obesity (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.14-2.32)-in particular morbid obesity (RR 3.38, 95%CI 1.63-7.00) - and oxygen saturation < 80% on admission (RR 4.8, 95%CI 3.26-7.31). Conclusions: In this study we found similar in-hospital and ICU mortality, as well as risk factors for mortality, compared to previous reports. However, 45% of the patients who did not survive justified admission to ICU but did not receive IMV/ICU care due to the unavailability of ICU beds. Furthermore, mortality rate over time was mainly due to the availability of ICU beds, indirectly suggesting that overcrowding was one of the main factors that contributed to hospital mortality.","Olivas-Martinez, A.; Cardenas-Fragoso, J.

395277,"The Patient as COVID: The Destructive Bias of Politicized Science - Flashpoints, Obligations and the Burden of Coming Together",2020,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been proposed as treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) on the basis of in vitro activity and data from uncontrolled studies and small, randomized trials. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing a range of possible treatments with usual care in patients hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned 1561 patients to receive hydroxychloroquine and 3155 to receive usual care. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: The enrollment of patients in the hydroxychloroquine group was closed on June 5, 2020, after an interim analysis determined that there was a lack of efficacy. Death within 28 days occurred in 421 patients (27.0%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and in 790 (25.0%) in the usual-care group (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 1.23; P = 0.15). Consistent results were seen in all prespecified subgroups of patients. The results suggest that patients in the hydroxychloroquine group were less likely to be discharged from the hospital alive within 28 days than those in the usual-care group (59.6% vs. 62.9%; rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.98). Among the patients who were not undergoing mechanical ventilation at baseline, those in the hydroxychloroquine group had a higher frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (30.7% vs. 26.9%; risk ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.27). There was a small numerical excess of cardiac deaths (0.4 percentage points) but no difference in the incidence of new major cardiac arrhythmia among the patients who received hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19, those who received hydroxychloroquine did not have a lower incidence of death at 28 days than those who received usual care.

409310,The Constitutional Dimension of Emergency: How the Covid-19 Pandemic Is Increasing Inequalities,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Without a specific antiviral treatment or vaccine, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic, affecting over 200 countries worldwide. A better understanding of B- and T-cell immunity is critical to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A cohort of 129 patients with COVID-19 and 20 suspected cases were enrolled in this study, and a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) and a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (MCLIA) were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG detection. Additionally, 127 patients with COVID-19 were selected for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate B-cell immunity, and peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were quantified in 95 patients with COVID-19 to evaluate T-cell immunity. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of LFIA-IgM/IgG and MCLIA-IgM/IgG assays for detecting SARS-CoV infection were > 90%, comparable with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction detection. IgM antibody levels peaked on day 13 and began to fall on day 21, while IgG antibody levels peaked on day 17 and were maintained until tracking ended. Lymphocyte and subset enumeration suggested that lymphocytopenia occurred in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: LFIA-IgM/IgG and MCLIA-IgM/IgG assays can indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection, which elicits an antibody response. Lymphocytopenia occurs in patients with COVID-19, which possibly weakens the T-cell response.","Zhang, Li-Xia; Miao, Shu-Yan; Qin, Zhong-Hua; Wu, Jun-Pin; Chen, Huai-Yong; Sun, Hai-Bai; Xie, Yi; Du, Yan-Qing; Shen, Jun",Mol Diagn Ther,,868

It seems that economic relations are built within the framework of a particular ecosystem, and the scientific descriptive and predictive analytics are not sufficiently able to describe their nature and the main patterns of growth. In order to provide a theoretical and practical contribution to the developing ecosystem approach, the article presents an analytical model of the innovation ecosystem of a high-tech company, proposed for evaluating and comparing its level of development. Research methods include content analysis of scientific literature devoted to the study of innovative ecosystems and approaches to their assessment, system analysis and factor modeling. The research fundament is based on the dynamics of indicators of innovative development of the ecosystem of a large production company in the Sverdlovsk region for 2013-2019. The model was tested according to the indicators of 2018. Further directions of the research in the practical aspect will consist in a comparative analysis of other periods of the company's activity, as well as in the application and verification of the model on the indicators of other organizations. Justification of the possibilities of creating technologies for managing the innovation ecosystem is seen as a theoretical component of future research. © 2021 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","Popov, E.; Dolghenko, R.; Simonova, V.; Chelak, I.",E3S Web Conf.,,868

Today, the Covid-19 is a global issue, and the world economy can be interpreted as almost at the standstill. In this context, this study aims to discuss the potential first reactions of short and long term global economic impacts of the pandemic through sectors by assessing its costs according to the data announced for both the world and Turkey. In addition, this study tries to put forth possible economic and political scenarios for the post-pandemic world. Materials and methods: This is a review article that summarizes the current reports and discussions about the economic consequences of this historical event, and tries to make some inferences considering them. Results: This pandemic has severe adverse effects on the employees, customers, supply chains and financial markets, in brief, most probably it will cause a global economic recession. Nevertheless, due to the uncertainty of the end of this pandemic, both the length and scale of this contraction are not predictable. Conclusion: It takes a while for the world economy to recover from the contraction. It seems that this pandemic will lead to a permanent shift in the world and its politics, especially in health, security, trade, employment, agriculture, manufacturing goods production and science policies. Since this new world might provide great opportunities for some countries that did not dominate world production before, governments should develop new strategies to adjust the new world order without much delay.","Açikgöz, Ömer; Günay, Asli",Turk J Med Sci,,868
416110,Recommendations for radiotherapy during the novel coronavirus pandemic,2020,"The environmental impact caused by generation of plastic wastes at a global level is significant, during the last year, production of plastic increased by 40% due to the Covid-19 pandemic, demanding in an accelerated way the massive use of disposable personal protection elements. This situation has changed drastically the pattern of human behavior, introducing a lifestyle with greater hygiene that makes necessary to use plastic packaging to cover products, utensils, and food, avoiding any risk of transmission. To combat the massive use of plastic it is necessary to activate the transition towards circular economies that make use of environmentally friendly plastics;this is the case of biopolymers, materials that can be synthesized from organic waste rich in starch. Therefore, in this work, the factors that affect the hardness of polymers made from potato and plantain peels are studied through a factorial experimental design. The design establishes the combination of urea, glycerine, acetic acid, and water, to identify the best combination of plasticizer and their effect on the hardness of the material. Using Minitab, the multivariate linear models of hardness behavior were assessed to achieve the highest hardness values.","Castro, H. F.; Farfán, H. I.; Abril, I. V.; Paredes, R. A.; Roa, K.

422251,Reflections on the Post Sars-cov-19 Pandemic,2020,"AIM: COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several reports have provided conflicting recommendations regarding contact lenses (CL) use during COVID-19, causing confusion among CL wearers. The aim of this study is to assess CL wearers' attitudes toward CL wear and care during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional online survey was used to assess the participants' attitude toward CL wear and care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey layout was based on Google form® specifically developed for CL wearers. Demographic characteristics and CL history and profile were also collected for each participant. RESULTS: A total of 196 CL wearers completed the online survey with an average age was 26 (± 4.1) and 90.8 % of participants were females. As reported by the participants, social media was the main source of information about COVID-19. 38.8 % of the study population reported stopping CL wear during the pandemic. The main stated reason for lens discontinuation was decreased social activities during the pandemic. 61.2 % of participants continued lens wear, with the majority reported considerable changes in their behaviors toward CL wear and care during the pandemic. This includes reinforced hands cleaning before and after lens wear, disinfecting of CLs and CL case and less frequent CL aftercare visits. CONCLUSION: The majority of the study population have continued CL wear during the pandemic. Contact lens wearers reported profound changes in attitudes toward CL wear including improved care and maintenance. Additionally, changes in CL purchase habit have been reported with more tendency for online purchase. CL cessation has been associated with several perceived reasons mainly attributed to reduced outdoor activity and fear of ocular infection. Levels of compliance among CL wearers should be assessed and reinforced during the current pandemic and similar lockdown situation to reduce possible CL-related complications and dropout.","Bakkar, May M; Alzghoul, Eman A",Cont Lens Anterior Eye,,868

In particular, we propose a modification of the popular Black-Karasinski model, which is widely used by practitioners for modeling interest rates, credit, and commodities. Our adjustment gives rise to the stochastic Verhulst model, which is well-known in the population dynamics and epidemiology as a logistic model. We demonstrate that the Verhulst model's dynamics are well suited to the current economic environment and the Fed's actions. Besides, we derive new integral equations for the zero-coupon bond prices for both the BK and Verhulst models. For the BK model for small maturities up to 2 years, we solve the corresponding integral equation by using the reduced differential transform method. For the Verhulst integral equation, under some mild assumptions, we find the closed-form solution. Numerical examples show that computationally our approach is significantly more efficient than the standard finite difference method.","Itkin, A.; Lipton, A.; Muravey, D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11976v1.pdf,868

The mean age was 60.8 ± 10.8 years, and 71.9% (41/57) were male. We defined strongly suspected PE among 75.4% (43/57) of patients who had acute worsening of hypoxia and acute hypotension requiring pressors. The findings suggestive of PE included right ventricular (RV) strain in 15.8% (9/57), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in 7.0% (4/57), increased dead space ventilation (Vd) in 31.6% (18/57) of patients, respectively. RV strain and RV thrombus were present in 3.5% (2/57), RV strain and DVT in 5.3% (3/57), RV strain and increased Vd in 8.8% (5/57), and DVT and increased Vd in 3.5% (2/57) of patients. Chest CT Angiography was not performed in any of the patients. Following tPA infusion, 49.1% (28/57) of patients demonstrated improvement. Six patients (10.5%) survived to discharge, of whom 2 received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and were transferred to other facilities for lung transplant, 2 were discharged home, and 2 were discharged to a rehabilitation facility. However, overall mortality was 89.5%. The utility of tPA for critically ill patients with COVID-19 and presumed PE warrants further studies.","So, Matsuo; Steiger, David J; Takahashi, Mai; Egorova, Natalia N; Kuno, Toshiki",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,868
591194,"Deviations in criminal filings of child abuse and neglect during COVID-19 from forecasted models: An analysis of the state of Oklahoma, USA",2020-12-06,"BACKGROUND: Syndemics are characterized by the clustering of two or more health conditions, their adverse interaction, and contextual factors that create the conditions for clustering and/or interaction that worsens health outcomes. Studying syndemics entails drawing on diverse disciplines, including epidemiology and anthropology. This often means collaboration between researchers with different scholarly backgrounds, who share and – ideally – integrate their findings. OBJECTIVE: This article examines how context within syndemics has been defined and studied. METHODS: A literature review of empirical studies focusing on syndemics involving non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health conditions was conducted and the full text of 13 articles was analyzed. The review was followed-up with semi-structured interviews with 11 expert researchers working in the field. RESULTS: The review and interviews highlighted a relatively consistent definition of syndemics. The reviewed studies of NCD-related syndemics tended to focus on micro-level context, suggesting a need to analyze further underlying structural factors. In their syndemics research, respondents described working with other disciplines and, although there were some challenges, welcomed greater disciplinary diversity. Methodological gaps, including a lack of mixed methods and longitudinal studies, were identified, for which further interdisciplinary collaborations would be beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: NCD-related syndemics research would benefit from further analysis of structural factors and the interconnections between syndemic components across multiple levels, together with more ambitious research designs integrating quantitative and qualitative methods. Research on the COVID-19 pandemic can benefit from a syndemics approach, particularly to understand vulnerability and the unequal impacts of this public health crisis.","Pirrone, Irene; Dieleman, Marjolein; Reis, Ria; Pell, Christopher",Global health action,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34308786/; https://doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2021.1927332,868
641539,Adaptation for endoscopy of a ventilation mask using a glove finger like a filter: trying to reduce aerosols,2020-09-04,"INTRODUCTION: The appropriateness of using routinely collected laboratory data combined with administrative data for estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) is still being explored. This paper outlines a protocol to estimate influenza VE using linked laboratory and administrative data which could act as a companion to estimates derived from other methods. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use the test-negative design to estimate VE for each influenza type/subtype and season. Province-wide individual-level records of positive and negative influenza tests at the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health in Alberta will be linked, by unique personal health numbers, to administrative databases and vaccination records held at the Ministry of Health in Alberta to determine covariates and influenza vaccination status, respectively. Covariates of interests include age, sex, immunocompromising chronic conditions and healthcare setting. Cases will be defined based on an individual’s first positive influenza test during the season, and potential controls will be defined based on an individual’s first negative influenza test during the season. One control for each case will be randomly selected based on the week the specimen was collected. We will estimate VE using multivariable logistic regression. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Alberta’s Health Research Ethics Board—Health Panel under study ID Pro00075997. Results will be disseminated by public health officials in Alberta.","Scott, Allison Nicole; Buchan, Sarah A; Kwong, Jeffrey C; Drews, Steven J; Simmonds, Kimberley A; Svenson, Lawrence W",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575570/,868
658127,Physical activity for health and use of face masks in the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The biochemical properties of mouse LSECtin, a glycan-binding receptor that is a member of the C-type lectin family found on sinusoidal endothelial cells, have been investigated. The C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain of mouse LSECtin, expressed in bacteria, has been used in solid-phase binding assays, and a tetramerized form has been used to probe a glycan array. In spite of sequence differences near the glycan-binding sites, the mouse receptor closely mimics the properties of the human receptor, showing high affinity binding to glycans bearing terminal GlcNAcβ1-2Man motifs. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to confirm that residues near the binding site that differ between the human and the mouse proteins do not affect this binding specificity. Mouse and human LSECtin have been shown to bind Ebola virus glycoprotein with equivalent affinities, and the GlcNAcβ1-2Man disaccharide has been demonstrated to be an effective inhibitor of this interaction. These studies provide a basis for using mouse LSECtin, and knockout mice lacking this receptor, to model the biological properties of the human receptor.","Pipirou, Zoi; Powlesland, Alex S; Steffen, Imke; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Taylor, Maureen E; Drickamer, Kurt",Glycobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21257728/; https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwr008,868
683880,SORT maneuver: ease and safety for the practitioner and the patient,2020-11-30,"Changes in air transport networks over time may be induced by competition among carriers, changes in regulations on airline industry, and socioeconomic events such as terrorist attacks and epidemic outbreaks. Such network changes may reflect corporate strategies of each carrier. In the present study, we propose a framework for analyzing evolution patterns in temporal networks in discrete time from the viewpoint of recurrence. Recurrence implies that the network structure returns to one relatively close to that in the past. We applied the proposed methods to four major carriers in the US from 1987 to 2019. We found that the carriers were different in terms of the autocorrelation, strength of periodicity, and changes in these quantities across decades. We also found that the network structure of the individual carriers abruptly changes from time to time. Such a network change reflects changes in their operation at their hub airports rather than famous socioeconomic events that look closely related to airline industry. The proposed methods are expected to be useful for revealing, for example, evolution of airline alliances and responses to natural disasters or infectious diseases, as well as characterizing evolution of social, biological, and other networks over time.","Sugishita, Kashin; Masuda, Naoki",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750811/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84337-z,868
