309,Early Assessment of Anxiety and Behavioral Response to Novel Swine-Origin Influenza A(H1N1),2009-12-03,"BACKGROUND: Since late April, 2009, a novel influenza virus A (H1N1), generally referred to as the “swine flu,” has spread around the globe and infected hundreds of thousands of people. During the first few days after the initial outbreak in Mexico, extensive media coverage together with a high degree of uncertainty about the transmissibility and mortality rate associated with the virus caused widespread concern in the population. The spread of an infectious disease can be strongly influenced by behavioral changes (e.g., social distancing) during the early phase of an epidemic, but data on risk perception and behavioral response to a novel virus is usually collected with a substantial delay or after an epidemic has run its course. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the results from an online survey that gathered data (n = 6,249) about risk perception of the Influenza A(H1N1) outbreak during the first few days of widespread media coverage (April 28 - May 5, 2009). We find that after an initially high level of concern, levels of anxiety waned along with the perception of the virus as an immediate threat. Overall, our data provide evidence that emotional status mediates behavioral response. Intriguingly, principal component analysis revealed strong clustering of anxiety about swine flu, bird flu and terrorism. All three of these threats receive a great deal of media attention and their fundamental uncertainty is likely to generate an inordinate amount of fear vis-a-vis their actual threat. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that respondents' behavior varies in predictable ways. Of particular interest, we find that affective variables, such as self-reported anxiety over the epidemic, mediate the likelihood that respondents will engage in protective behavior. Understanding how protective behavior such as social distancing varies and the specific factors that mediate it may help with the design of epidemic control strategies.","Jones, James Holland; Salathé, Marcel",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2779851/,144
535,Wide Prevalence of Heterosubtypic Broadly Neutralizing Human Anti-Influenza A Antibodies,2011-04-01,"(See the editorial commentary by Donis and Cox, on pages 1010–1012.) Background. Lack of life-long immunity against influenza viruses represents a major global health care problem with profound medical and economic consequences. A greater understanding of the broad-spectrum “heterosubtypic” neutralizing human antibody (BnAb) response to influenza should bring us closer toward a universal influenza vaccine. Methods. Serum samples obtained from 77 volunteers in an H5N1 vaccine study were analyzed for cross-reactive antibodies (Abs) against both subtype hemagglutinins (HAs) and a highly conserved pocket on the HA stem of Group 1 viruses. Cross-reactive Abs in commercial intravenous immunoglobulin were affinity purified using H5-coupled beads followed by step-wise monoclonal antibody competition or acid elution. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to quantify cross-binding, and neutralization activity was determined with HA-pseudotyped viruses. Results. Prevaccination serum samples have detectable levels of heterosubtypic HA binding activity to both Group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses, including subtypes H5 and H7, respectively, to which study subjects had not been vaccinated. Two different populations of Broadly neutralizing Abs (BnAbs) were purified from intravenous immunoglobulin by H5 beads: ∼0.01% of total immunoglobulin G can bind to HAs from both Group 1 and 2 and neutralize H1N1 and H5N1 viruses; ∼0.001% is F10-like Abs directed against the HA stem pocket on Group 1 viruses. Conclusion. These data—to our knowledge, for the first time—quantitatively show the presence, albeit at low levels, of two populations of heterosubtypic BnAbs against influenza A in human serum. These observations warrant further investigation to determine their origin, host polymorphism(s) that may affect their expression levels and how to boost these BnAb responses by vaccination to reach sustainable protective levels.","Sui, Jianhua; Sheehan, Jared; Hwang, William C.; Bankston, Laurie A.; Burchett, Sandra K.; Huang, Chiung-Yu; Liddington, Robert C.; Beigel, John H.; Marasco, Wayne A.",Clinical Infectious Diseases,https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/52/8/1003/810545/cir121.pdf,144
667,Immunogenetic Factors Associated with Severe Respiratory Illness Caused by Zoonotic H1N1 and H5N1 Influenza Viruses,2011-11-03,"Following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and ongoing sporadic avian-to-human transmission of H5N1 viruses, an emphasis has been placed on better understanding the determinants and pathogenesis of severe influenza infections. Much of the current literature has focused on viral genetics and its impact on host immunity as well as novel risk factors for severe infection (particularly within the H1N1 pandemic). An understanding of the host genetic determinants of susceptibility and severe respiratory illness, however, is currently lacking. By better defining the role of genetic variability in influenza infection and identifying key polymorphisms that impair the host immune response or correlate with protection, we will be able to better identify at-risk populations and new targets for therapeutic interventions and vaccines. This paper will summarize known immunogenetic factors associated with susceptibility or severity of both pH1N1 and H5N1 infections and will also identify genetic pathways and polymorphisms of high relevance for future study.","Juno, Jennifer; Fowke, Keith R.; Keynan, Yoav",Clin Dev Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3216312/,144
870,UNC93B1 Mediates Innate Inflammation and Antiviral Defense in the Liver during Acute Murine Cytomegalovirus Infection,2012-06-18,"Antiviral defense in the liver during acute infection with the hepatotropic virus murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) involves complex cytokine and cellular interactions. However, the mechanism of viral sensing in the liver that promotes these cytokine and cellular responses has remained unclear. Studies here were undertaken to investigate the role of nucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in initiating antiviral immunity in the liver during infection with MCMV. We examined the host response of UNC93B1 mutant mice, which do not signal properly through TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9, to acute MCMV infection to determine whether liver antiviral defense depends on signaling through these molecules. Infection of UNC93B1 mutant mice revealed reduced production of systemic and liver proinflammatory cytokines including IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF-α when compared to wild-type. UNC93B1 deficiency also contributed to a transient hepatitis later in acute infection, evidenced by augmented liver pathology and elevated systemic alanine aminotransferase levels. Moreover, viral clearance was impaired in UNC93B1 mutant mice, despite intact virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the liver. Altogether, these results suggest a combined role for nucleic acid-sensing TLRs in promoting early liver antiviral defense during MCMV infection.","Crane, Meredith J.; Gaddi, Pamela J.; Salazar-Mather, Thais P.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3377622/,144

In conditions of lymphoid tissue depletion, the liver plays an important role in host defence against viruses. The changes in mice liver infected with HPAI H5N1 virus A/goose/Krasnoozerskoye/627/05 have been studied. It has been shown that the virus persistence in the liver leads to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) and intracellular proteases (lysozyme, cathepsin D, and myeloperoxidase) by Kupffer cells. Defective antiviral response exacerbates destructive processes in the liver accelerating the development of liver failure.","Potapova, Oxana V.; Sharkova, Tatyana V.; Shkurupiy, Vyacheslav A.; Shestopalov, Alexander M.",Clin Dev Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3886489/,144
1416,Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients: Factors Determining Progression to Lower Respiratory Tract Disease,2013-12-23,"Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) is a life-threatening complication in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Lymphopenia has been associated with an increased risk of progression from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) to LRD. Methods. This study retrospectively analyzed the significance of lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, lung function, smoking history, corticosteroids, antiviral treatment, viral subtypes, and RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies for the progression to LRD in 181 HCT recipients with RSV URI. Results. In multivariable models, smoking history, conditioning with high-dose total body irradiation, and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≤100/mm(3) at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with disease progression. No progression occurred in patients with ALCs of >1000/mm(3) at URI onset. Lymphocyte engraftment dynamics were similar in progressors and nonprogressors. Pre- and posttransplant donor and posttransplant recipient RSV subtype-specific neutralizing antibody levels, RSV viral subtypes, and corticosteroids also were not significantly associated with LRD progression. Conclusions. Host and transplant related factors appear to determine the risk of progression to LRD more than viral factors. Dysfunctional cell-mediated immunity appears to be important in the pathogenesis of progressive RSV disease after HCT. A characterization of RSV-specific T-cell immunity is warranted.","Kim, Yae-Jean; Guthrie, Katherine A.; Waghmare, Alpana; Walsh, Edward E.; Falsey, Ann R.; Kuypers, Jane; Cent, Anne; Englund, Janet A.; Boeckh, Michael",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/209/8/1195/13804446/jit832.pdf,144
1931,A Multiple Antigenic Peptide Mimicking Peptidoglycan Induced T Cell Responses to Protect Mice from Systemic Infection with Staphylococcus aureus,2015-08-28,"Due to the enormous capacity of Staphylococcus aureus to acquire antibiotic resistance, it becomes imperative to develop vaccines for decreasing the risk of its life-threatening infections. Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a conserved and major component of S. aureus cell wall. However, it has not been used as a vaccine candidate since it is a thymus-independent antigen. In this study, we synthesized a multiple antigenic peptide, named MAP27, which comprised four copies of a peptide that mimics the epitope of PGN. After immunization with MAP27 five times and boosting with heat-inactivated bacterium one time, anti-MAP27 serum bound directly to S. aureus or PGN. Immunization with MAP27 decreased the bacterial burden in organs of BALB/c mice and significantly prolonged their survival time after S. aureus lethal-challenge. The percentage of IFN-γ(+)CD3(+) T cells and IL-17(+)CD4(+) T cells in spleen, as well as the levels of IFN-γ, IL-17A/F and CCL3 in spleen and lung, significantly increased in the MAP27-immunized mice after infection. Moreover, in vitro incubation of heat-inactivated S. aureus with splenocytes isolated from MAP27-immunized mice stimulated the production of IFN-γ and IL-17A/F. Our findings demonstrated that MAP27, as a thymus-dependent antigen, is efficient at eliciting T cell-mediated responses to protect mice from S. aureus infection. This study sheds light on a possible strategy to design vaccines against S. aureus.","Wang, Xiang-Yu; Huang, Zhao-Xia; Chen, Yi-Guo; Lu, Xiao; Zhu, Ping; Wen, Kun; Fu, Ning; Liu, Bei-Yi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552945/,144
2094,Rhinoviruses and Respiratory Enteroviruses: Not as Simple as ABC,2016-01-11,"Rhinoviruses (RVs) and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs) are leading causes of upper respiratory tract infections and among the most frequent infectious agents in humans worldwide. Both are classified in the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family and they have been assigned to seven distinct species, RV-A, B, C and EV-A, B, C, D. As viral infections of public health significance, they represent an important financial burden on health systems worldwide. However, the lack of efficient antiviral treatment or vaccines against these highly prevalent pathogens prevents an effective management of RV-related diseases. Current advances in molecular diagnostic techniques have revealed the presence of RV in the lower respiratory tract and its role in lower airway diseases is increasingly reported. In addition to an established etiological role in the common cold, these viruses demonstrate an unexpected capacity to spread to other body sites under certain conditions. Some of these viruses have received particular attention recently, such as EV-D68 that caused a large outbreak of respiratory illness in 2014, respiratory EVs from species C, or viruses within the newly-discovered RV-C species. This review provides an update of the latest findings on clinical and fundamental aspects of RV and respiratory EV, including a summary of basic knowledge of their biology.","Royston, Léna; Tapparel, Caroline",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4728576/,144
2324,Influenza A (H10N7) Virus Causes Respiratory Tract Disease in Harbor Seals and Ferrets,2016-07-22,"Avian influenza viruses sporadically cross the species barrier to mammals, including humans, in which they may cause epidemic disease. Recently such an epidemic occurred due to the emergence of avian influenza virus of the subtype H10N7 (Seal/H10N7) in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). This epidemic caused high mortality in seals along the north-west coast of Europe and represented a potential risk for human health. To characterize the spectrum of lesions and to identify the target cells and viral distribution, findings in 16 harbor seals spontaneously infected with Seal/H10N7 are described. The seals had respiratory tract inflammation extending from the nasal cavity to bronchi associated with intralesional virus antigen in respiratory epithelial cells. Virus infection was restricted to the respiratory tract. The fatal outcome of the viral infection in seals was most likely caused by secondary bacterial infections. To investigate the pathogenic potential of H10N7 infection for humans, we inoculated the seal virus intratracheally into six ferrets and performed pathological and virological analyses at 3 and 7 days post inoculation. These experimentally inoculated ferrets displayed mild clinical signs, virus excretion from the pharynx and respiratory tract inflammation extending from bronchi to alveoli that was associated with virus antigen expression exclusively in the respiratory epithelium. Virus was isolated only from the respiratory tract. In conclusion, Seal/H10N7 infection in naturally infected harbor seals and experimentally infected ferrets shows that respiratory epithelial cells are the permissive cells for viral replication. Fatal outcome in seals was caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia similar to that in fatal human cases during influenza pandemics. Productive infection of ferrets indicates that seal/H10N7 may possess a zoonotic potential. This outbreak of LPAI from wild birds to seals demonstrates the risk of such occasions for mammals and thus humans.","van den Brand, Judith M.

2631,Nasopharyngeal Protein Biomarkers of Acute Respiratory Virus Infection,2017-02-21,"Infection of respiratory mucosa with viral pathogens triggers complex immunologic events in the affected host. We sought to characterize this response through proteomic analysis of nasopharyngeal lavage in human subjects experimentally challenged with influenza A/H3N2 or human rhinovirus, and to develop targeted assays measuring peptides involved in this host response allowing classification of acute respiratory virus infection. Unbiased proteomic discovery analysis identified 3285 peptides corresponding to 438 unique proteins, and revealed that infection with H3N2 induces significant alterations in protein expression. These include proteins involved in acute inflammatory response, innate immune response, and the complement cascade. These data provide insights into the nature of the biological response to viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, and the proteins that are dysregulated by viral infection form the basis of signature that accurately classifies the infected state. Verification of this signature using targeted mass spectrometry in independent cohorts of subjects challenged with influenza or rhinovirus demonstrates that it performs with high accuracy (0.8623 AUROC, 75% TPR, 97.46% TNR). With further development as a clinical diagnostic, this signature may have utility in rapid screening for emerging infections, avoidance of inappropriate antibacterial therapy, and more rapid implementation of appropriate therapeutic and public health strategies.","Burke, Thomas W.; Henao, Ricardo; Soderblom, Erik; Tsalik, Ephraim L.; Thompson, J.

2866,Dihydroberberine exhibits synergistic effects with sunitinib on NSCLC NCI‐H460 cells by repressing MAP kinase pathways and inflammatory mediators,2017-04-26,"Highly effective and attenuated dose schedules are good regimens for drug research and development. Combination chemotherapy is a good strategy in cancer therapy. We evaluated the antitumour effects of dihydroberberine combined with sunitinib (DCS) on the human non‐small cell lung cancer cell lines (NSCLC), A549, NCI‐H460, and NCI‐H1299 in vitro and in vivo. DCS showed synergic effects on NCI‐H460 cell proliferation, colony formation and transplantable tumour growth, which suggested dihydroberberine increases the sensitivity of lung carcinoma to sunitinib. Further studies indicated that DCS down‐regulated phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and NF‐κB in NCI‐H460 cells and tumours and suppressed the IκB and COX‐2 expression. In addition, DCS reduced the secretion of the pro‐inflammatory cytokine, interleukin‐1 (IL‐1), in tumours. Inhibition of p38 activation by DCS was a likely contributing factor in IL‐1 and COX‐2 down‐regulation. Consistent with these results, a genomewide microarray analysis found that DCS induced the expression of cell cycle signal molecules that are known to be affected by JNK and p38. The change of cell cycle, in turn, led to down‐regulation of JNK and p38, and further reduced IL‐1 secretion. Collectively, these findings highlight potential molecular mechanisms of DCS chemotherapeutic activity and suggest that DCS is an efficacious strategy in NSCLC therapy.","Dai, Bingling; Ma, Yujiao; Wang, Wenjie; Zhan, Yingzhuan; Zhang, Dongdong; Liu, Rui; Zhang, Yanmin",J Cell Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618684/,144

3111,A pilot study on primary cultures of human respiratory tract epithelial cells to predict patients’ responses to H7N9 infection,2018-02-20,"Avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infections frequently lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in humans. We aimed to investigate whether primary cultures of human respiratory tract epithelial cells are helpful to understand H7N9 virus pathogenesis and tissue tropism, and to evaluate how patient-related characteristics can affect the host's response to infection. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (isolated from two different donors) and primary epithelial cells (harvested from 27 patients undergoing airway surgery) were experimentally infected with H7N9 and/or H1N1pdm for 72 h. After virus infection, the culture media were collected for viral RNA quantitation and cytokine detection. Both H7N9 and H1N1pdm viruses replicated and induced a cytokine response differently for each donor in the normal human bronchial epithelial model. H7N9 replicated equivalently in epithelial cells harvested from the inferior turbinate and paranasal sinus, and those from the larynx and bronchus, at 72 h post-infection. Viral RNA quantity at 72 h was significantly higher in patients aged 21–64 years than in patients aged ≥ 65 years; however, no effects of sex, medical comorbidities, and obesity were noted. H7N9-infected cultured cells released multiple cytokines within 72 h. Levels of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α were associated differently with patient-related characteristics (such as age, sex, obesity, and medical comorbidities). In the era of precision medicine, these findings illustrate the potential utility of this primary culture approach to predict a host's response to H7N9 infection or to future infection by newly emerging viral infections, and to dissect viral pathogenesis.","Huang, Chung-Guei; Lee, Li-Ang; Wu, Yi-Cheng; Hsiao, Mei-Jen; Horng, Jim-Tong; Kuo, Rei-Lin; Huang, Chih-Heng; Lin, Ya-Chu; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Chen, Min-Chi; Chen, Tse-Ching; Shih, Shin-Ru",Oncotarget,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865685/,144
3477,Therapeutic potential of products derived from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells in pulmonary disease,2018-11-09,"Multipotent mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) possess robust self-renewal characteristics and the ability to differentiate into tissue-specific cells. Their therapeutic potential appears promising as evident from their efficacy in several animal models of pulmonary disorders as well as early-phase clinical trials of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Such therapeutic efficacy might be attributed to MSC-derived products (the “secretome”), namely conditioned media (CM) and extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have been shown to play pivotal roles in the regenerative function of MSCs. Importantly, the EVs secreted by MSCs can transfer a variety of bioactive factors to modulate the function of recipient cells via various mechanisms, including ligand-receptor interactions, direct membrane fusion, endocytosis, or phagocytosis. Herein, we review the current state-of-the-science of MSC-derived CM and EVs as potential therapeutic agents in lung diseases. We suggest that the MSC-derived secretome might be an appropriate therapeutic agent for treating aggressive pulmonary disorders because of biological and logistical advantages over live cell therapy. Nonetheless, further studies are warranted to elucidate the safety and efficacy of these components in combating pulmonary diseases.","Mohammadipoor, Arezoo; Antebi, Ben; Batchinsky, Andriy I.; Cancio, Leopoldo C.",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234778/,144
3597,Human adenovirus type 7 infection causes a more severe disease than type 3,2019-01-09,"BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus type 3 (HAdV-3) and 7 (HAdV-7) cause significant morbidity and develop severe complications and long-term pulmonary sequelae in children. However, epidemiologic reports have suggested that nearly all highly severe or fatal adenoviral diseases in children are associated with HAdV-7 rather than HAdV-3. Here, we conduct in-depth investigations to confirm and extend these findings through a comprehensive series of assays in vitro and in vivo as well as clinical correlates. METHODS: A total of 8248 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections in Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from June 2009 to May 2015. Among 289 samples that tested positive for HAdVs, clinical data of 258 cases of HAdV-3 (127) and HAdV-7 (131) infections were analyzed. All HAdV-positive samples were classified by sequencing the hexon and fiber genes, and compared with clinical data and virological assays. We also performed in vitro assays of virus quantification, viral growth kinetics, competitive fitness, cytotoxicity and C3a assay of the two strains. Mouse adenovirus model was used to evaluate acute inflammatory responses. RESULTS: Clinical characteristics revealed that HAdV-7 infection caused more severe pneumonia, toxic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, longer mean hospitalization, significantly lower white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, compared to those of HAdV-3. In cell culture, HAdV-7 replicated at a higher level than HAdV-3, and viral fitness showed significant differences as well. HAdV-7 also exhibited higher C3a production and cytotoxic effects, and HAdV-7-infected mice showed aggravated pathology and higher pulmonary virus loads, compared to HAdV-3-infected mice. Macrophages in BALF remained markedly high during infection, with concomitant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-6), compared HAdV-3 infection. CONCLUSIONS: These results document that HAdV-7 replicates more robustly than HAdV-3, and promotes an exacerbated cytokine response, causing a more severe airway inflammation. The findings merit further mechanistic studies that offer the pediatricians an informed decision to proceed with early diagnosis and treatment of HAdV-7 infection.","Fu, Yangxi; Tang, Zhengzhen; Ye, Zhixu; Mo, Shi; Tian, Xingui; Ni, Ke; Ren, Luo; Liu, Enmei; Zang, Na",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6327436/,144

4129,Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation in Children With Hematological Malignancies Using αβ(+) T-Cell Receptor and CD19(+) Cell Depleted Grafts: High CD56(dim)/CD56(bright) NK Cell Ratio Early Following Transplantation Is Associated With Lower Relapse Incidence and Better Outcome,2019-10-30,"We prospectively analyzed outcomes of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using αβ(+) T-cell receptor/CD19(+) depleted grafts. Sixty-three transplantations were performed in 60 patients. Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 27 patients were diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, and in eight other hematological malignancies were diagnosed. Twenty-three were in first complete remission (CR), 20 in second CR, 20 beyond second CR. Four patients developed graft failure. Median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 14 (range 9–25) and 10 days (range 7–30), respectively. The probability of non-relapse mortality (NRM) by day +100 after transplantation was 10 ± 4%. With a median follow-up of 28 months, the probability of relapse was 32 ± 6% and disease-free survival was 52 ± 6%. Immune reconstitution was leaded by NK cells. As such, a high CD56(dim/)CD56(bright) NK cell ratio early after transplantation was associated with better disease-free survival (DFS) (≥3.5; 77 ± 8% vs. <3.5; 28 ± 5%; p = 0.001) due to lower relapse incidence (≥3.5; 15 ± 7% vs. <3.5; 37 ± 9%; p = 0.04). T-cell reconstitution was delayed and associated with severe infections after transplant. Viral reactivation/disease and presence of venooclusive disease of liver in the non-caucasian population had a significant impact on NRM. αβ(+) T-cell receptor/CD19(+) cell-depleted haploidentical transplant is associated with good outcomes especially in patients in early phase of disease. A rapid expansion of “mature” natural killer cells early after transplantation resulted on lower probability of relapse, suggesting a graft vs. leukemia effect independent from graft-vs.-host reactions.","Diaz, Miguel A.; Zubicaray, Josune; Molina, Blanca; Abad, Lorea; Castillo, Ana; Sebastian, Elena; Galvez, Eva; Ruiz, Julia; Vicario, Jose Luis; Ramirez, Manuel; Sevilla, Julian; González-Vicent, Marta",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6831520/,144

4471,Chest Computed Tomography Abnormalities and Their Relationship to the Clinical Manifestation of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in a Genetically Confirmed Outbreak,2020-01-15,"Although combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved the health of millions of those living with HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Type 1), the penetration into the central nervous system (CNS) of many such therapies is limited, thereby resulting in residual neurocognitive impairment commonly referred to as NeuroHIV. Additionally, while cART has successfully suppressed peripheral viremia, cytotoxicity associated with the presence of viral Transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein in tissues such as the brain, remains a significant concern. Our previous study has demonstrated that both HIV-1 Tat as well as opiates such as morphine, can directly induce synaptic alterations via independent pathways. Herein, we demonstrate that exposure of astrocytes to HIV-1 protein Tat mediates the induction and release of extracellular vesicle (EV) microRNA-7 (miR-7) that is taken up by neurons, leading in turn, to downregulation of neuronal neuroligin 2 (NLGN2) and ultimately to synaptic alterations. More importantly, we report that these impairments could be reversed by pretreatment of neurons with a neurotrophic factor platelet-derived growth factor-CC (PDGF-CC).

6349,Activation of the Granzyme Pathway in Children With Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection,2008,"Major life-threatening complications following blood transfusion are rare and human error remains an important aetiological factor in many. The infectious risk from blood transfusion is predominantly hepatitis, and non-A, non-B and hepatitis C (HCV) are the most common subtypes noted. The risk of posttransfusion hepatitis (PTH) appears to be decreasing and this is attributed to both deferral of high-risk donors and more aggressive screening of donated blood. Screening for HCV is expected to decrease this risk further. The risk of HIV transmission following blood transfusion is negligibly small. There are data to suggest that perioperative blood transfusion results in suppression of the recipient’s immune system. Earlier recurrence of cancer and an increased incidence of postoperative infection have been associated with perioperative blood transfusion although the evidence is not persuasive. Microaggregate blood filters are not recommended for routine blood transfusion but do have a role in the prophylaxis of non-haemolytic febrile reactions caused by platelet and granulocyte debris in the donor blood. Patients should be advised when there is likely to be a requirement for perioperative blood transfusion and informed consent for transfusion should be obtained.","Crosby, Edward T.",Can J Anaesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100124/,144

In the post-partum period, his mother, who was from the Ukraine, had a respiratory arrest; unusually, a high-resolution computerised tomograph demonstrated miliary tuberculosis (TB). As a consequence, and due to the continuing ill health of the infant, gastric aspirates were sent from the infant. Acid fast bacilli were seen on microscopy. Variable nucleotide tandem repeat analysis of acid fast bacilli facilitated the rapid diagnosis of connatal TB. We conclude that connatal TB should be considered in a prematurely born infant poorly responsive to standard management and whose mother falls into a high-risk group.","Premkumar, Muraldihar; Anumakonda, Vikram; Cormican, Liam; Ruiz, Gary; Greenough, Anne",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101876/,144

7175,The First Identification and Retrospective Study of Severe Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome in Japan,2014-03-15,"BACKGROUND. The burden of severe human metapneumovirus (HMPV) respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in European children has not been clarified. We assessed HMPV in Norwegian children and compared hospitalization rates for HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS. We prospectively enrolled children (<16 years old) hospitalized with RTI and asymptomatic controls (2006–2015). Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were analyzed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for HMPV, RSV, and 17 other pathogens. We genotyped HMPV-positive samples and assessed shedding time in 32 HMPV-infected children. RESULTS. In children with RTI, HMPV was detected in 7.3% (267 of 3650) and RSV in 28.7% (1048 of 3650). Among controls, 2.1% (7 of 339) had low HMPV levels detected by PCR, but all were culture negative. HMPV primarily occurred from January to April and in regular epidemics. At least 2 HMPV subtypes occurred each season. The average annual hospitalization rates in children <5 years old with lower RTI were 1.9/1000 (HMPV) and 10.4/1000 (RSV). Among children with RTI, the median HMPV shedding time by PCR was 13 days (range, 6–28 days), but all were culture negative (noninfectious) after 13 days. CONCLUSIONS. HMPV appears in epidemics in Norwegian children, with a hospitalization rate 5 times lower than RSV. Low levels of HMPV are rarely detected in healthy children.","Moe, Nina; Stenseng, Inger Heimdal; Krokstad, Sidsel; Christensen, Andreas; Skanke, Lars Høsøien; Risnes, Kari Ravndal; Nordbø, Svein Arne; Døllner, Henrik",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107394/,144
7245,Life-threatening human metapneumovirus infections in West of Scotland,2007-05-18,"AIMS: To determine whether influenza can trigger heart attacks, we investigated the impact of influenza epidemics on autopsy-proven coronary deaths. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied weekly death due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and chronic ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in autopsies conducted in 1993 to 2000 in St Petersburg, Russia. We plotted the weekly acute respiratory disease (ARD) counts and influenza epidemics against AMI and chronic IHD deaths. There were 11 892 subjects dying of AMI and 23 000 subjects dying of chronic IHD. Median age was 75 for women and 65 for men. In every year, a peak of AMI and chronic IHD deaths were present and coincided with the influenza epidemic and peak ARD activity. A similar pattern was seen for each subgroup of men, women, subjects 50 years or older, and subjects 70 years or older. When comparing the average influenza epidemic weeks to average off-season weeks, the odds for AMI and chronic IHD death increased by 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08–1.56) and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.97–1.26), respectively. CONCLUSION: Influenza epidemics are associated with a rise in autopsy-confirmed coronary deaths. Influenza vaccination should be advocated for patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular events.","Madjid, Mohammad; Miller, Charles C.; Zarubaev, Vladimir V.; Marinich, Ivan G.; Kiselev, Oleg I.; Lobzin, Yury V.; Filippov, Alexander E.; Casscells, Samuel Ward",Eur Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108465/,144

The specifics of how and where they might be implemented have recently been reviewed in the literature. However, the background and concerns for selecting between the different available methods have so far not been adequately covered. Summary: Before using predictions systems, it is necessary to not only understand how the methods are constructed but also their strength and limitations. The prediction systems in humoral epitope discovery are still in their infancy, but have reached a reasonable level of predictive strength. In cellular immunology, MHC class I binding predictions are now very strong and cover most of the known HLA specificities. These systems work well for epitope discovery, and predictions of the MHC class I pathway have been further improved by integration with state-of-the-art prediction tools for proteasomal cleavage and TAP binding. By comparison, class II MHC binding predictions have not developed to a comparable accuracy level, but new tools have emerged that deliver significantly improved predictions not only in terms of accuracy, but also in MHC specificity coverage. Simulation systems and mathematical modeling are also now beginning to reach a level where these methods will be able to answer more complex immunological questions.

It is reported that the scanning transmission mode of operation, which can induce image contrast changes electronically, may enhance studies with unstained sections and perhaps facilitate thin section immune electron microscopy (IEM). The application of negative stain IEM has been particularly useful for the study of the antigenic nature of some of the newly discovered noncultivable viruses. Viral antigens can also be detected in thin sections of infected cells by IEM with suitably labeled specific antibodies. Confirmation of viral infection by electron microscopy on tissues originally processed for light microscopy is also frequently useful.","Field, Anne M.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131171/,144

All nuclear mRNAs acquire the same capped 39 nucleotide sequence at their 5′ end as a consequence of the trans-splicing event. Trans splicing is used in the synthesis of some mRNAs in nematodes and chloroplats.

9646,"I, 2. Physiology and pathophysiology of the gut in relation to viral diarrhea",2004-09-14,"NIOSH published a Federal Register Notice to explore the possibility of incorporating FDA required filtration tests for surgical masks (SMs) in the 42 CFR Part 84 respirator certification process. There have been no published studies comparing the filtration efficiency test methods used for NIOSH certification of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) with those used by the FDA for clearance of SMs. To address this issue, filtration efficiencies of “N95 FFRs” including six N95 FFR models and three surgical N95 FFR models, and three SM models were measured using the NIOSH NaCl aerosol test method, and FDA required particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) and bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) methods, and viral filtration efficiency (VFE) method. Five samples of each model were tested using each method. Both PFE and BFE tests were done using unneutralized particles as per FDA guidance document. PFE was measured using 0.1 µm size polystyrene latex particles and BFE with ∼3.0 µm size particles containing Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. VFE was obtained using ∼3.0 µm size particles containing phiX 174 as the challenge virus and Escherichia coli as the host. Results showed that the efficiencies measured by the NIOSH NaCl method for “N95 FFRs” were from 98.15–99.68% compared to 99.74–99.99% for PFE, 99.62–99.9% for BFE, and 99.8–99.9% for VFE methods. Efficiencies by the NIOSH NaCl method were significantly (p = <0.05) lower than the other methods. SMs showed lower efficiencies (54.72–88.40%) than “N95 FFRs” measured by the NIOSH NaCl method, while PFE, BFE, and VFE methods produced no significant difference. The above results show that the NIOSH NaCl method is relatively conservative and is able to identify poorly performing filtration devices. The higher efficiencies obtained using PFE, BFE and VFE methods show that adding these supplemental particle penetration methods will not improve respirator certification.","Rengasamy, Samy; Shaffer, Ronald; Williams, Brandon; Smit, Sarah",J Occup Environ Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157953/,144
9805,Respiratory virus infection triggers acute psoriasis flares across different clinical subtypes and genetic backgrounds,2019-08-20,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is generally considered to be an autoimmune disorder with myelin as the target and with several unidentified viruses playing ancillary roles, possibly through molecular mimicry. Although this paradigm has led to important progress on potential mechanisms of myelin loss, neither a target antigen in myelin nor a triggering mechanism has yet been identified, leaving the etiology of MS still unknown. Animal models of viral demyelination and studies showing that JC virus (JCV), the polyomavirus which causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), may be latent in some normal human brains suggest another possibility. A host immune response targeting proteins expressed at low levels from viral DNA latent in the central nervous system (CNS) might underlie a focal demyelinating disease such as MS. A shift from autoimmunity to a latent‐virus model is not a trivial substitution of target antigens. This shift would expand the search for a definitive laboratory test for MS and could lead to improved therapeutic and preventive approaches.","Stoner, Gerald L.",Brain Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161790/,144

HRV‐14 RNA probes and oligonucleotide probes representing conserved sequences in the 5′‐non‐translated region were labeled with (35)S and used to detect infected HeLa or WI‐38 strain human embryonic lung cells in cytological preparations. ISH was shown to be specific for detection of HRV on a single‐cell basis. Subsequently, in human nasal polyps infected in vitro, both oligonucleotide‐ and riboprobes produced a strong signal in association with ciliated epithelial cells. In human adenoids infected in vitro, a signal was observed in nonciliated epithelial cells. This study shows that HRV replicates in ciliated cells in the epithelium of human nasal polyps infected in vitro, and the presence of viral RNA in non‐ciliated cells of the human adenoid infected in vitro suggests that other cell types may also support rhinovirus replication.","de Arruda, Eurico; Mifflin, Theodore E.; Gwaltney, Jack M.; Winther, Birgit; Hayden, Frederick G.",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166441/,144

These correspond to currently accepted subgenera of Acacia. The size of these more narrowly circumscribed genera is in keeping with the size of genera of other tribes of low diversity in Leguminosae. Acacia and Senegalia arose independently from the Ingeae, with Racosperma being derived from Senegalia. Section Filicinae is more advanced than section Senegalia of Senegalia, and sections Racosperma and Pukhella, both with at least some species with bipinnate foliage, are the most advanced of Racosperma, while the other sections Pleurinervia and Lycopodiifolia have only phyllodinous species. Long‐range dispersal of Racosperma from the Australian region has occurred, but the broad pattern of distribution is interpreted in terms of plate tectonics. Racosperma was present in Australia in the late Cretaceous but did not become widespread until the general drying of the continent in the Miocene. The flora of SW Australia has been isolated from the rest of the continent by climatic barriers since the late Tertiary and has a high proportion of endemic species. Barriers to plant migration in the east have operated only intermittently and there is no area comparable in endemism to the southwest.","PEDLEY, L.",Bot J Linn Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188348/,144

The study design was an Outbreak investigation, based on a program of prospective surveillance for nosocomial infection. All neonates admitted to the NICU formed part of the the study. An Infection Control Quality Improvement (QI) team was available to analyze the infection and initiate response action to outbreaks. RESULTS: Three outbreaks were reported in the year 2018. The first was in May 2018 and comprised of colonization with rectal Multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli (MDR GNB). The outbreak was controlled by using Aseptic non-touch technique (ANTT) for fortification of milk and using distilled water for cleaning of diaper area. The second outbreak in August 2018 was Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) whose source was a maternal Lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) wound. The third outbreak in October 2018 was MDR Acinetobacter. The source was from an outborn having the same organism. All infants were in close proximity to the index case.

However, it is unclear whether Rg1 exerted neuroprotection in LPS-induced sub-acute PD model. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of Rg1 in the sub-acute PD mouse model and explored the related mechanisms. Rg1 (10, 20, 40 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1)) was orally administered to mice for 18 days. A sub-acute PD model was established in the mice through LPS microinjection into the substantia nigra (SN) from D8 to D13. We found that Rg1 administration dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced damage of dopaminergic neurons and activation of glial cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The neuroprotective effects of Rg1 were associated with the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the improvement of anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophin in the midbrain. Rg1 shifted the polarization of microglia towards the M2 phenotype from M1, evidenced by decreased M1 markers (inducible NO synthase, CD16, etc.) and increased M2 markers (arginase 1 (Arg1), CD206, etc) in the midbrain. Furthermore, Rg1 administration markedly inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-κB in midbrain microglia. In conclusion, Rg1 protects PD mice induced by continuous LPS injection by inhibiting the nuclear entry of NF-κB and regulating the polarization balance of microglia, shedding new light on a disease-modifying therapy of PD.","Liu, Jia-qi; Zhao, Ming; Zhang, Zhao; Cui, Li-yuan; Zhou, Xin; Zhang, Wei; Chu, Shi-feng; Zhang, Da-yong; Chen, Nai-hong",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468333/,144

However, α(1)-adrenergic receptors (α(1)-ARs) are also expressed in the heart and are activated upon acute sympathetic stress. In the present study, we investigated whether α(1)-AR activation induced cardiac inflammation and the underlying mechanisms. Male C57BL/6 mice were injected with a single dose of α(1)-AR agonist phenylephrine (PE, 5 or 10 mg/kg, s.c.) with or without pretreatment with α-AR antagonist prazosin (5 mg/kg, s.c.). PE injection caused cardiac dysfunction and cardiac inflammation, evidenced by the increased expression of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and chemokines MCP-1 and MCP-5, as well as macrophage infiltration in myocardium. These effects were blocked by prazosin pretreatment. Furthermore, PE injection significantly increased the expression of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and the cleavage of caspase-1 (p20) and interleukin-18 in the heart; similar results were observed in both Langendorff-perfused hearts and cultured cardiomyocytes following the treatment with PE (10 μM). Moreover, PE-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cardiac inflammation was blocked in Nlrp3(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice. In conclusion, α(1)-AR overactivation induces cardiac inflammation by activating NLRP3 inflammasomes.","Xin, Jun-zhou; Wu, Ji-min; Hu, Guo-min; Gu, Hui-jun; Feng, Ye-nan; Wang, Shuai-xing; Cong, Wen-wen; Li, Ming-zhe; Xu, Wen-li; Song, Yao; Xiao, Han; Zhang, You-yi; Wang, Li",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468364/,144

12859,Reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by nanoparticle-based activation of immune-associated cells,2020-05-28,"Osteocalcin, expressed in osteoblasts of the bone marrow, undergoes post-translational carboxylation and deposits in mineralized bone matrix. A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.","Zhang, Xiao-lin; Wang, Ya-nan; Ma, Lu-yao; Liu, Zhong-sheng; Ye, Fei; Yang, Jian-hong",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470804/,144

In this study we explored the relationship between gut microbiota and kidney injuries of early diabetic nephropathy (DN) and its underlying mechanisms. Male SD rats were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin to induce DM. DM rats were orally administered compound broad-spectrum antibiotics for 8 weeks. After the rats were sacrificed, their blood, urine, feces, and renal tissues were harvested for analyses. We found that compared with the control rats, DM rats had abnormal intestinal microflora, increased plasma acetate levels, increased proteinuria, thickened glomerular basement membrane, and podocyte foot process effacement in the kidneys. Furthermore, the protein levels of angiotensin II, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor in the kidneys of DM rats were significantly increased. Administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics in DM rats not only completely killed most intestinal microflora, but also significantly lowered the plasma acetate levels, inhibited intrarenal RAS activation, and attenuated kidney damage. Finally, we showed that plasma acetate levels were positively correlated with intrarenal angiotensin II protein expression (r = 0.969, P < 0.001). In conclusion, excessive acetate produced by disturbed gut microbiota might be involved in the kidney injuries of early DN through activating intrarenal RAS.","Lu, Chen-chen; Hu, Ze-bo; Wang, Ru; Hong, Ze-hui; Lu, Jian; Chen, Pei-pei; Zhang, Jia-xiu; Li, Xue-qi; Yuan, Ben-yin; Huang, Si-jia; Ruan, Xiong-zhong; Liu, Bi-cheng; Ma, Kun-ling",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471476/,144
14813,Primary clear cell sarcoma of the femur: a unique case with RT-PCR and direct sequencing confirmation of EWSR1/ATF1 fusion gene,2021-01-21,"BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is highly prevalent in acute ischaemic stroke and is associated with worse functional outcome and increased risk of recurrence. Recent meta-analyses suggest the possibility of beneficial effects of nocturnal ventilatory treatments (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV)) in stroke patients with SDB. The evidence for a favourable effect of early SDB treatment in acute stroke patients remains, however, uncertain. METHODS: eSATIS is an open-label, multicentre (6 centres in 4 countries), interventional, randomized controlled trial in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and significant SDB. Primary outcome of the study is the impact of immediate SDB treatment with non-invasive ASV on infarct progression measured with magnetic resonance imaging in the first 3 months after stroke. Secondary outcomes are the effects of immediate SDB treatment vs non-treatment on clinical outcome (independence in daily functioning, new cardio-/cerebrovascular events including death, cognition) and physiological parameters (blood pressure, endothelial functioning/arterial stiffness). After respiratory polygraphy in the first night after stroke, patients are classified as having significant SDB (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) > 20/h) or no SDB (AHI < 5/h). Patients with significant SDB are randomized to treatment (ASV+ group) or no treatment (ASV− group) from the second night after stroke. In all patients, clinical, physiological and magnetic resonance imaging studies are performed between day 1 (visit 1) and days 4–7 (visit 4) and repeated at day 90 ± 7 (visit 6) after stroke. DISCUSSION: The trial will give information on the feasibility and efficacy of ASV treatment in patients with acute stroke and SDB and allows assessing the impact of SDB on stroke outcome. Diagnosing and treating SDB during the acute phase of stroke is not yet current medical practice. Evidence in favour of ASV treatment from a randomized multicentre trial may lead to a change in stroke care and to improved outcomes.

15239,Intensive care for human hearts in pluripotent stem cell models,2020-03-06,"OBJECTIVES: Local anesthetic medical thoracoscopy (LAT) is a well-established diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative intervention in undiagnosed pleural effusions with a high diagnostic sensitivity and low complication rates. There is a large variability in practice. We describe a nine-year experience in a large district general hospital in England. METHODS: Two hundred seventy-five patients had LAT between January 2010 and December 2018. Data on outcomes and complications were obtained from the patients’ notes, electronic records, laboratory, and radiographic findings. RESULTS: The main diagnoses were malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) (n=110, 40%), chronic inflammation/fibrinous pleuritis (77, 28%), lung cancer (26, 9.5%), and breast cancer (16, 6%). LAT failed to diagnose cancer in 7/275 patients (false-negative rate 2.5%, diagnostic sensitivity 97.5%). Out of the 105 patients with chronic inflammation/fibrinous pleuritis or atypical proliferative processes, 21 (20%) were subsequently diagnosed with malignancy. Talcum pleurodesis was performed in 146 patients, and was successful in 86%. Seventy eight (28%) patients had trapped lung; 27 of those had a repeat procedure. The median length of stay was 3.96 days. There was one hospital death (0.3% mortality). Complications of LAT included pleural (3, 1%) and wound infections (4, 1.4%), persistent air leaks (9, 3.2%), subcutaneous emphysema (10, 3.6%), and tumor extension to the access port (1, 0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, LAT was safe, effective, and enabled high diagnostic sensitivity. Further areas of study include optimal sedation and anesthetic pathways and combining LAT with indwelling pleural catheters (IPC).","Aujayeb, Avinash; Jackson, Karl",Pleura Peritoneum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7823154/,144

As a proof of principle, we show low dose GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog, does not alter memory T cell recall at lower doses whereas toxicity observed at high dose favors antigen-specific memory T cell survival/proliferation over non-specific CD8(+) T cells. Conversely, parent nucleoside GS-441524 at high dosage does not result in cellular toxicity and reduces antigen-specific T cell recall in most donors. Despite similar chemical structure, these drugs displayed opposing effects on memory T cell expansion and viability highlighting the sensitivity of this assay setup in screening compounds for off-target effects.","Kleiman, Eden; Sierra, Gloria; Mao, Binchen; Magcase, Dennie; George, Marybeth V.; Daftarian, Pirouz M.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8100288/,144

However, utilization of plant systems for production of edible vaccines has been a comparatively recent phenomenon. There are several potential advantages of plant derived vaccines over other conventional systems of vaccine production such as mammalian or avian cell culture. The cost of vaccines is one factor preventing further use of vaccination, leaving hundreds of thousands of children susceptible to preventable diseases. Especially for developing world this novel technique proved to be a boon for its low cost of production, convenient administration, easy storage and negligible chances of infection whereas the conventional system of vaccine production limits the applicability of vaccines in many parts of the world. These vaccines are prepared by introducing selected desired genes into plants and inducing these genetically modified plants to manufacture the encoded proteins. Transgenic plants may provide an ideal expression system, in which transgenic plant material can be fed directly as oral dose of recombinant vaccines. Expression of vaccines in plant tissue eliminates the risk of contamination with animal pathogen, provides a heat stable environment and enables oral delivery thus eliminating infection related hazards. Identification of transgenic material, containment of the transgenes and control of recombinant protein may be potential problems for large scale production of vaccines in plants. Factors like scaling up production as well as distribution and handling of transgenic plant material must comprise the future consideration in this field.","Sahai, Aastha; Shahzad, Anwar; Shahid, Mohd.",Recent Trends in Biotechnology and Therapeutic Applications of Medicinal Plants,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120501/,144

Bij ouderen vormen urineweginfecties een relatief frequente oorzaak van koorts. Bij ontbreken van richtinggevende voorgeschiedenis, klachten of verschijnselen volstaat men in eerste instantie met lichamelijk onderzoek van KNO-gebied en longen. Bij negatieve bevindingen volgt urineonderzoek. Wanneer geen afwijkingen gevonden worden, gaat men uit van een onschuldige virale oorzaak. Bij een ernstig zieke indruk of verminderd bewustzijn is het lichamelijk onderzoek allereerst gericht op eventuele stoornissen in de vitale functies, omdat deze onmiddellijke therapeutische implicaties hebben. Als de koorts een week aanhoudt of eerder bij verandering van het beeld, dient een uitgebreide anamnese en algemeen lichamelijk onderzoek plaats te vinden om diagnostische aanknopingspunten op te sporen. Ook kan de arts dan aanvullend onderzoek laten verrichten: in eerste instantie bloed-, urine- en fecesonderzoek en een X-thorax, eventueel gevolgd door X-sinussen en een mantouxreactie. Medicatie wordt zoveel mogelijk gestaakt om een allergie aan te tonen of uit te sluiten. Na enkele dagen herhaalt men anamnese en lichamelijk onderzoek. Twee weken onbegrepen koorts is reden voor verdere (poli)klinische evaluatie. Concrete aanwijzingen op grond van steeds herhaalde anamnese en lichamelijk onderzoek zijn richtinggevend voor de inzet van complex aanvullend onderzoek.

These peptides also display powerful immunomodulatory activity and are key mediators of inflammation. Therefore, they offer a significant opportunity to inform the development of novel therapeutics for treating viral infections by either directly targeting the pathogen or by enhancing the innate immune response.

Characterizing and modeling the spillover interface are a key part of how eco-epidemiologists respond to the growing global burden of emerging infectious diseases; but the diversity of pathogen life cycles and transmission modes poses a complex challenge for ecologists and clinicians alike. We review our current understanding of the spillover process and present a framework that relates spillover rates and human-to-human transmissibility to the basic reproduction number (R (0)). Using pathogens that exemplify important transmission pathways (anthrax, Ebola, influenza, and Zika), we illustrate key aspects of the spillover interface and discuss implications to public health and management of emerging infectious disease.","Alexander, Kathleen A.; Carlson, Colin J.; Lewis, Bryan L.; Getz, Wayne M.; Marathe, Madhav V.; Eubank, Stephen G.; Sanderson, Claire E.; Blackburn, Jason K.",The Connections Between Ecology and Infectious Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123968/,144

In this chapter we describe some of our latest investigations into the structure and function of two such accessory proteins: ORF3a and 9b. The ORF3a accessory protein is the largest accessory protein in SARS-CoV and is a unique membrane protein consisting of three transmembrane domains. It colocalizes on the cell membrane and host Golgi networks and may be involved in ion channel formation during infection. Similarly the ORF9b accessory protein is 98 amino acids, associates with the spike and nucleocapsid proteins and has unusual membrane binding properties. In this chapter we have suggested possible new roles for these two accessory proteins which may in the long run contain answers to many unanswered questions and also give us new ideas for drugs and vaccine design.","Lu, Wei; Xu, Ke; Sun, Bing",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123986/,144

These diseases are commonly encountered in the tropical regions of the world. However, parasitic lung diseases are increasingly being reported from other parts of the world due to an increase in the occurrence of immunosuppression (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, organ transplantations, the use of immunosuppressive drugs) and transcontinental travel. The lung diseases that may result from these infections range from asymptomatic phase to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome. These diseases can also mimic common respiratory diseases such as bacterial pneumonias, pulmonary tuberculosis, lung cancer, bronchial asthma, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis of parasitic lung diseases is a challenge to physicians, if they are not aware of the entity or these diseases are not investigated properly. The diagnosis of these diseases is based on the identification of the causative organism in the stool, sputum, other body fluids, or tissue specimens. Radiological imaging studies of the thorax including chest radiographs, high-resolution computerized tomograms, and ultrasonograms may aid in the diagnosis. In certain situations, invasive investigations such as fiberoptic bronchoscopic evaluation (transbronchial lung biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage studies) and thoracic surgical procedures (thoracoscopy and open lung biopsy) may be required for a diagnosis and also to exclude other lung diseases.

27059,HIV and HCV adaptation to polymorphic host responses,2006-09-10,"Land-use change is a key driver of the global biodiversity crisis and a particularly serious threat to tropical biodiversity. Throughout the tropics, the staggering pace of deforestation, logging, and conversion of forested habitat to other land uses has created highly fragmented landscapes that are increasingly dominated by human-modified habitats and degraded forests. In this chapter, we review the responses of tropical bats to a range of land-use change scenarios, focusing on the effects of habitat fragmentation, logging, and conversion of tropical forest to various forms of agricultural production. Recent landscape-scale studies have considerably advanced our understanding of how tropical bats respond to habitat fragmentation and disturbance at the population, ensemble, and assemblage level. This research emphasizes that responses of bats are often species and ensemble specific, sensitive to spatial scale, and strongly molded by the characteristics of the prevailing landscape matrix. Nonetheless, substantial knowledge gaps exist concerning other types of response by bats. Few studies have assessed responses at the genetic, behavioral, or physiological level, with regard to disease prevalence, or the extent to which human disturbance erodes the capacity of tropical bats to provide key ecosystem services. A strong geographic bias, with Asia and, most notably, Africa, being strongly understudied, precludes a comprehensive understanding of the effects of fragmentation and disturbance on tropical bats. We strongly encourage increased research in the Paleotropics and emphasize the need for long-term studies, approaches designed to integrate multiple scales, and answering questions that are key to conserving tropical bats in an era of environmental change and dominance of modified habitats (i.e., the Anthropocene).","Meyer, Christoph F.

This paper reviews on the phytochemical and pharmacological studies, especially for the toxicology and quality control of the species in Bupleurum L., which is a reference for the species in this genus for safe usage and further development.","YAO, Ru-yu; ZOU, Yuan-feng; CHEN, Xing-fu",Chin Herb Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129159/,144

The outcome of 39 pregnancies after artificial insemination or natural service during a 4 month period of risk for contracting BVDV was nine abortions, one mummified foetus, one still-birth, three calves that died within 1 week of age, 12 calves persistently infected (PI) with BVDV (11 males and one female) and 13 non-PI calves. Retrospective studies showed that only two of the 13 dams (15.4%) of non-PI calves had been inseminated once, which is a significantly (P < 0.001) lower rate than for 192 other gestations (66.7%) during the 3 year period. The gestational duration of multiparous cows (but not of heifers) was longer (P < 0.01) for five cows with PI calves (mean ± SD 287.6 ± 9.5 days) than for 53 other gestations in 35 cows (280.6 ± 3.8 days). Five of the 12 dams of the PI calves had not expelled the foetal membranes within 2 days after calving, which is a higher (P < 0.001) incidence than the seven cases of retained placenta observed after 198 other calvings. Furthermore, there was a 4.4-fold higher risk (P < 0.01) of treatment for enteritis and/or pneumonia in calves and a 6.0-fold higher risk of calf mortality associated with the introduction of BVDV. The mean heart girth of the PI calves was less (P < 0.05) than that of non-PI calves, at both 80 and 180 days of age.","Larsson, B.; Niskanen, R.; Alenius, S.",Anim Reprod Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131333/,144

We evaluated the presence of the following autoantibodies: rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), antibodies against cadiolipin (a‐CL) and antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti‐CCP). Methods: We studied the presence of RF, ANA, a‐CL and anti‐CCP in 40 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor was measured using nephelometric method, while ANAs were examined by indirect immunofluorescence technique using Hep‐2 cells as substrate. Sera that reacted at 1/80 dilution were classified as ANA positive. Positive sera were studied up to 1/1280 dilution. A‐CL and anti‐CCP were measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Results: RF was positive in 30 patients (75%), ANA in 15 (37%), a‐CL in 10 (25%) and anti‐CCP in 36 (90%). Predominant pattern of nuclear staining of ANA‐positive sera was homogenous and speckled type. ANA titres were particularly low; most patients (6) had ANA titre equal to 1/80, and five patients had a titre of 1/160, while only four out of 40 had an ANA titre of 1/320. Conclusions: Autoimmune disorders such as RA are characterized by various autoantibodies that usually are not specific, as they are present in many other diseases. However, RF and especially anti‐CCP are very often and show higher specificity for RA, being useful diagnostic serological markers. On the other hand, ANA and a‐CL are less common in RA paitents; they may be useful in terms of prognosis and treatment, but they always should be evaluated in correlation with the clinical features and the rest of the laboratory findings of each patient.","Astrinidou‐Vakaloudi, A.; Diamanti, I.; Xytsas, S.; Xatzidimitriou, D.; Georgakopoulou, E.",Scand J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169553/,144

33084,A Family of Tree-Based Generators for Bubbles in Directed Graphs,2020-04-30,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are highly contagious and result in large number of acute respiratory disease (ARD) cases with severe morbidity and mortality. Human adenovirus type 3 (HAdV-3) is the most common type that causes ARD outbreaks in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. However, there is currently no vaccine approved for its general use. The hexon protein contains the main neutralizing epitopes, provoking strong and lasting immunogenicity. In this study, a novel recombinant and attenuated adenovirus vaccine candidate against HAdV-3 was constructed based on a commercially-available replication-defective HAdV-5 gene therapy and vaccine vector. The entire HAdV-3 hexon gene was integrated into the E1 region of the vector by homologous recombination using a bacterial system. The resultant recombinants expressing the HAdV-3 hexon protein were rescued in AD293 cells, identified and characterized by RT-PCR, Western blots, indirect immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. This potential vaccine candidate had a similar replicative efficacy as the wild-type HAdV-3 strain. However, and importantly, the vaccine strain had been rendered replication-defective and was incapable of replication in A549 cells after more than twenty-generation passages in AD293 cells. This represents a significant safety feature. The mice immunized both intranasally and intramuscularly by this vaccine candidate raised significant neutralizing antibodies against HAdV-3. Therefore, this recombinant, attenuated, and safe adenovirus vaccine is a promising HAdV-3 vaccine candidate. The strategy of using a clinically approved and replication-defective HAdV-5 vector provides a novel approach to develop universal adenovirus vaccine candidates against all the other types of adenoviruses causing ARDs and perhaps other adenovirus-associated diseases.","Yan, Yuqian; Jing, Shuping; Feng, Liqiang; Zhang, Jing; Zeng, Zhiwei; Li, Min; Zhao, Shan; Ou, Junxian; Lan, Wendong; Guan, Wenyi; Wu, Xiaowei; Wu, Jianguo; Seto, Donald; Zhang, Qiwei",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7248191/,144

45505,Cryptosporidium: Host-Parasite Interactions and Pathogenesis,2021-02-08,"At the present, the mechanism of chlorophyll degradation in response to ionizing irradiation in harvested fruits have not been examined. To understand the effect of electron beam (E-beam) irradiation on the chlorophyll degrading pathway in relation to chlorophyll degrading enzymes activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant capacities of harvested mangoes stored at 13 °C for 16 days were studied. E-beam-treated fruit significantly suppressed the activities of chlorophyll degrading enzymes especially pheophytinase (PPH) and chlorophyll degrading peroxidase (Chl-POX) in the late stage of storage. This resulted in the chlorophyll content being maintained. However, E-beam irradiation did not affect the activities of chlorophyllase (Chlase) and magnesium de-chelatase (MD). The respiration rate, ethylene production, ROS accumulation (hydrogen peroxide [H(2)O(2)] and superoxide radical [O(−.)(2)]) immediately increased after E-beam treatment, following which they significantly decreased in comparison to the control. E-beam treatment enhanced the fruit’s antioxidant capacity by activating the activities of catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione (GSH) content, and inactivated the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Further, it did not affect the activity of glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG), vitamin C content, or total phenolic content. These results imply that E-beam treatment has the potential to delay chlorophyll degradation by suppressing the Chl-POX and PPH activities as well as reduce ROS production via CAT, APX, and SOD activities and GSH content.","Nguyen, Truc Trung; Uthairatanakij, Apiradee; Srilaong, Varit; Laohakunjit, Natta; Kato, Masaya; Jitareerat, Pongphen",Appl Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7854327/,144

A change in the epidemiology of injuries commonly caused by sporting activities is expected. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: Examine the effect of public health measures on the incidence and characteristics of common pediatric sports injuries. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study comparing sporting injuries presenting to a level I pediatric trauma hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic to sporting injuries during a pre-pandemic period at the same institution. Nine specific injury types were evaluated including ACL injury, meniscus injury, patellar dislocation, osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), shoulder dislocation, ankle sprain, clavicle fracture, medial epicondyle fracture, and tibial spine fracture. Patients were included if they presented for initial care between 3/15/20 and 4/15/20 for the “pandemic” group and the same time window in 2018 and 2019 for the “pre-pandemic” group. RESULTS: 487 patients were included in our study with an average of 222.5 patients in 2018 and 2019 compared to 42 patients in 2020. The average patient age decreased during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period (9.4 ± 6.0 vs 12.4 ± 4.2, p=0.007). Additionally, a decrease in the proportion of injuries attributed to sports (26.2% vs 47.6%, p=0.005) and those occurring at school/daycare (4.8% vs 10.3%, p<0.001) were observed. During the pandemic there was an increase in the proportion of injuries occurring at the patients home (50.0% vs 16.9%, p<0.001)(Table 1). The distribution was significantly different across the nine injury types included with a decrease in the proportion of ankle sprains (31.0% vs 59.8%, p<0.001) and an increase in the proportion of clavicle fractures (50.0% vs 16.2%, p<0.001)(Figure 1). For ankle sprains, there was no significant difference in the proportion of anterior talofibular ligament injuries to high ankle sprains (p=0.898). There was no delay in presentation in the “pandemic” group compared to the “pre-pandemic” group (6.6 ± 9.6 vs 5.4 ±9.9, p=0.424). CONCLUSION: At our institution, we observed an over fivefold reduction in presentation for common pediatric musculoskeletal injuries typically associated with sports. The dramatic drop off in injuries occurring across both sports and non-sports injury mechanisms raises concern for presentation of untreated injuries in the future. Additionally, the increased proportion of injuries occurring in the home setting creates an opportunity for emphasis to be placed on basic safety precautions, especially for young children.

60892,Evidence and possible mechanisms of rare maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.,2020-05-18,"Compensation is described as normal or near to normal performance in Parkinson's disease (PD), despite the ongoing neural loss. Functional compensation typically proceeds in an inverse U-shaped manner: compensation initiates in the prodromal phase, followed by an increasing episode until plateauing and diminishes in the advanced stages of the disease. The first evidence of the structural compensation was reported by functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Recent studies, which have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as the basis for their investigation, have shown improved white matter diffusional properties both in motor- and non-motor-related structures in association with improved clinical scores in patients with PD. The majority of DTI studies have demonstrated microstructural compensation in the prodromal/early stages of PD at the regional scale. However, there have been reports of compensation in later stages of the disease and the whole-brain/network scale that are probably due to the heterogeneous nature of PD. Although serving as a promising beginning to characterize compensation, lots remain to be clarified in understanding the underlying mechanisms of compensation and its structural pattern in PD. The existing knowledge gap necessitates studies that their main research questions are focused on structural compensation. This requirement becomes more apparent because structural compensation evidence has mostly emerged from the post hoc analysis of data and incidental findings of studies. Thus, future studies are required to investigate compensatory microstructural changes in PD to clarify the exact underlying mechanisms. These studies would also provide a basis to develop clinical improvements in the early diagnosis and management of PD.","Sanjari Moghaddam, Hossein; Dolatshahi, Mahsa; Mohebi, Farnam; Aarabi, Mohammad Hadi",Journal of neuroscience research,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333426/,144

Referrals to specialist clinics have to be balanced with increasing recommendations within the NHS to improve efficiency and patient care. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective evaluation of clinic records over two months at a district general (Poole Hospital) and tertiary (Guy's Hospital) menopause service. Data on referral origin, reason for referral, interval from referral to review and outcome were collected and compared between trusts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES To evaluate and compare referrals and outcomes in a tertiary and district general menopause service and provide recommendations for improving efficiency. RESULTS Most referrals are from primary care but up to 25% are from other specialties. Half of the appointments are new referrals and 95% of women attend. Of the new referrals, 50% have multiple medical comorbidities, 25% a personal or family history of cancer and 25% treatment resistance; 30% have premature ovarian insufficiency. At Guy's Hospital, 30% are reviewed more than 18 weeks after referral, at Poole Hospital this is 6%. Treatment resistance is reported in half of the women reviewed at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Menopause services review a complex patient population and the majority of referred women have more than one co-morbidity; they require time, specialist knowledge of current treatment options and a multidisciplinary approach. The main barrier to service efficiency is capacity, particularly in population dense areas; cognitive behavioural therapy and non-hormonal methods appear under-utilised in primary care, as do alternative methods of follow-up within the clinics such as telephone and patient-initiated appointments.","Manley, Kristyn M; Hillard, T; Holloway, D; Bruce, D; Rymer, J",Post reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1177/2053369120947620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854595/,144

OBJECTIVE To report on the feasibility of neuroendovascular OCT imaging and compare the neuroendovascular OCT findings with histology in nondiseased vessels in an animal, cadaveric, and clinical study. METHODS Catheter-based in vivo endovascular OCT imaging was performed in the common carotid arteries of 2 pigs and in the intracranial carotid arteries of 3 patients. The endovascular OCT device was delivered to the desired location via groin access and using standard endovascular procedures. Images were obtained via rotational and translational scanning using external motors. In vivo findings were reproduced using ex vivo OCT imaging in corresponding animal and human (cadaveric) harvested tissue segments. These segments underwent histological examination for comparison. RESULTS The structural compositions of the OCT-imaged segments of the common carotid arteries in pigs as well as the petrous and cavernous intracranial carotid arteries in patients were visualized at high resolution (8 μm). The in vivo images were identical to those obtained ex vivo, demonstrating the imaging capabilities of the endovascular OCT device. The OCT images correlated well with the images obtained after histological sectioning and visualized in vivo the laminar vascular structure. CONCLUSION Neuroendovascular OCT imaging is feasible for clinical use and can detect with high resolution the structure of arterial segments. Understanding OCT imaging in nondiseased arteries is important in establishing baseline findings necessary for interpreting pathological processes. This allows neuroendovascular optical biopsies of vascular tissue to be obtained without the need for excision and processing.","Mathews, Marlon S; Su, Jianping; Heidari, Esmaeil; Levy, Elad I; Linskey, Mark E; Chen, Zhongping",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0b013e318212bcb4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21358358/,144
64786,The SARS-CoV-2 Crisis: Has Medicine Finally Entered a Reductionist Era?,2020-08-04,"A non-linear stochastic model is presented to study the effect of time variation of transmission rates on the co-evolution of epidemics and its corresponding awareness over a two layered multiplex network. In the model, the infection transmission rate of a given node in the epidemic layer depends upon its awareness probability in the awareness layer. Similarly, the infection information transmission rate of a node in the awareness layer depends upon its infection probability in the epidemic layer. The spread of disease resulting from physical contacts is described in terms of a Susceptible Infected Susceptible process over the epidemic layer and the spread of information about the disease outbreak is described in terms of an Unaware Aware Unaware process over the virtual interaction mediated awareness layer. The time variation of the transmission rates and the resulting co-evolution of these mutually competing processes are studied in terms of a network topology dependent parameter ( α ). Using a second order linear theory, it is shown that in the continuous time limit, the co-evolution of these processes can be described in terms of damped and driven harmonic oscillator equations. From the results of a Monte-Carlo simulation, it is shown that for a suitable choice of the parameter ( α ) , the two processes can either exhibit sustained oscillatory or damped dynamics. The damped dynamics corresponds to the endemic state. Furthermore, for the case of an endemic state, it is shown that the inclusion of the awareness layer significantly lowers the disease transmission rate and reduces the size of the epidemic. The infection probability of the nodes in the endemic state is found to have a dependence on both the transmission rates and on their absolute degrees in each of the network layers and on the relative differences between their degrees in the respective layers.","Sagar, Vikram; Zhao, Yi; Sen, Abhijit",Chaos,https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5042575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30501210/,144

Statements about duration of therapeutic efficacy are based on persistence of serum buprenorphine levels over a minimum threshold, but behavioral data demonstrating sustained efficacy is not established. Additionally, chronic opioid exposure can induce tolerance and/or hyperalgesia; mice receiving sustained-release buprenorphine have not been evaluated for these effects. This study assessed clinical efficacy and duration of sustained-release buprenorphine in inflammatory, post-operative, and cancer pain; and screened for centrally-mediated opioid-induced hyperalgesia as well as opioid tolerance. At 1-2 mg/kg sustained-release buprenorphine, statistically significant analgesic efficacy occurred only at time points up to 2 h. These animals showed no changes in von Frey thresholds on the contralateral side, i.e. no centrally-mediated opioid hyperalgesia. To establish whether acute onset opioid tolerance resulted from a single sustained-release buprenorphine administration, we used the tail flick assay, exposing mice to sustained-release buprenorphine or saline on Day 1 and buprenorphine on Day 2. We measured duration and efficacy of 1 mg/kg buprenorphine after 1 mg/kg sustained-release buprenorphine, and also quantified a dose-response curve of buprenorphine (0.1-3 mg/kg) after 2 mg/kg sustained-release buprenorphine. Compared to control animals, mice previously exposed to sustained-release buprenorphine showed diminished analgesic response to buprenorphine; the resultant dose-response curve showed decreased efficacy. Pretreatment with naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, blocked sustained-release buprenorphine analgesic action. The short duration of antinociception following administration of sustained-release buprenorphine in mice is caused by the rapid development of tolerance.","Larson, Christina M; Peterson, Cristina D; Kitto, Kelley F; Wilcox, George L; Fairbanks, Carolyn A",European journal of pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726653/,144

66889,Identifying Gaps in Respiratory Syncytial Virus Disease Epidemiology in the United States Prior to the Introduction of Vaccines.,2017,"BACKGROUND The primary focus of previous aerosol research during mechanical ventilation was the endotracheal tube (ETT). Consequently, there are limited data in the literature on the delivery of inhaled medications administered with different aerosol devices in mechanically ventilated patients with a tracheostomy tube (TT). The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare the efficiency of aerosol devices in a lung model of an intubated and mechanically ventilated adult with a TT. METHODS An in vitro lung model was constructed to simulate a ventilator-dependent adult with a Portex TT and a Mallinckrodt ETT (8-mm inner diameter). Aerosol was collected distal to the bronchi of an adult mannikin on a filter attached to a passive test lung. A ventilator delivered adult breathing parameters (tidal volume 450 mL, breathing frequency 20 breaths/min, peak expiratory flow 40 L/min, and inspiratory-expiratory ratio 1:3) to the airway. A jet nebulizer and pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) were placed in the inspiratory limb of the circuit 15 cm from the Y-adapter. The jet nebulizer was operated at 8 L/min to deliver albuterol sulfate (2.5 mg/3 mL), whereas an albuterol pMDI was actuated 4 times with a spacer. Drug was eluted from the filter and analyzed by spectrophotometry. RESULTS Drug delivered via a TT was marginally greater compared with an ETT using the jet nebulizer and pMDI (P = .10 and .046, respectively). Although delivery efficiency with the pMDI was 3-fold greater than with the jet nebulizer with both a TT and an ETT (P = .001 and .002, respectively), the jet nebulizer delivered greater drug mass compared with the pMDI with either a TT (P = .01) or an ETT (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS Aerosol drug delivery via a TT was greater than with an ETT, whereas the delivery efficiency of a pMDI via either airway was greater than that of a jet nebulizer.","Ari, Arzu; Harwood, Robert J; Sheard, Meryl M; Fink, James B",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.04125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152470/,144
68120,Acute Neurologic Manifestations of Respiratory Viruses.,2021-10-01,"The new Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) hits specific population groups harder than others. However, social-epidemiological patterns of the pandemic which go beyond differences by age and gender have hardly been addressed in Germany. First reports from other western industrialised countries indicate that people living in socioeconomically deprived areas and people of color have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 progression and mortality. Social inequalities in the risk of infection due to different living and working conditions, and social inequalities in the susceptibility and risk factors for severe COVID-19, particularly in pre-existing medical conditions, might play an important role in explaining those findings. Such inequalities are well established for Germany, as well. It can therefore be assumed that also in Germany people with a lower socioeconomic status might be more affected during the further course of the pandemic. In addition, the interventions to contain the pandemic might have unequal social, economic and psychological impacts on different social groups. Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has the overall potential to increase social and health inequalities. Social-epidemiological research into COVID-19 is therefore needed to advance measures of health protection and infection control in an evidence-based, targeted and socially equitable manner.","Wachtler, Benjamin; Hoebel, Jens",Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1226-6708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32858757/,144
68212,Patterns of detection of respiratory viruses in nasal swabs from calves in Ireland: a retrospective study.,2014,"BACKGROUND Bacterial odontogenic sinusitis (ODS) is distinct from other forms of rhinosinusitis. Diagnosing ODS can be challenging because of nonspecific clinical presentations and underrepresentation in the literature. The purpose of this study was to compare maxillary sinus bacterial cultures between patients with ODS and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), to determine whether certain bacteria are associated with ODS. METHODS This was a retrospective case-control study of 276 consecutive patients from August 2015 to August 2019 who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for bacterial ODS, CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), or CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). When present, pus was sterilely cultured from maxillary sinuses after maxillary antrostomy, and aerobic and anaerobic cultures were immediately sent for processing. Demographics and culture results were compared between ODS and CRS patients, and then separately between ODS and CRSsNP, and ODS and CRSwNP. ODS culture results were also compared between different dental pathologies (endodontic vs oroantral fistula). RESULTS The following bacteria were significantly more likely in ODS compared to CRS: mixed anaerobes, Fusobacterium spp., Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus constellatus. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inversely related to ODS. There were no significant differences in cultures between the different dental pathologies. CONCLUSION Certain bacteria were more likely to be associated with ODS compared to CRS when purulence was cultured from the maxillary sinus. Physicians should evaluate for an odontogenic source of sinusitis when these ODS-associated bacteria are identified in maxillary sinus cultures.","Yassin-Kassab, Abdulkader; Bhargava, Pallavi; Tibbetts, Robert J; Griggs, Zachary H; Peterson, Edward I; Craig, John R",International forum of allergy & rhinology,https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.22627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32656998/,144

Although several studies have evaluated the use of RFA in primary NSCLC, there is little literature on its potential application as a salvage tool. PURPOSE To evaluate CT-guided RFA employed as a salvage therapy for pulmonary recurrences of NSCLC after prior treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective computer database search yielded 33 patients with biopsy proven primary NSCLC who underwent CT-guided RFA of 39 recurrent tumors following surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy. Follow-up imaging was performed with CT and PET-CT. The endpoints of interest were progression-free survival (PFS) and time to local progression (TTLP). PFS and TTLP were compared by lesion size (<3 cm, ≥3 cm). RESULTS The median PFS was 8 months. For patients with a tumor size <3 cm median PFS was 11 months, whereas the median PFS of patients with a tumor size ≥3 cm was 5 months. The difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.09). The median TTLP of all tumors was 14 months. TTLP of ablated tumors <3 cm in size was 24 months, compared to 8 months for ablated tumors ≥3 cm in size. The difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION RFA of recurrent NSCLC may be a valuable salvage tool to achieve local tumor control, especially in tumors measuring <3 cm in size.","Schoellnast, Helmut; Deodhar, Ajita; Hsu, Meier; Moskowitz, Chaya; Nehmeh, Sadek A; Thornton, Raymond H; Sofocleous, Constantinos T; Alago, William; Downey, Robert J; Azzoli, Christopher G; Rosenzweig, Kenneth E; Solomon, Stephen B",Acta radiologica,https://doi.org/10.1258/ar.2012.110333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22961644/,144

Descriptions of the surgical techniques of RARC with intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder or ileal conduit are sparse and oncologic and functional outcome data have not been reported. OBJECTIVE We present our technique with RARC and intracorporeal urinary diversion (neobladder or ileal conduit) and present oncologic and functional outcomes, as well as complication rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Single-hospital institution case-series from 2004 to 2009 including 45 selected patients (38 male, 7 female) with high-grade and/or muscle-invasive urothelial cancer of the bladder. SURGICAL PROCEDURE We performed RARC; pelvic lymph node dissection using three different templates; and a totally intracorporeal urinary diversion, either orthotopic neobladder (n=36) or ileal conduit (n=9). MEASUREMENTS Perioperative variables, pathology data, early and late complication rates, urinary continence, potency, and cancer-specific survival were evaluated as outcome measures. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Median patient age, operative time, estimated blood loss, and lymph node yield were 62 yr (range: 37-79), 477 min (range: 325-760), 550 ml (range: 200-2200), and 19 (range: 10-52), respectively. Nine patients were diagnosed with positive lymph nodes. Surgical margins were clear in all but one patient. Early complications occurred in 18 patients (40%). Median postoperative stay was 9 d (range: 4-78), and median postoperative follow-up time was 25 mo. Four patients died due to metastatic disease. The study is limited by a relative small sample size and no comparative group. CONCLUSIONS RARC with totally intracorporeal urinary diversion is technically feasible with good intermediate-term oncologic results. This is a nonrandomised study including a limited number of patients with a restricted follow-up time, however, and so precautions must be considered when interpreting the outcomes.","Jonsson, Martin N; Adding, L Christofer; Hosseini, Abolfazl; Schumacher, Martin C; Volz, Daniela; Nilsson, Andreas; Carlsson, Stefan; Wiklund, N Peter",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2011.07.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21852033/,144
72248,RSVpredict: An Online Tool to Calculate the Likelihood of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Children Hospitalized With Acute Respiratory Disease.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Carotid near-occlusion is defined as severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery with partial or full collapse of the distal vessel wall. The major studies evaluating carotid revascularization excluded patients with carotid near-occlusion. Given the paucity of data in the literature, we attempted to evaluate the safety of carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting in carotid near-occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective data base review was performed from January 2010 to December 2018 to identify patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting for symptomatic ICA near-occlusion and had 1-month clinical and imaging follow-up with carotid sonography. The medical records and imaging studies of patients with ICA near-occlusion were selected for analysis. RESULTS Forty-five patients met the criteria for ICA near-occlusion, of whom 39 were included in the study, given insufficient 1-month follow-up on 6 patients. Of the 39 patients, 25 underwent carotid endarterectomy and 14 underwent carotid artery stenting. All patients had technically successful immediate revascularization of the ICA. Most (33 of 39) had 1-year follow-up postoperatively. Patients with carotid artery stenting had 20% restenosis and 79% vessel maturation rates, while patients with carotid endarterectomy had 17.4% restenosis and 84% vessel maturation. There was no significant difference in periprocedural complication rates between the 2 procedures. CONCLUSIONS Carotid artery stenting shows similar outcomes in restenosis and vessel maturation rates compared with carotid endarterectomy for ICA near-occlusion. There were no major differences between the 2 treatments in clinical outcomes or periprocedural complications. Carotid artery stenting is a revascularization option for carotid near-occlusion if the patient is considered at high risk for carotid endarterectomy.","Kim, J; Male, S; Damania, D; Jahromi, B S; Tummala, R P",AJNR.

Three-dimensional spheroid culture of ADSC improves stem cell proliferation and differentiation, increasing their potential for clinical applications. In this study we aimed to detect if MF levitated culture of ADSC loaded with proprietary MNP maintain the properties of ADSC and improve their performances. Levitated ADSC-MNP formed aggregates with increased volume and reduced number compared to nonlevitated ones. ADSC-MNP from levitated spheroid displayed higher viability, proliferation and mobility compared to nonlevitated and 2D culture. Levitated and nonlevitated ADSC-MNP spheroids underwent three lineage differentiation, demonstrating preserved ADSC stemness. Quantitative osteogenesis showed similar values in MNP-loaded levitated and nonlevitated spheroids. Significant increases in adipogenic conversion was observed for all 3D formulation. Chondrogenic conversion in levitated and nonlevitated spheroids produced comparable ratio glucosaminoglycan (GAG)/DNA. Increased chondrogenesis could be observed for ADSC-MNP in both levitated and nonlevitated condition. Taken together, ADSC-MNP levitated spheroids retain stemness and display superior cell viability and migratory capabilities. Furthermore, the method consistently increases spheroid maneuverability, potentially facilitating large scale manufacturing and automation. Levitated spheroid culture of ADSC-MNP can be further tested for various application in regenerative medicine and organ modeling.","Labusca, Luminita; Herea, Dumitru Daniel; Minuti, Anca Emanuela; Stavila, Cristina; Danceanu, Camelia; Grigoras, Marian; Ababei, Gabriel; Chiriac, Horia; Lupu, Nicoleta","Journal of biomedical materials research.

All patients undergoing PD from July 2010 through December 2016 were included in the study. Outcome of RIGL were compared to SLR. Primary measure of outcome included incidence and severity of DGE. Secondary measures of outcome were overall complications and postoperative mortality. RESULTS One hundred and seventy-nine patients were included in the study. Fifty-two had RIGL, 127 had SLR. Overall complication rate was 40.2%, patients in the RIGL group experienced lower rates of DGE (15.4% vs 59.1%, P = 0.001). Other patient related outcomes were also significantly reduced: day of nasogastric tube removal (3 vs 5, P < 0.001), regain of normal diet (8 vs 9, P < 0.001).

We investigated our preventive procedure for esophagojejunostomy stenosis following use of circular staplers. METHODS Since the anastomotic stenosis is considered to be mainly caused by tension in the esophageal and jejunal stumps at the anastomotic site, we have been performing procedures to relieve this tension, by cutting off the rubber band and pushing the shaft of the circular stapler toward the esophageal side, since July 2015. We retrospectively compared the incidence of anastomotic stenosis in cases of LPG and LTG performed before July 2015 (early phase, 30 cases) versus those performed after this period (later phase, 22 cases). RESULTS Comparison of the incidence of anastomotic stenosis according to the type of surgery, LPG or LTG, and between the two time periods versus all cases, indicated a significantly lower incidence in the later phase than in the early phase (4.5 vs. 26.7%, p < 0.05), especially for LPG (0 vs. 38.5%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS It is possible to use a circular stapler during laparoscopic esophagojejunostomy, as with open surgery, if steps to reduce tension on the anastomotic site are undertaken.

While chemosensory dysfunction has been associated with eating disorders, the relationship is poorly understood. This systematic review aims to characterize psychophysical gustation and olfaction in patients with eating disorders. METHODS Systematic review of investigations assessing psychophysical chemosensory function in patients with organic eating disorders. RESULTS 26 studies were included. Five studies assessed both chemosenses, while 12 and 9 assessed exclusively gustation or olfaction, respectively. In total, 779 patients were included [72.4% anorexia nervosa (AN), 26.7% bulimia nervosa (BN), 0.8% combined AN/BN]. Patients with eating disorders experienced rates of hypogeusia up to 87% in AN and 84.6% in BN. There was evidence for alterations in psychophysical olfaction, but orientation of trends were less clear. Chemosensory dysfunction was more evident in AN patients. Treatment correlated with improved chemosensory function. CONCLUSIONS Despite heterogeneity in study methodology and results, this review demonstrates that patients with eating disorders experience some degree of chemosensory dysfunction, particularly in gustation. This symptomatology overlaps with those experienced by patients with other causes of chemosensory impairment.

METHODS We evaluated 6 intensive-care ventilators in the pressure support (PS), pressure assist/control (PA/C), and volume assist/control (VA/C) modes, with lung-model mechanics combinations of compliance and resistance of 60 mL/cm H(2)O and 10 cm H(2)O/L/s, 60 mL/cm H(2)O and 5 cm H(2)O/L/s, and 30 mL/cm H(2)O and 10 cm H(2)O/L/s, and inspiratory muscle effort of 5 and 10 cm H(2)O. PS and PA/C were set to 15 cm H(2)O, and PEEP to 5 and 15 cm H(2)O in all modes. During VA/C, tidal volume was set at 500 mL and inspiratory time was set at 0.8 second. Rise time and termination criteria were set at the manufacturers' defaults, and to an optimal level during PS and PA/C. RESULTS There were marked differences in ventilator performance in all 3 modes. VA/C had the greatest difficulty meeting lung model demand and the greatest variability across all tested scenarios and ventilators. From high to low inspiratory muscle effort, pressure-to-trigger, time for pressure to return to baseline, and triggering pressure-time product decreased in all modes. With increasing resistance and decreasing compliance, tidal volume, pressure-to-trigger, time-to-trigger, time for pressure to return to baseline, time to 90% of peak pressure, and pressure-time product decreased. There were large differences between the default and optimal settings for all the variables in PS and PA/C. Performance was not affected by PEEP. CONCLUSIONS Most of the tested ventilators performed at an acceptable level during the majority of evaluations, but some ventilators performed inadequately during specific settings.

On average, students spent 8.7 hours a day in front of a screen, with significant differences among countries. Students reported worsened studying, sleeping, and eating habits with substantial differences in Latin American countries. Finally, the participants frequently expressed onset and increase in both mental and physical health symptoms: backache, asthenopia, irritability, and emotional instability. Altogether, these results suggest a potential risk in the health and academic performance of future doctors if these new academic modalities are maintained.","Perez-Dominguez, Francisco; Polanco-Ilabaca, Francisca; Pinto-Toledo, Fernanda; Michaeli, Daniel; Achiardi, Jadi; Santana, Valeria; Urnelli, Chiara; Sawaguchi, Yoshihiro; Rodríguez, Perla; Maldonado, Mónica; Raffeeq, Zaheer; de Araujo Madeiros, Otavio; Rebolledo, Cristián",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,https://doi.org/10.1177/10901981211019292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047207/,144
83661,Correlates and Timing of Reproductive Aging Transitions in a Global Cohort of Midlife Women With Human Immunodeficiency Virus: Insights From the REPRIEVE Trial.,2020-07-09,"To date, there have been several million infections by the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted emerging pathogen that is considered to be taxonomically an Old World RNA virus. Although original CHIKV outbreaks were restricted to India, East Asian countries, Northern Italy, and France, a recent sharp rise had been identified in 41 countries or territories in the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and North America. A total of 1,012,347 suspected and 22,579 laboratory-confirmed CHIKV cases have been reported from these areas, which signals an increasing risk to the US mainland. Unlike past epidemics that were usually associated with Ae. aegypti transmission, the Caribbean outbreak was associated with Ae. albopictus transmission as the principal mosquito vector. In addition, the substantial increase in the number of deaths during this epidemic, as well as incidence of neurologic disease, suggests that CHIKV may have become more virulent. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available for CHIKV or its associated disease pathologies. Therefore, development of new vaccines and therapies that could confer immunity and/or treat clinical symptoms of CHIKV is greatly desired. This chapter describes the use of entirely cutting edge technologies/methodologies developed by our group for the development and evaluation of novel DNA vaccines against CHIKV.","Chung, Christopher; Ugen, Kenneth E; Sardesai, Niranjan Y; Weiner, David B; Muthumani, Kar",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-3618-2_28; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27233283/,144

However, recent developments in microbial biology, neuroscience, the philosophy of cognitive science, and social and personality psychology have produced a novel understanding of the individual and its fluid boundaries. Drawing on converging evidence from these disciplines, and following recent research in public health, we argue that certain features of our biological and social environment can be so tightly integrated as to constitute a unit of care extending beyond the intuitive boundaries of skin and skull. This paper develops and defends the Hypothesis of Extended Health (HEH), which denies the claim that health and disease states are predicated solely on the internal functioning of an organism.

88446,Interim Guidance on the Preparticipation Physical Examination for Athletes During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic.,2020-11-01,"The most severe sequelae after rehabilitation from SARS are femoral head necrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. We performed a 15-year follow-up on the lung and bone conditions of SARS patients. We evaluated the recovery from lung damage and femoral head necrosis in an observational cohort study of SARS patients using pulmonary CT scans, hip joint MRI examinations, pulmonary function tests and hip joint function questionnaires. Eighty medical staff contracted SARS in 2003. Two patients died of SARS, and 78 were enrolled in this study from August 2003 to March 2018. Seventy-one patients completed the 15-year follow-up. The percentage of pulmonary lesions on CT scans diminished from 2003 (9.40 ± 7.83)% to 2004 (3.20 ± 4.78)% (P < 0.001) and remained stable thereafter until 2018 (4.60 ± 6.37)%. Between 2006 and 2018, the proportion of patients with interstitial changes who had improved pulmonary function was lower than that of patients without lesions, as demonstrated by the one-second ratio (FEV1/FVC%, t = 2.21, P = 0.04) and mid-flow of maximum expiration (FEF25%-75%, t = 2.76, P = 0.01). The volume of femoral head necrosis decreased significantly from 2003 (38.83 ± 21.01)% to 2005 (30.38 ± 20.23)% (P = 0.000 2), then declined slowly from 2005 to 2013 (28.99 ± 20.59)% and plateaued until 2018 (25.52 ± 15.51)%. Pulmonary interstitial damage and functional decline caused by SARS mostly recovered, with a greater extent of recovery within 2 years after rehabilitation. Femoral head necrosis induced by large doses of steroid pulse therapy in SARS patients was not progressive and was partially reversible.","Zhang, Peixun; Li, Jia; Liu, Huixin; Han, Na; Ju, Jiabao; Kou, Yuhui; Chen, Lei; Jiang, Mengxi; Pan, Feng; Zheng, Yali; Gao, Zhancheng; Jiang, Baoguo",Bone research,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41413-020-0084-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33579902/,144

91029,Practical Guidance for Clinical Microbiology Laboratories: Viruses Causing Acute Respiratory Tract Infections.,2019,"OBJECTIVES American-style football (ASF) athletes are at risk for the development of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (C-LVH), an established cardiovascular risk factor in the general population. We sought to address whether black race is associated with acquired C-LVH in collegiate ASF athletes. METHODS Collegiate ASF athletes from two National Collegiate Athletic Association Division-I programmes were recruited as freshmen between 2014 and 2019 and analysed over 3 years. Demographics (neighbourhood family income) and repeated clinical characteristics and echocardiography were recorded longitudinally at multiple timepoints. A mixed-modelling approach was performed to evaluate acquired C-LVH in black versus white athletes controlling for playing position (linemen (LM) and non-linemen (NLM)), family income, body weight and blood pressure. RESULTS At baseline, black athletes (N=124) were more often NLM (72% vs 54%, p=0.005) and had lower median neighbourhood family income ($54 119 vs $63 146, p=0.006) compared with white athletes (N=125). While both black and white LM demonstrated similar increases in C-LVH over time, among NLM acquired C-LVH was more common in black versus white athletes (postseason year-1: N=14/89 (16%) vs N=2/68 (3%); postseason year-2: N=9/50 (18%) vs N=2/32 (6%); postseason year-3: N=8/33 (24%) vs N=1/13 (8%), p=0.005 change over time). In stratified models, black race was associated with acquired C-LVH in NLM (OR: 3.70, 95% CI 1.12 to 12.21, p=0.03) and LM was associated with acquired C-LVH in white athletes (OR: 3.40, 95% CI 1.03 to 11.27, p=0.048). CONCLUSIONS Independent of family income and changes in weight and blood pressure, black race was associated with acquired C-LVH among collegiate ASF NLM and LM was associated with acquired C-LVH in white athletes.","Tso, Jason V; Turner, Casey G; Liu, Chang; Galante, Angelo; Gilson, Carla R; Clark, Craig; Taylor, Herman A; Quyyumi, Arshed A; Baggish, Aaron L; Kim, Jonathan H",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2021-104333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34389546/,144

We investigated the repair time of each repair technique using endoscopic suturing (suturing group, SG) and endoscopic Hem-o-lok stapling (CG). Results Twenty-three (15.6%) PT cases occurred as TEP complication. The mean repair times (with standard deviation) of the PT were 16.2 ± 13 and 7.6 ± 7.0 min in the SG and CG, respectively, indicating a significant difference (P = 0.043). The repair time of the PT using Hem-o-lok (Teleflex, Wayne, PA, USA) stapling was shorter than that using endoscopic suturing, which was significantly different despite the length of the PT.

Of 33 non-homogenised specimens, 31 (93.9%) analysed in triplicate were consistently categorised relative to 10 µg/g, compared to all 33 (100%) homogenised specimens. Imprecision was higher (median 27.8%, (range 20.5% to 48.6%)) in non-homogenised specimens than in homogenised specimens (10.2%, (7.0 to 13.5%)). Considerable variation was observed in sequential clinical specimens from individual patients but no positive or negative trend in specimen degradation was observed over time (p=0.26).Discussion: The FIT immunoassay evaluated is capable of detecting faecal Hb at concentrations well below the DG30 threshold of 10 µg/g and is suitable for application in this context. The greatest practical challenge to FIT performance is reproducible sampling, the pre-analytical step associated with most variability. Further research should focus on reducing sampling variability, particularly as post COVID-19 guidance recommends greater FIT utilisation.","James, T; Nicholson, B D; Marr, R; Paddon, M; East, J E; Justice, S; Oke, J L; Shine, B",British journal of biomedical science,https://doi.org/10.1080/09674845.2021.1896204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627037/,144

There was concern that regeneration of these grafts would negatively affect oncologic outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We compared posttransplant graft survival between hepatocellular carcinoma whole livertransplant and partial/splitlivertransplant using Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data (2002-2017). The 330 partial/split liver transplant recipients were compared with a logistic regressionbased propensity score 1:1 matched whole liver transplant cohort (n = 330) and a random unmatched whole livertransplant cohort(n = 4143). Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression models evaluated the effects of partial/split and whole liver transplant on survival.

95574,The First Infant Death Associated With Human Coronavirus NL63 Infection.,2017,"Purpose Developed a preoperative prediction model based on multimodality imaging to evaluate the probability of inferior vena cava (IVC) vascular wall invasion due to tumor infiltration. Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 110 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with level I-IV tumor thrombus who underwent radical nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy between January 2014 and April 2019. The patients were categorized into two groups: 86 patients were used to establish the imaging model, and the data validation was conducted in 24 patients. We measured the imaging parameters and used logistic regression to evaluate the uni- and multivariable associations of the clinical and radiographic features of IVC resection and established an image prediction model to assess the probability of IVC vascular wall invasion. Results In all of the patients, 46.5% (40/86) had IVC vascular wall invasion. The residual IVC blood flow (OR 0.170 [0.047-0.611]; P = 0.007), maximum coronal IVC diameter in mm (OR 1.203 [1.065-1.360]; P = 0.003), and presence of bland thrombus (OR 3.216 [0.870-11.887]; P = 0.080) were independent risk factors of IVC vascular wall invasion. We predicted vascular wall invasion if the probability was >42% as calculated by: {Ln [Pre/(1 - pre)] = 0.185 × maximum cornal IVC diameter + 1.168 × bland thrombus-1.770 × residual IVC blood flow-5.857}. To predict IVC vascular wall invasion, a rate of 76/86 (88.4%) was consistent with the actual treatment, and in the validation patients, 21/26 (80.8%) was consistent with the actual treatment. Conclusions Our model of multimodal imaging associated with IVC vascular wall invasion may be used for preoperative evaluation and prediction of the probability of partial or segmental IVC resection.","Liu, Zhuo; Li, Liwei; Hong, Peng; Zhu, Guodong; Tang, Shiying; Zhao, Xun; Zhang, Qiming; Wang, Guoliang; He, Wei; Zhang, Hua; Xue, Heng; Cui, Ligang; Ge, Huiyu; Jiang, Jie; Zhang, Shudong; Cao, Fangting; Yan, Jing; Ma, Fengrong; Liu, Cheng; Ma, Lulin; Wang, Shumin",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/9530618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083491/,144

Thus, the inability to stabilize proteins in controlled-release systems represents a major obstacle in drug delivery. Here, a bone mineral inspired protein stabilization strategy is presented, which uses nanostructured mineral coatings on medical devices. Proteins bound within the nanostructured coatings demonstrate enhanced stability against extreme external stressors, including organic solvents, proteases, and ethylene oxide gas sterilization. The protein stabilization effect is attributed to the maintenance of protein conformational structure, which is closely related to the nanoscale feature sizes of the mineral coatings. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) released from a nanostructured mineral coating maintains its biological activity for weeks during release, while it maintains activity for less than 7 d during release from commonly used polymeric microspheres. Delivery of the growth factors bFGF and vascular endothelial growth factor using a mineral coated surgical suture significantly improves functional Achilles tendon healing in a rabbit model, resulting in increased vascularization, more mature collagen fiber organization, and a two fold improvement in mechanical properties. The findings of this study demonstrate that biomimetic interactions between proteins and nanostructured minerals provide a new, broadly applicable mechanism to stabilize proteins in the context of drug delivery and regenerative medicine.","Yu, Xiaohua; Biedrzycki, Adam H; Khalil, Andrew S; Hess, Dalton; Umhoefer, Jennifer M; Markel, Mark D; Murphy, William L",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201701255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675637/,144

To explore the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and carcinoma development in H. pylori-infected livers, we utilized BALB/cAnSlac mice to establish an H. pylori-infected model by oral inoculation and orthotopic grafts of hepatic tumors by H22 cells, respectively. We found that H. pylori colonies could not be cultured from all liver and tumor samples. However, its 16S rRNA was detectable in 85.3% of livers and 66.7% of tumors in the infected mice. Inflammatory cells were observed and thinly distributed in the lobule portions of the liver, and H. pylori mainly existed in the infected hepatic sinusoids and the necrotic areas of the infected tumors. No significant difference was found in liver to body weight ratio between the infected and uninfected. Moreover, the pathological tumor difference was unremarkable between the two. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression in the infected tumors was significantly higher and lower, respectively, than those of the uninfected tumors. However, no significant difference in Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) expression existed. The results indicate that H. pylori found in the livers which were infected by H. pylori oral inoculation could contribute to the infiltration of inflammatory cells in livers. Although H. pylori has no significant impact on the liver to body weight ratio or tumor Bcl-2 expression, it may upregulate PCNA expression and downregulate Bax expression, respectively. All our findings show that H. pylori may promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of tumor cells.","Wang, Junwei; Wang, Xiaoqian; Tang, Nanhong; Chen, Yanling; She, Feifei",International journal of oncology,https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.2015.3107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26238296/,144

97595,Role of human coronavirus NL63 in hospitalized children with croup.,2010,"COVID-19 places unprecedented demands on the oncology ecosystem. The extensive pressure of managing health care during the pandemic establishes the need for rapid implementation of telemedicine. Across our large statewide practice of 640 practitioners at 221 sites of service, an aggressive multidisciplinary telemedicine strategy was implemented in March by coordinating and training many different parts of our healthcare delivery system. From March to September, telemedicine grew to serve 15%-20% of new patients and 20%-25% of established patients, permitting the practice to implement safety protocols and reduce volumes in clinic while continuing to manage the acute and chronic care needs of our patient population. We surveyed practice leaders, queried for qualitative feedback, and established 76% were satisfied with the platform. The common challenges for patients were the first-time use and technology function, and patients were, in general, grateful and happy to have the option to visit their clinicians on a telemedicine platform. In addition to conducting new and established visits remotely, telemedicine allows risk assessments, avoidance of hospitalization, family education, psychosocial care, and improved pharmacy support. The implementation has limitations including technical complexity; increased burden on patients and staff; and broadband access, particularly in rural communities. For telemedicine to improve as a solution to enhance the longitudinal care of patients with cancer, payment coverage policies need to continue after the pandemic, technologic adoption needs to be easy for patients, and broadband access in rural areas needs to be a policy priority.

97648,Effects of the SARS-CoV2-Lockdown on Pediatric Care in the Rhine-Main Area.,2020-11-12,"BACKGROUND Conventional hemodialysis (HD) is associated with dialysis-induced hypotension (DIH) and ineffective phosphate removal. As the main source of extracellular fluid removed during HD are the legs, we sought to reduce DIH and increase phosphate removal by using cycling and pneumatic compression, which would potentially provide higher venous return, preserving central blood flow and also offering more phosphate to the dialyzer. METHODS We evaluated 21 patients in a randomized crossover fashion in which each patient underwent 3 different HD: control; cycling exercise during the first 60 min; and pneumatic compression during the first 60 min. Data obtained included bioelectrical impedance, hourly blood pressure measurement, biochemical parameters, and direct quantification of phosphate through the dialysate. DIH was defined as a drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥20 mm Hg. RESULTS There was no difference in the ultrafiltration rate (p = 0.628), delta weight (p = 0.415), delta of total, intra and extracellular body water among the control, cycling, and pneumatic compression (p = 0.209, p = 0.348, and p = 0.467 respectively). Delta MAP was less changed by pneumatic compression when compared to control, cycling, and pneumatic compression respectively (-4.7 [-17.2, 8.2], -4.7 [-20.5, -0.2], and -2.3 [-8.1, 9.0] mm Hg; p = 0.021). DIH occurred in 43, 38, and 24% of patients in control, cycling, and pneumatic compression respectively (p = 0.014). Phosphate removal did not increase in any intervention (p = 0.486). Higher phosphate removal was dependent on ultrafiltration, pre dialysis serum phosphate, and higher parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSION Pneumatic compression during the first hour of dialysis was associated with less DIH, albeit there was no effect on fluid parameters. Neither exercise nor pneumatic compression increased phosphate removal.","Álvares, Valeria R C; Ramos, Camila D; Pereira, Benedito J; Pinto, Ana Lucia; Moysés, Rosa M A; Gualano, Bruno; Elias, Rosilene M",American journal of nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000471513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28407637/,144

A potential alternative method is the determination of affinity maturation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, expressed as the SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity. METHODS SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentration and avidity were measured in sera of hospitalized COVID-19 patients sampled at two weeks and ≥12 weeks post symptom onset using an in-house developed protocol based on EUROIMMUN (anti-spike) and EDI™ (anti-nucleocapsid) SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA protocols. RESULTS We included 68 confirmed COVID-19 patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in both the initial and follow-up specimen sampled at a median of 14 (range 10-18) days and 120 (range 84-189) days, respectively, post symptom onset. The median anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity response was 40% (range 9-93%) and 72% (range 27-104%), respectively, for the first sample, and 66% (range 28-90%) and 57% (range 25-94%), respectively, for the second sample. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity results ≥60% was significantly lower for anti-spike compared to anti-nucleocapsid IgG for initial samples (p< 0.01) and vice versa for follow-up samples (p< 0.01). CONCLUSION Anti-nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 IgG maturation occurs faster and avidity decreases faster than anti-spike IgG, indicating different kinetics of anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG. Further, affinity maturation after SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently incomplete.","Heireman, Laura; Boelens, Jerina; Coorevits, Liselotte; Verhasselt, Bruno; Vandendriessche, Stien; Padalko, Elizaveta",Acta clinica Belgica,https://doi.org/10.1080/17843286.2021.1943231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152944/,144

Forward genetic screens have provided invaluable insights into the molecular regulation of embryonic development, including the essential contributions of some genes whose products must be provided to the transcriptionally silent early embryo for normal embryogenesis, called maternal-effect genes. However, other maternal-effect genes are not accessible due to their essential zygotic functions during embryonic development. Identifying these regulators is essential to fill the large gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms and molecular pathways contributing to fertility and to maternally regulated developmental processes. To identify these maternal factors, it is necessary to bypass the earlier requirement for these genes so that their potential later functions can be investigated. Here, we report reverse genetic systems to identify genes with essential roles in zebrafish reproductive and maternal-effect processes. As proof of principle and to assess the efficiency and robustness of mutagenesis, we used these transgenic systems to disrupt two genes with known maternal-effect functions: kif5ba and bucky ball.","Bertho, Sylvain; Kaufman, Odelya; Lee, KathyAnn; Santos-Ledo, Adrian; Dellal, Daniel; Marlow, Florence L",Development,https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.198010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143203/,144

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective observational study with a database of 1987 patients with COVID-19 who had attended the emergency department of a private hospital network between February 2020 and April 2020 were analyzed. Clinical variables and some laboratory parameters were studied. The Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices were calculated. The dependent variables were mortality and admission to the ICU. A descriptive and correlational analysis was performed. Logistic regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were established. RESULTS Positive correlations were observed between age, creatinine, and D-dimer levels, as well as with the scores obtained with the Charlson and Elixhauser indices. Differences in the levels of these parameters were also observed when analyzing variables such as mortality, sex or admission to the ICU. Mortality was associated with high creatinine and D-dimer levels and advanced age. Survival curves indicated longer survival in patients not admitted to the ICU, admitted to the hospital during the week, and in those with lower creatinine and D-dimer levels. CONCLUSIONS Mortality in Spanish patients with COVID-19 admitted to private hospitals was associated with high creatinine and D-dimer levels and advanced age. Longer survival was obtained on weekdays. This study provides valuable information on the management and nursing care of these patients in order to optimize resources in pandemic situations.","González-Gancedo, J; Morales-Cané, I; Rodríguez-Muñoz, P M; Hidalgo-Lopezosa, P; Del Rocío Valverde-León, M; Fernández-Martínez, M E; Fabbian, F; Rodríguez-Borrego, M A; López-Soto, P J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202104_25750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928626/,144

It is commonly used to reduce the risk of blood coagulation in patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, or ischemic stroke.Area covered: We reviewed published articles in PubMed and Google Scholar that focused on the mutations of CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP1A2 genes related to clopidogrel clinical efficacy and safety.Expert opinion: Based on current pharmacogenetic studies, patients carrying CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2B6*5 alleles may not respond to clopidogrel due to poor platelet inhibition efficacy revealed among them. In contrast, carriers of CYP2C19*17, CYP3A4*1G, and CYP1A2*1F alleles showed a more significant antiplatelet effect in clopidogrel users and expected to have a protective role as a genetic factor against cardiovascular events. Genotyping for either CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, or CYP1A2 variants is not recommended when considering clopidogrel treatment for patients, as some trials showed specific non-genetic factors (e.g., age and diabetes) that could affect clopidogrel responsiveness. Instead, platelets inhibition tests could be used as predictors of the clinical efficacy and safety of clopidogrel treatment. Other P2Y12 receptor inhibitors should be considered as alternative medications.","Alkattan, Abdullah; Alsalameen, Eman",Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17425255.2021.1925249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931001/,144

Few studies have addressed this problem in Latin America, so it is of interest to know how the disease plays out in this region. Objective The purpose of our study is to evaluate the course of COVID-19 in patients admitted to a tertiary center in Chile and to assess factors measured close to hospital admission that may be associated with death and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods We did a retrospective cohort study at Indisa Clinic in Santiago, Chile. We included all patients aged 15 years and older hospitalized between March 11 and July 25, 2020. Hospital mortality and severity of the cases were analyzed, and logistic regression models were applied to identify predictors of outcome variables. Results The sample included 785 subjects. The mean age was 59 years, 59% were men, and 61.3% had comorbidities. Forty five per cent required intensive care, and 24% invasive mechanical ventilation. The overall hospital fatality rate was 18.7%. In intensive care patients, the case fatality was 32.1%, and in those who received invasive mechanical ventilation, it was 59.4%. Independent risk factors for death included age (odds ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 1.12), diabetes (1.68; 1.06 to 2.67), chronic lung disease (2.80; 1.48 to 5.28), increased C-reactive protein, creatinine, and ferritin. No association with sex, public health insurance, history of heart disease, oxygen saturation upon admission, or D-dimer was found. Similar factors were predictors of invasive mechanical ventilation. Discussion The prognosis and predictive factors in this cohort of patients hospitalized in Chile for COVID-19 were comparable to those reported in similar studies from higher-income countries. Male sex was not associated with a poor prognosis in this group of patients.","Araujo, Miguel; Ossandón, Paola; Abarca, Ana María; Menjiba, Ana María; Muñoz, Ana María",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2020.10.8066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361751/,144

The La(OH)3 nano-rods stabilizing in polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers (PLNFs) were prepared by electrospinning and a subsequent in situ precipitation. PAN nanofibers were employed as the matrix of the composite nanofibers, where the well-dispersed La(OH)3 nano-rods were encapsulated as the active species for highly efficient phosphate capture owing to the strong binding between phosphate and lanthanum. On account of the nano-structure, the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity was 151.98 mg P/g (La), much higher than the result of La(OH)3 nano-crystal, produced by precipitation without PAN or any organic surfactants. Moreover, the PLNFs could remove phosphate (2 mg P/L) to an extremely low concentration within 20 min, which could lead to a nutrient deficient condition to protect water quality and ecosystem. The optimization of PLNFs design was implemented through parameter adjustment of electrospinning. Lanthanum salt content, humidity, concentration of solution and applied voltage were chosen to analyze the influences on the composition, diameter and morphology of the nanofibers, giving the result that the most effective adsorbent was the PLNFs with spider-web-like nano-structures.","He, Jiaojie; Yang, Yue; Xu, Yuhong; Wang, Zichuan; Xu, Bing; Huang, Yuheng; Yang, Liwei",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2020.467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263587/,144

The use of the toxic substances as potential bioweapons has raised concerns by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Military. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine to prevent botulinum intoxication. Here we present an immunogenicity study to evaluate the efficacy of novel monovalent vaccines and a trivalent cocktail DNA vaccine targeting the heavy chain C-terminal fragments of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, B, and E. These synthetic DNA vaccines induced robust humoral and polyfunctional CD4(+) T-cell responses which fully protected animals against lethal challenge after just 2 immunizations. In addition, naïve animals administered immunized sera mixed with the lethal neurotoxin were 100% protected against intoxication. The data demonstrate the protective efficacy induced by a combinative synthetic DNA vaccine approach. This study has importance for the development of vaccines that provide protective immunity against C. botulinum neurotoxins and other toxins.","Scott, Veronica L; Villarreal, Daniel O; Hutnick, Natalie A; Walters, Jewell N; Ragwan, Edwin; Bdeir, Khalil; Yan, Jian; Sardesai, Niranjan Y; Finnefrock, Adam C; Casimiro, Danilo R; Weiner, David B",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2015.1066051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158319/,144

RESEARCH QUESTION Using Framingham Offspring Cohort data, we sought to longitudinally examine the association between asthma and lifetime risk of CVD while controlling for cardiovascular risk factors included in the Framingham Risk Score. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed data from a prospective population-based cohort of 3,612 individuals, ages 17 to 77 years, who participated in Framingham Offspring Study examinations from 1979 to 2014. Asthma was defined based on physician diagnosis during study interviews. Incident CVD included myocardial infarction (MI), angina, coronary insufficiency, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or heart failure. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between asthma and CVD incidence. RESULTS Overall, 533 (15%) participants had a diagnosis of asthma and 897 (25%) developed CVD during the course of the study. Unadjusted analyses revealed that asthma was associated with increased CVD incidence (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-1.68). Cox regression also showed an adjusted association between asthma and CVD incidence (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.07-1.54) after controlling for established cardiovascular risk factors. INTERPRETATION Our prospective analysis with >35 years of follow-up shows that asthma is a risk factor for CVD after adjusting for potential confounders. When assessing risk of cardiovascular disease, asthma should be evaluated and managed as a contributing risk factor to morbidity and mortality.","Pollevick, Matias E; Xu, Kevin Y; Mhango, Grace; Federmann, Emily G; Vedanthan, Rajesh; Busse, Paula; Holguin, Fernando; Federman, Alex D; Wisnivesky, Juan P",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.11.053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316236/,144

113869,"HIV/Hepatitis C Virus Co-infection among Adults Beginning Antiretroviral Therapy, Malawi.",2016,"INTRODUCTION The emergence of a novel coronavirus identified in patients with unknown cause of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 has caused a global outbreak. The causative coronavirus was later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). As of 10 August, 2020, more than 19,718,030 confirmed cases and 728,013 deaths have been reported. COVID-19 is spread via respiratory droplets which are inhaled into the lungs. AREAS COVERED In this article, we summarized the knowledge about the causative pathogen of COVID-19 and various diagnostic methods in this pandemic for better understanding of the limitations and the nuances of virus testing for COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION In this pandemic, a rapid and an accurate identification of COVID-19 patients are critical to break the chain of infection in the community. RT-PCR provides a rapid and reliable identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the future, molecular diagnostics will still be the gold standard and next-generation sequencing can help us to understand more on the pathogenesis and detect novel mutations. It is believed that more sophisticated detection methods will be introduced to detect SARS-CoV-2 as earliest as possible.","Wu, So Yat; Yau, Hoi Shan; Yu, Man Yee; Tsang, Hin Fung; Chan, Lawrence Wing Chi; Cho, William Chi Shing; Yu, Chi Shing; Yim, Aldrin; Li, Marco; Wong, Yin Kwan Evelyn; Pei, Xiao Meng; Wong, Cesar Sze Chuen",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737159.2020.1816171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32845192/,144
113924,What settings have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters?,2020,"Background: The emerging evidence for the asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 infection emphasized the critical need for universal screening of pregnant women.Objectives: This study aimed to present the prevalence of overall and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in pregnant women admitted to the hospital, and assess the diagnostic accuracy of maternal symptoms and lung ultrasound (LUS) findings in detecting the infection.Patients and methods: This prospective cohort study was conducted at a single tertiary centre in Istanbul, Turkey, for a month period starting from 27th April, 2020. Women with a confirmed pregnancy regardless of the gestational week admitted to the obstetric unit with any indication were consecutively underwent LUS and PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.Results: A total of 296 patients were included for the final analysis. The universal screening strategy diagnosed 23 pregnant women (7.77%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 was found as 3.72% (n = 11) and 4.05% (n = 12), respectively. Four of nine women who underwent a second testing for SARS-CoV-2 upon abnormal LUS findings were found positive eventually (17.4%, n = 4/23). The asymptomatic pregnant women with LUS score of 1 and those with normal LUS findings were considered as likely to be normal. Symptomatic patients with LUS score of 1 and those with score of 2 or 3 were considered as abnormal. On a secondary diagnostic performance analysis, the positive predictive value and the sensitivity were found as 44% and 47.8% for the triage based on maternal symptoms and, 82.3% and 60.9% for the triage based on LUS, respectively.Conclusion: A one-month trial period of universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR in pregnant women who admitted to the hospital showed an overall and asymptomatic infection diagnose rate of 7.77% and 4%, respectively. Using lung ultrasound was found more predictive in detecting the infection than the use of symptomatology solely.","Yassa, Murat; Yirmibes, Cihangir; Cavusoglu, Gul; Eksi, Hazal; Dogu, Cevdet; Usta, Canberk; Mutlu, Memis Ali; Birol, Pinar; Gulumser, Cagri; Tug, Niyazi","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1798398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691641/,144

This study examined the safety and efficacy of prasugrel in the management of clopidogrel-resistant patients treated for cerebral aneurysms.METHODSFour hundred thirty-seven consecutive patients were identified between January 2011 and May 2016. Patients allergic, or having less than 30% platelet inhibition, to a daily 75-mg dose of clopidogrel received 10 mg of prasugrel daily (n = 20) or 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily (n = 2). The mean (± SD) follow-up duration was 15.8 ± 12.4 months. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score registered before discharge and at each follow-up visit. To control confounding, multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression and propensity score conditioning were used.RESULTSTwenty-six (5.9%) of 437 patients presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The mean patient age was 56.3 years, and 62 were women (14.2%). One of the 7 patients lost to follow-up received prasugrel. One patient was allergic to clopidogrel and prasugrel simultaneously. All patients receiving prasugrel or ticagrelor (n = 22) had an mRS score ≤ 2 on their latest follow-up visit (mean score 0.67 ± 1.15). In a multivariate analysis, clopidogrel did not affect the mRS score on last follow-up (p = 0.14). Multivariable logistic regression showed that clopidogrel was not associated with an increased long-term recurrence rate (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01-2.70, p = 0.21), an increased thromboembolic complication rate (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.12-1.67, p = 0.24), or an increased hemorrhagic event rate (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.91-1.64, p = 0.20). None of the patients receiving prasugrel or ticagrelor died or suffered a long-term recurrence or a hemorrhagic event; only 1 patient suffered from mild aphasia subsequent to a thromboembolic event. Three patients taking clopidogrel died during the study: 2 from acute SAH and 1 from intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Clopidogrel was not associated with an increased mortality rate (OR 2.18, 95% CI 0.11-43.27, p = 0.61). The same associations were present in propensity score-adjusted models.CONCLUSIONSIn a cohort of patients treated with PEDs, prasugrel (10 mg/day) was a safe alternative to clopidogrel-resistant or clopidogrel-allergic patients, or nonresponders.","Atallah, Elias; Saad, Hassan; Bekelis, Kimon; Chalouhi, Nohra; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula; Hasan, David; Eller, Jorge; Stidd, David; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Jabbour, Pascal",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2017.5.jns162663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29219758/,144

The condition is mainly respiratory, and up to 5% of patients develop critical illness, a situation that has put enormous pressure on the health systems of affected countries. A high demand for care has mainly been observed in intensive care units and critical care resources, which is why the need to redistribute resources in critical medicine emerged, with an emphasis on distributive justice, which establishes the provision of care to the largest number of people and saving the largest number of lives. One principle lies in allocating resources to patients with higher life expectancy. Mechanical ventilator has been assumed to be an indivisible asset; however, simultaneous mechanical ventilation to more than one patient with COVID-19 is technically possible. Ventilator sharing is not without risks, but the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence and justice prevail. According to distributive justice, being a divisible resource, mechanical ventilator can be shared; however, we should ask ourselves if this action is ethically correct.","Vázquez-de Anda, Gilberto F; Ruíz-de Chávez, Manuel; Pérez-Castañeda, Ana I; Vázquez-Moreno, Pamela; Dávila-Fernández, Juan C; Delaye-Aguilar, Ma Guadalupe",Gaceta medica de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/gmm.20000352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831320/,144

METHODS Data were collected from 258 centres in 18 countries. The number of MPS studies per million population (pmp) was estimated assuming that the nonresponding centres performed either no studies (lower estimate) or the same number as the responding centres (upper estimate). RESULTS The responding centres served 24% of the population of their countries. The total number of noncardiac nuclear medicine studies was between 2,160 and 8,000 studies pmp. The total number of MPS studies was between 529 and 2,293 pmp. The median number of MPS studies per centre was 571 per year with 57% performing fewer than 500 studies per year and 23% of centres performing fewer than 250 studies per year. There was significant variation between countries, with higher numbers of MPS studies (lower limit of estimate above the mid-range of all countries combined) in Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Portugal and Slovenia, and lower numbers (upper limit of estimate below the mid-range of all countries) in Finland, Norway, Spain and Switzerland. The ratio of MPS to coronary angiography to revascularization procedures was 0.9 to 2.2 to 1. Pharmacological stress was used in 57% and technetium-99m-labelled tracers in 88% of studies. ECG gating was performed in 74% of studies and attenuation correction in 22%. CONCLUSION MPS utilization in Europe remains low compared with coronary angiography although there has been a 21% increase in the number of studies pmp in centres that reported in both 2005 and 2007. Pharmacological agents continue to be the predominant form of stress. Despite the widespread use of technetium-99m-labelled tracers, ECG gating is not universally performed.

METHODS We enrolled patients who underwent kidney transplantation and were actively followed up in two hospitals in Paris on March 1st, 2020. Patients were screened for baseline and transplant characteristics, functional parameters, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive therapies. COVID-19 disease was assessed. Patients were followed up during the pandemic until April 30th, 2020 by the COVID-19 SLS KT survey program, including teleconsulting, at-home monitoring for patients with COVID-19, and a dedicated phone hotline platform. RESULTS Among 1216 patients with kidney transplants enrolled, 66 (5%) patients were identified with COVID-19 disease, which is higher than the incidence observed in the general population in France (0.3%).

The following factors were independently associated with COVID-19 disease: non-White ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.17; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.23 to 3.78; P=0.007), obesity (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.19 to 4.05; P=0.01), asthma and chronic pulmonary disease (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.49 to 6.41; P=0.002), and diabetes (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.92 to 5.77; P<0.001). The mortality rate related to COVID-19 disease was 1% in the overall study population and 24% in COVID-19-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS Patients with kidney transplants display a high risk of mortality. Non-White ethnicity and comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, asthma, and chronic pulmonary disease were associated with higher risk of developing COVID-19 disease. It is imperative that policy makers urgently ensure the integration of such risk factors on response operations against COVID-19.","Elias, Michelle; Pievani, Daniele; Randoux, Christine; Louis, Kevin; Denis, Blandine; Delion, Alexandra; Le Goff, Océane; Antoine, Corinne; Greze, Clarisse; Pillebout, Evangeline; Abboud, Imad; Glotz, Denis; Daugas, Eric; Lefaucheur, Carmen",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020050639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847984/,144
118722,Enhanced detection of respiratory pathogens with nanotrap particles.,2016,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In France, the entire population was put under a total lockdown from March 17 to May 11, 2020 during the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Whether the lockdown had consequences on the management of medical emergencies such as stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) has yet to be fully evaluated. This article describes hospitalization rates for acute stroke in 2 French regions that experienced contrasting rates of COVID-19 infection, before, during, and after the nationwide lockdown (January to June 2020). METHODS All patients admitted for acute stroke/TIA into all public and private hospitals of the 2 study regions were included. Data were retrieved from the National Hospitalization Database (PMSI). In the most affected region (Grand-Est), the hospitalization rates observed in April 2020 were compared with the rates in the same period in the least affected region (Occitanie) and in the 3 prior years (2017-2019). RESULTS There was a significant decline in hospitalization rates for stroke/TIA within the region most affected by COVID-19 during the month of April 2020 compared with previous years, while no significant change was seen in the least affected region. After lockdown, we observed a fast rebound in the rate of hospitalization for stroke/TIA in the most affected region, contrasting with a slower rebound in the least affected region. In both regions, patients with COVID-19 stroke more frequently had ischemic stroke, a nonsignificant greater prevalence of diabetes, they were less frequently admitted to stroke units, and mortality was higher than in patients without COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrates a significant drop in stroke/TIA hospitalizations and a fast recovery after the end of the French lockdown in the most affected region, while the least affected region saw a nonsignificant drop in stroke/TIA hospitalizations and a slow recovery. These results and recommendations could be used by the health authorities to prepare for future challenges.","Mariet, Anne-Sophie; Giroud, Maurice; Benzenine, Eric; Cottenet, Jonathan; Roussot, Adrien; Aho-Glélé, Ludwig Serge; Tubert-Bitter, Pascale; Béjot, Yannick; Quantin, Catherine",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.032312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33626900/,144
120115,Correction: Immunodominant SARS Coronavirus Epitopes in Humans Elicited Both Enhancing and Neutralizing Effects on Infection in Non-human Primates.,2020-04-15,"OBJECTIVE The aim of the study had two stages. One was to examine the psychometric quality of the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI) in Chinese version and its predicted function for the prevalence of insomnia. The other was to describe the prevalence of poor sleep hygiene habits and associated factors of sleep hygiene habits in Chinese nursing students. METHOD According to Brislin translation model, the English version of SHI was translated into Chinese. And a pilot-survey was carried out to measure psychometric quality of the Chinese version of SHI with 260 nursing students by convenient sampling. Then a cross-sectional survey was conducted. 659 undergraduates were recruited by simple random sampling in a medical university in China. Data collection instruments consisted of a demographic questionnaire, the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Brief Insomnia Questionnaire (BIQ). Data were analyzed by SPSS 24.0 and Amos 24.0 with P = 0.05 as the significant test value. RESULTS The internal consistency reliability of SHI in Chinese version was more than 0.60 (α = 0.62, ω = 0.63). The concurrent validity presented significantly (r = 0.25, P < 0.001). Exploratory factor analysis found that a six component model explained 63.06% of total variance and confirmatory factor analysis showed good fitness (χ2/df=2.14, RMSEA = 0.04). ROC analysis showed that the cut-off value predicting for insomnia was 5.50 (52.90% sensitivity and 75.80% specificity). The area under the ROC curve was 0.66 (95% confidence interval = 0.61-0.71). 199 (30.20%) participant had poor sleep hygiene habits, especially in the aspects of staying too longer in bed (65.25%) and irregular sleep schedule. Multiple linear regression analysis showed health condition, academic difficulties and gender were more common associated factors of sleep hygiene. CONCLUSIONS The Chinese version of the Sleep Hygiene Index demonstrates satisfactory psychometric qualities and has higher sensitivity and specificity to predict for insomnia. So SHI could be used in Chinese nursing students and detect high levels of insomnia. The status of sleep hygiene of nursing students in China should be concerned. Sleep hygiene education should be carried out in nursing students with different gender, health condition, and academic performance.","Tang, Zhengyan; Li, Xiaomei; Zhang, Yongai; Li, Xiaohong; Zhang, Xiaona; Hu, Minhua; Wang, Jing",Sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.02.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740592/,144

We present a scheme for deterministically preparing pairs of three-component solitons in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Our method is based on local spin rotations which simultaneously imprint suitable phase and density distributions. This enables us to observe striking collisional properties of the vector degree of freedom which naturally arises for the coherent nature of the emerging multicomponent solitons.

METHODS On four separate days, nine patients with type 2 diabetes, and 10 matched healthy control subjects received bolus instillations of (i) CDCA, (ii) colesevelam, (iii) CDCA + colesevelam or (iv) placebo. At baseline and for 180 min after instillation, blood was sampled. RESULTS In both the type 2 diabetes group and the healthy control group, CDCA elicited an increase in GLP-1 levels compared with colesevelam, CDCA + colesevelam and placebo, respectively (p < 0.05). The interventions did not affect plasma glucose, insulin or C-peptide concentrations in any of the groups. CDCA elicited a small increase in plasma insulin : glucose ratio compared with colesevelam, CDCA + colesevelam and placebo in both groups. Compared with colesevelam, CDCA + colesevelam and placebo, respectively, CDCA increased glucagon and delayed gastric emptying in both groups. CONCLUSIONS CDCA increased GLP-1 and glucagon secretion, and delayed gastric emptying. We speculate that bile acid-induced activation of TGR5 on L cells increases GLP-1 secretion, which, in turn, may result in amplification of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore our data suggest that colesevelam does not have an acute effect on GLP-1 secretion in humans.","Hansen, M; Scheltema, M J; Sonne, D P; Hansen, J S; Sperling, M; Rehfeld, J F; Holst, J J; Vilsbøll, T; Knop, F K","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.12648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26888164/,144

127520,"Macrolide resistance-associated 23S rRNA mutation in Mycoplasma genitalium, Japan.",2011,"Introduction: Several studies explored the effects of exposure to radiofrequency-electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) and extremely low frequency (ELF) EMF emitted from mobile phones on meningioma among adults. However, the results could not reach an agreement. This meta-analysis was conducted to confirm the relationship between adult meningioma risk and the use of a wireless phone. Methods: Pertinent studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase up to August 2018. The random- or fixed-effects model was used to combine the results depending on the heterogeneity of the analysis. The publication bias was evaluated using Egger's regression asymmetry test. The subgroup analysis was performed by time since the first use of wireless phone and laterality (ipsilateral/contralateral). Results: Eight studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The pooled results suggested that the ever use of wireless phone led to a borderline decreased adult meningioma risk [odds ratio (OR) 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.99] with no heterogeneity (I 2 = 5.3%; p = 0.391). A decreased risk of meningioma was seen in short-term (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94) users. Neither decreased nor increased risk of meningioma was observed in mid-term (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.75-1.16) and long-term (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.93-1.19) users. Neither ipsilateral (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.90-1.22) nor contralateral (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.62-1.18) wireless phone use was associated with the risk of meningioma. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggested a relationship between decreased meningioma risk and wireless phone use. However, the findings need further validation.","Chen, Fajun; Wang, Peng; Lan, Jiaying; Hu, Mingzhe; Zheng, Jiantao; Li, Yanwen; Hou, Chongxian; Zhou, Dong",British journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1080/02688697.2020.1856784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305648/,144

The primary objective of this study was to strengthen our current understanding of self-care education across undergraduate Canadian pharmacy programs. Methods A national curriculum survey and follow-up phone interview was conducted in 2019 to assess the quantity and quality of self-care instruction across Canadian pharmacy schools. Representatives were selected based on theirparticipation in the Association of Faculties of Pharmacy of Canada Self-Care Therapeutics and Minor Ailments special interest group. Results Responses were received from all 10 pharmacy schools in Canada. Self-care education varies across Canadian pharmacy curricula, reflecting differences in scopes of practice across provinces, topics of interest and availability of space within curricula by the various faculties. Specifically, there was considerable variability in the number of hours devoted to self-care education, course content and methods for integration and teaching. Conclusions Results of this study may help inform and evolve self-care curricula across the country. We argue that strategies for enhancing current programs may include establishing a minimum number of core hours and topics, expanding natural health product content and curricular content oversight by a lead faculty member.

COVID 19, started in December 2019 in China, has been considered a public health emergency by the Department of Health and Human Services and, at the moment, it is a pandemic disease with worldwide diffusion. The Covid 19 crisis permits to increase the role of Telemedicine as a tool for the delivery of health care services at distance and to slow down the virus diffusion. This technology is cheap and easy to use but it is limited by governmental licensing restrictions, reimbursement barriers, lesser extent of infrastructure and difficulties related to the change. During COVID 19 Epidemy, Telemedicine is safe, low cost and permits to treat urgent and routine specialist cases without human proximity and contact which would spread infection, particularly to the elderly and immunocompromised patients. In COVID 19 era, the goal of PCP is to reduce travels and visits in specialized center for liver disease patients.

This study characterizes resource access for Latino immigrants living in Philadelphia, as perceived by staff at Latino-serving organizations. METHODS An online cross-sectional survey of staff at key Latino-serving Philadelphia organizations assessed access to their organization and citywide access to each type of service (substance use, HIV/AIDS, domestic violence [DV], and mental health) for Latino immigrants. Descriptive statistics for organizational access indicators and citywide access scores across four syndemic domains (availability, accessibility, adequacy, and quality) and by syndemic condition were computed. RESULTS Organizational access and citywide access across HIV/AIDS (mean = 1.94, SD = 0.83), mental health (mean = 1.37, SD = 0.95), substance use (mean = 1.11, SD = 0.74), and DV (mean = 1.49, SD = 0.97) services were perceived as far from optimal.

STUDY DESIGN The research investigated the elderly suicide rates of the 232 municipal units in South Korea between 2001 and 2011. METHODS The Gi* score, which is a spatially weighted indicator of area attributes, was used to identify hot spots and the spatiotemporal pattern of elderly suicide in the nation during the last 10 years. The spatial Markov matrix and spatial dynamic panel data model were employed to identify and estimate the diffusion effect. RESULTS The suicide rate among elderly individuals 75 years and older was substantially higher than the rate for those between 65 and 74 years of age; however, the spatial patterns of the suicide clusters were similar between the two groups. From 2001 to 2011, the spatial distribution of elderly suicide hot spots differed each year. For both age cohorts, elderly suicide hot spots developed around the north area of South Korea in 2001 and moved to the mid-east area and the mid-western coastal area over 10 years. The spatial Markov matrix indicates that the change in the suicide rate of one area was affected by the suicide rates of neighbouring areas from the previous year, which suggests that suicide increase in one area inflates a neighbouring area's suicide rate over time. Using a spatial dynamic panel data model, elderly suicide diffusion effects were found to be statistically significant for both age cohorts even after economic and demographic indicators and a time variable are included. For individuals 75 years and older, the diffusion effect appeared to be larger. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that elderly suicide can spread spatially over time in both age cohorts. Thus, it is necessary to design a place-based and age-differentiated intervention policy that precisely considers the spatial diffusion of elderly suicide.","Joo, Y",Public health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2016.07.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27613224/,144

In this study, we aim to evaluate the impact of the current pandemic on racial disparities among stroke patients receiving mechanical thrombectomy (MT). METHODS We used the prospectively collected data in the Stroke Thrombectomy and Aneurysm Registry from 12 thrombectomy-capable stroke centers in the US and Europe. We included acute stroke patients who underwent MT between January 2017 and May 2020. We compared baseline features, vascular risk factors, location of occlusion, procedural metrics, complications, and discharge outcomes between patients presenting before (before February 2020) and those who presented during the pandemic (February to May 2020). RESULTS We identified 2083 stroke patients: of those 235 (11.3%) underwent MT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with pre-pandemic, stroke patients who received MT during the pandemic had longer procedure duration (44 vs 38 min, P=0.006), longer length of hospitalization (6 vs 4 days, P<0.001), and higher in-hospital mortality (18.7% vs 11%, P<0.001). Importantly, there was a lower number of African American patients undergoing MT during the COVID-19 pandemic (609 (32.9%) vs 56 (23.8%); P=0.004). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the care process for stroke patients receiving MT globally. There is a significant decline in the number of African American patients receiving MT, which mandates further investigation.","Al Kasab, Sami; Almallouhi, Eyad; Alawieh, Ali; Jabbour, Pascal; Sweid, Ahmad; Starke, Robert M; Saini, Vasu; Wolfe, Stacey Q; Fargen, Kyle M; Arthur, Adam S; Goyal, Nitin; Pandhi, Abhi; Maier, Ilko; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Howard, Brian M; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula I; Rai, Ansaar; Park, Min S; Mascitelli, Justin R; Psychogios, Marios N; Spiotta, Alejandro M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408256/,144

133638,Validation of SARS-CoV-2 detection across multiple specimen types.,2020-05-13,"PURPOSE We used an impedance-controlled generator with an internally cooled electrode to perform radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in ex vivo bovine livers, with a single injection of either 38.5% sodium chloride (NaCl) or 10% hydrochloric acid (HCl), to determine the relative effects of these two solutions on tissue impedance, temperature and ablation volume. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed 10 ablations each with injections of NaCl (NaCl-RFA), HCl (HCl-RFA) or nothing (RFA-alone), with a power setting of 200 W for 15 minutes. We recorded tissue impedance before and after injection. We logged temperatures obtained from thermocouple probes positioned 5, 10, 15 and 20 mm from the internally cooled RF electrode. After ablation, we measured ablation zone longitudinal and transverse diameters, and we calculated a spherical ratio (SR) for each ablation. RESULTS Mean post-injection impedance of 30.3 (standard deviation [SD] 2.5) ohms for HCl was significantly lower than that of 55.4 (SD 3.5) ohms for NaCl (p < .001). Mean maximum temperatures recorded at each respective distance from the RFA electrode were all highest for HCl-RFA and lowest for RFA-alone (p < .001). Mean longitudinal and transverse diameters after HCl-RFA (5.50 [SD 0.25] cm and 5.28 [SD 0.22] cm, respectively) were significantly larger than those after NaCl-RFA (4.24 [SD 0.35] cm and 3.55 [SD 0.43] cm, respectively) and after RFA-alone (3.60 [SD 0.10] cm and 2.70 [SD 0.13] cm, respectively) (p < .001). Mean SR after HCl-RFA (0.93, SD 0.02) was significantly higher than mean SR after NaCl-RFA (0.76, SD 0.06) and RFA-alone (0.72, SD 0.04) (p < .001). CONCLUSION Monopolar, impedance-controlled RFA, with an internally cooled electrode and a single 10% HCl injection may allow larger tumors to be treated, potentially resulting in improved patient outcomes.","Jiang, Xiong-Ying; Zhang, Tian-Qi; Li, Guo; Gu, Yang-Kui; Gao, Fei; Yao, Wang; Zhang, Yan-Yang; Huang, Jin-Hua","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2018.1472305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29807444/,144
134803,"INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Amid panic, a chance to learn about MERS.",2015,"BACKGROUND Although values underpin the goals pursued in health systems, including how health systems benefit the population, it is often not clear how values are incorporated into policy decision-making about health systems. The challenge is to encompass social/citizen values, health system goals, and financial realities and to incorporate them into the policy-making process. This is a challenge for all health systems and of particular importance for Latin American (LA) countries. Our objective was to understand how and under what conditions societal values inform decisions about health system financing in LA countries. METHODS A critical interpretive synthesis approach was utilised for this work. We searched 17 databases in December 2016 to identify articles written in English, Spanish or Portuguese that focus on values that inform the policy process for health system financing in LA countries at the macro and meso levels. Two reviewers independently screened records and assessed them for inclusion. One researcher conceptually mapped the included articles, created structured summaries of key findings from each, and selected a purposive sample of articles to thematically synthesise the results across the domains of agenda-setting/prioritisation, policy development and implementation. RESULTS We identified 5925 references, included 199 papers, and synthesised 68 papers. We identified 116 values and developed a framework to explain how values have been used to inform policy decisions about financing in LA countries. This framework has four categories - (1) goal-related values (i.e. guiding principles of the health system); (2) technical values (those incorporated into the instruments adopted by policy-makers to ensure a sustainable and efficient health system); (3) governance values (those applied in the policy process to ensure a transparent and accountable process of decision-making); and (4) situational values (a broad category of values that represent competing strategies to make decisions in the health systems, their influence varying according to the four factors). CONCLUSIONS It is an effort to consolidate and explain how different social values are considered and how they support policy decision-making about health system financing. This can help policy-makers to explicitly incorporate values into the policy process and understand how values are supporting the achievement of policy goals in health system financing.

135260,Dynamics and predisposition of respiratory viral co-infections in children and adults.,2020-06-12,"INTRODUCTION Single-port (SP) surgery has been characterized as having limited applicability regarding procedure, disease, and patient characteristics. There is a question if SP procedures offer disadvantages or advantages to multiport (MP) colorectal surgery. We hypothesize that SP is equivalent to MP and is a safe alternative in the full spectrum of colorectal disease and procedures. METHODS A case-matched analysis of a prospectively maintained database to compare perioperative outcomes in SP versus MP was performed. Criteria included age, gender, BMI, previous abdominal surgery, previous XRT, disease process, and procedure. 95 exact matches for all 7 criteria were found between 159 SP and 1,617 MP cases. Perioperative outcomes, surgical technique, morbidity, mortality, local recurrence, and 5-year survival were analyzed. RESULTS There was lower mean EBL in SP but no difference in transfusion requirement. OR time for SP left colectomy was shorter, with a trend to shorter OR times found in all procedures. 99 % SP and 98 % MP had no intra-operative complications. Conversion to open was equivalent (0/1). Mean largest incision was smaller for SP. There were no differences in return of bowel function or length of hospital stay. There were no mortalities. There were no differences in perioperative morbidity, local recurrence, distant metastasis, or overall 5-year survival. CONCLUSIONS SP is a safe alternative to MP colorectal surgery across the full array of procedures in equivalent patients. This study demonstrates SP has less blood loss, smaller incisions, is quicker in left colectomy, and tends to be quicker across all procedures. Conversion and morbidity rates are equivalent to MP, without compromise in quality of surgical technique. While proper training is essential, concerns regarding the inability to use SP laparoscopic colorectal surgery safely are unfounded in nearly exactly matched patients. These issues will require further study as SP laparoscopic colorectal surgery is practiced more widely.","Marks, John H; Montenegro, Grace A; Shields, Margaret V; Frenkel, Joseph L; Marks, Gerald J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3830-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25277473/,144

HIV patients are vulnerable to certain fatal infection due to their deficient immune functions. Nonetheless, the immunocompromised state may prevent HIV patients from severe hyper-immunity respond to COVID-19. To date, the impact of HIV on the clinical courses and outcomes of COVID-19 is inconclusive, and study answering this matter is evolving. We recently published the case series of nine HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infected patients admitted to our hospital during the early-wave of the pandemic in New York City, which contained the worrying mortality at 78%. Herein, we presented the clinical features and outcomes of another five confirmed COVID-19 patients with HIV infection who admitted to our hospital during the resolving pandemic phase of NYC, which showed an improved mortality rate at 20%. Notwithstanding, 60% of patients still had severe COVID-19 complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock. The extremely high mortality rate in our case series may be due to the mortality biases, the delay in corticosteroids administration, different vulnerability of patients, and the limitation of healthcare resources.

The absence of metallic mesh in the aneurysm's parent vessel lumen obviates the need for potent antiplatelet therapy, making this device appealing for acutely ruptured aneurysms not amenable to clipping or coiling. To assess the literature regarding WEB treatment of these aneurysms, we performed a comprehensive systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Keywords were combined with Boolean operators to increase search sensitivity and specificity ('woven endobridge device' AND 'ruptured'). Nine studies comprising 377 acutely ruptured aneurysms were included. Overall, 82.7% were wide-necked, 85.9% were located in the anterior circulation, and 26.9% of patients presented with poor subarachnoid hemorrhage grade. Intraprocedure and postprocedure complications occurred in 8.4% (95% CI 3.6% to 13.3%) and 1% (95% CI 0% to 2%), respectively. The post-treatment rebleeding rate was 0%. Rates of adequate occlusion (complete occlusion to neck remnant) and retreatment at last follow-up were 84.8% (95% CI 73% to 96.6%) and 4.5% (95% CI 2.2% to 6.8%), respectively. The favorable outcome rate (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) was 62.2% (95% CI 53% to 71.4%); mortality was 13.6% (95% CI 9.7% to 17.6%). WEB treatment of acutely ruptured aneurysms results in high adequate occlusion rates, low perioperative complication rates, no rebleeding, and low recurrence requiring retreatment. This device is promising for acutely ruptured aneurysms not amenable to clipping or coiling, considering the lower need for antiplatelet regimens during the procedure or follow-up.","Monteiro, Andre; Lazar, Audrey L; Waqas, Muhammad; Rai, Hamid H; Baig, Ammad A; Cortez, Gustavo M; Dossani, Rimal H; Cappuzzo, Justin M; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2021-017613; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266907/,144
139614,"Methanobrevibacter smithii, a methanogen consistently colonising the newborn stomach.",2017,"OBJECTIVE A major goal of palliative care is to provide comfort, and pain is one of the most common causes of treatable suffering in patients with advanced disease. Opioids are indispensable for pain management in palliative care and can usually be provided by the oral route, which is safe, effective, and of lowest cost in most cases. As patients near the end of life, however, the need for alternate routes of medication increases with up to 70% of patients requiring a nonoral route for opioid administration. In order to optimize patient care, it is imperative that clinicians understand existing available options of opioid administration and their respective advantages and disadvantages. METHODS We performed a literature review to describe the most commonly used and available routes that can substitute for oral opioid therapy and to provide a summary of factors affecting choice of opioid for use in palliative care in terms of benefits, indications, cautions, and general considerations. RESULTS Clinical circumstances will largely dictate appropriateness of the route selected. When the oral route is unavailable, subcutaneous, intravenous, and enteral routes are preferred in the palliative care population. The evidence supporting sublingual, buccal, rectal, and transdermal gel routes is mixed. CONCLUSIONS This review is not designed to be a critical appraisal of the quality of current evidence; rather, it is a summation of that evidence and of current clinical practices regarding alternate routes of opioid administration. In doing so, the overarching goal of this review is to support more informed clinical decision making.","Kestenbaum, Matthew G; Vilches, Agustin O; Messersmith, Stephanie; Connor, Stephen R; Fine, Perry G; Murphy, Brian; Davis, Malene; Muir, J Cameron",Pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/pme.12464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995406/,144

Women comprise 76% of the health-care workforce in the United States and are subject to experience higher psychosocial ramifications in the pandemic era due to gender disparities. Accordingly, women who are dually mothers may be navigating complex interactions of role strain by managing abnormally high parental and occupational workloads. The psychological toll is exacerbated for women holding multiple oppressed identities across domains such as economic status, race and ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, and other identities of salience. To address WHCWs' unique needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors present a clinical case example through an intersectional framework illustrating how an abbreviated, 4-session cognitive behavioral therapy model may be implemented to support women disproportionally affected by social and systemic factors with a focus on sexism and discrimination against mothers for this particular participant. This case study describes the treatment of a patient in an integrated women's health clinic to demonstrate how to clinically support WHCWs while promoting social justice and gender-based equity.

Complications of tunneling included kinking, bleeding and other problems. In 20 of 737 (2.7%) procedures, the catheter kinked, which was observed in 7.7% of silicone and 0.6% of polyurethane catheters. Repositioning was attempted in 4, but was successful in only 2 cases. Catheter exchange was necessary in 16 cases, but the function was adequate in 2 cases, despite radiological signs of kinking. In 6 cases (1 patient with diabetes, 2 with chest anatomy changes and medical devices, 2 with systemic sclerosis and 1 with greatly enlarged superficial jugular veins) we faced particular difficulties requiring an individual solution by tunneling; these are described in detail. The cumulative catheter patency rate were 69%, 52% and 37% at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. In conclusion, the most frequent complication of tunneling was kinking, usually necessitating catheter exchange. The silicon catheter kinked more often than the polyurethane one.

METHODS The sample comprised 215 female undergraduates who responded to a two-questionnaire anonymous survey conducted in Tokyo, Japan in 2018 and 2019 from November to December. We measured mindful eating status using the Expanded Mindful Eating Scale (EMES) and used Japanese plant-based dietary indices to determine plant-based dietary patterns. Partial correlation analyses were conducted to determine the correlation of mindful eating with energy and nutrient intake, food consumption, and plant-based dietary patterns, after adjusting for demographics and body mass index. RESULTS Participants with higher sub-scores in ""health of the planet"" and ""awareness and appreciation for food"" ate higher quantities of several micronutrients and plant-based foods and were more likely to have a healthful plant-based dietary pattern. They were also less likely to have an unhealthful plant-based dietary pattern. In contrast, participants with higher scores in ""non-judgmental awareness"" ate less protein, whole grains, and vegetables, and were likely to have an unhealthful plant-based dietary pattern.

The objective of this paper is to present an updated systematic review on the effectiveness of antiseptic cleaning of the meatal area for the prevention of CAUTIs and bacteriuria in patients who receive a urinary catheter. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES Electronic databases Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline and Academic Search Complete were searched from 1 January 2016 and 29 February 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies evaluating the use of antiseptic, antibacterial or non-medicated agents for cleaning the meatal, periurethral or perineal areas before indwelling catheter insertion or intermittent catheterisation or during routine meatal care. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted using the Cochrane Collaboration's data collection form for RCTs and non-RCTs. Data were extracted by one researcher and then checked for accuracy by a second researcher. RESULTS A total of 18 studies were included. Some potential benefit of using antiseptics, compared with non-antiseptics for meatal cleaning to prevent bacteriuria and or CAUTI was identified (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02; p=0.071). Antiseptics (chlorhexidine or povidine-iodine) may be of value for meatal cleaning on the incidence of CAUTI, compared with comparator agents (saline, soap or antimicrobial cloths) (OR=0.65, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.99; p=0.047). CONCLUSION There is emerging evidence of the role of some specific antiseptics (chlorhexidine) prior to urinary catheterisation, in reducing CAUTIs, and some potential benefit to the role of antiseptics more generally in reducing bacteriuria.

Our dual objectives were to develop a technique to assess the feasibility of retroperitoneal dialysis (RPD) in a porcine model. METHODS We incorporated two 35-kg Yorkshire pigs for this pilot study. In the first animal, we clamped renal vessels laparoscopically. In the second animal, we embolized renal arteries. In both animals, we dilated the retroperitoneal space bilaterally and deployed dialysis catheters. We measured serum creatinine (Cr), urea, and electrolytes at baseline 6 hours before the dialysis and every 4 hours after. RESULTS We successfully created retroperitoneal spaces bilaterally and deployed dialysis catheters in both animals. In the first animal, dialysate and plasma Cr ratio (D/P) on the left and right side were 0.43 and 0.3, respectively. Cr clearance by 40 minutes of dialysis treatment was 6.3 mL/min. The ratio of dialysate glucose at 4 hours dwell time to dialysate glucose at 0 dwell time (D/D0) for left/rights sides were 0.02 and 0.02, respectively. kt/Vurea was 0.43. In the second animal, D/P Cr for left/right sides were 0.34 and 0.33, respectively. kt/Vurea was 0.17. We euthanized the pigs due to fluid collection in the peritoneal space and rapid increase of serum Cr, urea, and electrolytes. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the feasibility of creation of a functionally anephric porcine model with successful development of retroperitoneal spaces using balloon inflation. Notwithstanding minimal clearance and limited diffusion capacity in this experiment, additional studies are needed to examine potential use of retroperitoneal space for peritoneal dialysis.","Okhunov, Zhamshid; Yoon, Renai; Perez Lanzac, Alberto; Sgroi, Michael; Lau, Wei Ling; Del Junco, Michael; Ordon, Michael; Drysch, Austin; Hwang, Christina; Vernez, Simone L; Fujitani, Roy; Kabutey, Nii-Kabu; Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar; Landman, Jaime",Clinical nephrology,https://doi.org/10.5414/cn108775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27345182/,144

144594,"Novel inflammatory markers, clinical risk factors and virus type associated with severe respiratory syncytial virus infection.",2013,"BACKGROUND Clinical evaluation of the demarcation line separating ischemic from non-ischemic liver parenchyma may be challenging. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a noninvasive imaging modality, which combines a camera with a spectroscope and allows quantitative imaging of tissue oxygenation. Our group developed a software to overlay HSI images onto the operative field, obtaining HSI-based enhanced reality (HYPER). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of HYPER to identify the demarcation line after a left vascular inflow occlusion during an anatomical left hepatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS In the porcine model (n = 3), the left branches of the hepatic pedicle were ligated. Before and after vascular occlusion, HSI images based on tissue oxygenation (StO2), obtained through the Near-Infrared index (NIR index), were regularly acquired and superimposed onto RGB video. The demarcation line was marked on the liver surface with electrocautery according to HYPER. Local lactates were measured on blood samples from the liver surface in both ischemic and perfused segments using a strip-based device. At the same areas, confocal endomicroscopy was performed. RESULTS After ligation, HSI demonstrated a significantly lower oxygenation (NIR index) in the left medial lobe (LML) (0.27% ± 0.21) when compared to the right medial lobe (RML) (58.60% ± 12.08; p = 0.0015). Capillary lactates were significantly higher (3.07 mmol/L ± 0.84 vs. 1.33 ± 0.71 mmol/L; p = 0.0356) in the LML versus RML, respectively. Concordantly, confocal videos demonstrated the absence of blood flow in the LML and normal perfusion in the RML. CONCLUSIONS HYPER has made it possible to correctly identify the demarcation line and quantify surface liver oxygenation. HYPER could be an intraoperative tool to guide perfusion-based demarcation line assessment and segmentation.","Urade, Takeshi; Felli, Eric; Barberio, Manuel; Al-Taher, Mahdi; Felli, Emanuele; Goffin, Laurent; Agnus, Vincent; Ettorre, Giuseppe Maria; Marescaux, Jacques; Mutter, Didier; Diana, Michele",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07586-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342212/,144

144995,Prevalence and clinical characterization of a newly identified human rhinovirus C species in children with acute respiratory tract infections.,2009,"AIM Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is currently a very important topic for surgeons. This study aimed to describe the initial clinical experience of transvaginal NOTES for adnexal masses and investigate its feasibility and surgical outcome. METHODS We performed transvaginal NOTES in seven patients with adnexal masses through a 2-cm incision in the posterior vaginal fornix. A transvaginal NOTES system comprising a wound protractor and a surgical glove with sheaths was used. Resection was performed according to the method of standard laparoscopic adnexal surgery. The adnexal mass was removed via the incision of the posterior vaginal fornix after complete resection. RESULTS Since June 2011, seven patients have undergone transvaginal NOTES for adnexal masses. All cases were completed successfully without conversion to standard laparoscopic approach. The median age of the patients was 48 years (range, 36-60) and the median body mass index was 23.6 (range, 20.4-25.3). The median tumor size was 6 cm (range, 3.7-6.7). The median operative time was 45 min (range, 40-80). The estimated blood loss was minimal (range, 5-300 mL). The median postoperative hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-3). No postoperative complications were observed at follow-up. All the patients were very satisfied with the cosmetic result. CONCLUSION The findings show transvaginal NOTES with our method to be a feasible, safe and effective surgical technique that results in excellent cosmesis. It may be an alternative technique for the treatment of properly selected female patients with adnexal masses. More experience and instrumental improvement suitable for transvaginal NOTES are needed.","Yang, Yun Seok; Hur, Myung Haeng; Oh, Kwoan Young; Kim, Soo Young",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.12108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23875997/,144

The preparations of high-risk departments (infection, respiratory, emergency, and intensive care unit) were relatively well within this pandemic, while low-risk departments may be unprepared. The spine surgery department in The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University in Hefei, China, was used as an example in this study. The spine surgery department took measures to manage the patients, medical staff and wards to avoid the cross-infection within hospital. During the outbreak, no patients or healthcare workers were infected, and no treatment was delayed due to these measures. The prevention and control measures effectively reduced the risk of nosocomial transmission between health workers and patients while providing optimum care. It was a feasible management approach that was applicable to most low-risk and even high-risk departments.","Zheng, Yongshun; Zhang, Xingfang; Fang, Shiyuan; Qian, Yeben; Zhang, Fan",Science progress,https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211009670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878962/,144
146487,Acute encephalopathy associated with influenza C virus infection.,2009,"BACKGROUND Stereotactic radiotherapy is used to treat peripheral lung cancer in inoperable patients. Placement of fiducial gold markers (FMs) is crucial for tracking small lesions that are not visible on chest radiographs. Our objective was to assess endoscopic FM placement in small peripheral lung nodules (PLNs) that are not trackable using automated tracking software. METHODS All patients benefiting from virtual bronchoscopy and radial endobronchial ultrasonography (R-EBUS)-guided placement of FMs for PLNs < 20 mm were included. After confirmation by biopsy sampling, a gold-seed FM was inserted into the nodule using a bronchial brush, without the use of fluoroscopy. The performance and complications of the procedure were recorded. RESULTS From May 2010 to June 2015, FMs were placed in the PLNs of 54 consecutive patients, 34 of whom presented with a nodule < 20 mm. Seventy-six percent of the procedures were performed using local anesthesia on an outpatient basis. The median long- and short-axis diameters of nodules were 15 mm (9-20 mm) and 11 mm (6-20 mm), respectively, with 31 of 34 nodules exhibiting a short axis of < 15 mm. In 23 cases (79%), histologic samples were obtained during the procedure that allowed FM placement. Migration occurred in six cases, including two in the hours following the procedure. FMs were in place and visible on CT imaging performed 3 months after radiation therapy in 80% of cases. No complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of peripheral nodules < 20 mm and FM placement using R-EBUS are efficient and safe in a single procedure.","Lachkar, Samy; Guisier, Florian; Roger, Maxime; Obstoy, Bérengère; Bota, Suzanna; Lerouge, Delphine; Piton, Nicolas; Thiberville, Luc; Salaün, Mathieu",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2017.08.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28847547/,144

We investigated the impact of baseline stroke severity on both futile reperfusion and therapeutic benefit of successful EVT. METHODS Using a prospective multicenter stroke registry, we identified consecutive ischemic stroke patients with anterior circulation large artery occlusion, who were reperfused successfully by EVT (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade 2b-3). The rate of futile reperfusion was assessed across the initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores. The frequency of poor outcomes (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 3-6) according to NIHSS scores was compared between patients revascularized successfully by EVT and those who did not receive EVT, after standardizing for age. RESULTS Among 21,591 patients with ischemic stroke, 972 (4.5%) received EVT within 12 h of onset, including 440 who met study eligibility criteria. Futile reperfusion was observed in 226 of the 440 study-eligible patients (51.4%) and was associated with stroke severity: 20.9% in NIHSS scores ≤5, 34.6% in 6-10, 58.9% in 11-20, and 63.8% in > 20 (p < 0.001). Nonetheless, the therapeutic benefit of EVT also increased with increasing stroke severity (p for interaction < 0.001): 0.1% in NIHSS ≤5, 18.6% in 6-10, 28.7% in 11-20, and 34.3% in > 20.

While surgical treatment has been employed for esophageal perforation, we have adopted conservative treatment with an esophageal stent for patients in a poor physical condition because we consider controlling sepsis and improving the physical status are the highest priorities; additionally, the surgical trauma could be fatal for these patients. CASE PRESENTATION A 60-year-old male complaining of left chest and back pain after vomiting was transferred to a local hospital. Computed tomography and chest X-ray examinations showed left tension pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and bilateral pleural effusion suspicious of spontaneous intrathoracic esophageal perforation. He was transferred to our hospital for further treatment. After arrival, he developed septic shock with acute respiratory failure. We considered that surgical treatment was too invasive and chose conservative treatment with an esophageal stent. Under general anesthesia, we first inserted a 20-Fr. trocar in the left posterior pleural space, and a large volume of the dark pleural effusion was discharged. We then performed endoscopy and found a pinhole perforation in the left posterolateral wall of the lower esophagus. We inserted both a silicon-covered esophageal stent with a check valve and a double elemental diet (W-ED) tube. We then inserted an 18-Fr. trocar into the left anterior wall. These procedures were performed less than 24 h after onset. As intensive medical care, the patient was administered broad-spectrum antibiotics and catecholamine. The two trocars and the W-ED tube were under continuous suction at - 5 cmH2O and at - 20 cmH2O every 30 s. On the 6th day, we inserted an additional thoracic drainage tube into the left pleura under CT guidance. The patient was discharged from the ICU to the general ward on the 7th day. We removed the stent almost triweekly, and the esophageal perforation was completely healed on the 45th day. He was discharged home on the 70th day. CONCLUSION Conservative treatment with a temporary self-expanding covered stent with a check valve, sufficient drainage, and W-ED tube nutrition was useful and effective in this unstable case of spontaneous intrathoracic esophageal perforation.","Matsumoto, Ryu; Sasaki, Ken; Omoto, Itaru; Noda, Masahiro; Uchikado, Yasuto; Arigami, Takaaki; Kita, Yoshiaki; Mori, Shinichiro; Maemura, Kosei; Natsugoe, Shoji",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-019-0717-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650260/,144

149670,In the Literature.,2018,"OBJECTIVES In an attempt to control the new coronavirus pandemic, many countries have taken unprecedented measures, such as extensive social distancing and total lockdowns of cities. Kidney transplant recipients have an increased risk for infectious diseases, including viral infections. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of population-wide infection control measures on the mood statuses of kidney transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We used an electronic survey tool to collect demographic and sociocultural data. Additionally, in the same survey, we used 2 questionnaires (the Profile of Mood States and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) to measure mood statuses of kidney transplant recipients. We also examined a control group and selected eligible participants according to age- and sex-based propensity score matching. RESULTS We analyzed the data of 308 participants: 154 kidney transplant recipients (mean age of 39.9 ± 10.6 years; 57.1% male) and 154 control participants (mean age of 39.1 ± 10.5; 57.1% male). With regard to the Profile of Mood States questionnaire, total scores and all subscale scores, excluding vigor, were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients than in the control group, a finding consistent with a better mood status. We found similar findings in anxiety and depression scores for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplant recipients seem to be resilient to the psychological stress induced by social distancing and lockdown periods. Strict adherence to infection control measures is purposefully suggested in this infection-prone population.","Ozcan, Seyda Gul; Poyraz, Burc Cagri; Bakir, Alev; Trabulus, Sinan; Pekmezci, Salih; Seyahi, Nurhan",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.6002/ect.2020.0488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33736586/,144

We argue that the failure to respond effectively to the pandemic stems from the nation's protracted divergence from the democratic ideals, we purport to value. Structural racism and class-based political and economic inequity are sustained through the failings of the nation's democratic institutions and processes. The situation has, in turn, fostered further inequity and undermined science, facts, and evidence in the name of economic and political interests, which in turn has encouraged the spread of the pandemic, exacerbated health disparities, and escalated citizen tensions.

Further, this study investigated the buffering effects of perceived social support and social participation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data were drawn from the 2011 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey, including N = 4,341 Chinese adults aged 60 years and older. For the survey, local officials identified whether the 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the major disasters in the history of their communities. Depression was assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale and inflammation was measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) collected from participants via venous blood draws. RESULTS Results from multilevel logistic regression models revealed that Chinese older adults living in communities exposed to SARS were more likely to have elevated CRP compared to those not living in such communities. Moreover, community SARS exposure was associated with greater risks of depression for Chinese older adults who had no perceived social support. Among Chinese older adults who had low levels of social participation, community SARS exposure was more strongly related to elevated CRP. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Findings suggest community-level exposure to the SARS epidemic had enduring consequences for Chinese older adults' health. However, active social participation and supportive social ties provided important resources that may buffer against negative effects of exposure to the SARS epidemic.","Wang, Haowei; Stokes, Jeffrey E; Burr, Jeffrey A",The Gerontologist,https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33599268/,144

MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a prospective study in 27 children followed for unilateral LCPD. Forty-six MRIs were carried out with bilateral quantification of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the neck of the femur. The intra- and inter-observer variability of the ADC measurements was evaluated. The association between the ADC and age as well as the healthy or pathological status of the neck of the femur and the Catterall classification were looked for. RESULTS Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of the ADC measurements was excellent. A statistically significant negative correlation between the ADC of the healthy neck of the femur and age was found. There was a significant increase in the ADC of the pathological neck of the femur compared to the healthy neck. The ratio of the pathological neck ADC and the healthy neck ADC was significantly associated with the Catterall classification. CONCLUSION The quantification of the ADC of the neck of the femur is reproducible. This could be useful in the treatment of LCPD, where there is an early and significant increase in the ADC on the pathological side. This increase could have a prognostic value, as it is correlated with the Catterall classification.","Boutault, J-R; Baunin, C; Bérard, E; Vial, J; Labarre, D; Domenech, C; Sales de Gauzy, J; Sans, N",Diagnostic and interventional imaging,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diii.2012.10.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23206418/,144

Gastric leakage from the staple line is a life-threatening complication of LSG, but there is controversy about whether buttressing the staple line with a reinforcement material will reduce leaks. We describe a single-center, 518-patient series of LSG procedures in which a synthetic buttressing material (GORE® SEAMGUARD® Bioabsorbable Staple Line Reinforcement) was used in the most recently treated patients. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwent LSG in our unit between September 2007 and December 2011. Patients treated before August 2009 did not receive the staple line reinforcement material (n = 186), whereas all patients treated afterward did (n = 332). RESULTS The percentages of excess weight loss in the 518 patients (mean age, 41 years; 82% female; mean preoperative body mass index, 44 kg/m(2)) were 67% (79% follow-up rate) at 6 months postoperatively, 81% (64%) at 1 year, and 84% (30%) at 2 years. Type 2 diabetes resolved in 71 % of patients (91/128). Patients given reinforcement material had baseline characteristics similar to those in the no-reinforcement-material group, but had no postoperative staple line leaks or bleeding. The no-reinforcement group had three leaks (p = 0.045) and one case of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS LSG resulted in substantial short-term weight loss.

Inflammation is a key component of many common respiratory disorders, including asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Many basic transcription factors are found in NF-κB, which is a member of the Rel protein family. Five members of this family c-REL, NF-κB2 (p100/p52), RelA (p65), NF-κB1 (p105/p50), RelB, and RelA (p65) produce 5 transcriptionally active molecules. Proinflammatory cytokines, T lymphocyte, and B lymphocyte cell mitogens, lipopolysaccharides, bacteria, viral proteins, viruses, double-stranded RNA, oxidative stress, physical exertion, various chemotherapeutics are the stimulus responsible for NF-κB activation. NF-κB act as a principal component for several common respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, COPD as well as infectious diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis, COVID-19.

The secretome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been shown to improve wound healing and angiogenesis. We hypothesized that topical application of the PBMC secretome would improve the quality of regenerating skin, increase angiogenesis, and reduce scar formation after burn injury and skin grafting in a porcine model. Full-thickness burn injuries were created on the back of female pigs. Necrotic areas were excised and the wounds were covered with split-thickness mesh skin grafts. Wounds were treated repeatedly with either the secretome of cultured PBMCs (Sec(PBMC)), apoptotic PBMCs (Apo-Sec(PBMC)), or controls. The wounds treated with Apo-Sec(PBMC) had an increased epidermal thickness, higher number of rete ridges, and more advanced epidermal differentiation than controls. The samples treated with Apo-Sec(PBMC) had a two-fold increase in CD31+ cells, indicating more angiogenesis. These data suggest that the repeated application of Apo-Sec(PBMC) significantly improves epidermal thickness, angiogenesis, and skin quality in a porcine model of burn injury and skin grafting.","Hacker, Stefan; Mittermayr, Rainer; Nickl, Stefanie; Haider, Thomas; Lebherz-Eichinger, Diana; Beer, Lucian; Mitterbauer, Andreas; Leiss, Harald; Zimmermann, Matthias; Schweiger, Thomas; Keibl, Claudia; Hofbauer, Helmut; Gabriel, Christian; Pavone-Gyöngyösi, Mariann; Redl, Heinz; Tschachler, Erwin; Mildner, Michael; Ankersmit, Hendrik Jan",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27125302/,144

The role of long noncoding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) in tumor progression has caught the attention of numerous researchers. In this work, lncRNA LINP1 was studied to identify how it functioned in the progression of ovarian cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS Firstly, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to measure LINP1 expression in ovarian cancer tissues. Furthermore, to identify the function of LINP1 in ovarian cancer, functional experiments were conducted. Also, by performing qRT-PCR and Western blot assay, the underlying mechanism was explored. RESULTS In this research, LINP1 expression was remarkably higher in ovarian carcinoma samples compared with adjacent tissues. Moreover, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were inhibited after LINP1 was silenced in the ovarian cancer cells. Besides, the messenger (mRNA) and the protein of KLF6 were overexpressed after LINP1 was silenced. Furthermore, the KLF6 expression level was negatively related to the LINP1 expression level in ovarian cancer samples. CONCLUSIONS We discovered a potential oncogene in ovarian cancer and identified that LINP1 enhanced cell metastasis and proliferation via down-regulating KLF6.","Li, Y; Hou, C-Z; Dong, Y-L; Zhu, L; Xu, H",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202001_19893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31957816/,144

One of these is the mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. The most frequent etiology is the complete autosomal recessive deficiency of the β1 subunit of the interleukin 12 receptor. CASE REPORT A female patient who, by the age of six months, started with a nodular lesion in the right shoulder and ipsilateral axillary adenitis after the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine was applied. Later, she developed a cutaneous fistula in the anterior thorax, the inframammary region, and chronic recidivant suppurative lymphadenitis. A disseminated infection caused by Mycobacterium bovis was diagnosed, therefore, individualized pharmacological treatment was required due to failure with the primary treatment. The patient was diagnosed with deficiency in the β1 subunit of the interleukin 12 receptor at age six. During her last hospitalization, she presented fever, cough, and tachypnea, and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The patient has had a favorable evolution. CONCLUSION In patients with disseminated infections caused by bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination or by environmental mycobacteria, there should be suspicion of an inborn error of immunity and the patient should be referred to a third level hospital for an early immunological assessment.","Allen-Manzur, Jesús Gerardo; Espinosa-Padilla, Sara Elva; Bustamante, Jacinta; Blancas-Galicia, Lizbeth; Mendieta-Flores, Elizabeth",Revista alergia Mexico,https://doi.org/10.29262/ram.v67i4.798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33631907/,144

Methods: The dates of hospitalization/isolation treatment of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases in different provinces in China reported as of 23 February, 2020 were collected. The Location Based Service (LBS) big data platform of ""Baidu Migration"" was employed to obtain the data of the proportion of the floating population from Wuhan to all parts of the country. Effective distance models and linear regression models were established to analyze the relationship between the effective distance and the arrival time of the epidemic as well as the number of cumulative confirmed cases at provincial and municipal levels. Results: The arrival time of the epidemic and the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 had significant linear relationship at both provincial and municipal levels in China, and the regression coefficients of each linear model were significant (P<0.001). At the provincial level, the effective distance could explain about 71% of the variation of the model with arrival time along with around 90% of the variation for the model in the cumulative confirmed case magnitude; at the municipal level, the effective distance could explain about 66% of the variation for the model in arrival time, and about 85% of the variation of the model with the cumulative confirmed case magnitude. Conclusions: The fitting degree of the models are good. The LBS big data and effective distance model can be used to estimate the track, time and extent of epidemic spread to provide useful reference for early warning, prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases.","Wang, Z K; Chen, Z S; Du, A H; Wang, C Y; Liu, H; Wang, Z W; Hu, J F",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200306-00269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340090/,144

These patients should undergo monitoring visits, blood sampling, questionnaire, physical examination, and drug and radiation administration. To avoid deviations from the protocol and trial discontinuation, follow-up should be performed regularly, in concordance with safety guidelines. Here we report several considerations.","Scarcia, Marcello; Ludovico, Giuseppe Mario; Fortunato, Angela; Fiorentino, Alba",Tumori,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300891620933672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32508257/,144

First, a state observer is introduced for each agent based on the output information of the agent. Then, a scaled consensus protocol is proposed via a truncated predictor output-feedback method, which can deal with the input delay. The integral terms with the mixed time delays that are contained in the transformed systems are analyzed by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals method, and sufficient conditions are obtained to achieve scaled consensus with guaranteed H∞ performance. An iterative procedure is utilized to calculate the linear matrix inequality. By this, the feedback gain and observer gain are then designed. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.","Chen, Shiming; Zhang, Zheng; Zheng, Yuanshi",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcyb.2020.3001643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609620/,144

METHODS AND MATERIALS Tumors were resected if possible, and intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT) was directed to the tumor or tumor bed in selected patients. Biologic mesh spacers comprised of cadaveric human skin treated to remove cells and preserve extracellular matrix (Alloderm; Lifecell, Branchburg, NJ) were then placed around the tumor or tumor bed. External radiation techniques included proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). RESULTS Patients had primary sarcomas (n = 2), radiation-associated sarcomas (n = 1), or isolated metastases (n = 2) in the retroperitoneum or pelvis. One patient received preoperative radiation. Three tumors were marginally resected (R1 resection) while 2 tumors were left in situ, and 3 patients received IOERT (10-17 Gy) to the tumor or tumor bed. Up to 4 sheets of biologic mesh were used as spacers around the tumor or tumor bed to displace small bowel, colon, ureter, bladder, or pancreas. The average distance of the 4 closest organs prior to mesh placement was 1.3-9 mm and after mesh placement was 8.0-23.5 mm. Preoperative or postoperative radiation 36-76 Gy was delivered by IMRT or PBRT. There were no early complications from mesh placement and late complications possibly related to radiation included 1 vertebral body compression fracture and 1 deep vein thrombosis. There were no mesh-related infections and none of the meshes required removal. All 5 patients currently remain free of disease progression after 3-38 months. CONCLUSIONS Biologic mesh spacers can be placed around tumors or tumor beds to displace radiation-sensitive organs and may allow for safer delivery of external beam radiation.","Yoon, Sam S; Chen, Yen-Lin; Kambadakone, Avinash; Schmidt, Benjamin; DeLaney, Thomas F",Practical radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prro.2012.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674365/,144

We describe a multicenter experience using a combined aspiration and stent retrieval technique for thrombectomy. DESIGN A retrospective analysis to identify patients receiving combined manual aspiration and stent retrieval for treatment of AIS between August 2012 and April 2013 at six high volume stroke centers was conducted. Outcome variables, including recanalization rate, post-treatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, discharge 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and mortality were evaluated. RESULTS 105 patients were found that met the inclusion criteria for this retrospective study. Successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score 2B) was achieved in 92 (88%) of these patients. 44% of patients had favorable (mRS score 0-2) outcomes at 90 days. There were five (4.8%) symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages and three procedure related deaths (2.9%). CONCLUSIONS Mechanical thrombectomy utilizing combined manual aspiration with a stent retriever is an effective and safe strategy for endovascular recanalization of large vessel occlusions presenting within the context of AIS.","Humphries, William; Hoit, Daniel; Doss, Vinodh T; Elijovich, Lucas; Frei, Donald; Loy, David; Dooley, Gwen; Turk, Aquilla S; Chaudry, Imran; Turner, Raymond; Mocco, J; Morone, Peter; Fiorella, David; Siddiqui, Adnan; Mokin, Maxim; Arthur, Adam S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463439/,144

163375,SARS-CoV-2 infects lung epithelial cells and induces senescence and an inflammatory response in patients with severe COVID-19,2021-05-18,"Background: According to guidelines, the use of steroid and/or hyaluronate (HA) intra-articular injections for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is controversial. Heterogeneity of studies and difference in HAs characteristics does not allow to draw safe conclusions. One of the major concerns is the accuracy of the procedure as up to 1/3 of injections could miss joint space when performed blindly (1), negatively affecting the efficacy of HA that needs to be placed correctly in the joint space Objectives: The aim of our study was to evaluate the longterm efficacy of a novel association of a Cross-Linked Sodium Hyaluronate Combined With Triamcinolone Hexacetonide (SHCTH) in patients with KOA in a real life setting. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and ultrasonographic (US) data of patients (pts) affected by symptomatic KOA with intra-articular injections of SHCTH (1 injection every 6 months). Pts with concomitant inflammatory arthropaties were excluded. US guidance was carried out with the in plane technique choosing either the lateral suprapatellar or midpatellar approach. All pts were evaluated for pain with a VAS 0-10 for pain at baseline and after 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, with the WOMAC questionnaire and with US, scoring joint effusion, synovial hypertrophy (SH) and power Doppler (PD) synovial signal. Due to the retrospective design, the WOMAC data were available as VAS or Likert scales;to allow comparability these values were standardized. Clinical and US variables at different time points were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sing test, the McNemar test or the paired samples t-test, depending on the variable. Results: 49 knees (43 pts, median age 70.6 years, 24 women) were included in the study. Kellgren Lawrence grade was 1 for 5 knees, 2 for 10, 3 for 17 and 4 for 9. SHCTH was delivered correctly in the joint space in all patients as assessed by US check during the injection and no side effects occurred. Of the 49 knees, 28 had an available 6 months follow-up, while 21 completed the 12 months follow-up, with an attrition mostly related to the COVID 19 pandemic. A rapid and sustained statistically significant decrease of both VAS pain and the WOMAC subscales was observed. The reduction of pain was already significant at 2 weeks, probably thanks to the corticosteroid component. At US evaluation, effusion significantly decreased at all time points. Although SH scores also significantly decreased, the effect on the proportion of affected joints was not as relevant. The reduction of PD was significant until month 9. Detailed results are presented in Table 1. Conclusion: Our data show that US guided SHCTH injections provide a rapid and sustained clinical response in patients with symptomatic OA. Besides the effect on pain, the US data confirm the effect of the drug on the inflammation. US guidance guaranteed the correct placement of the product in all patients and eliminated the bias of wrong placement that may occur with blind injections, thus allowing to draw safe conclusions on the efficacy of SHCTH for the treatment of KOA.","Porta, F.; Filippou, G.; Sakellariou, G.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.3035,144

The degree of bowing depends on the current supplied and the feed rate of the hot wire. Bowing occurs when the current is insufficient to melt the foam ahead of the wire and the mechanical interaction between the foam and the wire increases. This causes an increase in the tension in the wire and this is directly measured using a load cell arrangement. Based on this direct wire tension measurement a real time closed-loop feedback mechanism is implemented which regulates the current to maintain a constant wire tension and eliminates the bowing of the hot wire during the cutting process. For a particular feed rate the feedback mechanism precisely fine tunes the current supplied to the wire such that there is no mechanical drag force between the foam and the wire. The sensitivity of the feedback mechanism is high and responds to very minute contact between the foam and the wire and nominally regulates the current variation in the hot wire, hence, maintaining a constant kerf width throughout the cut. This mechanism allows to significantly improve the accuracy of the EPS part even in complex 3D cutting paths.","Karmakar, Namrata; Chetikena, Harish; M, Venkateshwaran; Subbiah, Sathyan",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314931; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314931,144

However, to date comprehensive regulation and management of multifaceted and often poorly understood ecosystems, such as the deep sea, has proven challenging. This is partly due to the complexity of coastal and ocean social-ecological systems, which are shaped by interactions between biophysical ecosystem processes and anthropogenic pressures, and at different geographical and temporal scales and administrative levels. In order to address the challenges posed by often-conflicting interests between economic activities and nature conservation at areas both national and beyond national jurisdiction, there is an urgent need for integrated approaches that bridge the gap between science, policy and practice. Consequently, the interest in multi, inter- and transdisciplinary research approaches at the national and international levels has been growing. This review will provide an overview of current shortcomings in coastal and ocean management and highlight project examples for incorporating inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches in the research design. From the project examples we identify challenges and good-practices in integrated research. Common subjects include addressing complexity, strengthening knowledge exchange, sustaining funding, increasing communication, ensuring policy relevance and involving the public. Based on this we propose key considerations for an integrated research design that is aimed at the effective translation between science, policy and society in support of sustainable coastal and ocean governance.","Rölfer, Lena Liconti Arianna Prinz Natalie Klöcker Clara Antonia",Frontiers in Marine Science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.693373,144

166479,Confronting COVID-19： Current Issues of SARS-CoV-2 Therapeutic Drug/Vaccine Development,2021,"During adolescence, heavy binge-like ethanol consumption can lead to frontocortical structural and functional impairments. These impairments are likely driven by adolescence being a critical time point for maturation of brain regions associated with higher-order cognitive functioning. Rodent models of heavy binge-like ethanol exposure show consistent disruptions to the typical development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). All deep cortical layers receive cholinergic projections that originate from the Nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) complex. These cholinergic projections are highly involved in learning, memory, and attention. Adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE) induces cholinergic dysfunction as a result of an epigenetic suppression of the genes that drive the cholinergic phenotype. The current study used a model of AIE to assess structural and functional changes to the frontal cortex and NbM following binge-like ethanol exposure in adolescence. Western blot analysis revealed long-term disruptions of the cholinergic circuit following AIE: choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was suppressed in the NbM and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) was suppressed in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In vivo microdialysis for acetylcholine efflux during a spatial memory task determined changes in cholinergic modulation within the PFC following AIE. However, AIE spared performance on the spatial memory task and on an operant reversal task. In a second study, Golgi-Cox staining determined that AIE increased apical dendritic complexity in the OFC, with sex influencing whether the increase in branching occurred near or away from the soma. Spine density or maturity was not affected, likely compensating for a disruption in neurotransmitter function following AIE. Significance Statement Adolescent ethanol exposure decreases cholinergic markers in the basal forebrain to orbital frontal cortical circuit, which lead to a massive suppression of behaviorally-activated tonic release acetylcholine and sex-dependent increases in dendritic branching. We concluded that cholinergic dysfunction is a contributor to cognitive impairments associated with heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence.

It is believed that sufficient supplies and equitable allocations of vaccines are necessary to limit the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of additional variants of concern. We have developed a COVID-19 vaccine based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that can be manufactured at high yields in embryonated eggs. Here we provide evidence that the NDV vector expressing an optimized spike antigen (NDV-HXP-S), upgraded from our previous construct, is a versatile vaccine that can be used live or inactivated to induce strong antibody responses and to also cross-neutralize variants of concern. The immunity conferred by NDV-HXP-S effectively counteracts SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice and hamsters. It is noteworthy that vaccine lots produced by existing egg-based influenza virus vaccine manufacturers in Vietnam, Thailand and Brazil exhibited excellent immunogenicity and efficacy in hamsters, demonstrating that NDV-HXP-S vaccines can be quickly produced at large-scale to meet global demands.","Sun, Weina; Liu, Yonghong; Amanat, Fatima; González-Domínguez, Irene; McCroskery, Stephen; Slamanig, Stefan; Coughlan, Lynda; Rosado, Victoria; Lemus, Nicholas; Jangra, Sonia; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Schotsaert, Michael; Martinez, Jose; Sano, Kaori; Mena, Ignacio; Innis, Bruce L; Wirachwong, Ponthip; Thai, Duong Huu; Oliveira, Ricardo Das Neves; Scharf, Rami; Hjorth, Richard; Raghunandan, Rama; Krammer, Florian; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Palese, Peter",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.06.451301,144

In particular, it focuses on a new project, aimed at constructing a Twitter Subjective Well-Being Index, which started in 2012-almost at the same time of expansion of sentiment analysis to Twitter data-and grew slowly till the present days. The project was originally conceived at the University of Milan (Italy) and then embraced later in 2015 by the University of Insubria (Como, Italy), the University of Tokyo and the University of Waseda in Japan. The book reviews the different approaches to the estimation of well-being, from traditional macro-economic definition-both one-dimensional and multidimensional-to survey analysis and finally to big data and social networking sites (SNS) in particular. It introduces briefly the most commonly used machine learning and statistical techniques for textual analysis. It also serves two scopes: to explain how machines transforms text into meaningful statistics, and also to convey the idea that human supervision is an essential step of this process whatever technique is used. The book presents different SNS-based subjective well-being indexes that have been proposed in the literature, with a special focus on the one proposed by the authors. Among all positive aspects of SNS data, there are also some pitfalls which are quite easy to imagine, and well known to the experts in the field. The main one is that social media accounts/users/data cannot be considered statistically representative of the demographic population. The book presents a possible approach to tackle the selection bias problem by anchoring social media indexes to official statistics. It focuses on the analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, that hit the world in 2020, on the social media indexes of subjective well-being.

As a result of the analysis, a significant influence of social capital on minimizing disaster conflict experience could be identified. In particular, the types of social capital at play were different. In the case of a large-scale disaster, the “network” had a significant impact on reducing the experience of disaster conflict, whereas, in the case of a small-scale disaster, “trust” in neighbors and communities had a significant impact on reducing the experience of disaster conflict. Based on these results, it was confirmed once again that it is very important not only to establish physical and human infrastructure and systems, but also to establish social capital within the community for disaster management.","Lee, Dae Woong Kim Hwa Yeon",International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102445,144

Here, we used thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase sequencing (TGIRT-seq) combined with peak calling to simultaneously profile all RNA biotypes in apheresis-prepared human plasma pooled from healthy individuals. Extending previous TGIRT-seq analysis, we found that human plasma contains largely fragmented mRNAs from >19,000 protein-coding genes, abundant full-length, mature tRNAs and other structured small non-coding RNAs, and less abundant tRNA fragments and mature and pre-miRNAs. Many of the mRNA fragments identified by peak calling correspond to annotated protein-binding sites and/or have stable predicted secondary structures that could afford protection from plasma nucleases. Peak calling also identified novel repeat RNAs, miRNA-sized RNAs, and putatively structured intron RNAs of potential biological, evolutionary, and biomarker significance, including a family of full-length excised introns RNAs, subsets of which correspond to mirtron pre-miRNAs or agotrons.","Yao, Jun; Wu, Douglas C.; Nottingham, Ryan M.; Lambowitz, Alan M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.25.171439,144

(Special Issue: SARS-CoV-2.),2020,"Germline copy number variants (CNVs) increase risk for many diseases, yet detection of CNVs and quantifying their contribution to disease risk in large-scale studies is challenging. We developed an approach called CNPBayes to identify latent batch effects, to provide probabilistic estimates of integer copy number across the estimated batches, and to fully integrate the copy number uncertainty in the association model for disease. We demonstrate this approach in a Pancreatic Cancer Case Control study of 7,598 participants where the major sources of technical variation were not captured by study site and varied across the genome. Candidate associations aided by this approach include deletions of 8q24 near regulatory elements of the tumor oncogene MYC and of Tumor Supressor Candidate 3 (TUSC3).

However, most of the assays with Cas enzymes were performed in bulk assays using multistep approaches and hard to realize quantitative detection. Herein, we report Microfluidics-Enabled Digital Isothermal Cas13a Assay (MEDICA), a digital format of SHERLOCK with enhanced robustness and sensitivity. We first address the macromolecular crowding problems when combining the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and Cas13a detection into a one-pot SHERLOCK assay. After the assay optimization, the enhanced one-pot SHERLOCK (E-SHERLOCK) achieves high robustness and 200-fold increased sensitivity. Leveraging droplet microfluidics, we streamline the E-SHERLOCK to eliminate undesired input targets caused by pre-amplification before partition, enabling background-free absolute quantification. From the real-time monitoring, MEDICA enables qualitative detection within 10 min and absolute quantification within 25 min. For the proof of concept, we applied MEDICA to quantify HPV 16 and 18 viral loads in 44 clinical samples, indicating perfect accordance with qPCR results. MEDICA highlights the CRISPR-based isothermal assays are promising for the next generation of point-of-care diagnostics.","Liu, F. X.; Cui, J. Q.; Park, H.; Chan, K. W.; Leung, T.; Tang, B.

The Weight Achievement and Intensive Treatment (Why WAIT) program is a 12-week multidisciplinary weight management program that has been implemented in real-world clinical practice and has shown long-term maintenance of weight reduction for 5 years. During COVID-19 pandemic, the program went virtual using telemedicine and mobile-applications (Healthimation and Good Measures™). We evaluated the outcomes of virtual program (VP) in comparison to in-person physical program (PP). Sixteen subjects were enrolled in VP and were compared to 22 subjects who completed the last 2 PPs. Body weight decreased by -16.49±8 lbs. (-7 % ± 0.3%) from baseline in VP (p<0.001) compared to -15.2± 7.8 lbs. (-6 % ± 0.3%) in PP (p<0.001) (p= 0.6 between groups). A1C decreased by -1.03% ± 1.2% from baseline in VP (p=0.002), and by -1.0% ± 1.2% in PP (p=0.001) (p=0.9 between groups). At the end of the intervention, CGM analysis showed TIR (70-180 mg/dL) was 87%±14% in VP and 72%±23% in PP (p=0.6 between them). BP and lipid profile improved in both groups with no significant difference between them. The number of anti-hyperglycemic medications reduced by -0.9± 0.6 in VP and by -0.8± 0.8 in PP (p=0.5 between them). Among insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, 5 patients (50%) in VP and 5 patients (33.3%) in PP stopped insulin at 12 wks (p=0.4 between them). Patients in VP reported reduced barriers to exercise from a score of 17.2±12.2 to 4.6±3.9 (p<0.001). In conclusion, virtual multidisciplinary ILI is as effective as the in-person physical program in improving body weight, A1C, BP, lipid profile and in reducing the number of anti-hyperglycemic medications. These results suggest that scaling the Why WAIT program in a virtual format to a larger population of patients with diabetes and obesity is potentially as successful as the costly in-person program.","Al-Badri, Marwa Kilroy Cara L.; Shahar, Jacqueline I.; Tomah, Shaheen Gardner Hannah Sin Mallory Votta Jennie L.; Phillips-Stoll, Aliza Price Aaron M.; Beaton, Joan M.; Davis, Chandra L.; Rizzotto, Jo-Anne M.; Hamdy, Osama",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-252-or,144

We utilize the temporal data of coronavirus spread from January 22, 2020 to May 20, 2020. We model the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, and perform prediction using ARIMA and Prophet time series forecasting models. Effectiveness of the models are evaluated based on the mean absolute error, root mean square error, root relative squared error, and mean absolute percentage error. Our analysis can help in understanding the trends of the disease outbreak, and provide epidemiological stage information of adopted countries. Our investigations show that ARIMA model is more effective for forecasting COVID-19 prevalence.

(Special Issue: SARS-CoV-2.),2020,"The prevailing pandemic (COVID-19) has increased socioeconomic problems and caused psychological distress due to work uncertainty, specifically in emerging economies. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in emerging economies have been severely affected. Particularly, work uncertainty is becoming a hindrance towards proactive work behaviour (PWB) that can be improved by an effective entrepreneurial leadership role and proactive personality attribute. Based on fortifying self-determination theory, this research answered the question to what extent proactive personality moderates the relationship between work uncertainty and PWB and strengthens the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and PWB. To empirically examine the study’s underlying theoretical framework, respondents were selected from SMEs working in Pakistan from the high-tech industry. Multisource data were accumulated from 420 workers and their leaders utilizing a two-wave, time-lagged research design. Conclusions revealed that entrepreneurial leadership first reduced individuals’ work uncertainty, which in turn, led to enhanced proactive work behaviour of employees. Furthermore, the results revealed that work uncertainty mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and proactive work behaviour. Moreover, proactive personality moderates the link concerning work uncertainty and proactive work behaviour, such that this association is significant only when proactive personality is low. Additionally, the moderated mediation analysis indicated that less proactive people, compared with their extraordinarily proactive colleagues, trusted entrepreneurial leadership to be more proactive in the workplace. These findings have important implications to induce PWB among employees. © 2021 by the authors.

By March 2021, per capita cases and deaths were greater in nonmetro than in metro areas. Multi-variate regression analysis found that political views were the most important variable explaining per capita COVID-19 cases, while measures of disadvantage were the best predictors of COVID-19 deaths. Counties with high proportions of Trump voters had higher per capita cases, and in nonmetro areas, these counties had higher death rates. Overall, the best predictor of COVID-19 death rates is low levels of educational attainment, high poverty rates, and high minority populations.","Albrecht, Don E.",Rural Sociology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12404,144

Up-to-date and statistically robust Rt from the curve of daily cases can be estimated as soon as new cases are added to the curve. That is equivalent to estimating Rt by averaging all detected cases of infection, without any distortion induced by the difficulty of following and weighting trees of secondary cases from original ones, and without needing to wait for secondary cases to manifest infection. With this method, if Rt scaled numbers are of interest, only the average duration of infectivity of subjects has to be estimated directly, but independently of linking secondary cases to primary ones. A new index, instantaneous reproduction number Rist is introduced, which does not depend on the duration of infectivity of subjects. Rist, Rt and the doubling/halving time of the epidemics may be estimated by simple computations at the very detection time of new daily cases. Any smoothed curve of daily cases gives smooth Rt and Rist.

The process utilizes water as a transient binder to fuse particles eliminating the possible contamination caused by traditional organic binders. Inkjet printing was employed to selectively deposit water into a powder bed. Bentonite clay powder was used as a model material for the study, due to its excellent solubility in water. An analysis of the effects of pressure and heat on powder fusion was completed using the compression strength as a quantitative measure. A processing map was created to provide a preliminary understanding of the relationship between the combination of heat and pressure and selective fusion of powder. Test cases were printed to show the capabilities of the developed process. A prediction of the parts compressive strength was done based on previous data collected. Results proved that an increase in temperature culminates a higher compression strength. Results also showed that an increase in pressure contributes to a postponed evaporation of water in the part; once the evaporation has taken place, a denser part has a more dramatic increase in compressive strength.","Kirby, Levi; Fei, Fan; Wang, Chao; Song, Xuan",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315687; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315687,144

(Special Issue: SARS-CoV-2.),2020,"South African higher education (HE) cannot be compared to any other country's HE systems due to the unique political landscape and structural narrative that it has undergone. Subsequent to the reorganisation of HEIs in 2004, a number of complexities arose. These included accessibility to education across race and the alignment of the South African HEIs to global pedagogic benchmarks. With the changing political landscape, transformations within higher education, socio economic inequities and changes in the workplace, researchers failed to cognize the impact of these factors on graduate employability. Changing graduate attributes to align with a decolonised curriculum and Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) workspaces were transiently underway when COVID-19 set a new narrative for the future of employability. This paper seeks to identify the impact of workplace changes and its direct influence on successful graduate employment and integration into the HE curriculum. The work environment has cursorily moved from 4IR to an advanced stage of the 4IR, where there is a full emphasis on digitisation, non-localised workspaces and is an ostensible playground for digital natives (Generation Z). This paper provides a systematic review of literature in the South African HE contexts that pertains to graduate attributes for employability within the workplace. The adoption of malleable secondary data will allow for an understanding of the relationship between changing workplace environments and expectations from graduates. This correlation is directly linked to graduate attributes which students need to comply with from year one. The paper will provide context to changes which are required for the future success of graduates, and whether graduate attributes are adequate preparation for employability. A clinical model is recommended with an intervention to manage the risk factors of decolonisation of curriculum, the 4IR and multi-generational workplace and responses to COVID-19. © 2021 Deakin University.

The first wave of the pandemic began during the beginning of March 2020, and included significant preventative measures. Previous research on mental health differences between the genders has found that women were more likely to exhibit symptoms of anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak.ObjectivesThe aim of our study was to assess the differences between the genders in depression, anxiety, and stress.MethodsAn online survey designed for the purposes of this study was distributed using the snowballing method during April and May of 2020. The survey consisted of two parts: sociodemographic and clinical data, and COVID-19 related data. Participants also filled out the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) - a well validated, self-questionnaire instrument. T-test for independent samples was used to evaluate the differences between the genders.ResultsOut of the initially sent 563 surveys, a total of 161 were included in further analyses (28.6% response rate). Mean age of the sample was 42.2±10.2 and 65.2% of the participants were female. Mean scores on DASS-21 were as follows: 8.78±6.66 on depression, 9.78±7.39 on anxiety and 7.76±7.14 on stress.

The population of this study is students in Bali who had attended online lectures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample size consists of 260 people selected with a purposive sampling method. The analysis is using SEM-PLS. The results shows that perceived value had a positive and significant effect on WOM. Perceived value also has a positive and significant effect on student satisfaction and student satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on WOM. There are several variables that need to be added, such as the online system itself, the quality and ease of use of online media. Satisfaction can mediate the effect of perceived value on WOM partially. Therefore, it is important for higher education institutions in Bali to increase the perceived value obtained by students, especially in the functional value, to increase student satisfaction and ultimately have an impact on increasing positive WOM about online lectures.","Giantari, Igak Yasa N.

This presents a significant barrier to the acceptance of SAVs, particularly autonomous public and on-demand transport (ODT), which is a major focus for Transport for New South Wales (TfNSW). Given this potential barrier, we interviewed (N = 13) operators, academics, and regulators with TfNSW to assess their role and abilities in overcoming sharing anxiety. However, our findings revealed a relative lack of awareness from experts in the mobility industry about the existence of sharing anxiety in users, suggesting additional barriers to adoption. We make suggestions for policy considerations for stakeholders that could mitigate sharing anxiety: promoting dynamic ridepooling products in commercial services, using tax breaks as incentivization;requiring ODT services and operators in jurisdiction to use a standardized, unified interface for users (“single-app”);shared, on-demand transport services likely need longer incubation/pilot periods in order for the sharing behavior to become culturally established.

Among the 200 evaluable patients, 185 (92.5%) had FHH documented in the medical record. The median age was 52 years (range 23-93). Eighty-nine (44.5%) included three generations, 154 (77%) relatives' gender, 109 (54.5%) relatives' lineage, and 77 (38.5%) pertinent negatives (Figure 1). Among 147 patients reporting a history of cancer in their family, 23 (15.6%) included age of relatives' cancer diagnosis. Among 75 patients listing deceased relatives, 13 (17.3%) included age of death and 48 (64%) cause of death. Age and personal cancer diagnosis were not associated with quality of FHH. Patients with family history of cancer scored higher in quality of FHH than those without family history (median=3.0 [IQR 3.0;4.0] vs. 1.0 [0.0;2.0], P <0.001) and were more likely to have inclusion of three generations (57.1% vs. 9.4%, P <0.001). Forty-three patients (21.5%) had previously undergone genetic testing and these patients had higher FHH scores than those without prior genetic testing (3.0 [3.0;4.0] vs. 3.0 [1.0;4.0], P=0.01) and were more likely to include age of relatives' cancer diagnosis (27.0% vs. 11.0%, P =0.04), age of relatives' death (35.7% vs. 13.1%, P=0.04), and cause of relatives' death (92.3% vs. 58.1%, P=0.02). Overall, patients with higher quality FHH had increased likelihood of being referred to genetic assessment (4.0 [3.0;4.75] vs. 3.0 [1.0;4.0], P=0.002). [Display omitted] Our data are consistent with the literature suggesting that standard collection of family history may not adequately capture all measures of a high quality oncologic FHH. Patients without prior genetic testing and no family history of cancer had the lowest scores for FHH quality and might benefit from a web-based FHH collection tool, allowing them to contact relatives for more information prior to an office visit and permitting better patient preparation and efficiency. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, tools that minimize inoffice time are increasingly important. A prospective evaluation of a web-based FHH collection tool to address these issues is ongoing.

182992,"Survey of WU and KI polyomaviruses, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and parechovirus in children under 5 years of age in Tehran, Iran",2020-04-11,"Wastewater surveillance has been widely implemented for monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 during the global COVID-19 pandemic, and near-to-source monitoring is of particular interest for outbreak management in discrete populations. However, variation in population size poses a challenge to the triggering of public heath interventions using wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. This is especially important for near-to-source sites that are subject to significant daily variability in upstream populations. Focusing on a university campus in England, this study investigates methods to account for variation in upstream populations at a site with highly transient footfall and provides a better understanding of the impact of variable populations on the SARS-CoV-2 trends provided by wastewater-based epidemiology. The potential for complementary data to help direct response activities within the near-to-source population is also explored, and potential concerns arising due to the presence of heavily diluted samples during wet weather are addressed. Using wastewater biomarkers, it is demonstrated that population normalisation can reveal significant differences between days where SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are very similar. Confidence in the trends identified is strongest when samples are collected during dry weather periods; however, wet weather samples can still provide valuable information. It is also shown that building-level occupancy estimates based on complementary data aids identification of potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 and can enable targeted actions to be taken to identify and manage potential sources of pathogen transmission in localised communities.","Sweetapple, C.; Melville-Shreeve, P.; Chen, A.; Grimsley, J.

Significant effort in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research has been devoted to addressing this problem through abusive content detection and related sub-areas, such as the detection of hate speech, toxicity, cyberbullying, etc. Although current technologies achieve high classification performance in research studies, it has been observed that the real-life application of this technology can cause unintended harms, such as the silencing of under-represented groups. We review a large body of NLP research on automatic abuse detection with a new focus on ethical challenges, organized around eight established ethical principles: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. In many cases, these principles relate not only to situational ethical codes, which may be context-dependent, but are in fact connected to universal human rights, such as the right to privacy, freedom from discrimination, and freedom of expression. We highlight the need to examine the broad social impacts of this technology, and to bring ethical and human rights considerations to every stage of the application life-cycle, from task formulation and dataset design, to model training and evaluation, to application deployment. Guided by these principles, we identify several opportunities for rights-respecting, socio-technical solutions to detect and confront online abuse, including `nudging', `quarantining', value sensitive design, counter-narratives, style transfer, and AI-driven public education applications.","Kiritchenko, Svetlana; Nejadgholi, Isar; Fraser, Kathleen C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12305v2.pdf,144

Materials and Methods: On completion of the preclinical endodontic course, 39 students were E-mailed an online questionnaire investigating their overall satisfaction with online modalities used for emergency remote teaching. They were requested to evaluate their satisfaction with three methods of lecture delivery: conventional face to face, online synchronized and online asynchronized, in terms of comprehension and retention of knowledge, communication with the lecturer, time convenience, Internet or technical support, transportation for face-to-face lectures, and stress-free learning. Students' scores were compared to scores of students who took the course before the pandemic and received only conventional face-to-face teaching. Data were statistically analyzed. Results: A response rate of 100% showed that 87% of the students were satisfied with the online modalities used for emergency remote teaching. Students were significantly less satisfied with online-asynchronized lectures in terms of communication with the lecturer (P < 0.001) and with online-synchronized lectures in terms of time convenience (P < 0.001). The students' examination performance was not affected by shifting to emergency remote teaching (P = 0.076). Conclusion: Dental students were satisfied with online modalities used for emergency remote teaching in the preclinical endodontic course and their academic performance was not adversely affected. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

There are many ways to detect human body temperatures, such as mercury, digital, and infrared thermometers. Internet of Things is widely applied in many aspects, including health care. Many challenging innovations can be studied to enhance temperature monitoring systems. This paper proposes a possible design architecture to implement an IoT Infrared (IR) thermal camera detection. The investigation is performed to observe relative accuracy and distances to detect samples of the human body and object at various temperatures. The LWIR micro thermal camera module is used to detect temperatures comparing to a digital thermometer. The experimentation results show effective detection of IR thermal camera system conditions based on IoT measuring human body temperatures of different distance ranges. However, our research suggests many concerns about using IoT sensors, such as the practical correctness of sensors, types of sensors, and distances of detecting objects. IoT temperature sensors need to be cautiously calibrated to better meet a better effective accuracy compared to a digital thermometer. © 2021 ACM.","Netinant, P.; Vasprasert, P.; Rukhiran, M.","5th International Conference on E-Commerce, E-Business and E-Government, ICEEG 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3466029.3466043,144
184156,Economic impact of respiratory syncytial virus-related illness in the US: an analysis of national databases.,2004,"The recent decline in honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colony health worldwide has had a significant impact on the beekeeping industry as well as on pollination-dependent crop sectors in North America and Europe. The pollinator crisis has been attributed to many environmental and anthropological factors including less nutrient rich agricultural monocultures, pesticide exposure, new parasite and pathogen infestations as well as beekeeper management and weather. Canadian beekeepers have indicated that issues with honey bee queens are the most significant factor affecting their colony health. In Canada, beekeepers manage colony losses by relying on the importation of foreign bees, particularly queens from warmer climates, to lead new replacement colonies. Unfortunately, the risks associated with imported queens include the introduction of new and potentially resistant pests and diseases, undesirable genetics including bees with limited adaptations to Canada’s unique climate and bees negatively affected by transportation. Importing a large proportion of our queens each year also creates an unsustainable dependency on foreign bee sources, putting our beekeeping and pollination sectors at an even greater risk in the case of border closures and restrictions. Increasing the domestic supply of queens is one mitigation strategy that could provide Canadian beekeepers, farmers and consumers with a greater level of agricultural stability through locally bred, healthier queens. Our study is the first rigorous analysis of the economic feasibility of Canadian queen production. We present the costs of queen production for three case study operations across Canada over two years as well as the profitability implications. Our results show that for a small to medium sized queen production operation in Canada, producing queen cells and mated queens can be profitable. Using a mated queen market price ranging from $30 to $50, a producer selling mated queens could earn a profit of between $2 and $40 per queen depending on price and the cost structure of his operation. If the producer chose to rear queens for his own operation, the cost savings would also be significant as imported queen prices continue to rise. Our case studies reveal that there is potential for both skilled labour acquisition over time in queen production as well as cost savings from economies of scale. Our queen producers also reduced their production costs by re-using materials year to year. Domestic queen production could be one viable strategy to help address the current pollinator crisis in Canada.","Bixby, Miriam; Hoover, Shelley E.; McCallum, Robyn; Ibrahim, Abdullah; Ovinge, Lynae; Olmstead, Sawyer; Pernal, Stephen F.; Zayed, Amro; Foster, Leonard J.; Guarna, M.

Is influenza A co infected with respiratory syncytial virus?,2012,"Background National data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and knowledge on associated risk factors are important for understanding the course of the pandemic. Testing Denmark is a national large-scale epidemiological surveillance study of SARS-CoV-2 in the Danish population. Methods Between September and October 2020, approximately 1.3 million of 5.8 million Danish citizens (age > 15 years) were randomly invited to fill in an electronic questionnaire covering COVID-19 exposures and symptoms. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined by Point-of Care rapid Test (POCT) distributed to participants home addresses. Findings In total 318,552 participants (24.5% invitees) completed the questionnaire and provided the result of the POCT. Of these, 2,519 (0.79%) were seropositive (median age 55 years) and women were more often seropositive than men, interquartile range (IQR) 42-64, 40.2% males. Of participants with a prior positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test (n=1,828), 29.1% were seropositive in the POCT. Seropositivity increased with age irrespective of sex. Elderly participants (>61 years) reported less symptoms and had less frequently been tested for SARS-CoV-2 compared to younger participants. Seropositivity was associated with physical contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (Risk ratio (RR) 7.43, 95% CI: 6.57-8.41) and in particular household members (RR 17.70, 95% CI: 15.60-20.10). Home care workers had a higher risk of seropositivity (RR 2.09 (95% CI: 1.58-2.78) as compared to office workers. Geographic population density was not associated to seropositivity. A high degree of compliance with national preventive recommendations was reported (e.g., > 80% use of face masks), but no difference was found between seropositive and seronegative participants. Interpretation This study provides insight into the immunity of the Danish population seven to eight months after the first COVID-19 case in Denmark. The seroprevalence was lower than expected probably due to a low sensitivity of the POCT used or due to challenges relating to the reading of test results. Occupation or exposure in local communities were major routes of infection. As elderly participants were more often seropositive despite fewer symptoms and less PCR tests performed, more emphasis should be placed on testing this age group.","Fogh, K.; Strange, J.

The study adopted Wong’s CasMac model of PP2.0 and designed a series of English lessons which aimed to understand the meaning of life through the perspectives of PP2.0 and its focus on MCPE. The participants were 38 university students, with upper-intermediate English proficiency, enrolled in an English speaking class. They participated in the English program for 15 weeks and 2 h each week. The quantitative data was collected from survey of the CasMac Measure of Character and analyzed with the paired t-test method, and the qualitative data analysis was collected from students’ weekly learning sheets and journals. The results show that the integration of MCPE and PP2.0 in a university English class is feasible to enhance students’ understanding of mature happiness through the CasMac model and to promote their meanings in life. According to the research findings, it is suggested that the CasMac model can be applied to other fields or other groups who need help to enhance life meaning and improve wellbeing. Particularly under the pandemic of COVID-19, there are people encountering traumas, losses, and sorrows and it is crucial to transform sufferings with the support of approaching mature happiness. © Copyright © 2021 Chen, Chang and Wu.","Chen, C.

This paper discusses different opinions of some contemporary scholars on this issue from the Maqāṣidī perspective. It adopts an analytical method to explain the opinions. Findings show that contemporary scholars are of two group: The first group permits the mosques’ closure for realizing the divine objective concerning to life protection out of danger. The second thinks that the mosques’s closure amounts to suspension of congregational prayer as one of Islamic essential exterior rites. The findings illustrate that the life protection constitutes a necessary benefit because putting life in danger is a very serious harm. The life protection is more important than congregational prayer’s objective which complements the necessary objective of religious protection. Moreover, it shares the spirit with the principle saying that any means to achieving what is compulsory also becomes compulsory accordingly. Above all, prohibition of congregational prayer is just a momentary legal permit due to a necessity on its merit the research recommends that religious institution should make people aware to take all measures in stopping the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.","Bouhedda, Ghalia; Obaid, Al-Marri Turki; Habeebullah, Zakariyah",Al-Ihkam: Jurnal Hukum dan Pranata Sosial,https://doi.org/10.19105/al-lhkam.v15i2.4018,144

An analysis of the course of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) was carried out in 16 patients with HIV infection who were hospitalized at the St. Petersburg State Budgetary Healthcare Institution Center for the Prevention and Control of AIDS and Infectious Diseases from April to October 2020. All patients underwent a study of biological material from the oropharynx and nasopharynx for COVID-19 and diagnosed based on a positive PCR result. Results. In HIV-infected patients with diagnosed coronavirus infection caused by COVID-19, signs of progression of HIV infection, clinical, immunological, virological (75%), opportunistic diseases and comorbidities (chronic viral hepatitis in the cirrhotic decompensated stage, cardiovascular diseases and others) (94%). A small sample of patients did not allow to determine with reliable accuracy the mutual influence of existing diseases and pathologies, but, of course, multiple comorbid pathologies play a role in the development of severe conditions and unfavorable outcomes. A clinical case is presented. Conclusion. The provoking factors have been identified that play a role in the development of infection and more severe forms of coronavirus infection caused by COVID-19 in HIV-infected patients (injecting drug use, alcohol abuse, late stage of HIV infection (4B, 4C) and progression of earlier stages (4A), a low number of CD4 lymphocytes (less than 200 cells / μl), multiple comorbid pathology (HIV infection, opportunistic diseases, comorbidities, especially chronic liver damage in the stage of decompensated cirrhosis), absence, interrupted antiretroviral therapy, multiple changes of regimens, absence prevention of opportunistic diseases).

186056,Persistent cryptosporidiosis in horses with severe combined immunodeficiency.,1991,"Using peritoneal macrophage cultures it was found that both PRI mice and their macrophages in culture were susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus and that C(3)H mice and macrophages were resistant. All F(1) macrophages and some back-cross cell cultures were susceptible. The degeneration of F(1) and back-cross macrophages obtained either from adult mouse peritoneal exudate or newborn mouse liver, occurred more slowly than PRI macrophages. Segregation of susceptibility occurred in the first back-cross generation. Tests of three back-cross generations from susceptible mice yielded about one-quarter of the mice shown to be susceptible either by direct test or test of their macrophages. A clear correlation between susceptibility in vivo and in vitro was established both in the test of the percentage segregation and in tests of individual back-cross mice. A small series of tests, however, indicated that 50 per cent of the back-cross mice had the genetic capacity to transmit susceptibility. Thus a hypothesis of two genes for susceptibility, although not excluded, may yield to a hypothesis of a single dominant gene, incompletely expressed. Resistant cells were converted into susceptible cells by ingestion of a relatively large particle containing a heat-stable substance. This susceptibility, although complete, was temporary. The nature of the factor causing the change has been discussed.","Kantoch, M.; Warwick, A.; Bang, F. B.",J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2137639/,144

186863,Human bocavirus.,2008,"Infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) shows extensive genotypic and phenotypic variability. The evolutionary process involves generation of genetic diversity by mutations and recombination followed by replication of those phenotypes favored by selection. In the current study, we examined changes occurring in a wild Arkansas (Ark) challenge strain in chickens that were vaccinated either ocularly with commercially available attenuated ArkDPI-derived vaccines or in ovo with a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus expressing a codon-optimized IBV Ark S1 gene (AdArkIBV.S1(ck)). Commercial IBV Ark vaccines A, B, and C provided slightly differing levels of protection against homologous challenge. Most importantly for the current study, chickens vaccinated with the different vaccines displayed significant differences in specific B-lymphocyte responses in the Harderian gland (i.e., the challenge virus encountered differing immune selective pressure during invasion among host groups). Based on S1 sequences, five predominant populations were found in different individual vaccinated/challenged chickens. Chickens with the strongest immune response (vaccine A) were able to successfully impede replication of the challenge virus in most chickens, and only the population predominant in the challenge strain was detected in a few IBV-positive birds. In contrast, in chickens showing less than optimal specific immune responses (vaccines B and C) IBV was detected in most chickens, and populations different from the predominant one in the challenge strain were selected and became predominant. These results provide scientific evidence for the assumption that poor vaccination contributes to the emergence of new IBV strains via mutation and/or selection. In ovo vaccination with a low dose of AdArkIBV.S1(ck) resulted in a mild increase of systemic antibody and reduced viral shedding but no protection against IBV signs and lesions. Under these conditions we detected only virus populations identical to the challenge virus. Possible explanations are discussed. From a broad perspective, these results indicate that selection is an important force driving IBV evolution.","Toro, Haroldo; Pennington, Daniela; Gallardo, Rodrigo A; van Santen, Vicky L; van Ginkel, Frederik W; Zhang, JianFeng; Joiner, Kellye S",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23050466/,144

This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility of early extubation followed by immediate NIV, compared conventional weaning, in patients with resolving hypoxemic ARF. METHODS Twenty consecutive hypoxemic patients were randomly assigned to receive either conventional weaning or NIV. The changes in arterial blood gases and respiratory rate were compared between the two groups at 1, 12, 24 and 48 h. Differences in the rate of extubation failure, ICU and hospital mortality, number of invasive-ventilation-free-days at day 28, septic complications, number of tracheotomies, days and rates of continuous intravenous sedation, and ICU length of stay were also determined. RESULTS No patient interrupted the study protocol. Arterial blood gases were similar during invasive mechanical ventilation, 1 h after NIV application following extubation, and after 12, 24 and 48 h. Respiratory rate was higher after 1 h in the NIV group, but no different after 12, 24 and 48 h. The number of invasive-ventilation-free-days at day 28 was 20 ± 8 (min = 0, max = 25) days in the treatment group and 10 ± 9 (min = 0, max = 25) days in the control group (p = 0.014). The rate of extubation failure, ICU and hospital mortality, tracheotomies, septic complications, days and rates of continuous sedation, and ICU length of stay were not significantly different between the two groups.

The 11.7-kb SIN genome was transcribed in vitro as two nonoverlapping RNA fragments. RNA-1 contained the entire 11.4-kb protein coding sequence of SIN and also carried an additional 1.8-kb nonviral sequence at its 3' end. RNA-2 carried the remaining 0.26 or 0.3 kb of the SIN genome containing the 3'NTR. Transfection of these two fragments into BHK cells resulted in vivo RNA-RNA recombination and release of infectious SIN recombinants. Eighteen plaque-purified recombinant viruses were sequenced to precisely map the RNA-RNA crossover sites at the 3'NTR. Sixteen of the 18 recombinants were found to be genetically heterogeneous at the 3'NTR. Two major clustered sites within the 3'NTR of RNA-2 were found to be fused to multiple locations on the nonviral sequence of RNA-1, resulting in insertions of 10 to 1,085 nucleotides at the 3'NTR. Sequence analysis of crossover sites suggested only limited homology and heteroduplex-forming capability between substrate RNAs. Analysis of additional 23 recombinant viruses generated by mutagenized donor and acceptor templates supports the occurrence of recombination hot spots on donor templates. Introduction of a 17-nucleotide rudimentary replicase recognition signal in the acceptor template alone did not induce the polymerase to reinitiate at the 17-nucleotide signal. Interestingly, deletion of a 24-nucleotide hot spot locus on the donor template abolished crossover events at one of the two sites and allowed the polymerase to reinitiate at the 17-nucleotide replicase recognition signal inserted at the acceptor template. The possible roles of RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions in the differential regulation of apparent pausing, template selection, and reinitiation are discussed.","Hajjou, M; Hill, K R; Subramaniam, S V; Hu, J Y; Raju, R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8764023/,144

Objective To describe the clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with rheumatic diseases and severe COVID-19. Material and methods Observational and descriptive case series in patients with rheumatic diseases and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by PCR or pulmonary tomography, hospitalized in Mexico City from March to August 2020. Results 15 patients with a mean age of 57 years (SD ± 11) were included, 66.6% were women, and 80% had a positive PCR test. The time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization, on average, was 7.2 days (SD ± 2.1). 46.6% died. Patients who died had a lower mean platelet level compared to survivors. The inflammatory reactants were higher in the deceased. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality for the variables related to rheumatic disease. Conclusions The differences in mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 in this series of cases seem to be related to the infection and not to the rheumatic disease.","Galicia-Lucas, Uriel Josette; Ramírez-Pérez, Astrid Asminda",Revista medica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231984/,144

The complex world of infectious diseases.",2003,"There remains controversy as to when patients undergoing cardiac surgery should receive a transfusion and whether a low hematocrit and its treatment with a transfusion of red cells influences outcome. The data related to this controversy are reviewed. Although the risk of known viral transmission is currently low, stored red cells do not function normally, and each unit contains activated inflammatory cells and mediators. These changes cause limited oxygen release, impaired microcirculatory flow, and immune suppression. A number of studies have observed decreased survival associated with transfusions in trauma, coronary artery bypass grafting, and intensive care unit patients. Studies that show an adverse outcome associated with low hematocrit are not definitive, because they fail to distinguish between the impact of low hematocrit per se and the possible adverse effects of transfusion, for what the low hematocrit may simply be a surrogate. The observation that a low hematocrit is associated with an adverse outcome does not necessarily prove that ""treatment"" of the anemia with a red cell transfusion will improve the outcome. Stored platelets contain a highly activated mixture of platelets with storage lesions and inflammatory mediators. Two retrospective post hoc multifactorial analyses suggest that platelet transfusions are associated with substantial increased morbidity and mortality. Clearly, large prospective studies are required to define the proper trigger for blood product transfusion to balance the adverse effects of anemia and platelet deficiency or dysfunction with the adverse effects of transfusion of blood products on morbidity and mortality associated with cardiac surgery and anesthesia.","Spiess, Bruce D",Seminars in cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15583789/,144

190267,Serum respiratory virus antibodies: predictor of reduced one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in Norwegian adults.,1996,"BACKGROUND The extralevator abdominoperineal excision (ELAPE) procedure creates an extensive soft tissue defect of the pelvic floor. It has been suggested that primary reconstruction reduces the risk of wound infection and delayed wound healing in this high-risk area. Use of myocutaneous flaps or omentoplasty are associated with functional limitations and complications. We performed the perineal variant of the lotus petal flap, which was originally described for vulvar reconstruction. We aimed to verify if application of the lotus petal flap in pelvic floor reconstruction after ELAPE meets the goals of an ideal reconstruction. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of 28 patients who underwent the lotus petal flap procedure for pelvic floor reconstruction after ELAPE between January 2011 and March 2014. RESULTS Median age was 62.1 years and 78.6 % of patients were female. In most patients the tumor was preoperatively irradiated (89.3 %) and in 28.6 % of the reconstructions a biological mesh was applied. No total flap loss occurred. Six (21.4 %) patients had no complications, while 13 (46.4 %) patients had minor complications (Clavien-Dindo grade I-II). Reoperation (Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb) was performed in nine patients (32.1 %), three of whom required a second lotus petal flap reconstruction. Median time until wound healing was 14 weeks. No additional surgery was performed for aesthetic problems. CONCLUSIONS Reconstruction of the pelvic floor after ELAPE using the fasciocutaneous lotus petal flap has limited major complications, but still with a high incidence of minor wound complications. This retrospective cohort study shows limited consequences on form and function.","Hellinga, Joke; Khoe, Patrick C K H; van Etten, Boudewijn; Hemmer, Patrick H J; Havenga, Klaas; Stenekes, Martin W; Eltahir, Yassir",Annals of surgical oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27338743/,144

Oval and elongated particles, approximately 100 to 170 nm in diameter, with club-shaped projections were seen in the infected culture supernatant, and torovirus-like (tubular and torus nucleocapsid) structures were seen in the infected cells by electron microscopy. An antiserum against bovine torovirus (BToV) reacted with the infected cells by immunofluorescence and neutralized the isolate. However, antisera against bovine coronavirus (BCV) failed to react with the infected cells by immunofluorescence or did not neutralize the isolate. Further, the isolate was positive for BToV by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting fragments of the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and spike (S) genes. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the PCR products with those of the published N, M, and S genes (476 to 497, 672, and 687 to 690 nucleotides, respectively) of toroviruses showed high sequence identities (up to 99.4%, 98.7%, and 94.9% for the N, M, and S genes, respectively) between the isolate and BToVs. In contrast, the isolate was negative for BCV by RT-PCR. In a serological survey of serum samples from 355 calves at 33 farms, 92% of calves were positive for neutralizing antibodies to the isolate. These results indicate that the isolate in this study was BToV and that BToV infection might be common in cattle in Japan.

191585,Infectious diseases. SARS experts want labs to improve safety practices.,2003,"The intestinal tract and intestinal contents were collected from 34 stunted, 5-to-14-day-old broiler chicks from eight flocks with runting and stunting syndrome (RSS) in Northern Germany to investigate intestinal lesions and the presence of enteric pathogens with a special focus on rotaviruses (RVs). Seven chicks from a healthy flock were used as controls. Severe villous atrophy was seen in chicks from six flocks with RSS but not in the control flock. Lesions were often ""regionally"" distributed in the middle-to-distal small intestine. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (PAGE), reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and seminested RT-PCR were used for detection and characterization of RVs. The PAGE allows discrimination of different RV groups, and the RT-PCR was used to verify the presence of group (gp) A RVs. RVs were detected (by all methods) in 32 of 34 chicks from the flocks with RSS. By TEM (negative staining), RV particles were observed in intestinal contents of 28 chicks from the flocks with RSS. PAGE analysis showed four RV groups: gpA, gpD, gpF, and gpG. Group A RVs were detected in four chicks from two flocks with RSS, without intestinal lesions. GpD RVs were detected in 12 chicks of five flocks with RSS, 10 of them with severe villous atrophy. GpF RVs were confirmed in four chicks from three flocks with RSS and in two birds in the control flock. GpG RVs were verified in two chicks from two flocks with RSS, one with, and one without, intestinal lesions. At present, PCR methods are only available for detection of gpA RVs. Using RT-PCR, gpA RVs were identified in samples from 22 chicks including samples of two chicks from the control flock. Statistical analysis revealed a positive correlation between presence of gpD RV and severe villous atrophy in flocks with RSS. The results suggest that gpD RV plays a major role in the pathogenesis of RSS.","Otto, Peter; Liebler-Tenorio, Elisabeth M; Elschner, Mandy; Reetz, Jochen; Löhren, Ulrich; Diller, Roland",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17039842/,144

The complete genome of SARS-CoV has been sequenced by international collaboration including China. In the present study, the genome sequences were collected from NCBI and genomic characterization was analyzed. SARS-CoV has a genome of 28-30 kb including 11 ORFs (Open Reading Frames), which is consistent with that of coronavirus family, and its genome organization is similar to those of other coronaviruses as well. SARS-CoV evolutionally closes to other coronavirus in their corresponding proteins, such as spike protein, small membrane protein and nucleocapsid protein. In some regions of the genome, the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV was significantly different from that of other coronavirus, and has a self-conservative genomic sequence. Moreover, its encoding protein sequences were greatly different from those of other coronavirus. The analysis indicated that SARS-CoV has lower redundancy, that is, it has a high variation possibility. It may not be a variant of other coronaviruses but a novel coronavirus, which existed independently in nature and was not recognized by human being before, although SARS-CoV is morphologically similar to other coronavirus and belongs to coronavirus family. The sequences of its genes and encoding proteins are substantially different from those of other coronavirus.","Zhang, Wen-Guang; Li, Jin-Quan; Zhou, Huan-Min",Yi chuan xue bao = Acta genetica Sinica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12939793/,144

Atopy has also been associated with both OME and viral infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of viruses in middle ear effusions (MEE) in children 2-7 yr old with OME, and to determine risk factors for virus detection in the MEE. MEE samples, collected at the time of myringotomy from 37 children with OME were assessed. Physical examination, skin prick tests and a standardized questionnaire on OME and allergy were also performed. Viral RNA was detected by the use of reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Fifteen samples (40.5%) were positive for rhinovirus (RV). One enterovirus and no other respiratory viruses were detected. Two out of five (40%), 3/7 (43%) and 10/25 (40%) were positive for RV in acute, subacute and chronic cases, respectively. Children with frequent episodes of OM, with early onset of OM (<2 yr old), and a positive family history of allergy had a statistically increased risk of RV detection. The two groups were comparable with respect to all other parameters examined. RV is the predominant virus recovered by RT-PCR in the middle ear cavity of children with asymptomatic OME, especially those with a history of longstanding OME or repeated episodes, or children with a family history of allergy. Interactions between allergy and RV infections are likely to predispose to middle ear disease.","Chantzi, F M; Papadopoulos, N G; Bairamis, T; Tsiakou, M; Bournousouzis, N; Constantopoulos, A G; Liapi, G; Xatzipsalti, M; Kafetzis, D A",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17014626/,144
193164,Hypercytokinemia and hyperactivation of phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in severe human influenza A virus infection.,2007,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The renin-angiotensin system is not what it was, or for that matter not necessarily where we thought it should be. For example, there is a novel angiotensin I-metabolizing enzyme that generates angiotensin 1-7 rather than angiotensin II. Moreover, we are slowly realizing the importance of local rather than circulating angiotensin II. RECENT FINDINGS Rather than concentrating on the systemic renin-angiotensin system, recent work has concentrated on elucidating the consequences of increasing angiotensin II production within specific organs, such as the heart and vasculature, as well as in the pancreas and in adipose tissue. Inhibition of angiotensin II production either using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers not only reverses remodelling but also increases tissue insulin sensitivity. Targeting the renin-angiotensin system clinically delays the onset of type 2 diabetes, but the mechanisms involved are not clearly understood. Moreover, at least one other angiotensin-converting enzyme homologue (ACE2) plays a significant role in the regulation of heart and kidney function, and as it generates angiotensin 1-7 from angiotensin I, it is proposed to counteract the detrimental effects associated with the activation of the classic renin-angiotensin system. SUMMARY There is a need to re-evaluate the role(s) played by the molecular components of the ""extended"" local renin-angiotensin system and their role in vascular disease and type 2 diabetes.","Fleming, Ingrid; Kohlstedt, Karin; Busse, Rudi",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16340660/,144

It was shown that 2-ME enhanced, in a dose-dependent manner, the production of antibodies to bovine coronavirus. In this test the optimal concentration of 2-ME was 50 microM. This molarity of 2-ME was also optimal for the pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced proliferation of PBMC obtained from the 7 cattle tested. Similarly, the spontaneous proliferation of PBMC from 4 out of these cattle was enhanced. Thus, 2-ME evoked an increase (up to 2.5 times) or a decrease (at most 10 times) of the quota between the PWM-induced and the spontaneous proliferation (stimulation index). In general, the presence of 50 microM 2-ME enhanced the in vitro production of interferon by bovine PBMC. On the contrary, the highest proliferative response of PBMC to stimulation with bovine virus diarrhoea virus was achieved in cultures without 2-ME or in cultures with 0.5 or 5 microM 2-ME. Since the effects of 2-ME varied, for different tests as well as for cattle tested, attention should be paid to the use of 2-ME in cultures of bovine PBMC.","Larsson, B; Anderson, H; Fossum, C",Zentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

196184,Signs and symptoms in common colds.,1993,"The success of an antiviral drug depends on its potency to neutralize the virus in vitro and its ability after administration in vivo to reach the anatomic compartments that fuel viral dissemination in the body. For instance, remdesivir, a potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug based on studies in vitro, if administered orally would be poorly effective because low drug levels would reach the lungs due to its high first pass destruction in the liver. This is the reason remdesivir can only be administered intravenously, a requirement that clearly limits its use as a prophylactic agent for COVID-19, although novel formulations for its easier administration are under development. Whether an antiviral prophylaxis could further control or even stop the COVID-19 epidemic in synergy with other non-pharmacological based mitigation strategies is today unknown. Since the mid-1960s, pharmacologists have investigated the use of lipid-based nanoparticles for efficient delivery of antivirals to tissues, for example by transforming the route of administration from intravenous to oral, subcutaneous or aerosol administrations. These novel encapsulation strategies have also the potential to maintain high levels of the antiviral drugs in tissues, with reduced dose frequency compared to the non-encapsulated drug. Several lipid-based nanoparticles are today approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or being tested in clinical studies with favorable toxicity profiles. Nonhuman primate models of coronavirus infection offer unique platforms to accelerate the search for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral prophylaxis. Paradigms, to corroborate this claim, are borrowed from nonhuman primate research studies, some of which had a profound impact on global public health in the specific setting of the AIDS pandemic. Sharing information from nonhuman primate research programs, invoking principles of scientific transparency and bioethics similar to those universally agreed for human studies, would also likely significantly help our collective fight (as the human species) against this public health emergency.","Mascio, Michele Di",Cancer studies and therapeutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32905553/,144

Background Deciphering the tissue and organ interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 infection can be important to discern the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the human protein-host protein interactions in the small intestine. Methods Public databases and published works were used to collect data related to small intestine tissue and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We constructed a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and showed interactions of host proteins in the small intestine. Associated modules, biological processes, functional pathways, regulatory transcription factors, disease ontology categories, and possible drug candidates for therapeutic targets were identified. Results Thirteen primary protein neighbors were found for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. ACE2 and its four partners were observed in a highly clustered module; moreover, 8 host proteins belonged to this module. The protein digestion and absorption as a significant pathway was highlighted with enriched genes of ACE2, MEP1A, MEP1B, DPP4, and XPNPEP2. The HNF4A, HNF1A, and HNF1B transcription factors were found to be regulating the expression of ACE2. A significant association with 12 diseases was deciphered and 116 drug-target interactions were identified. Conclusion The protein-host protein interactome revealed the important elements and interactions for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the small intestine, which can be useful in clarifying the mechanisms of gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation.

The sequences encoding the glycoprotein E2 were variable, translating to a number of changes in predicted amino acid sequences. The NS3 region was found to be highly conserved in both animals. The number of E2 clones showing variant amino acids increased with the age of the animal and comparison of the consensus sequences at the different time points confirmed differences in the predicted E2 sequences over time. The immune tolerance that allows the lifelong persistence of this viral infection is highly specific. It is likely that some of the variant viruses generated within these animals will differ antigenically from the persisting virus and be recognized by the immune system. Evidence of an immune response to persisting virus infection was gathered from a larger sample of cattle. Serum neutralizing antibodies were found in 4 of 21 persistently infected animals. Accumulations of viral RNA in the lymph nodes of all animals examined, particularly in the germinal center light zone, may represent antigenic variants held in the form of immune complexes on the processes of follicular dendritic cells.","Collins, M E; Desport, M; Brownlie, J",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10364492/,144

African green monkeys immunized through the respiratory tract with two doses of the vaccine developed a titer of SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies comparable with the robust secondary response observed in animals that have been immunized with a different experimental SARS-CoV vaccine and challenged with SARS-CoV. When animals immunized with NDV expressing S were challenged with a high dose of SARS-CoV, direct viral assay of lung tissues taken by necropsy at the peak of viral replication demonstrated a 236- or 1,102-fold (depending on the NDV vector construct) mean reduction in pulmonary SARS-CoV titer compared with control animals. NDV has the potential for further development as a pretested, highly attenuated, intranasal vector to be available for expedited vaccine development for humans, who generally lack preexisting immunity against NDV.","DiNapoli, Joshua M; Kotelkin, Alexander; Yang, Lijuan; Elankumaran, Subbiah; Murphy, Brian R; Samal, Siba K; Collins, Peter L; Bukreyev, Alexander",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17535926/,144

Three- to four-month-old calves, vaccinated intranasally with recombinant BAV-3 expressing full-length gD (BAV3.E3gD) or a truncated version of gD (gDt) (BAV3.E3gDt), or with E3-deleted BAV-3 (BAV3.E3d; control), were challenged with BHV-1 strain 108. Vaccination with BAV3.E3gD or BAV3.E3gDt induced gD-specific antibody responses in serum and nasal secretions, and primed calves for gD-specific lymphoproliferative responses. In addition, all calves developed complement-independent neutralizing antibodies against BHV-1. Protection against viral challenge was observed in calves vaccinated with recombinant BAV3.E3gD or BAV3.E3gDt as shown by a significant reduction in body temperature and clinical disease, and a partial reduction in the amount and duration of virus excretion in nasal secretions. These results indicate that replication-competent BAV-3-based vectors can induce protective immune responses in calves (the natural host) that have pre-existing BAV-3-specific antibodies.","Zakhartchouk, A N; Pyne, C; Mutwiri, G K; Papp, Z; Baca-Estrada, M E; Griebel, P; Babiuk, L A; Tikoo, S K",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10355773/,144

Annual early pup survival was reduced by 70%, and wolf population change was related to CPV antibody prevalence. In the greater Minnesota population of 3,000 wolves, pup survival was reduced by 40-60%. This reduction limited the Minnesota wolf population rate of increase to about 4% per year compared with increases of 16-58% in other populations. Because it is young wolves that disperse, reduced pup survival may have caused reduced dispersal and reduced recolonization of new range in Minnesota.","Mech, L David; Goyal, Sagar M; Paul, William J; Newton, Wesley E",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18957638/,144

Evidence suggests that commensal microbiota can directly modulate different populations of cells of the immune system (e.g., Ivanov et al., 2008; Atarashi et al., 2011). Recently, we showed that protein extracts from gut commensal microbiota can activate retina-specific T cells, allowing these autoreactive T cells to then break through the blood-retinal barrier and trigger autoimmune uveitis in the recipient (Horai et al., 2015).

Accordingly, cerebral oxygen saturation thresholds for hypoxia/ischemia identified in studies conducted with INVOS(TM) models do not necessarily apply to other devices. In this study, the measurements made with both INVOS(TM) and EQUANOX(TM) oximeters on the forehead of 10 patients during conventional cardiac surgery are directly compared, in order to evaluate the interchangeability of these two devices in clinical practice. METHODS Cerebral oxygen saturation measurements were collected from both INVOS(TM) 5100C and EQUANOX(TM) 7600 before anesthetic induction (baseline), two minutes after tracheal intubation, at cardiopulmonary bypass onset/offset, at aortic cross-clamping/unclamping, at the end of surgery and whenever at least one of the two devices measured a reduction in cerebral oxygen saturation equal to or greater than 20% of the baseline value. Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare the bias and limits of agreement between the two devices. RESULTS A total of 140 paired measurements were recorded. The mean bias between INVOS(TM) and EQUANOX(TM) was -5.1%, and limits of agreement were ±16.37%. Considering the values as percent of baseline, the mean bias was -1.43% and limits of agreement were ±16.47. A proportional bias was observed for both absolute values and changes from baseline. CONCLUSIONS INVOS(TM) and EQUANOX(TM) do not seem to be interchangeable in measuring both absolute values and dynamic changes of cerebral oxygen saturation during cardiac surgery. Large investigations, with appropriate design, are needed in order to identify any device-specific threshold.","Pisano, A; Galdieri, N; Iovino, T P; Angelone, M; Corcione, A","Heart, lung and vessels",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25279362/,144

AIMS: This study assessed the prevalence of enteric infections among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We evaluated 4973 hospitalized patients &#8805; 18 years of age tested for COVID-19 from March 11 through April 28, 2020, at two academic hospitals. The primary exposure was a positive COVID-19 test. The primary outcome was detection of a gastrointestinal pathogen by PCR stool testing. RESULTS: Among 4973 hospitalized individuals, 311 were tested for gastrointestinal infections (204 COVID-19 positive, 107 COVID-19 negative). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely to test positive compared to patients without COVID-19 (10% vs 22%, p < 0.01). This trend was driven by lower rates of non-C.difficile infections (11% vs 22% in COVID-19 positive vs. negative, respectively, p = 0.04), but not C. difficile infection (5.1% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.33). On multivariable analysis, infection with COVID-19 remained significantly associated with lower odds of concurrent GI infection (aOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.97), again driven by reduced non-C.difficile infection. Testing for both C.difficile and non-C.difficile enteric infection decreased dramatically during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens aside from C.difficile do not appear to be a significant contributor to diarrhea in COVID-19 positive patients.","Laszkowska, Monika; Kim, Judith; Faye, Adam S; Joelson, Andrew M; Ingram, Myles; Truong, Han; Silver, Elisabeth R; May, Benjamin; Greendyke, William G; Zucker, Jason; Lebwohl, Benjamin; Hur, Chin; Freedberg, Daniel E",Dig. dis. sci,,144

People with disabilities often experience inequalities with access to healthcare services, resulting in increased costs of living with disability. The economic burden of living with a disability results in nearly $400 billion spent annually from combined public and private payor sources. Historically, disparities in healthcare are associated with intersections between race, culture, and environmental factors. Minority status also plays a significant role in health outcomes and studies have highlighted the additional burdens faced at the junction of race and disability status. COVID-19 changed the landscape of healthcare delivery in the United States, resulting in a drastic increase in telehealth utilization. Traditional non-medical barriers to persons with disability, such as unforeseen parking fees, are documented in the literature. However, conditions surrounding access to the necessary technology required to participate in a telehealth driven medical landscape are less clear. This paper addresses the non-medical barriers and costs associated with living with a disability and discusses potential solutions in the evolving healthcare system.","Norman, Jensine039; Stowers, Jared; Verduzco-Gutierrez, Monica",Am. j. phys. med. rehabilit,,144

222453,Network dynamic model of epidemic transmission introducing a heterogeneous control factor,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a critical respiratory disease caused by coronaviruses (CoV). The available antiviral agents or host-specific anti-inflammatory therapies are the principal treatment modalities, with drugrepurposing as the most viable approach to timely tackle the CoV pandemic. Though these approaches are successful to some extent in reducing the mortality rate, however, it is too far to see a complete escape from the current CoV-2 pandemic. Plants are the primary source of diet, dietary supplements, botanical drugs, and natural products (NPs). It has been well accepted and proved via several scientific studies that plant-based therapies play a vital role in protecting against such infections. The faulty immune system (compromised innate immunity or aberrant immune activation) decides the severity of the respiratory distress in CoV-2 infected patients. Natural products intervene at various stages of the virus replication cycle, including inhibition of virus entry into the host cells, inhibition of serine/ cysteine proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or helicase. Besides, several natural products or plant-based dietary ingredients have a unique ability to strengthen the immune system or alleviate the hyper-inflammatory condition. Many plant-based formulations, dietary supplements, and NPs are being investigated in clinical trials in CoV-2 patients, and few have already shown positive results. The review has unearthed several NP leads for medicinal chemistry programs as well as some having direct opportunity of repurposing in SARS CoV infections.","Sharma, Venu; Sharma, Ankita; Bharate, Sandip B",Curr. med. chem,,144

Herein, we develop a rapid and unamplified nanosensing platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human throat swab specimens. A gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-decorated graphene field-effect transistor (G-FET) sensor was fabricated, after which complementary phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligos (PMO) probe was immobilized on the AuNP surface. This sensor allowed for highly sensitive testing of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as PMO does not have charges, leading to low background signal. Not only did the method present a low limit of detection in PBS (0.37 fM), throat swab (2.29 fM), and serum (3.99 fM), but also it achieved a rapid response to COVID-19 patients' samples within 2 min. The developed nanosensor was capable of analyzing RNA extracts from 30 real clinical samples. The results show that the sensor could differentiate the healthy people from infected people, which are in high agreement with RT-PCR results (Kappa index = 0.92). Furthermore, a well-defined distinction between SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and SARS-CoV RdRp was also made. Therefore, we believe that this work provides a satisfactory, attractive option for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Li, Jiahao; Wu, Ding; Yu, Yi; Li, Tingxian; Li, Kun; Xiao, Meng-Meng; Li, Yirong; Zhang, Zhi-Yong; Zhang, Guo-Jun",Biosens Bioelectron,,144

This study attempts to explore the intrinsic characteristic of risk perception and the spatial distribution of it, which have not been involved in previous studies. To attach this purpose, data from questionnaire conducted in China and Korea (samples of 897 respondents in China and 340 respondents in South Korea) are used to produce risk perception of COVID- 19. Results reveal four principal findings: (1) risk perception of COVID-19 can be categorized into perceived social risk and perceived risk of being infected;(2) the internal differences are most pronounced in perceived risk of being infected about oneself in China, and in perceived social risk disorder about local community in South Korea;(3) the spatial distribution of risk perception is not consistent with that of epidemic severity, for high-risk perception spread out beyond the epicenter with different performance in the two categories;and (4) among the influence factors, trust in information, familiarity with epidemic situation, and interpersonal distance from suffers in the epicenter are found to have a significant influence on different aspects of risk perception.

Three-Dimensional stereophotogrammetry intend to accurately quantify skin microtopography before and after treatments. The objective of this study is comparing the accuracy of stereophotogrammetry with a scale-based peer evaluation in assessing topographical changes to skin surface following laser treatment. A 3D stereophotogrammetry system photographed skin surface of 48 patients with facial wrinkles or scars before and three months after laser resurfacing, followed immediately by topical application of vitamin C. The software measured changes in skin roughness, wrinkle depth and scar volume. Images were presented to three observers, each independently scoring cutaneous improvement according to Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (IGAIS). As for the results, a trend reflecting skin/scar improvement was reported by 3D SPM measurements and raters. The percentage of topographical change given by the raters matched 3D SPM findings. Agreement was highest when observers analysed 3D images. However, observers overestimated skin improvement in a nontreatment control whilst 3D SPM was precise in detecting absence of intervention. This study confirmed a direct correlation between the IGAIS clinical scale and 3D SPM and confirmed the efficacy and accuracy of the latter when assessing cutaneous microtopography alterations as a response to laser treatment.","Machado, Barbara Helena Barcaro; De Melo E Silva, Ivy Dantas; Pautrat, Walter Marou; Frame, James; Najlah, Mohammad",Sci Rep,,144

234493,Case Report: Adequate T and B Cell Responses in a SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patient After Immune Checkpoint Inhibition,2021,"Confronting the challenge of the outbreak of COVID-19 should sharpen our focus on global drug access as a key issue in antiviral therapy testing. The testing and adoption of effective therapies for novel coronaviruses are hampered by the challenge of conducting controlled studies during a state of emergency. The access to direct antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin, that have an existing inventory and reliable supply chain may be a priority consideration for therapies developed for the 2019-nCoV infection outbreaks and any strain variants that may emerge. On the basis of the direct antiviral activity of ribavirin against 2019-nCoV in vitro and evidence for potency enhancement strategies developed during the prior SARS and MERS outbreaks, ribavirin may significantly impact our ability to end the lingering outbreaks in China and slow outbreaks in other countries. The apparent COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to follow dosage guidelines for treatment with ribavirin, test new therapeutic concepts, and conduct controlled testing to apply the scientific rigor required to address the controversy around this mainstay of antiviral therapy.","Khalili, Jahan S; Zhu, Hai; Mak, Nga Sze Amanda; Yan, Yongqi; Zhu, Yi",J Med Virol,,144

236124,SARS-CoV-2 and the Nervous System: From Clinical Features to Molecular Mechanisms,2020,"The year 2020 has been marked by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by an RNA virus called SARS-COV2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus). The fight against this epidemic has become the center of our daily clinical practice as well as of our private lives, in which avoiding infection has become one of our most important goals. Even though COVID-19 is a potentially lethal disease, especially for the elderly and people with chronic diseases, it did not cause all the other life-threatening diseases to vanish. On the contrary, many scheduled medical activities and procedures, especially preventive and non-urgent internal and surgical activities, had to be postponed due to COVID-19 crisis. This interruption in the health care system can negatively affect the diagnosis and management of our patients with other health issues, namely malignant skin tumors, of which melanoma is the most aggressive. In this letter, we as dermatovenereologists from the Croatian Referral Centre of The Ministry of Health for Melanoma needed to express our concern regarding the increasing number of patients with delayed diagnosis of skin cancer, with special emphasis on melanoma detection and treatment. In the last few months, a large number of our newly-diagnosed patients with melanoma, as well as those with non-melanoma skin cancers, reported that they had noticed a suspicious skin lesion a few months ago but decided not to seek help from dermatologist due to the worrisome epidemiologic situation. In the current environment, clinical skin examination may be viewed as less important and thus postponed, but neglecting melanoma throughout the virus outbreak may lead to increased rates of morbidity, mortality, and consequently a greater financial burden for the health system (1). There are several reasons for such a relaxed attitude towards skin health in our patients. Unlike cardiac, pulmonary, or digestive difficulties, which patients consider life-threatening and for which they seek emergency care despite the coronavirus pandemic, skin tumors do not cause great subjective or significantly noticeable objective symptoms. Moreover, all of the skin tumors and especially melanoma , mostly present as small changes of just a few millimeters in diameter in the early stage at which they are prognostically most favorable. For the average person with no medical education, such small lesions usually do not cause any concern as they have no awareness of the fact that small and inconspicuous skin lesions may be dangerous and potentially even lethal. According to the recommendations concerning patient management during COVID-19 pandemic, oncological examinations should still be performed regularly (2). In spite of that, the cancelation of appointments, especially by patients who are being monitored for high-risk lesions, is inevitable when COVID-19 is disrupting everyone's lives. With the pandemic evolving and no clear solutions in sight, now is the time to emphasize the importance of self-examination and teledermatology in early melanoma diagnosis. Even though diagnosing and managing pigmented skin lesions usually requires face-to-face examinations and dermoscopy as a crucial tool in early melanoma detection, in these times, and especially for people with a higher risk of SARS-COV2 infection, remote communication could prevent delays resulting in worse prognosis and could also eliminate the risk of infecting healthcare workers. Moreover, teledermatology can also be initiated by doctors asking patients to monitor lesions between clinical visits (3). However, we should not rely solely on this technology but should instead assess every patient individually and insist on a face-to-face examination for those at greater risk, with the aim that, if necessary, surgery be performed in timely manner. The collaboration between general practitioners and dermatologists represents an important aspect of achieving the most rational and effective health care in terms of performing triage of patients who can be assessed by teledermatology as","Situm, M.; Filipovic, N.; Buljan, M.",Acta Dermatovenerologica Croatica,,144
238882,Synergistic effects of anionic surfactants on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virucidal efficiency of sanitizing fluids to fight COVID-19,2020,"Nephroblastoma is the most common kidney tumour in children. Its diagnosis is based on imagery. In the SAIAD project, we have designed a platform for optimizing the segmentation of deformed kidney and tumour with a small dataset, using Artificial Intelligence methods. These patient's structures segmented by separate tools and processes must then be fused to obtain a unique numerical 3D representation. However, when aggregating these structures into a final segmentation, conflicting pixels may appear. These conflicts can be solved by IA techniques. This paper presents a synthesis of our segmentation contribution in the SAIAD project and a new fusion method. The segmentation method uses the FCN-8s network with the OV2ASSION training method, which allows segmentation by patient and overcomes the limited dataset. This new fusion method combines the segmentations of the previously performed structures, using a simple and efficient network combined with the OV2ASSION training method as well, in order to manage eventual conflicting pixels. These segmentation and fusion methods were evaluated on pathological kidney and tumour structures of 14 patients affected by nephroblastoma, included in the final dataset of the SAIAD project. They are compared with other methods adapted from the literature. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our training method coupled with the FCN-8s network in the segmentation process with more patients, and in the case of the fusion process, its effectiveness coupled with a common network, in resolving the conflicting pixels and its ability to improve the resulting segmentations.","Corbat, Lisa; Henriet, Julien; Chaussy, Yann; Lapayre, Jean-Christophe",Comput Biol Med,,144

METHODS: From March 16th until June 15th 2020, IRD patients from private practices and rheumatology departments were asked to answer a questionnaire addressing their behaviour with respect to their immunomodulating therapy. Eight private practices and nine rheumatology departments which included rheumatology primary care centres and university hospitals participated. 4252 questionnaires were collected and evaluated. RESULTS: The majority of patients (54%) were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, followed by psoriatic arthritis (14%), ankylosing spondylitis (10%), connective tissue diseases (12%) and vasculitides (6%). The majority of patients (84%) reported to continue their immunomodulatory therapy. Termination of therapy was reported by only 3% of the patients. The results were independent from the type of IRD, the respective immunomodulatory therapy and by whom the patients were treated (private practices vs rheumatology departments). Younger patients (<60 years) reported just as often as older patients to discontinue their therapy. CONCLUSION: The data show that most of the patients continued their therapy in spite of the pandemic. A significant change in behavior with regard to their immunomodulatory therapy was not observed during the three months of observation. The results support the idea that the immediate release of recommendation of the German Society of Rheumatology were well received, supporting the well-established physician-patient-relationship in times of a crisis.","Hasseli, R; Müller-Ladner, U; Keil, F; Broll, M; Dormann, A; Fräbel, C; Hermann, W; Heinmüller, C-J; Hoyer, B F; Löffler, F; Özden, F; Pfeiffer, U; Saech, J; Schneidereit, T; Schlesinger, A; Schwarting, A; Specker, C; Stapfer, G; Steinmüller, M; Storck-Müller, K; Strunk, J; Thiele, A; Triantafyllias, K; Vagedes, D; Wassenberg, S; Wilden, E; Zeglam, S; Schmeiser, T",Rheumatology (Oxford),,144

So far, Ghana has recorded 48,643 confirmed cases with 320 associated deaths. Although summaries of data are usually provided by the Ministry of Health, detailed epidemiological profile of cases are limited. This study sought to describe the socio-demographic features, pattern of COVID-19 spread and the viral load dynamics among subjects residing in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional retrospective study that reviewed records of samples collected from February to July, 2020. Respiratory specimens such as sputum, deep-cough saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from suspected COVID-19 subjects in 12 regions of Ghana for laboratory analysis and confirmation by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 72,434 samples were collected during the review period, with majority of the sampled individuals being females (37,464; 51.9%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 identified in the study population was 13.2% [95%CI: 12.9, 13.4). Males were mostly infected (4,897; 51.5%) compared to females. Individuals between the ages 21-30 years recorded the highest number of infections (3,144, 33.4%). Symptomatic subjects had higher viral loads (1479.7 copies/µl; IQR = 40.6-178919) than asymptomatic subjects (49.9; IQR = 5.5-3641.6). There was significant association between gender or age and infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.05). Among all the suspected clinical presentations, anosmia was the strongest predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Adj. OR (95%CI): 24.39 (20.18, 29.49). We observed an average reproductive number of 1.36 with a minimum of 1.28 and maximum of 1.43. The virus trajectory shows a gradual reduction of the virus reproductive number. CONCLUSION: This study has described the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 cases in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana, with males and younger individuals at greater risk of contracting the disease. Health professionals should be conscious of individuals presenting with anosmia since this was seen as the strongest predictor of virus infection.","Owusu, Michael; Sylverken, Augustina Angelina; Ankrah, Sampson Twumasi; El-Duah, Philip; Ayisi-Boateng, Nana Kwame; Yeboah, Richmond; Gorman, Richmond; Asamoah, Jesse; Binger, Tabea; Acheampong, Godfred; Bekoe, Franklin Asiedu; Ohene, Sally-Ann; Larsen-Reindorf, Rita; Awuah, Anthony Afum-Adjei; Amuasi, John; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Phillips, Richard Odame",PLoS One,,144
247767,Cross-reactive coronavirus antibodies with diverse epitope specificities and Fc effector functions,2021,"Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been associated with substantial presymptomatic transmission, which occurs when the generation interval--the time between infection of an individual with a pathogen and transmission of the pathogen to another individual--is shorter than the incubation period--the time between infection and symptom onset. We collected a dataset of 257 SARS-CoV-2 transmission pairs in Japan and jointly estimated the mean generation interval (3.7-5.1 days) and mean incubation period (4.4-5.7 days) as well as measured their dependence (Kendalls tau of 0.4-0.6), taking into consideration demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the pairs. The positive correlation between the two parameters demonstrates that reliance on isolation of symptomatic COVID-19 cases as a focal point of control efforts is insufficient to address the challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Accounting for this dependence within SARS-CoV-2 epidemic models can also improve model estimates.","Linton, Natalie M; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.; Nishiura, Hiroshi",,,144
248998,Changes of the patient management in dentistry during the pandemic caused by the SARS-Coronavirus 2-initial perspectives of a clinic of operative dentistry in Europe,2020,"Given the current social distancing regulations across the world, social media has become the primary mode of communication for most people. This has resulted in the isolation of many people suffering from mental illnesses who are unable to receive assistance in person. They have increasingly turned to social media to express themselves and to look for guidance in dealing with their illnesses. Keeping this in mind, we propose a solution to detect and classify mental illness posts on social media thereby enabling users to seek appropriate help. In this work, we detect and classify five prominent kinds of mental illnesses: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, ADHD and PTSD by analyzing unstructured user data on social media platforms. In addition, we are sharing a new high-quality dataset to drive research on this topic. We believe that our work is the first multi-class model that uses a Transformer-based architecture such as RoBERTa to analyze people's emotions and psychology. We also demonstrate how we stress-test our model using behavioral testing.

248999,Changes of the patient management in dentistry during the pandemic caused by the SARS-Coronavirus 2-initial perspectives of a clinic of operative dentistry in Europe,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to validate the original Caprini score and its modifications considering coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a severe prothrombotic condition in patients admitted to the hospital. METHODS: The relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records with an implemented Caprini score and were retrospectively evaluated. The score was calculated twice: by the physician on admission and by the investigator at discharge (death). The final assessment considered additional risk factors that occurred during inpatient treatment. Besides the original Caprini score (a version of 2005), the modified version added the elevation of D-dimer and specific scores for COVID-19 as follows: two points for asymptomatic, three points for symptomatic, and five points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer. Cases were evaluated retrospectively. The primary end point was symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) detected during inpatient treatment and confirmed by appropriate imaging testing or autopsy. The secondary end points included those observed during hospitalization (admission to the intensive care unit, a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, death, bleeding), and those assessed at 6-month follow-up (symptomatic VTE, bleeding, death). The association of eight different versions of the Caprini score with VTE events was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients (83 males and 85 females at the age of 58.3 ± 12.7 years) were admitted to the hospital between April 30 and May 29, 2020, and were discharged or died to the time of data analysis. The original Caprini score varied between 2 and 12 (5.4 ± 1.8) at the admission and between 2 and 15 (5.9 ± 2.5) at discharge or death. The maximal score was observed with modification including specific COVID-19 points of 5 to 20 (10.0 ± 3.0). Patients received prophylactic (enoxaparin 40 mg once daily: 2.4%), intermediate (enoxaparin 80 mg once daily: 76.8%), or therapeutic (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily: 20.8%) anticoagulation. Despite this, symptomatic VTE was detected in 11 (6.5%) inpatients. Of the 168 individuals, 28 (16.7%) admitted to the intensive care unit, 8 (4.8%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 8 (4.8%) died. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was detected in two (1.2%) cases. The Caprini score of all eight versions demonstrated a significant association with inpatient VTE frequency. The highest predictability was observed for the original scale when assessed at discharge (death). Only symptomatic VTE was reported after discharge with a cumulative incidence of 7.1%. This did not affect the predictability of the Caprini score. Extended antithrombotic treatment was prescribed to 49 (29%) patients with a cumulative incidence of bleeding of 1.8% at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified a significant correlation between the Caprini score and the risk of VTE in patients with COVID-19. All models including specific COVID-19 scores showed equally high predictability, and use of the original Caprini score is appropriate for patients with COVID-19.","Tsaplin, Sergey; Schastlivtsev, Ilya; Zhuravlev, Sergey; Barinov, Victor; Lobastov, Kirill; Caprini, Joseph A",J.

250236,Comparison five primer sets from different genome region of covid-1for detection of virus infection by conventional rt-pcr,2020,"Worldwide, concern about physical inactivity and excessive car dependence has encouraged ambitious targets and policies to promote cycling. But policy making is hindered by limited knowledge about why cycling prevalence and trends vary greatly between different geographic areas (e.g. in London (UK) <1% cycle to work in Harrow compared to>15 % in Hackney) and individuals (e.g. by age or gender). The role of cycle infrastructure investment in explaining part of these patterns and trends is also unknown. We linked individual-level data on 317,117 London commuters (including 11,199 cyclists) in the 2001 and 2011 UK census to relevant geographic data, including on area-level cycling infrastructure investment during the period. Whilst cycle commuting increased over time on average, concentration curves and indices demonstrated that in contrast with England as a whole, cycling in London shifted from being dominated by commuters with lower socioeconomic status to commuters with higher socioeconomic status. In our first set of regression analyses, we showed that observed differences and time trends in cycling prevalence were partially explained by area-level differences in topography, greenspace, footpaths and crime levels and by differences and changes in population structures. In the second, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis which showed that expenditure on cycling infrastructure was associated with increased cycling at a marginal rate of £4915 per additional commuter cyclist, with some variation between groups: ethnic minorities were more responsive, and females, older people and those with lower socioeconomic status appeared less responsive. If planned increases in expenditure in England for the period 2020-25 were as cost-effective, and were sustained for the whole decade, our study suggests that commuter cycling prevalence could increase in England by 0.5 to 1.1 percentage points (this equates to a 16% to 34% increase in commuter cycling prevalence if compared to 2011 levels). More research is necessary to assess the impact on broader measures of cycling, active travel and overall physical activity, and to determine whether such expenditure constitutes good or equitable value for money.","Martin, Adam; Morciano, Marcello; Suhrcke, Marc",Econ Hum Biol,,144

257117,Panels and Syndromic Testing in Clinical Microbiology,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The novel Coronavirus also called COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread across the world. It has so far infected around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114,698 lives overall. As the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing shortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays. METHODS: In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The proposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available databases. RESULTS: CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases are 93% and 98.2% for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia viral vs normal). For 3-class classification (COVID vs Pneumonia vs normal), the proposed model produced a classification accuracy of 95%. The preliminary results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more training data becomes available. CONCLUSION: CoroNet achieved promising results on a small prepared dataset which indicates that given more data, the proposed model can achieve better results with minimum pre-processing of data. Overall, the proposed model substantially advances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID-19 pandemic, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.","Khan, Asif Iqbal; Shah, Junaid Latief; Bhat, Mohammad Mudasir",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,144

261637,"The murky origins of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic causes vital concerns due to the lack of proved, effective, and safe therapy. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine seem to be useful, but recently serious concerns regarding their adverse events have risen. The aim of the study was to broaden the general perspective of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use in COVID-19 treatment, based on an analysis of their current safety profile among patients with rheumatic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was based on a group of 152 patients with rheumatic diseases, aged 20-78 years, treated either with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Analyzed data included age, gender, comorbidities, type of drug, dosage, treatment duration, and reported adverse events. Cases of drug withdrawal related to adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS: The dosage was consistent in both groups: 250 mg of chloroquine or 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily. 77.6% of patients did not experience any adverse reactions to the treatment. Hydroxychloroquine showed better safety profile, with 10.9% of patients reporting side-ffects, compared to 28.9% in patients treated with chloroquine. The overall incidence of ophthalmic complications was 6.6%. For both drugs, no statistically significant correlation between adverse events and age, chronic heart or liver disease, or hypertension was found. CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine at lower doses, as used in rheumatic diseases, prove to be relatively safe. Data from the literature show that high dosage as recommended in COVID-19 treatment may pose a risk of toxicity and require precise management, but prophylactic, long-term use of lower, safe doses might be a promising solution.","Majewski, Dominik; Majewska, Katarzyna Anna; Naskrecka, Monika; Grygiel-Górniak, Bogna",Ann Agric Environ Med,,144
261638,"The murky origins of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"A priority for research on infectious disease is to understand how epidemiological and evolutionary processes interact to influence pathogen population dynamics and disease outcomes. However, little is understood about how population adaptation changes across time, how sexual vs. asexual reproduction contribute to the spread of pathogens in wild populations and how diversity measured with neutral and selectively important markers correlates across years. Here, we report results from a long-term study of epidemiological and genetic dynamics within several natural populations of the Linum marginale-Melampsora lini plant-pathogen interaction. Using pathogen isolates collected from three populations of wild flax (L. marginale) spanning 16 annual epidemics, we probe links between pathogen population dynamics, phenotypic variation for infectivity and genomic polymorphism. Pathogen genotyping was performed using 1567 genome-wide SNP loci and sequence data from two infectivity loci (AvrP123, AvrP4). Pathogen isolates were phenotyped for infectivity using a differential set. Patterns of epidemic development were assessed by conducting surveys of infection prevalence in one population (Kiandra) annually. Bayesian clustering analyses revealed host population and ecotype as key predictors of pathogen genetic structure. Despite strong fluctuations in pathogen population size and severe annual bottlenecks, analysis of molecular variance revealed that pathogen population differentiation was relatively stable over time. Annually, varying levels of clonal spread (0-44.8%) contributed to epidemics. However, within populations, temporal genetic composition was dynamic with rapid turnover of pathogen genotypes, despite the dominance of only four infectivity phenotypes across the entire study period. Furthermore, in the presence of strong fluctuations in population size and migration, spatial selection may maintain pathogen populations that, despite being phenotypically stable, are genetically highly dynamic.","Susi, Hanna; Burdon, Jeremy J; Thrall, Peter H; Nemri, Adnane; Barrett, Luke G",PLoS Pathog,,144

262862,"A blood transcriptome-based analysis of disease progression, immune regulation, and symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients",2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths and overburdened healthcare systems worldwide. Systemic low-dose corticosteroids have proven clinical benefit in patients with severe COVID-19. Higher doses of corticosteroids are used in other inflammatory lung diseases and may offer additional clinical benefits in COVID-19. At present, the balance between benefits and harms of higher vs. lower doses of corticosteroids for patients with COVID-19 is unclear. METHODS: The COVID STEROID 2 trial is an investigator-initiated, international, parallel-grouped, blinded, centrally randomised and stratified clinical trial assessing higher (12 mg) vs. lower (6 mg) doses of dexamethasone for adults with COVID-19 and severe hypoxia. We plan to enrol 1,000 patients in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and India. The primary outcome is days alive without life support (invasive mechanical ventilation, circulatory support or renal replacement therapy) at day 28. Secondary outcomes include serious adverse reactions at day 28; all-cause mortality at day 28, 90 and 180; days alive without life support at day 90; days alive and out of hospital at day 90; and health-related quality of life at day 180. The primary outcome will be analysed using the Kryger Jensen and Lange test adjusted for stratification variables and reported as adjusted mean differences and median differences. The full statistical analysis plan is outlined in this protocol. DISCUSSION: The COVID STEROID 2 trial will provide evidence on the optimal dosing of systemic corticosteroids for COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxia with important implications for patients, their relatives and society.","Warrer Munch, Marie; Granholm, Anders; Nainan Myatra, Sheila; Kumar Tirupakuzhi Vijayaraghavan, Bharath; Cronhjort, Maria; Rubenson Wahlin, Rebecka; Jakob, Stephan M; Cioccari, Luca; Nørregaard Kjaer, Maj-Brit; Kingo Vesterlund, Gitte; Sylvest Meyhoff, Tine; Helleberg, Marie; Hylander Møller, Morten; Benfield, Thomas; Venkatesh, Balasubramanian; Hammond, Naomi; Micallef, Sharon; Bassi, Abhinav; John, Oommen; Jha, Vivekanand; Tjelle Kristiansen, Klaus; Suppli Ulrik, Charlotte; Lind Jørgensen, Vibeke; Smitt, Margit; Bestle, Morten H; Sofie Andreasen, Anne; Musaeus Poulsen, Lone; Steen Rasmussen, Bodil; Craveiro Brøchner, Anne; Strøm, Thomas; Møller, Anders; Saif Khan, Mohd; Padmanaban, Ajay; Vasishtha Divatia, Jigeeshu; Saseedharan, Sanjith; Borawake, Kapil; Kapadia, Farhad; Dixit, Subhal; Chawla, Rajesh; Shukla, Urvi; Amin, Pravin; Chew, Michelle S; Gluud, Christian; Lange, Theis; Perner, Anders",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,,144
264290,Commercially available rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of high priority pathogens: status and challenges,2021,"Tissue culture is an essential tool for the regeneration of uniform plant material. However, tissue culture conditions can be a source of abiotic stress for plants, leading to changes in the DNA sequence and methylation patterns. Despite the growing evidence on biochemical processes affected by abiotic stresses, how these altered biochemical processes affect DNA sequence and methylation patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, the methylation-sensitive Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (metAFLP) approach was used to investigate de novo methylation, demethylation, and sequence variation in barley regenerants derived by anther culture. Additionally, we used Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to identify the spectral features of regenerants, which were then analyzed by mediation analysis. The infrared spectrum ranges (710-690 and 1010-940 cm-1) identified as significant in the mediation analysis were most likely related to ß-glucans, cellulose, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Additionally, the identified compounds participated as predictors in moderated mediation analysis, explaining the role of demethylation of CHG sites (CHG_DMV) in in vitro tissue culture-induced sequence variation, depending on the duration of tissue culture. The data demonstrate that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is a useful tool for studying the biochemical compounds that may affect DNA methylation patterns and sequence variation, if combined with quantitative characteristics determined using metAFLP molecular markers and mediation analysis. The role of ß-glucans, cellulose, and SAM in DNA methylation, and in cell wall, mitochondria, and signaling, are discussed to highlight the putative cellular mechanisms involved in sequence variation.","Bednarek, Piotr T; Zebrowski, Jacek; Orlowska, Renata",,,144

Studies have focused on the relationships between complex emergencies and natural disasters with outbreaks of infectious diseases. However, there is a dearth of relevant literature on the impact of a global pandemic on vaccination programs - an important topic because delays or stops in such programs are likely to result in outbreaks and epidemics of other infectious diseases. Thus, this article discusses the negative and positive impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic may exert on vaccination for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Negative impacts include the increased risk of VPD outbreaks in low-resource countries where vaccination programs must be temporarily halted to prevent the spread of infection. Positive effects include the strong possibility that the universally-recognized need for a coronavirus vaccine may increase people's appreciation for vaccines in general, resulting in improved vaccination uptake once the pandemic passes. Concerned stakeholders, such as governments and the World Health Organization (WHO), should seize this moment to effectively build on these positive impacts by planning renewed and revitalized post-COVID vaccination programs.","Ali, Inayat",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,144

In this study, we aim to investigate the efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) in the treatment of severe and critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHOD: The data of severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients who received anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-containing CP along with the antiviral treatment (n = 888) and an age-gender, comorbidity, and other COVID-19 treatments matched severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients at 1:1 ratio (n = 888) were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Duration in the intensive care unit (ICU), the rate of mechanical ventilation (MV) support and vasopressor support were lower in CP group compared with the control group (p = 0.001, p = 0.02, p = 0.001, respectively). The case fatality rate (CFR) was 24.7 % in the CP group, and it was 27.7 % in the control group. Administration of CP 20 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis or COVID-19 related symptoms were associated with a higher rate of MV support compared with the first 3 interval groups (&#8804;5 days, 6-10 days, 11-15 days) (p=0.001).

(Special Issue: Proteomics and its application in pandemic diseases.),2020,"The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has deranged the recent history of humankind, afflicting more than 27 million individuals to date. While the majority of COVID-19 patients recuperate, a considerable number of patients develop severe complications. Bilateral pneumonia constitutes the hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease but an involvement of other organ systems, namely the cardiovascular system, kidneys, liver, and central nervous system, occurs in at least half of the fatal COVID-19 cases. Besides respiratory failure requiring ventilation, patients with severe COVID-19 often display manifestations of systemic inflammation and thrombosis as well as diffuse microvascular injury observed postmortem. In this review, we survey the mechanisms that may explain how viral entry and activation of endothelial cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can give rise to a series of events including systemic inflammation, thrombosis, and microvascular dysfunction. This pathophysiological scenario may be particularly harmful in patients with overt cardiovascular disease and may drive the fatal aspects of COVID-19. We further shed light on the role of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system and its inhibitors in the context of COVID-19 and discuss the potential impact of antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment options. Acknowledging the comorbidities and potential organ injuries throughout the course of severe COVID-19 is crucial in the clinical management of patients affecting treatment approaches and recovery rate.","Gencer, Selin; Lacy, Michael; Atzler, Dorothee; van der Vorst, Emiel P C; Döring, Yvonne; Weber, Christian",Thromb Haemost,,144

We show that this effect can be explained as a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end, we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals, as well as population-wide isolation practices in response to containment policies or behavioral changes, and show that the model captures the observed growth behavior accurately. The insights provided here may aid the careful implementation of containment strategies for ongoing secondary outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","Maier, Benjamin F; Brockmann, Dirk",Science,,144

Alkaline phosphatase (AP) from the psychrophilic marine bacterium Vibrio splendidus (VAP) is characterized by an analogous large surface loop in each monomer, referred to as the large-loop, that hovers over the active site of the other monomer. It presumably has a role in the high catalytic efficiency of VAP which accompanies its extremely low thermal stability. Here, we designed several different variants of VAP with the aim of removing inter-subunit interactions at the dimer interface. Breaking the inter-subunit contacts from one residue in particular (Arg336) reduced the temperature stability of the catalytically potent conformation and caused a 40% drop in catalytic rate. The high catalytic rates of enzymes from cold-adapted organisms are often associated with increased dynamic flexibility. Comparison of the relative B-factors of the R336L crystal structure to that of the wild-type confirmed surface flexibility was increased in a loop on the opposite monomer, but not in the large-loop. The increase in flexibility resulted in a reduced catalytic rate. The large-loop increases the area of the interface between the subunits through its contacts and may facilitate an alternating structural cycle demanded by a half-of-sites reaction mechanism through stronger ties, as the dimer oscillates between high affinity (active) or low phosphoryl-group affinity (inactive).","Hjörleifsson, Jens Guðmundur; Helland, Ronny; Magnúsdóttir, Manuela; Ásgeirsson, Bjarni",,,144

Here we determined the prognostic value of an outpatient chest radiograph, together with an ensemble of deep learning algorithms predicting comorbidities and airspace disease to identify patients at a higher risk of hospitalization from COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing who received an ambulatory chest radiography between March 17, 2020 and October 24, 2020. In this study, full admission was defined as hospitalization within 14 days of the COVID-19 test for > 2 days with supplemental oxygen. Univariate analysis and machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the relationship between the deep learning model predictions and hospitalization for > 2 days. RESULTS: The study included 413 patients, 222 men (54%), with a median age of 51 years (interquartile range, 39-62 years). Fifty-one patients (12.3%) required full admission. A boosted decision tree model produced the best prediction. Variables included patient age, frontal chest radiograph predictions of morbid obesity, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias, and radiographic opacity, with an internally validated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.837 (95% CI: 0.791-0.883) on a test cohort. CONCLUSION: Deep learning analysis of single frontal chest radiographs was used to generate combined comorbidity and pneumonia scores that predict the need for supplemental oxygen and hospitalization for > 2 days in patients with COVID-19 infection with an AUC of 0.837 (95% confidence interval: 0.791-0.883).

It consists of a cross-sectional and census-based study with data collected between August 2016 and February 2017. The dependent variables were body mass index (BMI) and height-for-age z-score, using Student's t-Test and ANOVA in the statistical analysis. A total of 67 children, 73.2% to 24 months of age and 34.3% being male, were evaluated. There was a significant proportion of families with per capita income of less than 1/4 of the minimum wage (65.6%), with no home monitoring for the family health strategy (88.1%), and long working hours for mothers (43.3%). The onset of prenatal care until the third month of pregnancy and female sex were associated with higher BMI averages. For height-for-age, an association with lower mean values was found for households with more than one resident per room, higher age range of the child, and child-care in daycare centers. Thus, although few factors have an association with the anthropometric indications evaluated, it is necessary to consider the precarious socioeconomic conditions in which these children find themselves.","Batista, Delma Riane Rebouças; Rodrigues, Paulo Rogério Melo; Souza, Amanda Moura; Sichieri, Rosely; Muraro, Ana Paula",Cien Saude Colet,,144

In the present review, we address current knowledge on coronaviruses from a short history to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation of the disease, as well as treatment and prevention strategies. Although a great amount of research and efforts have been made worldwide to prevent further outbreaks of coronavirus­associated disease, the spread and lethality of the 2019 outbreak (COVID­19) is proving to be higher than previous epidemics on account of international travel density and immune naivety of the population.

Present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to discuss the prevalence of neurological involvement of the 2019-nCoV patients and assess the symptomatic trend of events as compared to the 2002 ""SARS"" and 2012 ""MERS"" pandemics. The articles were systematically screened through several search engine and databases. The articles published or in preprint were included in the study till 15th May 2020. The systematic review done as per the published literatures which included 31 cross sectional, observational studies and case reports which revealed neurological signs and symptoms in SARS-COV-2 disease. For meta-analysis, we included 09 observational and cross-sectional studies which included COVID-19 positive patients and assessed the predominance of various neurological signs and symptoms in COVID-19 patients with relation to SARS-2002 and MERS-2012. Data was analyzed by using the ""MedCalc"" Statistical Software version 19.2.6 and reported as pooled prevalence. Standard I2 test was used to analyze the heterogeneity. We have collected and screened about a total 2615articles, finally we have included 31articles for the systematic review and 09 for meta-analysis as per the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The analysis was made as per the prevalence rate of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 positive patients. The cumulative neurological outcome of SARS-2002 and MERS-2012 was assessed to get the trends which was further tried to correlate the events with the current pandemic. During the analysis severity and outcome of neurological manifestations range from simple headache to vague non-focal complaints to severe neurologic impairment associated with seizure or meningitis. Central and peripheral nervous system (CNS/PNS) manifestations were seen during the SARS-2002, MERS-2012 and COVID-19. However, none of the publication had primary or secondary objectives of searching neurological manifestations in the COVID-19 patients and the pathogenic mechanism which will subsequently strengthen the importance to start more prospective clinical trials. The prevalence of neurological signs and symptoms were taken as primary objective. Thereafter, the prevalence of each CNS/PNS symptoms was categorized and their prevalence studied. The selection of Bagheri et al., 2020 may be discussed because they have done the cross-sectional study with the neurological finding and correlated the data with prevalence of the COVID-19 positive patients. The proportion of patients presenting with neurological outcome and clinical/PCR positivity were done. We had searched and followed all the possible online/web source, still the data collection process may remain a limitation of work due to addition of several publications on COVID-19 every day. Due to lack of data of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we have included the case reports, MERS and COVID-19 in CNS/PNS manifestations.","Prakash, Ajay; Singh, Harvinder; Sarma, Phulen; Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Dhibar, Deba Prasad; Balaini, Neeraj; Shree, Ritu; Goyal, Manoj; Modi, Manish; Medhi, Bikash",Sci Rep,,144

However, with the gradual easing of lockdown policies in most countries, the majority of non-essential retail businesses are trying their best to bounce back both economically and socially. Nevertheless, the efforts of retail traders are hampered by uncertainty regarding what capacity measures need to be taken, and there is an urgent need to understand how social distancing can be safely followed and implemented in these spaces. This paper draws from retail space allocation, crowd science, operational research and ergonomics/biomechanics to develop a method for identifying the minimum amount of space an individual needs to socially distance in shops, markets, shopping centres and open commercial spaces, when there are other people present. The area required per person is calculated for both static space (where people are seated, standing or queuing, for example) and dynamic space (where people need to walk freely). We propose our method as a step forward in understanding the very practical problem of capacity, which can hopefully allow retail spaces to operate safely, and minimise the risk of virus transmission.","Ntounis, Nikos; Mumford, Christine; Loroño-Leturiondo, Maria; Parker, Cathy; Still, Keith",Saf Sci,,144

Viral infections including SARS-CoV are associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species, disturbances of Ca++ caused by unfolded protein response (UPR) mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and is due to the exploitation of virus's own protein i.e., viroporins into the host cells. Several clinical trials are on-going including testing Remdesivir (anti-viral), Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine derivatives (anti-malarial drugs) etc. Unfortunately, each drug has specific limitations. Herein, we review the viral protein involvement to activate ER stress transducers (IRE-1, PERK, ATF-6) and their downstream signals; and evaluate combination therapies for COVID-19 mediated ER stress alterations. Melatonin is an immunoregulator, anti-pyretic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and ER stress modulator during viral infections. It enhances protective mechanisms for respiratory tract disorders. Andrographolide, isolated from Andrographis paniculata, has versatile biological activities including immunomodulation and determining SARS-CoV-2 binding site. Considering the properties of both compounds in terms of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-pyrogenic, anti-viral and ER stress modulation and computational approaches revealing andrographolide docks with the SARS-CoV2 binding site, we predict that this combination therapy may have potential utility against COVID-19.","Banerjee, Aditi; Czinn, Steven J; Reiter, Russel J; Blanchard, Thomas G",Life Sci,,144

Given that the severe shortage of hospital beds has led to early discharge and insufficient patient education on home care routines and isolation protocols, the close follow-up of patients and their immediate relatives is an integral part of transitioning from hospital care to home care for patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We designed the Tele-COVID-19 prospective cohort to follow-up with COVID-19 patients in Tehran, Iran, and improve health care delivery and the recording of postdischarge patients' clinical profiles. METHODS: All adult patients who were admitted to the COVID-19 wards of teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran were eligible to participate in this cohort study. At baseline, patients were recruited from 4 major hospitals from March 9, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Telephone follow-ups, which were led by volunteer medical students, were conducted on postdischarge days 1-3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. We collected data on a range of sociodemographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics by using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 950 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were approached, 823 (response rate: 86.6%) consented and were enrolled into the cohort. Of the 823 participants, 449 (54.5%) were male. The mean age of participants was 50.1 years (SD 12.6 years). During the initial data collection phase, more than 5000 phone calls were made and over 577 reports of critical patients who were in need of urgent medical attention were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The Tele-COVID-19 cohort will provide patients with sufficient education on home care and isolation, and medical advice on care and the proper use of drugs. In addition, by preventing unnecessary hospital returns and providing information on household SARS-CoV-2 transmission as early as possible, this cohort will help with effective disease management in resource-limited settings.

With the aid of modern research tools and programs for mathematical and statistical data processing, the indicators of personal and situational anxiety, resilience and academic performance of students at the beginning and the end of the first wave of COVID-19 were analyzed. The interrelationships between the components of the studied phenomena were identified, as well as the positive and negative aspects of the new online learning format from the student point of view. In particular, the results revealed the prolonged influence of resilience components such as social and emotional flexibility. There is also a link between situational anxiety and students' academic performance.

Risks and outcomes remain poorly understood. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to five Johns Hopkins hospitals was conducted between March and August 2020. CAPA was defined using composite clinical criteria. Fine and Gray competing risks regression was used to analyze clinical outcomes and multilevel mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression was used to compare longitudinal disease severity scores. RESULTS: Amongst the cohort of 396 people, 39 met criteria for CAPA. Compared to those without, patients with CAPA were more likely to have underlying pulmonary vascular disease (41% vs 21.6%, p=0.01), liver disease (35.9% vs 18.2%, p=0.02), coagulopathy (51.3% vs 33.1%, p=0.03), solid tumors (25.6% vs 10.9%, p=0.017), multiple myeloma (5.1% vs 0.3%, p=0.027), corticosteroid exposure during index admission (66.7% vs 42.6%, p=0.005), and had a lower BMI (median 26.6 vs 29.9, p=0.04). People with CAPA had worse outcomes as measured by ordinal severity of disease scores, requiring longer time to improvement (adjusted odds ratio 1.081.091.1, p<0.001), and advancing in severity almost twice as fast (subhazard ratio, sHR 1.31.82.5, p<0.001). People with CAPA were intubated twice as long as those without (sHR) 0.40.50.6, p<0.001) and had a longer hospital length of stay [median (IQR) 41.1 (20.5, 72.4) vs 18.5 (10.7, 31.8), p<0.001].

A questionnaire about glove reliability, including protection in tasks, durability, integrity and tear resistance, feeling fearful, and focusing on duties, and the nurses' anxiety regarding their infection with coronavirus was distributed to the selected nurses to complete. 375 questionnaires were completed (response rate of 93.75%). Among the participants, 180 (48%) were in the corona section and 195 (52%) were hardly possible to have contact with coronavirus pneumonia patients. RESULTS: The mean score (SD) of anxiety about infection with COVID-19 for nurses in the COVID-19 section and those in the non-COVID-19 section were 6.08 (2.8) and 4.56 (2.58), respectively (p<0.05). The mean duration of gloves usage in a day was almost similar in the two groups (about 5h), but the number of glove replacements was significantly higher among the nurses in the corona section (6 times) compared to those in the non-corona section (3 times). The two groups were also significantly different regarding glove protection in daily tasks and glove durability. CONCLUSION: The nurses in the corona section had more concerns about medical gloves as a type of personal protective equipment. In addition to health education on controlling and preventing the spread of diseases, raising awareness about the reliability of personal protective equipment can improve nurses' performance.","Jahangiri, M; Malakoutikhah, M; Choobineh, A; Zare, A",J. healthc. qual. res,,144

An information note,2021,"We present a forecasting model aim to predict hospital occupancy in metropolitan areas during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Our SEIRD type model features asymptomatic and symptomatic infections with detailed hospital dynamics. We model explicitly branching probabilities and non-exponential residence times in each latent and infected compartments. Using both hospital admittance confirmed cases and deaths, we infer the contact rate and the initial conditions of the dynamical system, considering breakpoints to model lockdown interventions and the increase in effective population size due to lockdown relaxation. The latter features let us model lockdown-induced 2nd waves. Our Bayesian approach allows us to produce timely probabilistic forecasts of hospital demand. We have applied the model to analyze more than 70 metropolitan areas and 32 states in Mexico.","Capistran, Marcos A; Capella, Antonio; Christen, J Andrés",PLoS One,,144

This is an ecological study of COVID-19 cases and deaths between 26 February and 31 July 2020. All Brazilian counties were used as units of analysis. The incidence, mortality, Bayesian incidence and mortality rates, global and local Moran indices were calculated. A geographic weighted regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between incidence and mortality due to COVID-19 and socioeconomic indicators (independent variables). There were confirmed 2 662 485 cases of COVID-19 reported in Brazil from February to July 2020 with higher rates of incidence in the north and northeast. The Moran global index of incidence rate (0.50, P = 0.01) and mortality (0.45 with P = 0.01) indicate a positive spatial autocorrelation with high standards in the north, northeast and in the largest urban centres between cities in the southeast region. In the same period, there were 92 475 deaths from COVID-19, with higher mortality rates in the northern states of Brazil, mainly Amazonas, Pará and Amapá. The results show that there is a geospatial correlation of COVID-19 in large urban centres and regions with the lowest human development index in the country. In the geographic weighted regression, it was possible to identify that the percentage of people living in residences with density higher than 2 per dormitory, the municipality human development index (MHDI) and the social vulnerability index were the indicators that most contributed to explaining incidence, social development index and the municipality human development index contributed the most to the mortality model. We hope that the findings will contribute to reorienting public health responses to combat COVID-19 in Brazil, the new epicentre of the disease in South America, as well as in other countries that have similar epidemiological and health characteristics to those in Brazil.","Castro, R R; Santos, R S C; Sousa, G J B; Pinheiro, Y T; Martins, R R I M; Pereira, M L D; Silva, R A R",Epidemiol Infect,,144

Governments around the world have imposed lockdown to slow down the transmissions. In the meantime, researchers worked hard to find the vaccine. Fortunately, we have found the vaccine, in fact a good number of them. However, managing the testing and vaccination process of the total population is a mammoth job. There are multiple government and private sector organisations that are working together to ensure proper testing and vaccination. However, there is always delay or data silo problems in multi-organisational works. Therefore, streamlining this process is vital to improve the efficiency and save more lives. It is already proved that technology has a significant impact on the health sector, including blockchain. Blockchain provides a distributed system along with greater privacy, transparency and authenticity. In this article, we have presented a blockchain-based system that seamlessly integrates testing and vaccination system, allowing the system to be transparent. The instant verification of any tamper-proof result and a transparent and efficient vaccination system have been exhibited and implemented in the research.

Although use of personal protective equipment is a critical strategy to protect health care personnel from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), other strategies also need to be implemented on labor and delivery units to reduce the risk of health care-associated transmission, including screening of all pregnant women who present for care (case identification), placing a mask on and rapidly isolating ill pregnant women, and minimizing the number of personnel who enter the room of an ill patient (physical distancing). Although the mechanism of transmission of COVID-19 is not known with certainty, current evidence suggests that COVID-19 is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets. Therefore, strict adherence to hand hygiene and consistent use of recommended personal protective equipment are cornerstones for reducing transmission. In addition, it is critical that health care professionals receive training on and practice correct donning (putting on) and doffing (removing) of personal protective equipment and avoid touching their faces as well as their facial protection to minimize self-contamination.","Jamieson, Denise J; Steinberg, James P; Martinello, Richard A; Perl, Trish M; Rasmussen, Sonja A",Obstet Gynecol,,144

No studies have specifically assessed COVID-19-associated superinfections or AMR. Based on limited data from case series, it is reasonable to anticipate that an appreciable minority of patients with severe COVID-19 will develop superinfections, most commonly pneumonia due to nosocomial bacteria and Aspergillus. Microbiology and AMR patterns are likely to reflect institutional ecology. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial use is likely to be widespread among hospitalized patients, both as directed and empiric therapy. Stewardship will have a crucial role in limiting unnecessary antimicrobial use and AMR. Congressional COVID-19 relief bills are considering antimicrobial reimbursement reforms and antimicrobial subscription models, but it is unclear if these will be included in final legislation. Prospective studies on COVID-19 superinfections are needed, data from which can inform rational antimicrobial treatment and stewardship strategies, and models for market reform and sustainable drug development.","Clancy, Cornelius J; Nguyen, M Hong",Clin. infect. dis,,144

The aim was to evaluate work participation up to 10 years after colon or rectal cancer diagnosis compared between diagnosis and to a matched cancer-free population. METHODS: In this national register-based cohort study, all first-time CRC patients in the period 2000-2015 with no previous cancer, between 20 and 60 years, were identified in the Danish Cancer Registry. A control group with no previous cancer was matched on gender, age, education, and income. For each year a mean Work Participation Score (WPS) was calculated (a percentage of weeks working) for individuals part of the labour market. RESULTS: A total of 5625 colon cancer patients and 3856 rectal cancer patients and 25,341 and 17,256 matched controls were included in the study, respectively. The WPS increased for colon cancer patients from 45.69% after 1 year to 83.94% after 4 years, while rectal cancer patients had a score of 38.07% after 1 year and 80.07% after 4 years. The WPS was lower for cancer patients compared with controls, but the difference decreased after 4 years. CONCLUSION: CRC patients had a lower work participation up to 10 years after diagnosis compared with controls, while rectal cancer patients had a lower participation the first 7 years after diagnosis compared with colon cancer patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Work-related issues should be considered in the early stage of rehabilitation to increase work participation and thereby improve quality of life.","Pedersen, Pernille; Laurberg, Søren; Andersen, Niels Trolle; Steenstra, Ivan; Nielsen, Claus Vinther; Maribo, Thomas; Juul, Therese",Journal of cancer survivorship (Online),,144

To achieve this goal, it is important to identify surrogates of immune protection, namely, CoV-2 MHC Class I and II immunodominant pieces/epitopes and methodologies to measure them. Here, we present results of flow cytometry-based MHC Class I and II QuickSwitchTM platforms for assessing SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding affinities to various human alleles as well as the H-2 Kb mouse allele. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 potential MHC binders were screened and validated by QuickSwitch testing. The screen included 31 MHC Class I and 19 MHC Class II peptides predicted to be good binders by the IEDB web resource provided by NIAID. While several predicted peptides with acceptable theoretical Kd showed poor MHC occupancies, fourteen MHC class II and three MHC class I peptides showed promiscuity in that they bind to multiple MHC molecule types. In addition to providing important data towards the study of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its presented antigenic epitopes, the peptides identified in this study can be used in the QuickSwitch platform to generate MHC tetramers. With those tetramers, scientists can assess CD4 + and CD8 + immune responses to these different MHC/peptide complexes.","Poluektov, Yuri; George, Marybeth; Daftarian, Pirouz; Delcommenne, Marc C",Vaccine,,144

Among them, ocular infections caused by herpesviruses are the most frequent. HSV-1 keratitis and kerato-uveitis affect approximately are the leading cause of infectious blindness in the Western world, mainly because of corneal opacification caused by recurrences. For this reason, they may warrant long-term antiviral prophylaxis. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus, accounts for 10 to 20% of all shingles locations and can be associated with severe ocular involvement (keratitis, kerato-uveitis) of which a quarter becomes chronic/recurrent. Post herpetic neuralgias in the trigeminal territory can be particularly debilitating. Necrotizing retinitis caused by herpesviruses (HSV, VZV, CMV) are seldom, but must be considered as absolute visual emergencies, requiring urgent intravenous and intravitreal antiviral treatment. Clinical pictures depend on the immune status of the host. Adenovirus are the most frequent cause of infectious conjunctivitis. These most often benign infections are highly contagious and may be complicated by visually disabling corneal lesions that may last over months or years. Some arboviruses may be associated with inflammatory ocular manifestations. Among them, congenital Zika infections may cause macular or optic atrophy. Conjunctivitis is frequent during the acute phase of Ebola virus disease. Up to 15% of survivors present with severe chronic inflammatory ocular conditions caused by viral persistence in uveal tissues. Finally, COVID-19-associated conjunctivitis can precede systemic disease, or even be the unique manifestation of the disease.

COVID-19 is now a global pandemic and public health emergency due to rapid human-to-human transmission. The impact is far-reaching, with enforced social distancing and isolation, detrimental effects on individual physical activity and mental wellbeing, education in the young and economic impact to business. Whilst most COVID-19 patients demonstrate mild-to-moderate symptoms, those with severe disease progression are at a higher risk of mortality. As more is learnt about this novel disease, it is becoming evident that comorbid cardiovascular disease is associated with a greater severity and increased mortality. Many patients positive for COVID-19 demonstrate increased concentrations of cardiac troponin, creating confusion in clinical interpretation. While myocardial infarction is associated with acute infectious respiratory disease, the majority of COVID-19 patients demonstrate stable cTn rather than the dynamically changing values indicative of an acute coronary syndrome. Although full understanding of the mechanism of cTn release in COVID-19 is currently lacking, this mini-review assesses the limited published literature with a view to offering insight to pathophysiological mechanisms and reported treatment regimens.","Gaze, David C",Ann Clin Biochem,,144

The index ranked 195 countries according to their expected preparedness in case of a pandemic or other biological threat. The Covid-19 pandemic provides the background to compare each country's predicted performance from the GHSI with the actual performance. In general, there is an inverted relation between predicted versus actual performance, i.e. the predicted top performers are among those that are the worst hit. Obviously, this reflects poorly on the potential policy uses of the index. This paper analyses the reasons for the poor match between prediction and reality in the index, and mentions six general observations applying to global indices in this respect. The level of abstraction in these global indices builds uncertainties upon uncertainties which potentially removes them from the policy needs on the ground. From this, the question is raised if the policy community might have better tools for decision making. On the basis of data from the INGSA Policy-making Tracker, some simple heuristics are suggested, which may be more useful than a global index.","Kaiser, Matthias; Chen, Andrew Tzer-Yeu; Gluckman, Peter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13637v1.pdf,144

Methods: Field epidemiological survey was conducted. Results: Case 1 of the long-term residents from Hubei province was the source of infection of this family clustering. There were 6 cases (from case 2 to case 7) infected in the whole incubation period. The incubation period was more than 14 days for 3 of the second-generation cases. Routes of transmission included respiratory droplets (from case 1 transmitted to case 6, from case 1 to her family members) and close contact (from case 1 to other cases in her family). All the age groups were generally susceptible, while elderly were easier to progress to critically ill. Besides respiratory symptoms, there were also gastrointestinal symptoms, of which diarrhea was the most common one. Conclusions: Family clustering had been an important part for COVID-19 cases.","Guan, Q; Liu, M; Zhuang, Y J; Yuan, Y; Wang, S S; Li, J; Chen, Z; Yang, X L; Tang, Z R; Jia, H J; Ma, J Y; Wang, X X; Tai, P G; He, Y",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,144

Little research has been done to assess how COVID-19 has affected pharmacists' employment, workload, and feelings of burnout. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on pharmacists' employment status, workload, and feelings of burnout, as well as to examine emotional health concerns related to COVID-19. METHODS: Wisconsin pharmacists were surveyed using an online instrument between August 25, 2020, and September 22, 2020. The data analysis, performed in December 2020, examined employment status, 3 common burnout risk factors (workload, rewards, and social depersonalization), and emotional health concerns related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 1300 pharmacists, 439 completed the survey (33.8%). The study analysis included pharmacists in community (n = 127) and hospital or health system (n = 107) settings. With regard to employment changes and workload, hospital pharmacists (36%) were more likely to have their hours reduced than community pharmacists (13%) (P < 0.01), and, conversely, community pharmacists (19%) were more likely to have their hours increased than hospital pharmacists (8%) (P = 0.01). For the burnout domain of workload, 45% of the pharmacists reported increased feelings of physical exhaustion at work, and 53% reported increased feelings of emotional exhaustion at work, with no difference between settings. Regarding the burnout domain of rewards, 6% of the hospital pharmacists and 1% of the community pharmacists experienced a reduction in hourly wages or salaries as a result of COVID-19. For the burnout domain of depersonalization, 25% of the pharmacists reported that their ability to connect with colleagues and patients decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional emotional health concerns reported by the pharmacists included 40% experiencing more anxiety and 25% experiencing more sadness or depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, with no difference between settings. CONCLUSION: This study found that the burnout domains related to workload, rewards, and depersonalization were negatively affected by COVID-19. Pharmacy managers need to proactively combat burnout as well as be reactive when employees show signs of burnout to maintain their workforce and meet the COVID-19-associated challenges.","Bakken, Brianne K; Winn, Aaron N",,,144

364275,The null effect of UVC ceiling light exposure on SARS-CoV2,2020,"BACKGROUND: Households are important sites for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and preventive measures are recommended. This study aimed to 1) investigate the impact of living with a person infected with SARS-CoV-2; 2) understand how household members implemented infection control recommendations in their home; and 3) identify the information and support needs of household members. METHODS: For this observational mixed-methods study, households with a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited via drive-through testing sites of Municipal Health Services, healthcare worker screening or hospital emergency visits in the University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands and via primary care physicians, hospital emergency visits or preoperative screening in the University Hospital of Antwerp, Belgium. We recorded household characteristics, including characteristics of all household members, together with their views on prevention measures. In a subset of households one adult household member was asked to participate in an interview investigating their views on preventive measures. Survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics and interview data by rapid framework analysis. A triangulation protocol was used to integrate findings. RESULTS: Thirty-four households (120 household members) were included in the quantitative survey. Twenty-two households were invited to be interviewed, of which 18 completed an interview (response 81.8%). Survey data showed that almost all households implemented some preventive measures, the use of face masks being least frequently reported. Measures taken depended on what was physically possible, the perceived severity of illness of the index patient and to what extent household members were willing to limit social interaction. Respondents did not believe in the effectiveness of wearing face masks within the house, and from the interviews this was explained by media coverage of face masks, impracticality and the stigma associated with wearing masks. Interviewees reported that quarantine had a high emotional burden and wished to have more information about the exact duration of quarantine, their own COVID-19 status, symptoms and when to seek medical help. CONCLUSION: People were willing to implement prevention measures, however actual adherence depended on perceived severity of illness and the perceived risk of becoming infected. Homes are social environments and recommendations for infection prevention should account for this context. Incorporating our findings into policy making could provide households with more relevant and actionable advice.","Verberk, Janneke D M; Anthierens, Sibyl A; Tonkin-Crine, Sarah; Goossens, Herman; Kinsman, John; de Hoog, Marieke L A; Bielicki, Julia A; Bruijning-Verhagen, Patricia C J L; Gobat, Nina H",PLoS One,,144
364502,Study of combining virtual screening and antiviral treatments of the Sars-CoV-2 (Covid-19),2020,"OBJECTIVE: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a chronic remitting and relapsing disorder, and abrupt discontinuation of the substance due to nonavailability in the absence of treatment precipitates withdrawals and craving. The objective of this study was to assess the craving and withdrawal coping mechanisms used by patients with SUDs as a result of disruption in availability of substances and medications due to sudden lockdown in response to coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: A survey was administered via telephone from June 25, 2020, to July 15, 2020, to patients who had previously attended the substance use clinic of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India from January 1, 2020, to March 21, 2020 (up to the time of lockdown). Sociodemographic and clinical details were obtained from case record files. A 16-item questionnaire was developed to collect information on coping with craving and withdrawal symptoms. A total of 215 patients were registered in the substance use clinic during this period for the treatment of SUDs, and of those, 43 could not be contacted due to various reasons such as wrong contact numbers, patient expired (not related to substance withdrawal), or not willing to talk. The mean age of the subjects was 37.05 (SD = 13.22) years, and men outnumbered women. The remaining 172 patients were contacted via telephone, and responses were gathered regarding withdrawal symptoms and coping with craving. RESULTS: More than two-thirds of the patients were still maintaining abstinence from their primary substance of abuse during lockdown. A large number of patients (n = 41, 43.2%) reported difficulty in obtaining prescribed medication for detoxification without renewal of their prescription. More than 66% of patients reported that they were able to control their craving, and many kept themselves busy with household activities. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients who had completed the acute phase of withdrawals were able to maintain abstinence in the absence of renewal of prescribed medication and substance of abuse due to sudden disruption in supply. The patients were able to use certain strategies to control their craving.","Sidana, Ajeet; Chavan, Bir Singh; Rohilla, Ravi; Singh, Jasvir",Prim. care companion CNS disord. (Online),,144
366187,SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Channels: A Review of the Literature,2020,"Disasters are constant threats to humankind, and beyond losses in lives, they cause many implicit yet profound societal issues such as wealth disparity and digital divide. Among those recovery measures in the aftermath of disasters, restoring and improving communication services is of vital importance. Although existing works have proposed many architectural and protocol designs, none of them have taken human factors and social equality into consideration. Recent sociological studies have shown that people from marginalized groups (e.g., minority, low income, and poor education) are more vulnerable to communication outages. In this work, we take pioneering efforts in integrating human factors into an empirical optimization model to determine strategies for post-disaster communication restoration. We cast the design into a mix-integer non-linear programming problem, which is proven too complex to be solved. Through a suite of convex relaxations, we then develop heuristic algorithms to efficiently solve the transformed optimization problem. Based on a collected dataset, we further evaluate and demonstrate how our design will prioritize communication services for vulnerable people and promote social equality compared with an existing modeling benchmark.","Liu, Jianqing; Dong, Shangjia; Morris, Thomas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10582v1.pdf,144

As of April 15, 2020, >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including >120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.","Ceylan, Zeynep",Sci Total Environ,,144
379392,Sex differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19,2021,"Sewer systems are reservoirs of pathogens and bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, most recent high-throughput studies rely on DNA-based techniques that cannot provide information on the physiological state of the cells nor expression of ARGs. In this study, wastewater and sewer sediment samples were collected from combined and separate sanitary sewer systems. The metabolically active prokaryote community was evaluated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and actively transcribed ARG abundance was measured using mRNA RT-qPCR. Three (sul1, blaTEM, tet(G)) of the eight tested ARGs were quantifiable in select samples. Sewer sediment samples had greater abundance of actively transcribed ARGs compared to wastewater. Microbiome analysis showed the presence of metabolically active family taxa that contain clinically relevant pathogens (Pseudomonadaceae, Enterobacteraceae, Streptococcaceae, Arcobacteraceae, and Clostridiaceae) and corrosion-causing prokaryotes (Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae) in both matrices. Spirochaetaceae and methanogens were more common in the sediment matrix while Mycobacteraceae were more common in wastewater. The microbiome obtained from 16S rRNA sequencing had a significantly different structure from the 16S rRNA gene microbiome. Overall, this study demonstrates active transcription of ARGs in sewer systems and provides insight into the abundance and physiological state of taxa of interest in the different sewer matrices and sewer types relevant for wastewater-based epidemiology, corrosion, and understanding the hazard posed by different matrices during sewer overflows.","Morales Medina, William R; Eramo, Alessia; Fahrenfeld, N L",,,144

Simultaneously, an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing at latitudes around 40 degrees North was observed on global scale, in line with an anomalously strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation. This atypical situation could have resulted in favorable meteorological conditions for a quicker spread of the virus over the latitude band detailed above. This possible connection needs further attention in order to understand the meteorological and climatological factors related to the COVID-19 outbreak, and for anticipating the spatio-temporal distribution of possible future pandemics.","Sanchez-Lorenzo, Arturo; Vaquero-Martinez, Javier; Lopez-Bustins, Joan-A.; Calbo, Josep; Wild, Martin; Santurtun, Ana; Folini, Doris; Vaquero, Jose-M.; Anton, Manuel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03171v1.pdf,144
381449,Evolution of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in mild-moderate COVID-19,2021,"To predict the tropism of human coronaviruses, we profile 28 SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated receptors and factors (SCARFs) using single-cell transcriptomics across various healthy human tissues. SCARFs include cellular factors both facilitating and restricting viral entry. Intestinal goblet cells, enterocytes, and kidney proximal tubule cells appear highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with clinical data. Our analysis also predicts non-canonical entry paths for lung and brain infections. Spermatogonial cells and prostate endocrine cells also appear to be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting male-specific vulnerabilities. Both pro- and anti-viral factors are highly expressed within the nasal epithelium, with potential age-dependent variation, predicting an important battleground for coronavirus infection. Our analysis also suggests that early embryonic and placental development are at moderate risk of infection. Lastly, SCARF expression appears broadly conserved across a subset of primate organs examined. Our study establishes a resource for investigations of coronavirus biology and pathology.","Singh, Manvendra; Bansal, Vikas; Feschotte, Cédric",Cell Rep,,144

It is an emergency the world has never seen before. MAIN TEXT: The attention of health systems is mainly focused on COronaVIrus Disease 19 patients and on the risk that intensive care units might be overwhelmed by the serious pulmonary complications. Different countries are also attempting to establish infection prevention and control strategies which proved effective in China where the outbreak was initially reported. We reflect on important lessons to be learnt from different countries. The effects that infection prevention and control strategies, such as social distancing or isolation, can have on the care of millions of patients with non-communicable diseases, who may be indirectly affected, have not been taken into consideration so much. CONCLUSIONS: When dealing with COronaVIrus Disease 19, policy makers and healthcare personnel should consider the indirect effects on the treatment of non-communicable diseases.","Modesti, Pietro A; Wang, Jiguang; Damasceno, Albertino; Agyemang, Charles; Van Bortel, Luc; Persu, Alexandre; Zhao, Dong; Jarraya, Faical; Marzotti, Ilaria; Bamoshmoosh, Mohamed; Parati, Gianfranco; Schutte, Aletta E",BMC Med,,144

DATA SOURCES: An electronic search was performed on June 13, 2020 on the Embase, PubMed and Scopus databases using the following search terms: (Coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR COVID19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR SARS-CoV2 OR SARSCoV2) AND (vertical OR pregnancy OR fetal). SELECTION OF STUDIES: The electronic search resulted in a total of 2,073 records. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two authors (WPM, IDESB), who checked for duplicates using the pre-established criteria for screening (studies published in English without limitation regarding the date or the status of the publication). DATA COLLECTION: Data extraction was performed in a standardized way, and the final eligibility was assessed by reading the full text of the articles. We retrieved data regarding the delivery of the potential cases of vertical transmission, as well as the main findings and conclusions of systematic reviews. DATA SYNTHESIS: The 2,073 records were reviewed; 1,000 duplicates and 896 clearly not eligible records were excluded. We evaluated the full text of 177 records, and identified only 9 suspected cases of possible vertical transmission. The only case with sufficient evidence of vertical transmission was reported in France. CONCLUSION: The risk of vertical transmission by SARS-CoV-2 is probably very low. Despite several thousands of affected pregnant women, we have identified only one case that has fulfilled sufficient criteria to be confirmed as a case of vertical transmission. Well-designed observational studies evaluating large samples are still necessary to determine the risk of vertical transmission depending on the gestational age at infection.","Barcelos, Ionara Diniz Evangelista Santos; Penna, Ivan Andrade de Araújo; Soligo, Adriana de Góes; Costa, Zelma Bernardes; Martins, Wellington Paula",Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet,,144
394090,Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 viral load: current status and future prospects,2021,"The objective is to investigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated neurological and psychiatric effects and explore possible pathogenic mechanisms. This study included 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Neurological manifestations were evaluated by well-trained neurologists, psychologists, psychiatric presentations and biochemical changes were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and electronic medical records. Eighteen (23.4%) patients presented with neurological symptoms. Patients with neurological presentations had higher urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels and lower basophil counts. Among them, patients with muscle involvement had higher urea nitrogen and cystatin C levels but lower basophil counts. In addition, patients with psychiatric presentations were older and had higher interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels and higher alkaline phosphatase, R-glutamate transferase, and urea nitrogen levels. Moreover, patients with anxiety had higher IL-6 and IL-10 levels than those without, and patients with moderate depression had higher CD8 + T cell counts and lower CD4 + /CD8 + ratios than other patients. This study indicates that the central nervous system may be influenced in patients with COVID-19, and the pathological mechanisms may be related to direct virus invasion of the central nervous system, infection-mediated overreaction of the immune system, and aberrant serum pro-inflammatory factors. In addition, basophils and cystatin C may also play important roles during these pathological processes. Our findings suggest that neurological and psychiatric presentations should be evaluated and managed in patients with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms.","He, Xudong; Zhang, Dan; Zhang, Lei; Zheng, Xu; Zhang, Ge; Pan, Konghan; Yu, Hong; Zhang, Lisan; Hu, Xingyue",Eur. arch. psychiatr. clin. neurosci,,144

METHODS: A compliance audit for press releases and epidemiological bulletins was analyzed against a quality benchmark, which had been specifically designed by the authors. This framework, made up of five dimensions and 50 items, graded (0/1), was applied by two researchers in preventive medicine. Multiplying the scores by a coefficient of two resulted in a partial score of 20 points for each dimension and a total score of 100 points for the checklist taken as a whole. The quality of the communication media was considered to be good when exceeding the thresholds of 15/20 for the different dimensions and 75/100 for the entire grid. RESULTS: A total of 141 information media were included in this audit (Tunisia: 60; Algeria: 60; Morocco: 21). The overall median quality score for these media was only 56/100 (IIQ: [46-58]), without major variability between countries. The most appreciated dimension was ""maintaining the confidence of the population"", with an overall median score of 14/20 (12/20 for epidemiological bulletins and 16/20 for press releases). The most poorly rated dimension was ""strengthening community participation"", with a median score of only 4/20 (6/20 for epidemiological bulletins and 4/20 for press releases). CONCLUSION: The quality of the Maghreb crisis communication media during COVID-19 was insufficient in most of its dimensions and items, particularly from a psychosocial standpoint. Reinforcement of the capacities of communication officers to develop information material and supports during health crises is indispensable and should be considered as an urgent matter.","Ben Abdelaziz, A; El Haddad, N; Hannachi, H; Nouira, S; Melki, S; Chebil, D; Chelly, S; Quessar, A; Boussouf, N",Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,,144

404427,Optical Biosensors for Virus Detection: Prospects for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19,2020,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: Vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by food insecurity, resulting in heightened risk of suboptimal dietary intake. Food insecure people appear to implement several coping strategies and dietary compromises to avoid hunger. Less explored in the literature is how these strategies impact consumption of food inside and outside of the home. METHODS: An online survey was completed by adults (n=1292) residing in one of five Australian states. The questionnaire comprised of the six-item US Household Food Security Survey Module, 12 socio-demographic variables and 32 questions related to elements of food literacy. RESULTS: Food insecure respondents were more likely to frequent fast food venues (p = 0.002), take away (p <0.001) and food courts (p <0.001) than their food secure counterparts. Food secure respondents reported greater use of raw (p = 0.043) and fresh, pre-prepared produce (p = 0.002) when cooking, whereas food insecure respondents were more likely to prepare food using only frozen, pre-packaged products (p <0.001). No significant differences were found between food security status and the enjoyment and social bonding derived from cooking. CONCLUSIONS: Food insecure respondents appeared to be accessing a poorer quality of food through greater consumption of take away and fast food. These dietary compromises are most likely related to perceived financial, time or cooking facilities constraints and to a lesser extent food literacy skills. SO WHAT?: This study highlights some of the health and social inequities apparent within food insecure populations. Food insecure households should be supported to access healthy fresh food and in home cooking practices. While a multi strategy approach is required, healthy food environment policy, particularly in disadvantaged areas, should be considered to guarantee all Australians have dignified access to nutritious food.","Butcher, Lucy M; O039,; Sullivan, Therese A; Ryan, Maria M; Lo, Johnny; Nyanjom, Julie; Wilkins, Hugh C; Devine, Amanda",Health promotion journal of Australia :official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,,144

The presence of multiple risk factors for COVID-19 makes it difficult to plan treatment and optimize the use of medical resources. The aim of this study is to determine potential risk factors for hospitalization or mortality in patients with COVID-19 via two novel naive Bayesian nomograms. The publicly available COVID-19 National data published by the Mexican Ministry of Health through the ""Dirección General de Epidemiología"" website was analyzed. Univariable logistic regression was utilized to identify potential risk factors that may affect hospitalization or mortality in patients with COVID-19. The naïve Bayesian classifier method was implemented to predict nomograms. The nomograms were verified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), classification accuracy (CA), F1 score, precision, recall, and calibration plot. A total of 979,430 patients (45.3 ± 15.9 years old, and 51.1% male) tested positive for COVID-19 from January 1 to November 22, 2020. Among them, 22.3% of the patients required hospitalization and 99,964 patients (9.8%) died. The most important risk factors to predict the probability of hospitalization and mortality were pneumonia, age, chronic kidney failure, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, and diabetes. The performance measures demonstrated good discrimination and calibration (hospitalization: AUC = 0.896, CA = 0.880; mortality: AUC = 0.903, CA = 0.899). Two novel nomograms to estimate the risk of hospitalization and mortality were proposed, which could be used to facilitate individualized decision-making for patients newly diagnosed with COVID-19.","Karaismailoglu, Eda; Karaismailoglu, Serkan",J Med Virol,,144

Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy in terms of morbidity, mortality, and perinatal maternal and fetal outcomes is essential to propose strategies for prevention and infection control. Here, we conducted a systematic review to investigate pregnant women infected with COVID-19 in terms of signs and symptoms, type of delivery, comorbidities, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and the possibility of vertical transmission. A search on Embase and PubMed databases was performed on 31 October 2020. Observational studies and case reports on pregnant women infected with COVID-19 were included without language restrictions. The 70 selected studies included a total of 1457 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. The most common signs and symptoms were fever, cough, and nausea. The most frequent comorbidities were obesity, hypertensive disorders, and gestational diabetes. Among maternal and fetal outcomes, premature birth (n = 64), maternal death (n = 15), intrauterine fetal death or neonatal death (n = 16), cases of intrauterine fetal distress (n = 28), miscarriage (n = 7), decreased fetal movements (n = 19), and severe neonatal asphyxia (n = 5) were the most frequent. Thirty-nine newborns tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected in the placenta (n = 13) and breast milk (n = 6). This review indicates that COVID-19 during pregnancy can result in maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 viral exposure of neonates during pregnancy and delivery cannot be ruled out. Thus, we highlight the need for long-term follow-up of newborns from mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 to establish the full implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in these children.","Amaral, Waldemar Naves do; Moraes, Carolina Leão de; Rodrigues, Ana Paula Dos Santos; Noll, Matias; Arruda, Jalsi Tacon; Mendonça, Carolina Rodrigues",,,144

409931,Mesenchymal stem cells: current clinical progress in ARDS and COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Compound liquorice tablet (CLT) is a herbal compound preparation and is used as a classic antitussive and expectorant in China. It is composed of liquorice extract powder, opioid powder, star anise oil, camphor, and sodium benzoate. The complexity of herbal materials brings a huge challenge in producing compound preparations with stable and uniform quality consistency. OBJECTIVE: To establish a new intelligent model for predicting the quality of CLT. METHODS: The HPLC fingerprints of raw materials including liquorice extract powder, powdered opium, star anise oil, and sodium benzoate were tested and merged to generate the intelligent mergence fingerprints, whose correlation with the raw materials and the CLT samples was studied. The consistency of the intelligently merged fingerprints with the standard fingerprints was observed by using the systematic quantitative fingerprint method in order to calculate quality evaluation results. RESULTS: The intelligent mergence fingerprints covered all the main fingerprint peaks of four raw materials and had a good correlation with the CLT sample fingerprint. There were no significant quality differences either among the six intelligent mergence models obtained by combining different batches of raw materials or between the reference fingerprint of the intelligent mergence connection fingerprints (RFPIMFC ) and the theoretical standard preparation (RFPS ). CONCLUSION: The computer-aided model of intelligent mergence fingerprints could be used to predict the quality of herbal compound preparations based on raw materials. In this way, preproduction quality prediction can be realised in order to avoid low-quality medicinal materials and improve the quality consistency among different batches.","Hou, Zhifei; Sun, Guoxiang",Phytochem anal,,144
411050,Blood stewardship: Conservation and supply of blood components during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,2020,"Among the four genera of influenza viruses (IVs) and the four genera of coronaviruses (CoVs), zoonotic &#945;IV and ßCoV have occasionally caused airborne epidemic outbreaks in humans, who are immunologically naïve, and the outbreaks have resulted in high fatality rates as well as social and economic disruption and losses. The most devasting influenza A virus (IAV) in &#945;IV, pandemic H1N1 in 1918, which caused at least 40 million deaths from about 500 million cases of infection, was the first recorded emergence of IAVs in humans. Usually, a novel human-adapted virus replaces the preexisting human-adapted virus. Interestingly, two IAV subtypes, A/H3N2/1968 and A/H1N1/2009 variants, and two lineages of influenza B viruses (IBV) in ßIV, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineage-like viruses, remain seasonally detectable in humans. Both influenza C viruses (ICVs) in Î³IV and four human CoVs, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in &#945;CoV and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in ßCoV, usually cause mild respiratory infections. Much attention has been given to CoVs since the global epidemic outbreaks of ßSARS-CoV in 2002-2004 and ßMERS-CoV from 2012 to present. ßSARS-CoV-2, which is causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has resulted in 890,392 deaths from about 27 million cases of infection as of 8 September 2020, has provoked worldwide investigations of CoVs. With the aim of developing efficient strategies for controlling virus outbreaks and recurrences of seasonal virus variants, here we overview the structures, diversities, host ranges and host receptors of all IVs and CoVs and critically review current knowledge of receptor binding specificity of spike glycoproteins, which mediates infection, of IVs and of zoonotic, pandemic and seasonal CoVs.","Sriwilaijaroen, Nongluk; Suzuki, Yasuo",,,144

The aim of this study is to examine the role of age in the early psychological responses to the pandemic in a Spanish community sample, focusing on how different generations coped with it. METHOD: An online survey was conducted during the early stages of the quarantine. Sociodemographic, health and behavioral variables were compared for five age groups. Mental health was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and psychological impacts were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: 3,524 participants were included (Mage = 39.24, SDage = 12.00). Participants aged between 18 and 33 years old showed more hyperactivation and evitation, were more depressed, anxious and stressed. Those aged between 26 and 33 years old showed more intrusion. Those aged between 18 and 25 years old suffered more sleep disturbances, claustrophobia and somatization and maintained worse routines. Elderly people showed better psychological responses in general. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial evidence that the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic hits young people harder. These results should be taken into account when developing specific evidence-based strategies.","Justo-Alonso, Ania; García-Dantas, Ana; González-Vázquez, Ana I; Sánchez-Martín, Milagrosa; Del Río-Casanova, Lucía",Psicothema,,144

METHODS: Files of 155 patients visiting the fever clinics at our hospital and affiliated hospitals from January 20th to February 9th, 2020 were searched. Among them, 140 cases (including 82 males and 58 females) were included as suspected COVID-19 cases based on clinical and epidemiological history; the CT image features of 70 cases with suggestive findings on CT, confirmed by positive nucleic acid test were analyzed and evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of CT in diagnosing COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with epidemiological history. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients, 84.3% showed bilateral lung involvement on CT; 27 cases (38.6%) showed ground-glass opacity (GGO), which was mostly distributed in the subpleural area (55.7%), and this sign was mainly observed in early COVID-19 patients. In addition, 41 cases (58.6%) manifested GGO combined with focal consolidation opacity, 2 (2.8%) had flake-like consolidation opacity, with involvements of the periphery of lung field and the central zone (44.3%), and this sign was mostly observed in severe or critical patients. Concomitant signs such as pleural effusion and mediastinal lymph node enlargement were rare. Among patients with epidemiological history, the sensitivity of CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was 89.7% (70/78), and the specificity was 88.7% (55/62). CONCLUSION: CT shows high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing COVID-19. CT is an important examination method in evaluation of suspected cases and assessment of disease severity.","Luo, Ning; Zhang, Han; Zhou, Yang; Kong, ZiXuan; Sun, WeiHang; Huang, Nan; Zhang, AoDan",Diagn Interv Radiol,,144
415094,Designing of Cytotoxic and Helper T Cell Epitope MaProvides Insights into the Highly Contagious Nature of the Pandemic Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV2,2020,"Propelled by versatile data capture, communication, and computing technologies, physical sensing has revolutionized the avenue for spontaneously capturing and interpreting real-world phenomenon. Despite its virtues, various limitations (e.g., high application specificity, partial autonomy, and sparse coverage) hinder physical sensing's effectiveness in critical scenarios such as disaster response. Meanwhile, social sensing is contriving as a pervasive sensing paradigm that leverages the observations from human participants equipped with portable devices and ubiquitous Internet connectivity (i.e., through social media or crowdsensing apps) to perceive the environment. While social sensing possesses a plethora of benefits, it also inherently suffers from a few drawbacks (e.g., inconsistent reliability, uncertain data provenance, and limited sensing availability). Motivated by the complementary virtues of both physical and social sensing, social-physical sensing (SPS) is protruding as an emerging sensing paradigm that tightly integrates social and physical sensors at an unprecedented scale. The vision of SPS centers on mitigating the individual weaknesses of physical and social sensing while exploiting their collective strengths in reconstructing the""state of the world"", both physically and socially. While a good amount of interesting SPS applications has been explored, several important unsolved challenges and open research questions prevail in the way of developing dependable SPS systems, which require careful study to address. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of SPS, with an emphasis on its definition and key enablers, state-of-the-art applications, potential research challenges, and road-map for future work. This paper intends to bridge the knowledge gap in current literature by thoroughly examining the various aspects of SPS crucial for building potent SPS systems.","Rashid, Md Tahmid; Wei, Na; Wang, Dong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01360v1.pdf,144

421972,Sensitive on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 by ID NOW COVID-19,2021,"Viruses such as the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that is wreaking havoc on the world, depend on interactions of its own proteins with those of the human host cells. Relatively small changes in sequence such as between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can dramatically change clinical phenotypes of the virus, including transmission rates and severity of the disease. On the other hand, highly dissimilar virus families such as Coronaviridae, Ebola, and HIV have overlap in functions. In this work we aim to analyze the role of protein sequence in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins towards human proteins and compare it to that of the above other viruses. We build supervised machine learning models, using Generalized Additive Models to predict interactions based on sequence features and find that our models perform well with an AUC-PR of 0.65 in a class-skew of 1:10. Analysis of the novel predictions using an independent dataset showed statistically significant enrichment. We further map the importance of specific amino-acid sequence features in predicting binding and summarize what combinations of sequences from the virus and the host is correlated with an interaction. By analyzing the sequence-based embeddings of the interactomes from different viruses and clustering them together we find some functionally similar proteins from different viruses. For example, vif protein from HIV-1, vp24 from Ebola and orf3b from SARS-CoV all function as interferon antagonists. Furthermore, we can differentiate the functions of similar viruses, for example orf3a's interactions are more diverged than orf7b interactions when comparing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.","Kshirsagar, Meghana; Tasnina, Nure; Ward, Michael D; Law, Jeffrey N; Murali, T M; Lavista Ferres, Juan M; Bowman, Gregory R; Klein-Seetharaman, Judith",Pac Symp Biocomput,,144
422345,Corrigendum,2020,"This report is dedicated to determination of anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) in human urine using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Aluminum oxide loaded with silver nanoparticles (AO-Ag) was proposed as SERS-active sorbent and used for solid-phase extraction (SPE) of the analyte and its SERS-based determination (SPE-SERS protocol). MTX has strong SERS signal only in alkaline media that challenges its determination in urine due to strong background signal caused by creatinine. The application of SPE step enables to purify and concentrate the analyte making MTX determination possible. Also, the application of the same material for SPE pretreatment and SERS analysis enables to simplify and speed-up the protocol. The protocol was developed and tested using artificially spiked samples of human urine collected during different time of day to account deviating composition of the urine matrix. The use of dilution step of the analyte-containing urine was proposed prior SPE-SERS protocol to reduce the difference between morning-time- and daytime-collected urine achieving maximal reliability of the analysis. Additional physicochemical study was performed to estimate an influence of the primary intrinsic urine components (salts, urea, creatinine) and their mixtures on the analytical signal. Final protocol enables MTX determination in human urine within 20-300 µg mL-1 range of concentrations with satisfactory precision (11-19% RSD), accuracy (97-104% apparent recovery), and limit of detection (4.2 µg mL-1). Accounting that the analysis requires less than 15 min and portable Raman spectrometer, the protocol seems to be promising for therapeutic drug monitoring in hospitals to identify poor MTX clearance in a timely manner and minimize adverse effects of therapy.

We report the case of a 4-day-old infant who presented with acute-onset mucopurulent discharge of the left eye as well as subconjunctival hemorrhage and palpebral injection, without corneal findings. A diagnosis of ophthalmia neonatorum was established, for which ocular cultures and Gram staining were performed. No bacterial growth was noted, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, and herpes simplex were negative. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctival SARS-CoV-2 PCR were positive. Given the identification of SARS-CoV-2 illness, lack of other underlying bacterial or viral etiology on testing, and the well-documented ability for SARS-CoV-2 to cause conjunctivitis, the clinical picture was supportive of ophthalmia neonatorum secondary to SARS-CoV-2. The infant was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin prior to culture results.

The aim of the study was to examine the disability-inclusiveness of government responses to COVID-19 in four South American Countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. METHODS: We conducted documentary research, using framework analysis to analyse reports, legislation, decrees, and other official documents that communicated measures taken in response to the pandemic, published from February 1st until May 22nd, 2020. We included documents reporting measures that affected disabled people either directly (measures specifically designed for disabled people) or indirectly (measures for the general population). We developed an analytical framework based on recommendations for disability-inclusive response to COVID-19 published by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Carribean, the World Health Organisation, and other international organisations. RESULTS: We analysed 72 documents. The findings highlight that while some positive measures were taken, the needs of disabled people were not fully considered. Several countries published recommendations for a disability-inclusive response to COVID-19, without ensuring their translation to practice. All countries took at least some steps to ensure access to financial support, health, and education for disabled people, but at the same time they also implemented policies that had a detrimental impact on disabled people. The populations that are most exposed to the impacts of COVID-19, including disabled people living in institutional care, were protected in several cases only by recommendations rather by legislation. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates how the official government responses taken by four countries in the region - while positive, in several aspects - do not fully address the needs of disabled people, thus further disadvantaging them. In order to ensure response to COVID - 19 is disability inclusive, it is necessary to translate recommendations to practice, consider disabled people both in mainstream policy and in disability-specific measures, and focus on the long-term reconstruction phase.","Sakellariou, Dikaios; Malfitano, Ana Paula Serrata; Rotarou, Elena S",Int J Equity Health,,144

The formulation of functional materials requires synergistic understanding on the properties of materials and mechanisms of virus transmission and disease progression, including secondary bacterial infections that are prevalent in COVID-19 patients. A viable candidate in the struggle against the pandemic is antimicrobial polymer, due to their favorable properties of flexibility, lightweight, and ease of synthesis. Polymers are the base material for personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves, face mask, face shield, and coverall suit for frontliners. Conducting polymers (CPs) are polymers with electrical properties due to the addition of dopant in the polymer structure. The conductivity of polymers augments their antiviral and antibacterial properties. This review discusses the types of CPs and how their properties could be exploited to ward off bacterial infections in hospital settings, specifically in cases involving COVID-19 patients. This review also covers common CPs fabrication techniques. The key components to produce CPs at several possibilities to fit the current needs in fighting secondary bacterial infections are also discussed.","Mahat, Mohd Muzamir; Sabere, Awis Sukarni Mohmad; Azizi, Juzaili; Amdan, Nur Asyura Nor",Emergent Mater,,144

These VHHs neutralize MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1 S pseudotyped viruses, respectively. Crystal structures of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs interfere with receptor binding. We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-directed VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S and demonstrate that this cross-reactive VHH neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion.

The study was exploratory in nature, with its main objective consisting of inductively identifying topics embedded in user-generated content. We found that a five-topic model was the best in representing the data corpus, including: (i) the public's perception of gambling addiction amid the COVID-19 outbreak, (ii) risks and support available for those who stay at home, (iii) the users' interpretation of gambling addiction, (iv) forms of gambling during the pandemic, and (v) gambling advertising and impact on families. Sentiment analysis showed a prevalence of underlying fear, trust, sadness, and anger, across the corpus. Users viewed the pandemic as a driver of problematic gambling behaviors, possibly exposing unprepared individuals and communities to forms of online gambling, with potential long-term consequences and a significant impact on health systems. Despite the limitations of the study, we hypothesize that enhancing the presence of mental health operators and practitioners treating problem gambling on social media might positively impact public mental health and help prevent health services from being overwhelmed, in times when healthcare resources are limited.","Fino, Emanuele; Hanna-Khalil, Bishoy; Griffiths, Mark D",J Addict Dis,,144

An important reason behind the widespread social anxiety is the huge uncertainty about the pandemic. One major uncertainty is how many or what percentage of people have been infected? There are published and frequently updated data on various statistics of the pandemic, at local, country or global level. However, due to various reasons, many cases were not included in those reported numbers. We propose a structured approach for the estimation of the number of unreported cases, where we distinguish cases that arrive late in the reported numbers and those who had mild or no symptoms and thus were not captured by any medical system at all. We use post-report data for the estimation of the former and population matching to the latter. We estimate that the reported number of infected cases in the US should be corrected by multiplying a factor of 220.54% as of Apr 20, 2020. The infection ratio out of the US population is estimated to be 0.53%, implying a case mortality rate at 2.85% which is close to the 3.4% suggested by the WHO.","Yan, Donghui; Xu, Ying; Wang, Pei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12993v1.pdf,144

Both photobioelectrodes are driven by enzymatic glucose conversion. Whereas the photobioanode can collect electrons from sugar oxidation at rather low potential, the photobiocathode shows reduction currents at rather high potential. The electrodes can be arranged sandwich-like due to the semi-transparent nature of BiFeO 3 , which also guarantees a simultaneous excitation of the photobioanode when illuminated via the cathode side. This tandem cell can generate electricity under illumination and in the presence of glucose and provides an exceptionally high OCV of about 1 V. The developed semi-artificial system has significant implications on the integration of biocatalysts in photoactive entities for bioenergetic purposes and opens a new way for the generation of electricity from sun light and (bio-)fuels.","Riedel, Marc; Höfs, Soraya; Ruff, Adrian; Schuhmann, Wolfgang; Lisdat, Fred",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,144

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to iteratively devise protocols and processes that minimized HCW exposure while safely and effectively caring for children who may require unanticipated aerosol-generating procedures. METHODS: As part of our PED's initiative to optimize clinical care and HCW safety during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, regular multidisciplinary systems and process simulation sessions were conducted. These sessions allowed us to evaluate and reorganize patient flow, test and improve communication modalities, alter the process for consultation in resuscitations, and teach and reinforce the appropriate donning and use of personal protective equipment. RESULTS: Simulation was a highly effective method to disseminate new practices to PED staff. Numerous workflow modifications were implemented as a result of our in situ systems and process simulations. Total number of persons in the resuscitation room was minimized, use of a ""command post"" with remote providers was initiated, communication devices and strategies were trialed and adopted, and personal protective equipment standards that optimized HCW safety and communication were enacted. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation can be an effective and agile tool in restructuring patient workflow and care of the most critically ill or injured patients in a PED during a novel pandemic.","Lavoie, Megan E; Tay, Khoon-Yen; Good, Grace; Buchhalter, Lillian; Abbadessa, Mary Kate; Gaines, Shannon; Myers, Sage",Pediatr Emerg Care,,144

At the time of writing, approximately 16.06 million cases have been reported worldwide. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 relies on the surface Spike glycoprotein to access the host cells, mainly through the interaction of its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with the host receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a profound downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine storm. This release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines is underpinning lung tissue damage, respiratory failure, and eventually multiple organ failure in COVID-19 patients. The phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 is positively correlated with virus load and ERK1/2 inhibition suppressed viral replication and viral infectivity. Therefore, molecular entities able to interfere with binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2, or damping hyperinflammatory cytokines storm, blocking ERK1/2 phosphorylation have a great potential to inhibit viral entry along with viral infectivity. Herein, we report that the FDA-approved non-peptide opioid antagonist drug, naltrexone suppresses high fat/LPS induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release both from macrophage cells and Adipose Tissue Macrophage. Moreover, Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) also showed its activity as an ERK1/2 inhibitor. Notably, virtual docking and simulation data also suggest LDN may disrupt the interaction of ACE2 with RBD. LDN may be considered as a target as the treatment and (or) adjuvant therapy for coronavirus infection. Clinical toxicity measurements may not be required for LDN since naltrexone was previously tested and is an approved drug by the FDA. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

462696,Is the kidney a target of SARS-CoV-2?,2020,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is an acute and rapidly developing pandemic, which leads to a global health crisis. SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks human alveoli and causes severe lung infection and damage. To better understand the molecular basis of this disease, we sought to characterize the responses of alveolar epithelium and its adjacent microvascular endothelium to viral infection under a co-culture system. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused massive virus replication and dramatic organelles remodeling in alveolar epithelial cells, alone. While, viral infection affected endothelial cells in an indirect manner, which was mediated by infected alveolar epithelium. Proteomics analysis and TEM examinations showed viral infection caused global proteomic modulations and marked ultrastructural changes in both epithelial cells and endothelial cells under the co-culture system. In particular, viral infection elicited global protein changes and structural reorganizations across many sub-cellular compartments in epithelial cells. Among the affected organelles, mitochondrion seems to be a primary target organelle. Besides, according to EM and proteomic results, we identified Daurisoline, a potent autophagy inhibitor, could inhibit virus replication effectively in host cells. Collectively, our study revealed an unrecognized cross-talk between epithelium and endothelium, which contributed to alveolar-capillary injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection. These new findings will expand our understanding of COVID-19 and may also be helpful for targeted drug development.","Wang, Peng; Luo, Ronghua; Zhang, Min; Wang, Yaqing; Song, Tianzhang; Tao, Tingting; Li, Zhongyu; Jin, Lin; Zheng, Hongyi; Chen, Wenwen; Zhao, Mengqian; Zheng, Yongtang; Qin, Jianhua",Cell Death Dis,,144

465423,Lessons learned 1 year after SARS-CoV-2 emergence leading to COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"It has been widely recognized that access to mental health treatment is imperative to address current and long-term stressors for children and parents during COVID-19. Internet-delivered Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (iPCIT, previously referred to as I-PCIT) is a strong model for remote service delivery during social distancing restrictions due to its empirical base. However, this treatment modality was not widely implemented before COVID-19, likely due to barriers to providing telehealth services. This mixed methods study conducted a follow-up survey to gather therapist experiences (N = 223) in delivering iPCIT during COVID-19, including qualitative data on the benefits and challenges to delivering iPCIT. The vast majority of therapists (82%) indicated that they transitioned to deliver PCIT via telehealth in response to COVID-19. PCIT caseloads decreased slightly from the first survey to the COVID-19 follow-up survey, but the racial and ethnic composition of caseloads were not significantly different between the two surveys. Of the 183 therapists who transitioned to deliver PCIT via telehealth, 82% expressed interest in continuing to provide iPCIT following the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported benefits of iPCIT included decreased barriers to access and the ability to practice skills within the naturalistic home environment. Challenges to iPCIT were primarily issues with technology as well as other logistical barriers, which could limit engagement for some families. Findings from this study may be beneficial in improving future implementation of iPCIT during and post-COVID-19.","Barnett, Miya L; Sigal, Marika; Green Rosas, Yessica; Corcoran, Frederique; Rastogi, Medini; Jent, Jason F",,,144

This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of clinical gastroenterology and gastrointestinal endoscopy practices during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled physician members of the Indonesian Society for Digestive Endoscopy. We used an online self-administered questionnaire disseminated via social media. The 32-item survey determined the baseline characteristics of the participants, characteristics of clinical gastroenterology and gastrointestinal endoscopy practices, involvement of the physicians in the management of COVID-19, and overall impact of the pandemic on practice. All collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: The 200 participants in this study had a median age of 50 (34-76) years. Modifications in clinical gastroenterology practice were frequently reported in the outpatient (95.5%) and inpatient (100%) settings. All participants reported changes in the gastrointestinal endoscopy practice patterns. Of the participants, 86.0% were working in high-risk zones, and several of them reported inadequate protective personal equipment (34.0%).

As telemedicine has evolved over the last decade, remote monitoring emerged as a new and powerful modality. COVID-19 requires scaled interactions with populations in near real-time. Remote monitoring has specific operational and design features that are well suited for the COVID-19, especially the asynchronous communication. Monitoring can be used in particular to gather pandemic data and obtain real-time clinical feedback. As telemedicine continues to grow and evolve, remote monitoring is emerging as a valuable tool for payers, providers, and public health officials alike.","Watson, Andrew R; Wah, Robert; Thamman, Ritu",Telemed J E Health,,144
472237,Serpentoviruses: More than Respiratory Pathogens,2020,"OBJECTIVE: As an intravenous anesthetic, propofol has been exhibited to provide excellent clinical analgesia. Whether propofol has amelioration property for NP and neuroinflammation remains unexplored. The present study was arranged to probe the role of propofol in the mitigation of NP and neuroinflammation in rats and underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Rats were randomly classified into the following groups: Model, Sham, Control, Propofol, GW9662, and Saline groups. The radiant heat stimulation was used to measure paw withdrawal latency (PWL), and mechanical stimulation was employed to detect paw withdrawal threshold (PWT). Subsequently, the expression of GFAP was assessed by immunofluorescence to reflect the activation of astrocyte. qRT-PCR and Western blot were utilized for the performance of mRNA and protein expression levels of PPAR Î³ as well as inflammation factors (TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, and IL-6). RESULTS: Pentobarbital sodium anesthesia significantly shortened the PWL and PWT, suppressed PPAR Î³ expression in rats in addition to elevating astrocyte activation and inflammation response. Propofol treatment attenuated the NP of rats as evidenced by restrained astrocyte activation level and inflammation factor levels. Rats treated with propofol had markedly heightened PPAR Î³ expression. PPAR Î³ exposure ameliorated NP and inflammation degree, which demonstrated by elevated astrocyte activation and inflammation levels as well as suppressed PWL and PWT in rats injected with PPAR Î³ inhibitor. Besides, PPAR Î³ decreased the expression level of ß-catenin. CONCLUSION: Propofol ameliorates NP and neuroinflammation of rats by up-regulating PPAR Î³ expression to block the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway.","Jiang, Peng; Jiang, Qun; Yan, Yan; Hou, Zhiqi; Luo, Dexing",Neurol Res,,144

Stroke is a major neurological disease contributing to death and disability worldwide, and is still an ongoing issue during the pandemic. Here we investigate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on stroke manifestations, treatment courses, the outcome of stroke patients, and the hospitalization rate in a referral center for stroke management in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: We extracted data regarding 31 stroke patients (10 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019) and compared the demographic and pathological characteristics of the patients with or without coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The association of demographic/pathological characteristics of stroke patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and a corresponding period during the previous year (49 patients) and an earlier period during the same year as the pandemic (50 patients) was also evaluated. RESULTS: The absolute number of admissions decreased about 40% during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Except for the stroke severity (P = 0.002), there were no significant changes in the demographic and pathological characteristics of the stroke patients during the three studied periods. A significantly higher mean of age (75.60 ± 9.54 versus 60.86 ± 18.45; P = 0.007), a significant difference in the type of stroke (P = 0.046), and significantly higher stroke severity (P = 0.024) were observed in stroke patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with those of stroke patients without coronavirus disease 2019. Treatment approaches, duration of hospitalization, and mortality rates did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that the pandemic caused the number of acute stroke admissions to plummet compared to other periods. Although the pandemic did not affect the treatment plans and care of the patients, stroke cases with coronavirus disease 2019 had higher age, more large vessel ischemic stroke, and more severe stroke. Further studies are urgently needed to realize the probable interaction of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the neurologic disease.","Mehrpour, M; Shuaib, A; Farahani, M; Hatamabadi, H R; Fatehi, Z; Ghaffari, M; Moghadam, N B; Aghamiri, S H; Mansouri, B; Assarzadegan, F; Lima, B S; Hesami, O",Int J Stroke,,144

This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study, with a quantitative approach, carried out in eight LTCF in the Metropolitan Region of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, with a population of 267 elderly people, between the months of February and December 2018. The Elderly Health Handbook was used to collect data on sociodemographic, health and risk factors. The Pearson's Chi-square test and odds ratio were used for the analysis. A higher frequency of low weight was observed in elderly people with cognitive impairment (24.6%), and overweight in those hypertensive (23.3%) and diabetics (12.9%). BMI was associated with the age group of 80 years or over, hypertension and diabetes (p = 0.013; p < 0.001; p = 0.001). Hypertensive elderly people were more likely to have low weight when compared to non-hypertensive individuals (RC = 3.6; 95% CI 1.5-8.6). The institutionalized elderly individuals present health conditions that may contribute to the occurrence of adverse outcomes in case of infection by Covid-19. The importance of protective measures for this population must be reinforced, in view of the devastating action of this disease in these institutions.","Araújo, Mayara Priscilla Dantas; Nunes, Vilani Medeiros de Araújo; Costa, Larissa de Albuquerque; Souza, Talita Araujo de; Torres, Gilson de Vasconcelos; Nobre, Thaiza Teixeira Xavier",PLoS One,,144

Adverse income shocks have caused malnutrition and food insecurity and have increased the need for food assistance. The present study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food insecurity and investigates the determinants of food security and coping strategies in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Data were collected through the internet and received responses from 370 respondents. The household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS) model was applied to examine food insecurity, and a logit regression model was used to analyze its determining factors. The results illustrate that food insecurity substantially increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Households’ demographics and socioeconomic factors have influence on food insecurity. Households with a large family size and people in quarantine found more food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, while financial assistance played a role in a decline in food insecurity. Households handle the negative income shocks by eating less preferred food and getting support from government and charity organizations. It is suggested that stakeholders and responsible institutes provide financial assistance to support low-income families in order to enhance food security. Furthermore, policymakers should strengthen social safety nets and aid programs such as the Ehsas income program in the province of the country.","Shahzad, Muhammad Aamir Qing Ping Rizwan Muhammad Razzaq Amar Faisal Muhammad",Healthcare,,144

Antibody combinations were effective for prevention and in therapy when administered early. However, in vitro antibody neutralization potency did not uniformly correlate with in vivo protection, and some hu-mAbs were more protective in combination in vivo. Analysis of antibody Fc regions revealed that binding to activating Fc receptors contributes to optimal protection against SARS-CoV-2 MA. The data indicate that intact effector function can affect hu-mAb protective activity and that in vivo testing is required to establish optimal hu-mAb combinations for COVID-19 prevention.","Schäfer, Alexandra; Muecksch, Frauke; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Leist, Sarah R; Cipolla, Melissa; Bournazos, Stylianos; Schmidt, Fabian; Maison, Rachel M; Gazumyan, Anna; Martinez, David R; Baric, Ralph S; Robbiani, Davide F; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Ravetch, Jeffrey V; Bieniasz, Paul D; Bowen, Richard A; Nussenzweig, Michel C; Sheahan, Timothy P",J. exp. med,,144

However, digital inequalities persist and affect rural communities as well. Schools can play a key role in bridging digital inequalities, but little attention has been paid to the specific conditions rural schools find themselves in when facing continuous digital developments. Therefore, we apply the digital inclusion lens and explore the impact of digital developments on rural schools in the German context. In 2019, we conducted 16 in-depth interviews with heads and teachers from rural elementary and secondary schools in Baden-Wurttemberg and Lower Saxony. We found that smaller rural schools especially can experience difficulties and conclude that the contribution of schools to a digital-included society is subject to a geographical lottery. This could eventually increase existing rural–urban digital inequalities and these findings are also relevant in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing a sudden switch to distance learning. © 2021 by the authors.

We aimed to review the public health interventions used during the COVID-19 outbreak and describe the impact on seasonal influenza activity in Korea. METHODS: National response strategies and public health interventions, along with daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea were reviewed during the pandemic. National influenza surveillance data were compared between seven sequential seasons. Characteristics of each season, including the rate of influenza-like illness (ILI), duration of epidemic, date of termination of epidemic, distribution of influenza virus strain and hospitalization were analyzed. RESULTS: After various public health interventions including enforced public education on hand hygiene, cough etiquette and staying at home with respiratory symptoms, universal mask use in public places, refrain from non-essential social activities and school closure, the duration of the influenza epidemic in 2019/2020 decreased by 6-12 weeks and the influenza activity peak rated 49.8 ILI/1,000 visits compared to 71.9-86.2 ILI/1,000 visits of previous seasons. During the period of enforced social distancing from week 9 to 17 of 2020, influenza hospitalization cases were 11.9-26.9-fold lower compared with previous seasons. During the 2019/2020 season, influenza B accounted for only 4%, in contrast with previous seasons in which influenza B accounted for 26.6% to 54.9% of all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to activate high level national response not only led to a decrease in COVID-19, but also substantial decrease in seasonal influenza activity. Interventions applied to control COVID-19 may serve as useful strategies for prevention and control of influenza in upcoming seasons.","Lee, Hyunju; Lee, Heeyoung; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Kim, Eu Suk; Park, Jeong Su; Jung, Jongtak; Ahn, Soyeon; Jeong, Eun Kyeong; Park, Hyekyung; Kim, Hong Bin",Clin. infect. dis,,144

501541,Antiviral drugs against sars-COV-2 for the treatment of COVID-19,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently accelerating. Patients with locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) may require treatment in locations where resources are limited, and the prevalence of infection is high. Patients with LA-NSCLC frequently present with comorbidities that increase the risk of severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. These risks may be further increased by treatments for LA-NSCLC. Although guiding data is scarce, we present an expert thoracic oncology multidisciplinary (radiation oncology, medical oncology, surgical oncology) consensus of alternative strategies for the treatment of LA-NSCLC during a pandemic. The overarching goals of these approaches are the following: (1) reduce the number of visits to a health care facility, (2) reduce the risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, (3) attenuate the immunocompromising effects of lung cancer therapies, and (4) provide effective oncologic therapy. Patients with resectable disease can be treated with definitive nonoperative management if surgical resources are limited or the risks of perioperative care are high. Nonoperative options include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, and radiation therapy with sequential schedules that may or may not affect long-term outcomes in an era in which immunotherapy is available. The order of treatments may be on the basis of patient factors and clinical resources. Whenever radiation therapy is delivered without concurrent chemotherapy, hypofractionated schedules are appropriate. For patients who are confirmed to have COVID-19, usually, cancer therapies may be withheld until symptoms have resolved with negative viral test results. The risk of severe treatment-related morbidity and mortality is increased for patients undergoing treatment for LA-NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapting alternative treatment strategies as quickly as possible may save lives and should be implemented through communication with the multidisciplinary cancer team.","Kumar, Sameera; Chmura, Steven; Robinson, Clifford; Lin, Steven H; Gadgeel, Shirish M; Donington, Jessica; Feliciano, Josephine; Stinchcombe, Thomas E; Werner-Wasik, Maria; Edelman, Martin J; Moghanaki, Drew",J Thorac Oncol,,144

On the one hand, worries about one's own health and the health of loved ones, in particular of the newborn child, can increase the risk of some mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety in the pregnant woman. On the other hand, as happened for the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, given the need for physical distancing, the maintenance of the social and family network, so important for new parents in the perinatal period, is lacking. In addition, health services are forced to reorganize their offerings to ensure maximum safety for their operators and patients.

Even that the exact solution of the model can be obtained in an exact parametric form, in order to perform the comparison with the epidemiological data a simple but highly accurate representation of the time evolution of the SIR compartments would be very useful. In the present paper we obtain a series representation of the solution of the SIR model by using the Laplace-Adomian Decomposition Method to solve the basic evolution equation of the model. The solutions are expressed in the form of infinite series. The series representations of the time evolution of the SIR compartments are compared with the exact numerical solutions of the model. We find that there is a good agreement between the Laplace-Adomian semianalytical solutions containing only three terms, and the numerical results.","Harko, Tiberiu; Mak, Man Kwong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07170v2.pdf,144
506154,Do SARS-CoV2 viral proteins have neuromodulatory properties?,2020,"The increasing interest in understanding anthropogenic impacts on the environment have led to a considerable number of studies focusing on sedimentary records for the last $\sim$ 100 - 200 years. Dating this period is often complicated by the poor resolution and large errors associated with radiocarbon (14C) ages, which is the most popular dating technique. To improve age-depth model resolution for the recent period, sediment dating with lead-210 ($^{210}$Pb) is widely used as it provides absolute and continuous dates for the last $\sim$ 100 - 150 years. The $^{210}$Pb dating method has traditionally relied on the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS, also known as Constant Flux - CF) model which uses the radioactive decay equation as an age-depth relationship resulting in a restrictive model to approximate dates. In this work, we compare the classical approach to $^{210}$Pb dating (CRS) and its Bayesian alternative (\textit{Plum}). To do so, we created simulated $^{210}$Pb profiles following three different sedimentation processes, complying with the assumptions imposed by the CRS model, and analysed them using both approaches. Results indicate that the CRS model does not capture the true values even with a high dating resolution for the sediment, nor improves does its accuracy improve as more information is available. On the other hand, the Bayesian alternative (\textit{Plum}) provides consistently more accurate results even with few samples, and its accuracy and precision constantly improves as more information is available.","Aquino-L'opez, Marco A; Sanderson, Nicole K.; Blaauw, Maarten; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana Carolina; Aquino-L'opez, J Andr'es Christen Marco A; Christen, J Andr'es",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06819v1.pdf,144

This outbreak threatens not only physical health but also has significant repercussions on mental health. In recent world history, major infectious outbreaks were associated with severe mental health sequelae, including suicide. In this study, we systematically review the literature on suicidal outcomes during major international respiratory outbreaks, including COVID-19. We reviewed descriptive and analytic articles addressing suicide during major international respiratory outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases and then utilized an independent method for study selection by a pair of reviewers. Two reviewers completed data abstraction and conducted a narrative summary of the findings. Our search generated 2,153 articles. Nine studies (three descriptive, five analytical, and one with mixed methodology) were eligible. The included studies were heterogeneous, divergent in methods, and with a low degree of evidence. Deducing an association between pandemics, suicide, and suicide-related outcomes remains thus poorly supported. Future research with better methodological characteristics, the use of longitudinal studies, and a focus on suicide as the primary outcome would allow for an in-depth understanding and formulation of the scope of this problem.","Kahil, Karine; Cheaito, Mohamad Ali; El Hayek, Rawad; Nofal, Marwa; El Halabi, Sarah; Kudva, Kundadak Ganesh; Pereira-Sanchez, Victor; El Hayek, Samer",Asian J Psychiatr,,144

The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of preadmission statin therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to investigate its potential association with acute distress respiratory syndrome (ARDS) at admission and in-hospital mortality. We retrospectively recruited 467 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the emergency department of 10 Italian hospitals. The study population was divided in 2 groups according to the ARDS diagnosis at admission and in-hospital mortality. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess the risk of ARDS at admission and death during hospitalization among patients with COVID-19. A competing risk analysis in patients taking or not statins before admission was also performed. ARDS at admission was reported in 122 cases (26.1%). There was no statistically significant difference for clinical characteristics between patients presenting with and without ARDS. One hundred seven patients (18.5%) died during the hospitalization; they showed increased age (69.6 ± 13.1 vs. 66.1 ± 14.9; P = 0.001), coronary artery disease (23.4% vs. 12.8%; P = 0.012), and chronic kidney disease (20.6% vs. 11.1%; P = 0.018) prevalence; moreover, they presented more frequently ARDS at admission (48.6% vs. 19.4%; P < 0.001). At multivariable regression model, statin therapy was not associated neither with ARDS at admission nor with in-hospital mortality.

Methods: Analysis of longitudinal data from the departments of Peru using official public information from the National Death Information System and the Ministry of Health of Peru. The analysis is performed between January 1, 2018 and June 23, 2020 (100 days of quarantine). The daily death rate per million inhabitants has been used. The days in which the departments were quarantined with a limit number of accumulated cases of COVID-19 were used to estimate the quarantine impact. Three limits were established for cases: less than 1, 10 and 100 cases. Result: In Peru, the daily death rate per million inhabitants decreased by -1.89 (95% CI: -2.70; -1.07) on quarantine days and without COVID-19 cases. When comparing this result with the total number of non-violent deaths, the excess deaths during the first 100 days of quarantine is 36,230. This estimate is 1.12 times the estimate with data from 2019 and 4.2 times the deaths officers by COVID-19. Conclusion: Quarantine reduced nonviolent deaths; however, they are overshadowed by the increase as a direct or indirect cause of the pandemic.

Disease severity is associated with a higher COVID‐19 antibody titer. We compared the COVID‐19 antibody titer response of patients with obesity versus patients without obesity. METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved data of individuals tested for COVID‐19 serology at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City between March 1st, 2020, and December 14th, 2021. The primary outcome was peak antibody titer, assessed as a binary variable (1:2880, which was the highest detected titer, versus lower than 1:2880). In patients with positive serology test, peak titer rates were compared between BMI groups (<18.5, 18.5‐25, 25‐30, 30‐40, ≥40 kg/m(2)). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to analyze the independent association between different BMI groups and peak titer. RESULTS: Overall, 39,342 individuals underwent serology testing and had BMI measurements. Positive serology test was present in 12,314 patients. Peak titer rates were associated with obesity (<18.5:34.5%, 18.5‐25:29.2%, 25‐30:37.7%; 30‐40:44.7%; ≥40:52.0%, p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, severe obesity had the highest adjusted odds ratio for peak titer (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 2.1–3.0). CONCLUSION: COVID‐19 neutralizing antibody titer is associated with obesity. This has implications on the understanding of the role of obesity in COVID‐19 severity.","Soffer, Shelly; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Zimlichman, Eyal; Efros, Orly; Levin, Matthew A; Freeman, Robert; Reich, David L; Klang, Eyal",Obesity (Silver Spring),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33945220/; https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23208,144

In this study, we investigated the roles of CXCR2 and CXCL1 in leukocyte recruitment to the CNS using a murine model of neuroinflammation. METHODS: Wild-type (WT), CXCL1(−/−), and CXCR2(−/−) mice each received an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Esterase staining and intravital microscopy were performed to examine neutrophil recruitment to the brain. To assess endothelial activation in these mice, the expression of adhesion molecules was measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting. To identify the cellular source of functional CXCR2, chimeric mice were generated by transferring bone marrow cells between the WT and CXCR2(−/−) mice. RESULTS: Expression levels of the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 were significantly increased in the brain following the i.c.v. injection of LPS. CXCR2 or CXCL1 deficiency blocked neutrophil infiltration and leukocyte recruitment in the cerebral microvessels. In the CXCR2(−/−) and CXCL1(−/−) mice, the cerebral endothelial expression of adhesion molecules such as P-selectin and VCAM-1 was dramatically reduced. Furthermore, the bone marrow transfer experiments demonstrated that CXCR2 expression on CNS-residing cells is essential for cerebral endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment. Compared with microglia, cultured astrocytes secreted a much higher level of CXCL1 in vitro. Astrocyte culture conditioned medium significantly increased the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in cerebral endothelial cells in a CXCR2-dependent manner. Additionally, CXCR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cerebral endothelial cells but not in microglia or astrocytes was increased following tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation. The intravenous injection of the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 significantly inhibited endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment to cerebral microvessels. CONCLUSIONS: CXCL1 secreted by astrocytes and endothelial CXCR2 play essential roles in cerebral endothelial activation and subsequent leukocyte recruitment during neuroinflammation.","Wu, Fengjiao; Zhao, Yawei; Jiao, Tian; Shi, Dongyan; Zhu, Xingxing; Zhang, Mingshun; Shi, Meiqing; Zhou, Hong",J Neuroinflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25990934/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0316-6,144

This has contributed to novel approaches for therapeutic applications including vaccine development and gene therapy-based immunotherapy. Numerous studies in animal tumor models have demonstrated that self-replicating RNA viral vectors can generate antibody responses against infectious agents and tumor cells. Moreover, protection against challenges with pathogenic Ebola virus was obtained in primates immunized with alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Similarly, vaccinated animals have been demonstrated to withstand challenges with lethal doses of tumor cells. Furthermore, clinical trials have been conducted for several indications with self-amplifying RNA viruses.

Nonetheless, exact association and contribution of particular cytokines towards COVID-19 pathology remains poorly understood. This study performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to establish association between induced cytokines and COVID-19 disease severity to help in prognosis and clinical management. Methods: Scientific literature was searched to identify 18 clinical studies. Standardized mean difference (SMD) for cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF- and IFN-{gamma} between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patient groups were summarized using random effects model. A classifier was built using logistic regression model with cytokines having significant SMD as covariates. Results: Out of the 6 cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10 showed statistically significant SMD across the studies synthesized. Classifier with mean values of both IL-6 and IL-10 as covariates performed well with accuracy of ~ 92% that was significantly higher than accuracy reported in literature with IL-6 and IL-10 as individual covariates. Conclusions: Simple panel proposed by us with only two cytokine markers can be used as predictors for fast diagnosis of patients with higher risk of COVID-19 disease deterioration and thus can be managed well for a favourable prognosis.","Dhar, S.

We undertook recombination analyses of 158,118 public seasonal hCoV, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV genome sequences using the RDP4 software. We found moderate evidence for 8 SARS-CoV-2 recombination events, two of which involved the spike gene, and low evidence for one SARS-CoV-1 recombination event. Within MERS-CoV, 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 datasets, we noted 7, 1, 9, 14, and 1 high-confidence recombination events, respectively. There was propensity for recombination breakpoints in the non-ORF1 region of the genome containing structural genes, and recombination severely skewed the temporal structure of these data, especially for NL63 and OC43. Bayesian time-scaled analyses on recombinant-free data indicated the sampled diversity of seasonal CoVs emerged in the last 70 years, with 229E displaying continuous lineage replacements. These findings emphasize the importance of genomic based surveillance to detect recombination in SARS-CoV-2, particularly if recombination may lead to immune evasion.","Pollett, Simon; Conte, Matthew A.; Sanborn, Mark; Jarman, Richard G.; Lidl, Grace M.; Modjarrad, Kayvon; Maljkovic Berry, Irina",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96626-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34462471/,144

We have recently shown that PCV2 induces nuclear factor kappa B activation and its activation is required for active replication, but the other cellular factors involved in PCV2 replication are not well defined. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) which served as an important component of cellular signal transduction pathways has been shown to regulate many viral infections. In this report, we show that PCV2 activates ERK1/2 in PCV2-infected PK15 cells dependent on viral replication. The PCV2-induced ERK1/2 leads to phosphorylation of the ternary complex factor Elk-1, which kinetically paralleled ERK1/2 activation. Inhibition of ERK activation with U0126, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, significantly reduced viral progeny release. Investigations into the mechanism of ERK1/2 regulation revealed that inhibition of ERK activation leads to decreased viral transcription and lower virus protein expression. These data indicate that the ERK signaling pathway is involved in PCV2 infection and beneficial to PCV2 replication in the cultured cells.","Wei, Li; Liu, Jue",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.01.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19215954/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209000348; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682209000348,144

DNA vaccines represent an important alternative since they induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models and in human trials. We tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DNA-based vaccine regimens expressing different prefusion-stabilized Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens upon intramuscular injection followed by electroporation in rhesus macaques. Different Spike DNA vaccine regimens induced antibodies that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and elicited robust T cell responses. The antibodies recognized and potently neutralized a panel of different Spike variants including Alpha, Delta, Epsilon, Eta and A.23.1, but to a lesser extent Beta and Gamma. The DNA-only vaccine regimens were compared to a regimen that included co-immunization of Spike DNA and protein in the same anatomical site, the latter of which showed significant higher antibody responses. All vaccine regimens led to control of SARS-CoV-2 intranasal/intratracheal challenge and absence of virus dissemination to the lower respiratory tract. Vaccine-induced binding and neutralizing antibody titers and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis inversely correlated with transient virus levels in the nasal mucosa. Importantly, the Spike DNA+Protein co-immunization regimen induced the highest binding and neutralizing antibodies and showed the strongest control against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques.","Rosati, Margherita; Agarwal, Mahesh; Hu, Xintao; Devasundaram, Santhi; Stellas, Dimitris; Chowdhury, Bhabadeb; Bear, Jenifer; Burns, Robert; Donohue, Duncan; Pessaint, Laurent; Andersen, Hanne; Lewis, Mark G.; Terpos, Evangelos; Dimopoulos, Meletios Athanasios; Wlodawer, Alexander; Mullins, James I.; Venzon, David J.; Pavlakis, George N.; Felber, Barbara K.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34551020/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009701,144

Methods: A comprehensive sample of very old (≥75 years) people insured at a large Northeastern statutory insurer was followed over 6 years (2012–2017). We assessed dental services costs for: (1) examination, assessments and advice, (2) operative, (3) surgical, (4) prosthetic, (5) periodontal, (6) preventive and (7) outreach services. Association of utilization with: (1) sex, (2) age, (3) region, (4) social hardship status, (5) International Disease Classification (ICD-10) diagnoses and (6) Diagnoses Related Groups (DRGs) was explored. Results: 404,610 individuals with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age 81.9 (5.4 years) were followed, 173,733 did not survive follow-up. Total mean costs were 129.61 (310.97) euro per capita; the highest costs were for prosthetic (54.40, SD 242.89 euro) and operative services (28.40, SD 68.38 euro), examination/advice (21.15, SD 28.77 euro), prevention (13.31, SD 49.79 euro), surgery (5.91, SD 23.91 euro), outreach (4.81, SD 28.56 euro) and periodontal services (1.64, SD 7.39 euro). The introduction of new fee items for outreach and preventive services between 2012 and 2017 was reflected in costs. Total costs decreased with increasing age, and this was also found for all service blocks except outreach and preventive services. Costs were higher in those with social hardship status, and in Berlin than Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Certain general health conditions were associated with increased or decreased costs. Conclusions: Costs were associated with sex, social hardship status, place of living and general health conditions. Clinical significance: Dental services costs for the elderly in Germany are unequally distributed and, up to a certain age or health status, generated by invasive interventions mainly. Policy makers should incentivize preventive services earlier on and aim to distribute expenses more equally.","Krasowski, Aleksander; Krois, Joachim; Paris, Sebastian; Kuhlmey, Adelheid; Meyer-Lueckel, Hendrik; Schwendicke, Falk",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205730/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126669,144

Responding to the pandemic, Sweden has taken a different approach aiming to mitigate, not suppress, community transmission, by using physical distancing without lockdowns. Here we contrast the consequences of different responses to COVID-19 within Sweden, the resulting demand for care, intensive care, the death tolls and the associated direct healthcare related costs. METHODS: We used an age-stratified health-care demand extended SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) compartmental model for all municipalities in Sweden, and a radiation model for describing inter-municipality mobility. The model was calibrated against data from municipalities in the Stockholm healthcare region. RESULTS: Our scenario with moderate to strong physical distancing describes well the observed health demand and deaths in Sweden up to the end of May 2020. In this scenario, the intensive care unit (ICU) demand reaches the pre-pandemic maximum capacity just above 500 beds. In the counterfactual scenario, the ICU demand is estimated to reach ∼20 times higher than the pre-pandemic ICU capacity. The different scenarios show quite different death tolls up to 1 September, ranging from 5000 to 41 000, excluding deaths potentially caused by ICU shortage. Additionally, our statistical analysis of all causes excess mortality indicates that the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 could be increased by 40% (95% confidence interval: 0.24, 0.57). CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlight the impact of different combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions, especially moderate physical distancing in combination with more effective isolation of infectious individuals, on reducing deaths, health demands and lowering healthcare costs. In less effective mitigation scenarios, the demand on ICU beds would rapidly exceed capacity, showing the tight interconnection between the healthcare demand and physical distancing in the society. These findings have relevance for Swedish policy and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and illustrate the importance of maintaining the level of physical distancing for a longer period beyond the study period to suppress or mitigate the impacts from the pandemic.","Sjödin, Henrik; Johansson, Anders F; Brännström, Åke; Farooq, Zia; Kriit, Hedi Katre; Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Åström, Christofer; Thunberg, Johan; Söderquist, Mårten; Rocklöv, Joacim",Int J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32954400/,144

While live poultry marketing is widespread throughout the country and known to influence AI dissemination and persistence, trading patterns have not been described. The aim of this study is to assess poultry trading practices and features of the poultry trading networks which could promote AI spread, and their potential implications for disease control and surveillance. Data on poultry trading practices was collected from 849 poultry traders during a cross-sectional survey in 138 live bird markets (LBMs) across 17 different districts of Bangladesh. The quantity and origins of traded poultry were assessed for each poultry type in surveyed LBMs. The network of contacts between farms and LBMs resulting from commercial movements of live poultry was constructed to assess its connectivity and to identify the key premises influencing it. RESULTS: Poultry trading practices varied according to the size of the LBMs and to the type of poultry traded. Industrial broiler chickens, the most commonly traded poultry, were generally sold in LBMs close to their production areas, whereas ducks and backyard chickens were moved over longer distances, and their transport involved several intermediates. The poultry trading network composed of 445 nodes (73.2% were LBMs) was highly connected and disassortative. However, the removal of only 5.6% of the nodes (25 LBMs with the highest betweenness scores), reduced the network’s connectedness, and the maximum size of output and input domains by more than 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Poultry types need to be discriminated in order to understand the way in which poultry trading networks are shaped, and the level of risk of disease spread that these networks may promote. Knowledge of the network structure could be used to target control and surveillance interventions to a small number of LBMs. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s12917-018-1331-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","Moyen, N.; Ahmed, G.; Gupta, S.; Tenzin, T.; Khan, R.; Khan, T.; Debnath, N.; Yamage, M.; Pfeiffer, D.U.; Fournie, G.",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29329534/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1331-5,144

An anticipated correlate of such countermeasures is the level of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which engages with host ACE2 receptor for entry. Using an infectious molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing eGFP as a marker of infection, we replaced the glycoprotein gene (G) with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and developed a high-throughput imaging-based neutralization assay at biosafety level 2. We also developed a focus-reduction neutralization test with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 at biosafety level 3. Comparing the neutralizing activities of various antibodies and ACE2-Fc soluble decoy protein in both assays revealed a high degree of concordance. These assays will help define correlates of protection for antibody-based countermeasures and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

This study examine changes in loneliness in the general adult population when the corona-related social distancing protocols were largely discontinued (T2) following a period of strict protocols (T1), predictors and correlates of these changes, and the associations between loneliness and depression and anxiety symptoms. DESIGN: In an online survey, 10,061 responded at T1. At T2, these respondents were asked to complete the survey again, and 4936 (49.1%) of them responded. RESULTS: Loneliness decreased from T1 to T2, but only to a minor extent. Using a multilevel approach, younger age was found to be related to more reduction of loneliness from T1 to T2. Higher health anxiety was found to predict less reduction of loneliness across time. Reduction of maladaptive coping strategies and negative metacognitive beliefs from T1 to T2 were both associated with reduction in loneliness. In turn, reductions in loneliness were associated with reductions of depression and anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that health anxiety, maladaptive coping strategies and negative meta-beliefs are potential targets of intervention to alleviate loneliness.

Now it has covered more than 150 countries worldwide. It is referred to as COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the respiratory systems of humans that can lead up to serious illness or even death in the presence of different comorbidities. However, most COVID-19 infected people show mild to moderate symptoms, and no medication is suggested. Still, drugs of other diseases have been used to treat COVID-19. Nevertheless, the absence of vaccines and proper drugs against the COVID-19 virus has increased the mortality rate. Albeit sex is a risk factor for COVID-19, none of the studies considered this risk factor for identifying biomarkers from the RNASeq count dataset. Men are more likely to undertake severe symptoms with different comorbidities and show greater mortality compared with women. From this standpoint, we aim to identify shared gene signatures between males and females from the human COVID-19 RNAseq count dataset of peripheral blood cells using a robust voom approach. We identified 1341 overlapping DEGs between male and female datasets. The gene ontology (GO) annotation and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs are involved in various BP categories such as nucleosome assembly, DNA conformation change, DNA packaging, and different KEGG pathways such as cell cycle, ECM-receptor interaction, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, etc. Ten hub-proteins (UBC, KIAA0101, APP, CDK1, SUMO2, SP1, FN1, CDK2, E2F1, and TP53) were unveiled using PPI network analysis. The top three miRNAs (mir-17–5p, mir-20a-5p, mir-93–5p) and TFs (PPARG, E2F1 and KLF5) were uncovered. In conclusion, the top ten significant drugs (roscovitine, curcumin, simvastatin, fulvestrant, troglitazone, alvocidib, L-alanine, tamoxifen, serine, and doxorubicin) were retrieved using drug repurposing analysis of overlapping DEGs, which might be therapeutic agents of COVID-19.","Shahjaman, Md; Rezanur Rahman, Md; Rabiul Auwul, Md",Inform Med Unlocked,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914821001854; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2021.100702; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821001854?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34423108/,144
600368,Evidence supporting the use of peptides and peptidomimetics as potential SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) therapeutics,2020-07-16,"In November 2007, China implemented its Emergency Response Law to ensure national unified leadership and collaboration when responding to emergencies. In recent years, China’s main focuses for enhancing disaster management have included emergency preparation, emergency management, and legal system mechanisms. However, its well-designed management system faced a great challenge during the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. By examining the literature on the development of disaster management, we realized that enhancing self-organization in communities can effectively resolve problems caused by collective actions and strengthen resilience to disasters. In the decade since the Wenchuan earthquake, the literature has focused more on empowering communities during disaster management in China. However, literature on the compatibility of social resilience and the government-dominant model in China is still scant. This study investigates China’s current disaster management system design; specifically, it identifies ways and methods for counteracting any conflicts between disaster management under social synergies and China’s emergency management system. It further explores what factors facilitate the balance between social synergies and the emergency management system if the two concepts were fused together. Using case studies, in-depth interviews, and a focus group in the field of public administration, this study collected qualitative data to understand the changes in China’s disaster management system since the Wenchuan earthquake as well as provide recommendations for future reform.","Wang, Chun-yuan; Guo, Jinyun; Kuo, Ming-feng",Saf Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288261/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S092575352030059X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104662; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092575352030059X,144

Five young adult and two adult cheetahs presented with lethargy, anorexia, watery diarrhea and regurgitation over an 11-day period. Fecal samples were submitted for electron microscopy and culture. Electron microscopy results revealed particles morphologically consistent with an astrovirus, and no other viral pathogens or significant bacterial pathogens were identified. The astrovirus was confirmed and sequenced using consensus astroviral PCR, resulting in a 367 base pair partial RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) product and a 628 base pair partial capsid product. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed on both the RdRp and the capsid protein segments. All animals were monitored and treated with bismuth subsalicylate tablets (524 mg PO BID for 5 days), and recovered without additional intervention. This is the first report we are aware of documenting an astrovirus outbreak in cheetah.","Atkins, Adrienne; Wellehan, James F.X.; Childress, April L.; Archer, Linda L.; Fraser, William A.; Citino, Scott B.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19171442/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.10.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113508004896; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113508004896,144
600639,IDENTIFICATION OF RESPIRATORY VIRUSES IN ADULTS: NASOPHARYNGEAL VS OROPHARYNGEAL SAMPLING,2009-10-31,"BACKGROUND: Multimodal analgesia is the leading principle for managing postoperative pain. Recent guidelines recommend combinations of paracetamol and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for most surgeries. Glucocorticoids have been used for decades due to their potent anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Subsequently, glucocorticoids may improve postoperative analgesia. We will perform a systematic review to assess benefits and harms of adding glucocorticoids to paracetamol and NSAIDs. We expect to uncover pros and cons of the addition of glucocorticoid to the basic standard regimen of paracetamol and NSAIDs for postoperative analgesia. METHOD: This protocol for a systematic review was written according to the The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. We will search for trials in the following electronic databases: Medline, CENTRAL, CDSR and Embase. Two authors will independently screen trials for inclusion using Covidence, extract data and assess risk of bias using Cochrane's ROB 2 tool. We will analyse data using Review Manager and Trial Sequential Analysis. Meta-analysis will be performed according to the Cochrane guidelines and results will be validated according to the eight-step procedure suggested by Jakobsen et al We will present our primary findings in a 'summary of findings' table. We will evaluate the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. DISCUSSION: This review will aim to explore the combination of glucocorticoids together with paracetamol and NSAIDs for postoperative pain. We will attempt to provide reliable evidence regarding the role of glucocorticoids as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen in combination with paracetamol and NSAID.","Ritsmer Stormholt, Emma; Steiness, Joakim; Bauer Derby, Cecilie; Esta Larsen, Mia; Maagaard, Mathias; Mathiesen, Ole",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138463/; https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13943,144
600665,Co-Infections with Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses,2012-06-29,"INTRODUCTION: The head-to-toe approach to teaching the physical examination (PE) focuses on technique and performing a comprehensive PE whereas core + clusters and hypothesis-driven PE (HDPE) approaches integrate clinical reasoning into performing a focused PE. These approaches can be implemented in a developmental sequence. We report the implementation and evaluation of an HDPE educational session. METHODS: We designed a 3-hour HDPE session as part of a transition to clerkship program. For each of five clinical vignettes, rising third-year students worked in pairs and then in small groups to generate a differential diagnosis and determine relevant PE maneuvers. Students next performed these maneuvers on peers with facilitator observation and feedback. Students completed postsession surveys on their retrospective pre- and postsession knowledge and confidence, as well as their satisfaction with the session. We completed quantitative and qualitative analyses on survey data. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-two students participated, and 140 (73%) completed the survey. Students were significantly more likely to report feeling confident generating a differential diagnosis and using it to select PE maneuvers for common complaints postsession. Over 80% of respondents felt the session improved critical thinking about patient presentations and would help them in clerkships. DISCUSSION: Our session increased student confidence in the progression to performing an HDPE just prior to the start of clerkships. The session is feasible and straightforward to implement. It requires a large number of faculty to facilitate, but the breadth of cases used allows inclusion of faculty from all fields.","Kelly, Julia; Oza, Sandra K.; Feinn, Richard; Cassese, Todd",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274298/; https://doi.org/10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11043,144
601020,Prevalence and Molecular Characterization of Human Bocavirus Detected in Croatian Children with Respiratory Infection,2021-08-31,"Background: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are particularly vulnerable to nosocomial outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with high rates of transmission and mortality. Timely epidemiological surveillance is essential to detect and respond to outbreaks, but testing resources are highly limited in the current pandemic context. Methods: We used an individual-based transmission model to simulate COVID-19 spread along inter-individual contact networks in the LTCF setting. A range of surveillance strategies were evaluated for their ability to detect simulated outbreaks, assuming limited availability of standard RT-PCR tests. Various epidemiological scenarios were considered, including COVID-19 importation from patient transfers or staff members infected in the community. Findings: We estimated a median delay of 7 (95% uncertainty interval: 2-15) days from importation of an asymptomatic COVID-19-infected patient to first presentation of COVID-19 symptoms among any patients or staff, at which point an additional 7 (0-25) individuals were infected but did not (yet) show symptoms. Across a range of scenarios, the reference surveillance strategy (testing individuals with COVID-like symptoms with signs of severity) took a median 11-21 days to detect an outbreak. Group testing (pooling specimens from multiple individuals for a single RT-PCR test) patients and staff with any COVID-like symptoms was both the most timely and efficient strategy, detecting outbreaks up to twice as quickly as the reference, and more quickly than other considered strategies while using fewer tests. Maximizing use of available tests via testing cascades was more effective than group testing only when substantial testing resources were available (on the order of 1 test/20 beds/day). Including not merely those with symptoms but also newly admitted patients in group tests and testing cascades reduced delays in outbreak detection for LTCFs actively admitting patients potentially already infected with COVID-19. Interpretation: Improving COVID-19 surveillance can alert healthcare institutions to emerging outbreaks before they escalate, informing a need for urgent public health intervention in settings with ongoing nosocomial transmission.","Smith, David RM; Duval, Audrey; Pouwels, Koen B; Guillemot, Didier; Fernandes, Jerome; Huynh, Bich-Tram; Temime, Laura; Opatowski, Lulla",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071639v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071639,144

Among these, SARS-CoV-2 continues to ravage the world today and has lead to millions of deaths and incalculable economic damage. Till now, there is no clinically proven antiviral drug available for SARS-CoV-2. However, the bioactive molecules of natural origin, especially medicinal plants, have been proven to be potential resources in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, acting at different stages of the viral life cycle and targeting different viral or host proteins, such as PL(pro), 3CL(pro), RdRp, helicase, spike, ACE2, and TMPRSS2. They provide a viable strategy to develop therapeutic agents. This review presents fundamental biological information on SARS-CoV-2, including the viral biological characteristics and invasion mechanisms. It also summarizes the reported natural bioactive molecules with anti-coronavirus properties, arranged by their different targets in the life cycle of viral infection of human cells, and discusses the prospects of these bioactive molecules for the treatment of COVID-19.","Chen, Wei; Wang, Zhihao; Wang, Yawen; Li, Yiping",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.702472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483904/,144

In this study, we demonstrate the value of the Google Trends (GT) interface to characterize and monitor in real-time the response in public interest toward various elective orthopedic procedures. Methods Search volume databases were generated from January 2015 to May 2020 for keywords related to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, elbow arthroplasty, hip arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty, and rotator cuff repair. To measure the immediate effects on public interest, the percent change was calculated from the AAOS, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) defined a 30-day pre-recommendations period to a 30-day post-recommendations period. To measure long-term effects, mean search volumes from January 1, 2015, to February 29, 2020, were compared to mean search volumes from March 1, 2020, to May 21, 2020. Results In the 30-day period following statements by the AAOS and CMS, interest in all search terms except “partial knee arthroplasty” decreased as follows: “ACL reconstruction” (-32.7%); “ACL repair” (-22.6%); “anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction” (-39.8%); “elbow arthroplasty” (-17.2%); “elbow joint replacement” (-15.1%); “total elbow arthroplasty” (-40.0%); “hip arthroplasty” (-23.0%); “hip replacement” (-41.2%); “total hip arthroplasty” (-23.0%); “knee arthroplasty” (-43.0%); “total knee arthroplasty” (-33.3%); “rotator cuff repair” (-34.2%); “rotator cuff surgery” (-50.6%); “shoulder arthroplasty” (-26.7%). Discussion GT data have previously demonstrated utility in characterizing and anticipating shifts in real-world healthcare utilization, making it an invaluable tool for physicians to anticipate and address the emerging needs of our patient population. Our study further illustrates the value of GT in localizing rapidly recovering interest in several of the most common elective orthopedic surgeries, enabling surgeons with up-to-date actionable data to guide the management of practices and healthcare facilities as the US slowly emerges from precautions endorsed during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tijerina, Jonathan D; Cohen, Samuel A; Parham, Matthew J; Debbaut, Christopher; Cohen, Landon; Stevanovic, Milan; Lefebvre, Rachel",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.12123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33489537/,144
602518,Is the kidney a target of SARS-CoV-2?,2020-06-01,"Viruses can be transmitted from animals to humans (and vice versa) and across animal species. As such, host-virus interactions and transmission have attracted considerable attention. Non-human primates (NHPs), our closest evolutionary relatives, are susceptible to human viruses and certain pathogens are known to circulate between humans and NHPs. Here, we generated global statistics on virus infections in NHPs (VI-NHPs) based on a literature search and public data mining. In total, 140 NHP species from 12 families are reported to be infected by 186 DNA and RNA virus species, 68.8% of which are also found in humans, indicating high potential for crossing species boundaries. The top 10 NHP species with high centrality in the NHP-virus network include two great apes (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus) and eight Old World monkeys (Macaca mulatta, M. fascicularis, M. leonina, Papio cynocephalus, Cercopithecus ascanius, C. erythrotis, Chlorocebus aethiops, and Allochrocebus lhoesti). Given the wide distribution of Old World monkeys and their frequent contact with humans, there is a high risk of virus circulation between humans and such species. Thus, we suggest recurring epidemiological surveillance of NHPs, specifically Old World monkeys that are in frequent contact with humans, and other effective measures to prevent potential circulation and transmission of viruses. Avoidance of false positives and sampling bias should also be a focus in future work.","Liu, Zhi-Jin; Qian, Xue-Kun; Hong, Min-Heng; Zhang, Jia-Li; Li, Da-Yong; Wang, Tian-Han; Yang, Zuo-Min; Zhang, Li-Ye; Wang, Zi-Ming; Nie, Hua-Jian; Fan, Ke-Yue; Zhang, Xiong-Fei; Chen, Meng-Meng; Sha, Wei-Lai; Roos, Christian; Li, Ming",Zool Res,https://doi.org/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2021.080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34410047/,144

Most affluent countries have seen substantial increases in the incidence and costs of non-communicable diseases. The interest in social models for health has led to the growth in use of social prescribing and psychological therapies. At the same time, there has been growth in application of a variety of nature-based and mind–body interventions (NBIs and MBIs) aimed at improving health and longevity. We assess four NBI/MBI programmes (woodland therapy, therapeutic horticulture, ecotherapy/green care, and tai chi) on life satisfaction/happiness and costs of use of public services. These interventions produce rises in life satisfaction/happiness of 1.00 pts to 7.29 (n = 644; p < 0.001) (for courses or participation >50 h). These increases are greater than many positive life events (e.g., marriage or a new child); few countries or cities see +1 pt increases over a decade. The net present economic benefits per person from reduced public service use are £830–£31,520 (after 1 year) and £6450–£11,980 (after 10 years).

Methods Secondary attack rates (SARs) for schools and day-care centres were calculated using data from state-wide mandatory notification of SARS-CoV-2 index cases in educational institutions and additional information on routine contact tracing and PCR-testing. Findings From August to December 2020, every sixth of overall 784 independent index cases caused a transmission in educational institutions (risk 0.17, 95% CI 0.14-0.19). In a subgroup, monitoring of 14,594 institutional high-risk contacts (89% PCR-tested) of 441 index cases revealed 196 secondary cases (SAR 1.34%, 1.16-1.54). Transmission was more likely from teachers than from students/children (incidence risk ratio [IRR] 3.17, 1.79-5.59), and from index cases in day-care centres (IRR 3.23, 1.76-5.91) than from those in secondary schools. In 748 index cases, teachers caused four times more secondary cases than children (1.08 vs. 0.25 secondary cases per index, IRR 4.39, 2.67-7.21). This difference was mainly due to common transmission from teacher index cases to teacher contacts (mean secondary cases 0.56 teacher to teacher vs. 0.04 child to teacher, IRR 13.3, 6.6-26.7). Interpretation In educational institutions, the risk of contacts to a confirmed COVID-19 case for infection is one percent, but varies depending on type of institution and index case. Hygiene measures targeting the day-care setting and teacher-to-teacher transmission are priorities in reducing the burden of infection and may promote on-site education during the pandemic.","Schoeps, A.; Hoffmann, D.; Tamm, C.; Vollmer, B.; Haag, S.; Kaffenberger, T.; Ferguson-Beiser, K.; Kohlhase-Griebel, B.; Basenach, S.; Missal, A.; Hoefling, K.; Michels, H.; Schall, A.; Kappes, H.; Vogt, M.; Jahn, K.; Baernighausen, T.; Zanger, P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250670v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.04.21250670,144

Improving Our Confidence in a Model‐Based Approach to Dose Selection,2020-05-09,"From the severe porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) epidemics that struck in 2013 in the United States of America and other countries of North and South America, two types of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) were isolated, namely the InDel and the non‐InDel strains. They are differentiated by insertions/deletions in the S1 nucleotide sequence of the S gene, and differences in virulence were observed from the clinical cases. In 2014, a PED outbreak occurred in a pig farm in France, from which an InDel strain was isolated. This study aimed at comparing, under experimental conditions, the pathogenicity and the direct and indirect transmissions between a non‐InDel strain isolated from a PED‐affected piglet in 2014 in the USA and the French InDel strain. All infected pigs showed clinical signs with the non‐InDel strain although only the inoculated and direct contact pigs showed clinical signs in the InDel strain group. Although viral RNA was detected in air samples with both strains, the indirect contact pigs remained free from infection with the InDel strain in contrast to the non‐InDel group in which airborne transmission occurred in the indirect contact pigs. All infected pigs shed virus in faeces regardless of PEDV strain with 9 of 30 pigs showing intermittent faecal shedding. The transmission rate by direct contact was found to be 2.17‐fold higher than the non‐InDel strain compared with the InDel. In conclusion, the InDel strain was less pathogenic than the non‐InDel strain in our experimental conditions. The transmission route differed between the two strains. Direct contact was the main transmission route for the InDel strain, although the non‐InDel strain was transmitted through direct contact and indirectly through the air.","Gallien, Sarah; Andraud, Mathieu; Moro, Angélique; Lediguerher, Gérald; Morin, Nadège; Gauger, Phillip C.; Bigault, Lionel; Paboeuf, Frédéric; Berri, Mustapha; Rose, Nicolas; Grasland, Béatrice",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.12945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29968338/,144

608247,Estimating and forecasting the burden and spread of SARS-CoV2 first wave in Colombia.,2021-01-15,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the effectiveness of a cultural competence and humility intervention for third-year medical students by assessing changes in clinical evaluation assessments in patient encounters. METHODS: This study examines the effect of a 1-h educational intervention on cultural competence and cultural humility for third-year medical students. Clinical assessments during observed patient encounters are compared in the clerkship before and after the intervention. The intervention adapts a previously studied cultural competence didactic and emphasizes cultural humility practices. Change in scores from the intervention cohort (clinical year 2019–2020) is compared to a pre-intervention cohort (2018–2019). RESULTS: Students who completed the intervention demonstrate greater clinical competency in “relating to patients in a respectful, caring, empathetic manner” as assessed by supervising physicians compared with pre-intervention cohort students (2.7% difference in earning top two scores in subsequent clerkship, P value 0.05, Cramer’s V 0.04). Greater clinical competencies were also found in the intervention students compared with pre-intervention students in the domains “demonstrates accountability, contribution and commitment to patient care” and “develops insightful, focused, pertinent questions based on clinical scenarios” (3.8% difference in earning top two scores in subsequent clerkship, P value 0.01 and 5.1% difference, P-value 0.003 with Cramer’s V of 0.05 and 0.06, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Educational interventions to improve cultural competence and cultural humility are important during clinical years to shape future physicians. Our study suggests that brief interventions may improve medical students’ clinical competencies. A future study with a more robust intervention is expected to yield more substantial results.","Khoury, Nayla M.; Suser, Joanna L.; Germain, Lauren J.; Myers, Kathryn; Brown, Amy E.

608326,Adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19,2021-01-12,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created fear in people around the world. This has led to the widespread use of various herbal remedies in its prevention and treatment regardless of the paucity of scientific evidence about their safety and efficacy. This study assessed the fear of COVID-19 and the influence of media on the use of herbal medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19 in Uganda. METHODS: In the first 2 weeks of July 2021, a descriptive online cross-sectional study was carried out anonymously in the general population in Uganda. A validated questionnaire was used to collect data on herbal medicine use and the influence of media. Fear of COVID-19 was rated using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). RESULTS: We recruited 488 participants, 273 (55.9%) were female, with a median age of 25 (range: 18–73) years. Sixty-seven (57.8%) participants had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The mean FCV-19S score was 21.7 SD 5.9 with 53.3% reporting high levels of COVID-19 fear. About 57.4% of participants reported using herbal remedies either to prevent or treat COVID-19-like symptoms. Media was the main source of information, with more than 80% of the participants reporting seeing or accessing information about herbal medication use. Women (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.74, 95% CI: 1.2–2.5, p=0.003) and people with a previously confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (aOR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.35–7.14, p=0.008) had a statistically significantly higher FCV-19S score. Being unemployed (aOR: 1.0, 95% CI: 1.1–2.3, p=0.008) and a female (aOR: 1.0, 95% CI: 1.1–2.3, p=0.012) were statistically significantly associated with herbal medicine use. Participants who used herbal remedies had a higher median FCV-19S score compared to non-users (23 versus 21, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of herbal medicines to treat or prevent COVID-19 is a widespread practice among the general population in Uganda amidst the high levels of fear of COVID-19.","Musoke, Phillip; Nantaayi, Brandy; Kato Ndawula, Rodney; Wannyana, Babrah; Ssewante, Nelson; Wekha, Godfrey; Olum, Ronald; Nakyagaba, Lourita; Rhoda Nassozi, Dianah; Nabukeera, Germinah; Marvin Kanyike, Andrew; Ojilong, Daniel; Madut Akech, Gabriel; Kajjimu, Jonathan; Kiwumulo, Joshua; Agira, Drake; Okot, Jerom; Bongomin, Felix",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s332325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584474/,144

It has affected nearly all aspects of life. Education has been particularly hit, and a lot of effort has been put to implement more and more virtual platforms through online classes, meetings and conferences. Medical education has also been affected, especially because of the need for hands-on education, specifically in the clinical setting of the last 2 years. This had a huge psychological impact on the medical students currently enrolled in medical schools around the globe. In this descriptive study, we sent all medical students at the American University of Beirut Faculty of Medicine (AUBFM) an online anonymous survey by email. The survey started with general questions (age, gender and medical school year), followed by 3 sections that contain questions pertaining to the attitudes of medical students towards clinical rotations and online classes. Data was then analyzed using SPSSv24 and was then reported as percentages. Students were almost equally divided among the medical school classes (Med 1, 2, 3, and 4). The majority of clinical students (Med 3 and Med 4) reported that they feel nervous during their rotations in the hospital. Moreover, they reported that they have increased their use of disinfectants and personal protective equipment since the emergence of the pandemic. Moreover, the majority of medical students reported that they feel more stressed after shifting to online classes. Medical students also reported that they would be willing to go back to on-campus classes. This study aimed at describing the response of medical students at AUBFM to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of stress. Limited data exists in the literature concerning the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students in the middle East. Medical students reported that they feel more stressed and nervous during their clinical rotations and after the shift to online education, affecting their academic and social life.

Infections during lymphopenia after allogeneic HSCT are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Typical infectious agents are Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella‐zoster virus and fungi. The study aim was to evaluate whether measurement of the responses of antigen‐specific T‐cells, recognizing infectious pathogens would correlate to protective functions in the stem cell recipient post‐transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty‐one grafts were analysed by flow cytometry and cells were stimulated in vitro with relevant infectious antigens, followed by evaluation of T‐cell proliferation and cytokine production. Results were compared to the recipients’ clinical records 1‐year post‐transplantation. RESULTS: We show that an extensive repertoire of transferred antigen‐specific T‐cells from allogeneic donor grafts against infectious agents, involved in post‐transplant infections, are linked to an absence of infectious complications for the recipient up‐to 1‐year post‐transplant. The protective effect was associated with antigen‐specific T‐cell proliferation and IL‐1β secretion. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that assaying T‐cell function before HSCT could determine individual risks for infectious complications and thus aid in clinical decision‐making regarding prophylactic and pre‐emptive anti‐infective therapy.","Nilsson, J.; Granrot, I.; Mattsson, J.; Omazic, B.; Uhlin, M.; Thunberg, S.",Vox Sang,https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.12521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28466551/,144

The purpose of our study was to objectively assess smell impairment in COVID‐19 patients and to correlate olfactory function with viral recovery. METHODS: Between 15 and 30 April 2020, hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection underwent an objective assessment of olfactory function with the Smell Identification subtest of the Sniffin’ Sticks Test (SI‐SST). Association between viral recovery and SI‐SST performance was evaluated. RESULTS: 51 patients were enrolled (49% males, mean age 66.2 ± 14.6 years). At the time of test administration, 45% were clinically recovered and 39% were virus‐free. Objective hyposmia/anosmia was found in 45% of the patients. Subjective olfactory disorders showed no association with the clinical or viral recovery status of the patients. On the contrary, none of the patients with anosmia and the 5% of hyposmic patients at test had viral recovery. The relative risk for hyposmic patients to be still positive at swab test was 10.323 (95% CI 1.483–71.869, p < .0001). Logistic regression analysis showed an independent and significant correlation between viral clearance and SI‐SST scores (OR = 2.242; 95% CI 1.322–3.802, p < .003). ROC curve analysis confirmed that a SI‐SST > 10.5 predicts viral clearance with 79% sensitivity and 87% specificity (AUC = 0.883). CONCLUSION: Hyposmia is part of COVID‐19 symptoms; however, only objectively assessed olfactory function is associated with viral recovery. SI‐SST is an easy and safe instrument, and further large multicentric studies should assess its value to predict infection and recovery.","Mazzoli, Marco; Molinari, Maria Angela; Tondelli, Manuela; Giovannini, Giada; Ricceri, Riccardo; Ciolli, Ludovico; Picchetto, Livio; Meletti, Stefano",Brain Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465295/; https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2006,144
616319,Human adenovirus replication and persistence in hypertrophic adenoids and palatine tonsils in children,2019-03-18,"OBJECTIVE: Age‐associated decreases in immune functions are precipitated by a variety of mechanisms and affect nearly every immune cell subset. In myeloid cells, aging reduces numbers of phagocytes and impairs their functional abilities, including antigen presentation, phagocytosis, and bacterial clearance. Recently, we described an aging effect on several functions in monocytes, including impaired mitochondrial function and reduced inflammatory cytokine gene expression during stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. We hypothesized that circulating factors altered by the aging process underly these changes. Growth differentiation factor‐15 (GDF‐15) is a distant member of the transforming growth factor‐β superfamily that has known anti‐inflammatory effects in macrophages and has been shown to be highly differentially expressed during aging. METHODS: We used biobanked plasma samples to assay circulating GDF‐15 levels in subjects from our previous studies and examined correlations between GDF‐15 and monocyte function. RESULTS: Monocyte interleukin‐6 production due to lipopolysaccharide stimulation was negatively correlated to plasma GDF‐15. Additionally, GDF‐15 was positively correlated to circulating CD16 + monocyte proportions and negatively correlated to monocyte mitochondrial respiratory capacity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GDF‐15 is a potential circulating factor affecting a variety of monocyte functions and promoting monocyte immunosenescence and thus may be an attractive candidate for therapeutic intervention to ameliorate this.","Pence, Brandt D.; Yarbro, Johnathan R.; Emmons, Russell S.",Aging Med (Milton),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33738380/; https://doi.org/10.1002/agm2.12128,144

METHODS: From 1 April 2020, patients with COVID-19-associated CSS, defined as rapid respiratory deterioration plus at least two out of three biomarkers with important elevations (C-reactive protein >100 mg/L; ferritin >900 µg/L; D-dimer >1500 µg/L), received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 5 consecutive days (250 mg on day 1 followed by 80 mg on days 2–5). If the respiratory condition had not improved sufficiently (in 43%), the interleukin-6 receptor blocker tocilizumab (8 mg/kg body weight, single infusion) was added on or after day 2. Control patients with COVID-19-associated CSS (same definition) were retrospectively sampled from the pool of patients (n=350) admitted between 7 March and 31 March, and matched one to one to treated patients on sex and age. The primary outcome was ≥2 stages of improvement on a 7-item WHO-endorsed scale for trials in patients with severe influenza pneumonia, or discharge from the hospital. Secondary outcomes were hospital mortality and mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: At baseline all patients with COVID-19 in the treatment group (n=86) and control group (n=86) had symptoms of CSS and faced acute respiratory failure. Treated patients had 79% higher likelihood on reaching the primary outcome (HR: 1.8; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.7) (7 days earlier), 65% less mortality (HR: 0.35; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.65) and 71% less invasive mechanical ventilation (HR: 0.29; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.65). Treatment effects remained constant in confounding and sensitivity analyses.

So far, it has caused ~ 4000 deaths in this country. We aimed to systematically characterize clinical features and determine risk factors of sudden death for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Deceased patients with COVID-19 in Tongji hospital from January 22 to March 23, 2020 were extracted. Patients who died within 24 hours after admission were identified as sudden deaths, and the others formed non-sudden deaths. The differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups were estimated. Risk factors associated with sudden deaths were explored by logistic regression. RESULTS: 281 deceased patients were enrolled in this study. Sudden death occurred in 28 (10.0%) patients, including 4 (14.3%) admitted to the intensive care unit. Fatigue was more common in sudden deaths (11, 47.8%) than in non-sudden deaths (40, 17.2%). Both the count and percentage of eosinophils were lower in sudden deaths than that in non-sudden deaths (P = 0.006 and P = 0.004). Compared with non-sudden deaths, sudden deaths had higher plasma levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. There were not significant differences in gender, age, chest CT image features and comorbidities observed.

Elevations in serum IL-6 concentrations in patients with severe COVID-19 have led to renewed interest in the cytokine as a therapeutic target. However, although the pro-inflammatory properties of IL-6 are widely known, the cytokine also has a series of important physiological and anti-inflammatory functions. An adequate understanding of the complex processes by which IL-6 signalling occurs is crucial for the correct interpretation of IL-6 concentrations in the blood or lung, the use of IL-6 as a critical care biomarker, or the design of effective anti-IL-6 strategies. Here, we outline the role of IL-6 in health and disease, explain the different types of IL-6 signalling and their contribution to the net biological effect of the cytokine, describe the approaches to IL-6 inhibition that are currently available, and discuss implications for the future use of treatments such as tocilizumab in the critical care setting.","McElvaney, Oliver J; Curley, Gerard F; Rose-John, Stefan; McElvaney, Noel G",Lancet Respir Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221326002100103X; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(21)00103-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872590/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221326002100103X,144

Quarantine is a strategy used to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in correctional settings, and specific quarantine practices differ state to state. To better understand how states are using quarantine in prisons, we reviewed each state’s definition of quarantine and compared each state’s definition to the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) definition and recommendations for quarantine in jails and prisons. Most prison systems, 45 of 53, define quarantine, but definitions vary widely. No state published definitions of quarantine that align with all CDC recommendations, and only 9 states provide quarantine data. In these states, the highest recorded quarantine rate occurred in Ohio in May 2020 at 843 per 1,000. It is necessary for prison systems to standardize their definitions of quarantine and to utilize quarantine practices in accordance with CDC recommendations.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for its binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. It contains multiple dominant neutralizing epitopes and serves as an important antigen for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we showed that immunization of mice with a candidate subunit vaccine consisting of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Fc fragment of human IgG, as an immunopotentiator, elicited high titer of RBD-specific antibodies with robust neutralizing activity against both pseudotyped and live SARS-CoV-2 infections. The mouse antisera could also effectively neutralize infection by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 with several natural mutations in RBD and the IgG extracted from the mouse antisera could also show neutralization against pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). Vaccination of human ACE2 transgenic mice with RBD-Fc could effectively protect mice from the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc has good potential to be further developed as an effective and broad-spectrum vaccine to prevent infection of the current SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants, as well as future emerging SARSr-CoVs and re-emerging SARS-CoV.","Liu, Zezhong; Xu, Wei; Xia, Shuai; Gu, Chenjian; Wang, Xinling; Wang, Qian; Zhou, Jie; Wu, Yanling; Cai, Xia; Qu, Di; Ying, Tianlei; Xie, Youhua; Lu, Lu; Yuan, Zhenghong; Jiang, Shibo",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-020-00402-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33247109/,144
619916,Nasopharyngeal Microbiome Signature in COVID-19 Positive Patients: Can We Definitively Get a Role to Fusobacterium periodonticum?,2021-02-15,"Background: Cardiac injury is recognized as one of the most common critical complications during exacerbation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to investigate the effect of cardiac injury on the clinical course of COVID-19 and to examine its potential mechanism and treatments. Methods and Results: A total of 222 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan were selected for the study during February 10 to March 28, 2020. Demographic, laboratory, and clinical data on admission and during hospitalization were compared between patients with COVID-19 with or without cardiac injury. On admission, cardiac injury (n = 29) was associated with advanced age, more underlying coronary artery disease, and a lower Pao(2). Troponin levels were correlated with inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: r = 0.348, P < 0.001; interleukin 6: r = 0.558, P < 0.001) and d-dimer levels (r = 0.598, P < 0.001). During hospitalization, another six patients suffered from cardiac injury and cardiac injury (n = 35), resulting in higher rates of ventilation (invasive: 51.4 vs. 1.6%, P < 0.001; non-invasive: 31.4 vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001) and mortality (54.3 vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001). Cardiac injury on admission was a predictive factor for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 4.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.35–16.63, P = 0.015). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that, on admission, a troponin level of 36.35 pg/mL was predictive for mortality with a sensitivity of 73.7% and a specificity of 92.1%. Conclusions: Cardiac injury complicates the disease course and increases the mortality rate of COVID-19. Troponin levels should be checked at admission and during hospitalization for triage, better monitoring, and managing those with COVID-19, especially in the most severe patients. Condensed Abstract: Cardiac injury is not uncommon in COVID-19. In a cohort of 222 patients with COVID-19, cardiac injury was found in 29 patients on admission and in another 6 patients during hospitalization. The admission level of troponin was well-correlated with inflammatory factors and d-dimer levels and strongly predicted mortality. Cardiac injury is a manifestation secondary to hypoxia and systemic infection, but which nevertheless further complicates the disease course and increases the mortality rate. Troponin levels should be checked at admission and during hospitalization for triage, better monitoring, and managing those with COVID-19, especially in the most severe patients.","Wang, Yushi; Zheng, Yang; Tong, Qian; Wang, Lihui; Lv, Guorui; Xi, Ziwei; Liu, Wei",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33195443/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2020.00147,144

Methods A cross-sectional point prevalence survey, was developed and disseminated through the pediatric emergency medicine research networks for Europe (REPEM) and the United Kingdom and Ireland (PERUKI). We aimed to include ten EDs for countries with > 20 million inhabitants and five EDs for less populated countries, unless the number of eligible EDs was below five. ED directors or their delegates completed the survey between March 20th and 21st to report practice at that time. We used descriptive statistics to analyse data. Results Overall 102 centers from 18 countries (86% response rate) completed the survey: 34% did not have an ED contingency plan for pandemics and 36% had never had simulations for such events. Wide variation on PPE items was shown for recommended PPE use at pre-triage and for patient assessment, with 62% of centers experiencing shortage in one or more PPE items, most frequently FFP2/N95 masks. Only 17% of EDs had negative pressure isolation rooms. COVID-19 positive ED staff was reported in 25% of centers. Conclusion We found variation and identified gaps in preparedness and response to the COVID-19 epidemic across European referral EDs for children. A lack in early availability of a documented contingency plan, provision of simulation training, appropriate use of PPE, and appropriate isolation facilities emerged as gaps that should be optimized to improve preparedness and inform responses to future pandemics.","Bressan, Silvia; Buonsenso, Danilo; Farrugia, Ruth; Parri, Niccolo’; Oostenbrink, Rianne; Titomanlio, Luigi; Roland, Damian; Nijman, Ruud G.; Maconochie, Ian; Da Dalt, Liviana; Mintegi, Santiago",Ann Emerg Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064420303668; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064420303668?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419713/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.05.018,144

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a pivotal role in cell-entry and host immune response, thus regarded as potential drug- and vaccine-target. As the virus utilizes the S1 domain of spike to initiate cell-attachment and S2 domain for membrane fusion, several attempts have been made to design viral-receptor and viral-fusion blockers. Here, by deploying interactive structure-based design and pharmacophore-based approaches, we designed short and stable peptide-biologics i.e. CoV-spike-neutralizing peptides (CSNPs) including CSNP1, CSNP2, CSNP3, CSNP4. We could demonstrate in cell culture experiments that CSNP2 binds to S1 at submicromolar concentration and abrogates the S1-hACE2 interaction. CSNP3, a modified and downsized form of CSNP2, could neither interfere with the S1-hACE2 interaction nor bind to S1. CSNP4 exhibited dose-dependent binding to both S1 and hACE2 and abolished the S1-hACE2 interaction in vitro. CSNP4 possibly enhance the mAb-based S1 neutralization by limiting the spontaneous movement of spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas CSNP2 allowed RBD-mAb binding without any steric hindrance. Taken together, we suggest that CSNP2 and CSNP4 are potent and stable candidate peptides that can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 spike and possibly pose the virus to host immune surveillance.","Shah, Masaud; Moon, Sung Ung; Woo, Hyun Goo",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.30.424801,144
624434,Bioinformatic HLA Studies in the Context of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and Review on Association of HLA Alleles with Preexisting Medical Conditions,2021-05-28,"SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) develops an antagonistic mechanism by which to evade the antiviral activities of interferon (IFN). Previous studies suggested that SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibits activation of the IRF3 pathway, which would normally elicit a robust IFN response, but the mechanism(s) used by SARS PLpro to inhibit activation of the IRF3 pathway is not fully known. In this study, we uncovered a novel mechanism that may explain how SARS PLpro efficiently inhibits activation of the IRF3 pathway. We found that expression of the membrane-anchored PLpro domain (PLpro-TM) from SARS-CoV inhibits STING/TBK1/IKKε-mediated activation of type I IFNs and disrupts the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3, which are activated by STING and TBK1. Meanwhile, we showed that PLpro-TM physically interacts with TRAF3, TBK1, IKKε, STING, and IRF3, the key components that assemble the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex for activation of IFN expression. However, the interaction between the components in STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex is disrupted by PLpro-TM. Furthermore, SARS PLpro-TM reduces the levels of ubiquitinated forms of RIG-I, STING, TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3 in the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex. These results collectively point to a new mechanism used by SARS-CoV through which PLpro negatively regulates IRF3 activation by interaction with STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex, yielding a SARS-CoV countermeasure against host innate immunity.","Chen, Xiaojuan; Yang, Xingxing; Zheng, Yang; Yang, Yudong; Xing, Yaling; Chen, Zhongbin",Protein Cell,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-014-0026-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622840/,144
625270,Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome: Tick-Mediated Viral Disease,2013-06-03,"Many of the ‘essential workers’ during the Covid-19 pandemic are migrants, playing an important role for the continued functioning of basic services – notably health services, social care, and food supply chains. We argue that this role should be taken into account when assessing the impacts of migrant workers and in the design of labour migration and related public policies. Existing studies highlight how the employment of migrant workers in essential services is shaped by interests of employers, sectoral policies, and national institutions. Considerations of how migrants may affect the systemic resilience of essential services – in a pandemic or similar crises – are pervasively absent, not only in policy-making but also in research. Drawing on several disciplines, we outline the concept of systemic resilience and develop implications for the analysis and regulation of labour migration. We call for shifting the focus from the role of migrants in specific occupations and sectors in particular countries to transnational systems of production and service provision. To study how migrant workers affect systemic resilience, we propose an agenda for comparative research along three lines: comparing migrants to citizens within the same system, comparing migrants’ roles across systems, and comparing strategies for resilience adopted in different systems.","Anderson, Bridget; Poeschel, Friedrich; Ruhs, Martin",Comp Migr Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608433/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-021-00252-2,144

Whether the specific mutations that evolve in the lab also evolve in nature and whether they have the same impact on evolution in the real world is unknown. We studied a model virus, bacteriophage λ, that repeatedly evolves to exploit a new host receptor under typical laboratory conditions. Here, we demonstrate that two residues of λ’s J protein are required for the new function. In natural λ variants, these amino acid sites are highly diverse and evolve at high rates. Insertions and deletions at these locations are associated with phylogenetic patterns indicative of ecological diversification. Our results show that viral evolution in the laboratory mirrors that in nature and that laboratory experiments can be coupled with protein sequence analyses to identify the causes of viral evolution in the real world. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for widespread host‐shift evolution in lambdoid viruses.","Maddamsetti, Rohan; Johnson, Daniel T.; Spielman, Stephanie J.; Petrie, Katherine L.; Marks, Debora S.; Meyer, Justin R.",Evolution,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30152871/; https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13586,144

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the existence of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and raised the question of the neuropathogenicity of coronaviruses. The aim of this review was to summarize the current data about neurological manifestations and diseases linked to human coronaviruses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Articles have been identified by searches of PubMed and Google scholar up to September 25, 2020, using a combination of coronavirus and neurology search terms and adding relevant references in the articles. RESULTS: We found five cohorts providing prevalence data of neurological symptoms among a total of 2533 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and articles focusing on COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations including a total of 580 patients. Neurological symptoms involved up to 73% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and were mostly headache, myalgias and impaired consciousness. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were mostly non-specific encephalopathies that represented between 13% and 40% of all neurological manifestations; post-infectious syndromes including acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM, n = 13), acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE, n = 4), Bickerstaff's encephalitis (n = 5), generalized myoclonus (n = 3) and acute transverse myelitis (n = 7); other encephalitis including limbic encephalitis (n = 9) and miscellaneous encephalitis with variable radiologic findings (n = 26); acute cerebrovascular diseases including ischemic strokes (between 1.3% and 4.7% of COVID-19 patients), hemorrhagic strokes (n = 17), cerebral venous thrombosis (n = 8) and posterior reversible encephalopathy (n = 5). Peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were the following: Guillain–Barré syndrome (n = 31) and variants including Miller Fisher syndrome (n = 3), polyneuritis cranialis (n = 2) and facial diplegia (n = 2); isolated oculomotor neuropathy (n = 6); critical illness myopathy (n = 6). Neuropathological studies in COVID-19 patients demonstrated different patterns of CNS damage, mostly ischemic and hemorrhagic changes with few cases of inflammatory injuries. Only one case suggested SARS-CoV-2 infiltration in endothelial and neural cells. We found 10 case reports or case series describing 22 patients with neurological manifestations associated with other human coronaviruses. Among them we found four MERS patients with ADEM or Bickerstaff's encephalitis, two SARS patients with encephalitis who had a positive SARS-CoV PCR in cerebrospinal fluid, five patients with ischemic strokes associated with SARS, eight MERS patients with critical illness neuromyopathy and one MERS patient with Guillain–Barré Syndrome. An autopsy study on SARS-CoV patients demonstrated the presence of the virus in the brain of eight patients. CONCLUSION: The wide range of neurological manifestations and diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with multiple pathogenic pathways including post-infectious mechanisms, septic-associated encephalopathies, coagulopathy or endothelitis. There was no definite evidence to support direct neuropathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.","Maury, A.; Lyoubi, A.; Peiffer-Smadja, N.; de Broucker, T.; Meppiel, E.",Rev Neurol (Paris),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurol.2020.10.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0035378720307323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33446327/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0035378720307323,144

Objective At the time of this study, there were no published studies investigating knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to COVID-19 within the Saudi population. Therefore, this study aims to address this gap in current knowledge and provide baseline data to the government and other health associations for preventive measurements for future outbreaks. Methods This study was conducted among the Saudi population using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire assessed the awareness of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) incubation period, the known symptoms of COVID-19, the mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and infection control measures for prevention. Results The study included 6000 participants. Most respondents (84.93%) of the population reported awareness of the virus, 78.78% reported a belief that the virus leads to death, 89.47% reported a belief that 14 days is the incubation period, and 93.73% were aware of the possibility of asymptomatic carriers.

This study evaluated the trends in Google searches, as an indication of public interest and demand, for bruxism and its symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Google Trends was queried for bruxism, teeth grinding, and teeth clenching both worldwide and in the United States. Two periods in 2020 (March 15–May 9 and May 10–October 17) were compared to similar periods of 2016–2019 to investigate both initial and short-term interest. RESULTS: The relative search volume of bruxism, teeth grinding, and teeth clenching was not significantly different between 2020 and 2016–2019 worldwide or in the United States in the March 15–May 9 period. Only the search for teeth grinding showed an increase worldwide. In the May 10–October 17 period, the relative search volume of bruxism, teeth grinding, and teeth clenching all was significantly higher in 2020 compared to 2016–2019 both worldwide and in the United States. CONCLUSION: The study showed that the relative search volume for bruxism, teeth grinding, and teeth clenching, as an indication of public interest and demand, was increased both worldwide and in the United States during the May–October 2020 period compared to similar periods of the previous 4 years.

A systematic literature search with no language restriction was performed in electronic databases to identify eligible observational studies which reported the adjusted effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to prevent RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. Meta-analyses with the random-effects model were used to calculate the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and pooled incidence rate ratio (IRR) at 95% confidence intervals, and the vaccine effectiveness was indicated as (pooled HR − 1)/HR or (pooled IRR − 1)/IRR. Nineteen studies were included for this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed significant protective effect against RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 ≥ 14 days after the first dose, with vaccine effectiveness of 53% (95% confidence interval 32–68%), and ≥ 7 days after the second dose, with vaccine effectiveness of 95% (95% confidence interval: 96–97%). Despite its effectiveness, reporting vaccine safety data by relevant stakeholders should be encouraged as BNT162b2 mRNA is a new vaccine that has not gained full approval. There have been limited data about vaccine effectiveness among immunocompromised patients; thus, the vaccine should be used cautiously in this patient population.","Kow, Chia Siang; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Inflammopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10787-021-00839-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34241782/,144

629441,Efficacy of various disinfectants against SARS coronavirus,2005-05-31,"PURPOSE: The capability of lung ultrasound (LUS) to distinguish the different pulmonary patterns of COVID-19 and quantify the disease burden compared to chest CT is still unclear. METHODS: PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who underwent both LUS and chest CT at the Emergency Department were retrospectively analysed. In both modalities, twelve peripheral lung zones were identified and given a Severity Score basing on main lesion pattern. On CT scans the well-aerated lung volume (%WALV) was visually estimated. Per-patient and per-zone assessments of LUS classification performance taking CT findings as reference were performed, further revisioning the images in case of discordant results. Correlations between number of disease-positive lung zones, Severity Score and %WALV on both LUS and CT were assessed. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to determine LUS performance in detecting %WALV ≤ 70%. RESULTS: The study included 219 COVID-19 patients with abnormal chest CT. LUS correctly identified as positive 217 (99%) patients, but per-zone analysis showed sensitivity = 75% and specificity = 66%. The revision of the 121 (55%) cases with positive LUS and negative CT revealed COVID-compatible lesions in 42 (38%) CT scans. Number of disease-positive zones, Severity Score and %WALV between LUS and CT showed moderate correlations.

Widely used second-generation sequencers have enabled the analysis of extremely diverse microbial communities, the discovery of novel gene functions, and the comprehension of the metabolic interconnections established among microbial consortia. However, the high cost of the sequencers and the complexity of library preparation and sequencing protocols still hamper the application of metagenomic sequencing in a vast range of real-life applications. In this context, the emergence of portable, third-generation sequencers is becoming a popular alternative for the rapid analysis of microbial communities in particular scenarios, due to their low cost, simplicity of operation, and rapid yield of results. This review discusses the main applications of real-time, in situ metagenomic sequencing developed to date, highlighting the relevance of this technology in current challenges (such as the management of global pathogen outbreaks) and in the next future of industry and clinical diagnosis.","Latorre-Pérez, Adriel; Pascual, Javier; Porcar, Manuel; Vilanova, Cristina",Biol Methods Protoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134552/; https://doi.org/10.1093/biomethods/bpaa016,144

PURPOSE: To review the MRI findings associated with acute neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between March 23 and May 7, 2020 at the Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital, a reference center for COVID-19 in the Paris area. Inclusion criteria were: adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, presenting with acute neurological manifestations and referred for a brain MRI examination. Patients were excluded if they had a previous history of neurological disease. The characteristics and the frequency of different MRI features were investigated. The findings were analyzed separately in patients in intensive care units (ICU) and other departments (non-ICU). RESULTS: During the inclusion period, 1176 consecutive patients were hospitalized for suspected COVID-19. Out of 308 patients with acute neurological symptoms, 73 patients met the inclusion criteria (23.7%) and were included: 35 ICU patients (47.9%) and 38 non-ICU patients (52.1%). The mean age was 58.5 ± 15.6 years, with a male predominance (65.8% vs. 34.2%). Forty-three patients presented pathological MRI findings 2-4 weeks after symptom onset (58.9%), including 17 with acute ischemic infarct (23.3%), 1 with a deep venous thrombosis (1.4%), 8 with multiple microhemorrhages (11.3%), 22 with perfusion abnormalities (47.7%), 3 with restricted diffusion foci within the corpus callosum consistent with cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCC, 4.1%). Multifocal white matter enhancing lesions were seen in 4 ICU patients (5%). Basal ganglia abnormalities were seen in 4 other patients (5%). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was negative for SARS-CoV-2 in all tested patients (n=39). CONCLUSION: In addition to cerebrovascular lesions, perfusion abnormalities, CLOCC and ICU-related complications, we identified two patterns including white matter enhancing lesions and basal ganglia abnormalities that could be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chougar, Lydia; Shor, Natalia; Weiss, Nicolas; Galanaud, Damien; Leclercq, Delphine; Mathon, Bertrand; Belkacem, Samia; Stroër, Sebastian; Burrel, Sonia; Boutolleau, David; Demoule, Alexandre; Rosso, Charlotte; Delorme, Cécile; Seilhean, Danielle; Dormont, Didier; Morawiec, Elise; Raux, Mathieu; Demeret, Sophie; Gerber, Sophie; Trunet, Stéphanie; Similowski, Thomas; Degos, Vincent; Rufat, Pierre; Corvol, Jean-Christophe; Lehéricy, Stéphane; Pyatigorskaya, Nadya",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020202422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32677875/,144

Two studies were conducted separately in China during outbreak and the after peak stages, with 2540 participants were recruited from February 6 to 16, 2020, and 2543 participants were recruited from April 25 to May 5, 2020. The network models were created to explore the relationship between psychopathology symptoms both within and across anxiety and depression, with anxiety measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and depression measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Symptom network analysis was conducted to evaluate network and bridge centrality, and the network properties were compared between the outbreak and after peak. Noticeably, psychomotor symptoms such as impaired motor skills, restlessness, and inability to relax exhibited high centrality during the outbreak, which still relatively high but showed substantial remission during after peak stage (in terms of strength, betweenness, or bridge centrality). Meanwhile, symptoms of irritability (strength, betweenness, or bridge centrality) and loss of energy (bridge centrality) played an important role in the network after the peak of the pandemic. This study provides novel insights into the changes in central features during the different COVID-19 stages and highlights motor-related symptoms as bridge symptoms, which could activate the connection between anxiety and depression. The results revealed that restrictions on movement were associated with worsen in psychomotor symptoms, indicating that future psychological interventions should target motor-related symptoms as priority.","Wang, Yuanyuan; Hu, Zhishan; Feng, Yi; Wilson, Amanda; Chen, Runsen",Mol Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-00881-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929212/,144

Despite huge efforts to contain the disease spread, it is still on the rise because of the community spread pattern of this infection. In order to prevent the community spread, a nationwide lockdown was implemented, due to which many restrictions were imposed on movements of citizens within the country. Since the dental professionals were at the forefront of acquiring the infection, the majority of the dental clinics were shut for routine dental procedures. Only emergency treatment was provided to the patients. However, due to restrictions in movement, it was difficult for the patients to visit the clinics for routine check-ups. This was overcome by the advancements in technology which has a major impact on medicine. Due to increased usage of smartphones and related software applications, the clinical data exchange was facilitated between patients and clinicians which has been termed as “teledentistry.” Teledentistry is a combination of telecommunications and dentistry, involving the exchange of clinical information and images for dental consultation and treatment planning. This technology served as a boon for the dentists to manage dental emergencies during the lockdown period. This narrative review discusses teledentistry and its applications in general and specialty dental practice amidst the COVID-19 lockdown.","Deshpande, Shantanu; Patil, Devendra; Dhokar, Amol; Bhanushali, Parin; Katge, Farhin",Int J Telemed Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33628231/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8859746,144

633529,Blood stewardship: Conservation and supply of blood components during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic,2020-07-16,"Resistance to chemotherapeutics and targeted drugs is one of the main problems in successful cancer therapy. Various mechanisms have been identified to contribute to drug resistance. One of those mechanisms is lysosome-mediated drug resistance. Lysosomes have been shown to trap certain hydrophobic weak base chemotherapeutics, as well as some tyrosine kinase inhibitors, thereby being sequestered away from their intracellular target site. Lysosomal sequestration is in most cases followed by the release of their content from the cell by exocytosis. Lysosomal accumulation of anticancer drugs is caused mainly by ion-trapping, but active transport of certain drugs into lysosomes was also described. Lysosomal low pH, which is necessary for ion-trapping is achieved by the activity of the V-ATPase. This sequestration can be successfully inhibited by lysosomotropic agents and V-ATPase inhibitors in experimental conditions. Clinical trials have been performed only with lysosomotropic drug chloroquine and their results were less successful. The aim of this review is to give an overview of lysosomal sequestration and expression of acidifying enzymes as yet not well known mechanism of cancer cell chemoresistance and about possibilities how to overcome this form of resistance.","Hraběta, Jan; Belhajová, Marie; Šubrtová, Hana; Merlos Rodrigo, Miguel Angel; Heger, Zbyněk; Eckschlager, Tomáš",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32575682/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21124392,144

Accumulating data on patients with COVID-19-associated stroke have shed light on specificities concerning clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and outcome. Such specificities include a propensity towards large vessel occlusion, multi-territory stroke, and involvement of otherwise uncommonly affected vessels. Conversely, small-vessel brain disease, cerebral venous thrombosis, and intracerebral hemorrhage appear to be less frequent. Atypical neurovascular presentations were also described, ranging from bilateral carotid artery dissection to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and vasculitis. Cases presenting with encephalopathy or encephalitis with seizures heralding stroke were particularly challenging. The pathogenesis and optimal management of ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19 still remain uncertain, but emerging evidence suggest that cytokine storm-triggered coagulopathy and endotheliopathy represent possible targetable mechanisms. Some specific management issues in this population include the difficulty in identifying clinical signs of stroke in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, as well as the need for a protected pathway for brain imaging, intravenous thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy, keeping in mind that “time is brain” also for COVID-19 patients.

634339,Rising to the challenge of COVID-19: Working on SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic,2021-06-03,"Background: Seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is an important tool to estimate the true extent of infection in a population. However, seroprevalence studies have been scarce in South East Asia including India, which, as of now, carries the third largest burden of confirmed cases in the world. The present study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody among hospitalized patients at one of the largest government hospital in India. Method: This cross-sectional study, conducted at a tertiary care hospital in North India, recruited consecutive patients who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or CB-NAAT. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels targeting recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS CoV-2 were estimated in serum samples by the ELISA method. Results: A total of 212 hospitalized patients were recruited in the study with mean age (+/-SD) of 41.2 (+/-15.4) years and 55% male population. Positive serology against SARS CoV-2 was detected in 19.8% patients(95% CI 14.7-25.8).

No particular age groups or socio-economic strata showed a higher proportion of seropositivity. Conclusion: Around, one-fifth of hospitalized patients, who were not diagnosed with COVID-19 before, demonstrated seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2.

There are varying data regarding the exact frequency in the various study population. The outcome of the olfactory impairment is also not clearly defined. OBJECTIVE: To find the frequency of olfactory impairment and its outcome in hospitalized patients with positive swab test for COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective descriptive study of 100 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, randomly sampled, from February to March 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory findings were analyzed according to the olfactory loss or sinonasal symptoms. The olfactory impairment and sinonasal symptoms were evaluated by 9 Likert scale questions asked from the patients. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients completed the follow-up (means 20.1 (± 7.42) days). Twenty-two (23.91%) patients complained of olfactory loss and in 6 (6.52%) patients olfactory loss was the first symptom of the disease. The olfactory loss was reported to be completely resolved in all but one patient. Thirty-nine (42.39%) patients had notable sinonasal symptoms while rhinorrhea was the first symptom in 3 (3.26%). Fifteen patients (16.3%) had a taste impairment. Patients with sinonasal symptoms had a lower age (p = 0.01). There was no significant relation between olfactory loss and sinonasal symptoms (p = 0.07).

To determine the COVID-19 case from other normal and abnormal cases, this work proposes an alternative method that extracted the informative features from X-ray images, leveraging on a new feature selection method to determine the relevant features. As such, an enhanced cuckoo search optimization algorithm (CS) is proposed using fractional-order calculus (FO) and four different heavy-tailed distributions in place of the Lévy flight to strengthen the algorithm performance during dealing with COVID-19 multi-class classification optimization task. The classification process includes three classes, called normal patients, COVID-19 infected patients, and pneumonia patients. The distributions used are Mittag-Leffler distribution, Cauchy distribution, Pareto distribution, and Weibull distribution. The proposed FO-CS variants have been validated with eighteen UCI data-sets as the first series of experiments. For the second series of experiments, two data-sets for COVID-19 X-ray images are considered. The proposed approach results have been compared with well-regarded optimization algorithms. The outcomes assess the superiority of the proposed approach for providing accurate results for UCI and COVID-19 data-sets with remarkable improvements in the convergence curves, especially with applying Weibull distribution instead of Lévy flight.","Yousri, Dalia; Abd Elaziz, Mohamed; Abualigah, Laith; Oliva, Diego; Al-qaness, Mohammed A.A.; Ewees, Ahmed A.",Appl Soft Comput,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.107052; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156849462030990X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519325/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156849462030990X,144

India has the world’s largest population aged between 10 and 40 years. At the same time, India has a large number of individuals with diabetes, hypertension and kidney diseases, who are at a high risk of developing COVID-19. A vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2, may offer immediate protection from the causative agent of COVID-19, however, the protective memory may be short-lived. Even if vaccination is broadly successful in the world, India has a large and diverse population with over one-third being below the poverty line. Therefore, the success of a vaccine, even when one becomes available, is uncertain, making it necessary to focus on alternate approaches of tackling the disease. In this review, we discuss the differences in COVID-19 death/infection ratio between urban and rural India; and the probable role of the immune system, co-morbidities and associated nutritional status in dictating the death rate of COVID-19 patients in rural and urban India. Also, we focus on strategies for developing masks, vaccines, diagnostics and the role of drugs targeting host-virus protein-protein interactions in enhancing host immunity.

Both the tumor and its treatment can lead to significant neurological and endocrinological complications. Due to the essential role of the hypothalamus in the complex neurophysiologic process of sleep, tumors involving the hypothalamic area may be responsible for disturbances in sleep–wake regulation with alterations in the circadian rhythm, sleep fragmentation, and increased daytime sleepiness. We report two cases of patients with craniopharyngioma, who came to our attention due to the occurrence of episodes characterized by psychomotor slowing and afinalistic limb movements, temporal and spatial disorientation, psychomotor agitation, and oneiric stupor like episodes. A comprehensive clinical data collection and a targeted diagnostic work-up led to a diagnosis of severe sleep disorder characterized by hypersomnia, altered sleep–wake rhythm, and sleep-related breathing disorder. In addition, the polysomnography revealed peculiar alterations in the sleep structure. The diagnostic work-up lead to an accurate differential diagnosis between epileptic seizures and episodes expressions of sleep disturbances. These clinical features can be challenging to diagnose and can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Diagnosis of sleep disorders is crucial, considering the impact of sleep on general health, cognition, and neuropsychological functioning.

The recombinant gl had an apparent molecular weight of 116 kDa and was partially cleaved to yield 63-kDa (glb) and 52-kDa (glc) subunits. This processing step was significantly less efficient in insect cells than the analogous step in mammalian cells, even though the cleavage sites of authentic and recombinant gl were shown to be identical. The oligosaccharide linkages were mostly endoglycosidase-H-sensitive, in contrast to those of authentic gl, which has mostly endoglycosidase-H-resistant linkages and an apparent molecular weight of 130/74/55 kDa. Despite the reduced cleavage and altered glycosylation, the recombinant glycoprotein was transported and expressed on the surface of infected insect cells. These surface molecules were biologically active as demonstrated by their ability to induce cell-cell fusion. Fusion was inhibited bythree monoclonal antibodies specific for antigenic domains I and IV on gl. Domain I maps to the extracellular region of the carboxy terminal fragment glc and domain IV to the very amino terminus of the glb fragment, indicating that domains mapping in two distinct regions of gl function in cell fusion. Monoclonal antibodies specific for eight different epitopes recognized recombinant gl, indicating that the antigenic characteristics of the recombinant and authentic glycoproteins are similar. In addition, the recombinant gl was as immunogenic as the authentic gl, resulting in the induction of gl-specific antibodies in cattle.","Van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk, S.; Parker, M.

Estimating rate and relevance of these manifestations remains difficult as there is a lack of standardised case definitions. METHODS: We defined comprehensive categories including most reported neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 to allow for a more standardised data collection. After a literature search of MEDLINE with ten keywords, 12 selected studies and larger case series were included. We compared the rate and relevance of neurological manifestations in hospitalized patients. We propose four main categories including 1) cerebrovascular disease, 2) inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS) and muscle, 3) metabolic/toxic dysfunction of CNS, PNS and muscle and 4) miscellaneous disorders. CONCLUSION: Ageusia (702) and anosmia (805) have been reported as the most common and the first occurring neurological symptoms. Cerebrovascular disease (451) and encephalopathy (663) were associated with a more severe course and worse clinical outcome. Any neurological manifestation was associated with a longer hospital stay and a higher morbidity and mortality compared to patients without neurological manifestations. We suggest reporting future neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) following a pathophysiology-based approach using standardized pre-defined case definitions to yield more specific and comparable data.","Leven, Yana; Bösel, Julian",Neurol Res Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34311778/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s42466-021-00138-9,144

Here we followed 73 acute Lyme disease patients and uninfected controls over a period of a year. At each visit, RNA-sequencing was applied to profile patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells in addition to extensive clinical phenotyping. Based on the projection of the RNA-seq data into lower dimensions, we observe that the cases are separated from controls, and almost all cases never return to cluster with the controls over time. Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes between clusters identifies up-regulation of immune response genes. This observation is also supported by deconvolution analysis to identify the changes in cell type composition due to Lyme disease infection. Importantly, we developed several machine learning classifiers that attempt to perform various Lyme disease classifications. We show that Lyme patients can be distinguished from the controls as well as from COVID-19 patients, but classification was not successful in distinguishing those patients with early Lyme disease cases that would advance to develop post-treatment persistent symptoms.","Clarke, Daniel J.

639642,Microfragmented adipose tissue is associated with improved ex vivo performance linked to HOXB7 and b-FGF expression,2021-08-28,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the patchwork nature of disease epidemics, with infection spread dynamics varying wildly across countries and across states within the US. These heterogeneous patterns are also observed within individual states, with patches of concentrated outbreaks. Data is being generated daily at all of these spatial scales, and answers to questions regarded reopening strategies are desperately needed. Mathematical modeling is useful in exactly these cases, and using modeling at a county scale may be valuable to further predict disease dynamics for the purposes of public health interventions. To explore this issue, we study and predict the spread of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI, the home to University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, and Google, as well as serving as a sister city to Detroit, MI where there has been a serious outbreak. Here, we apply a discrete and stochastic network-based modeling framework allowing us to track every individual in the county. In this framework, we construct contact networks based on synthetic population datasets specific for Washtenaw County that are derived from US Census datasets. We assign individuals to households, workplaces, schools, and group quarters (such as prisons). In addition, we assign casual contacts to each individual at random. Using this framework, we explicitly simulate Michigan-specific government-mandated workplace and school closures as well as social distancing measures. We also perform sensitivity analyses to identify key model parameters and mechanisms contributing to the observed disease burden in the three months following the first observed cases on COVID-19 in Michigan. We then consider several scenarios for relaxing restrictions and reopening workplaces to predict what actions would be most prudent. In particular, we consider the effects of 1) different timings for reopening, and 2) different levels of workplace vs. casual contact re-engagement. Through simulations and sensitivity analyses, we explore mechanisms driving magnitude and timing of a second wave of infections upon re-opening. This model can be adapted to other US counties using synthetic population databases and data specific to those regions.","Renardy, Marissa; Kirschner, Denise",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.06.20147223v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32676613/,144

Genomic data allows comprehensive evaluation of underlying viral diversity and epidemiology to inform control. For human rhinovirus (HRV), genomic amplification and sequencing is challenging due to numerous types, high genetic diversity and inadequate reference sequences. Methods: We developed a tiled amplicon type-specific protocol for genome amplification and sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform of two HRV types, A15 and A101. We then assessed added value in analyzing whole genomes relative to the VP4/2 region only in the investigation of HRV molecular epidemiology within the community in Kilifi, coastal Kenya. Results: We processed 73 samples collected between 2016-2018, and 48 yielded at least 70% HRV genome coverage. These included all A101 samples (n=10) and 38 (60.3%) A15 samples. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Kilifi A101 sequences interspersed with global A101 genomes available in GenBank collected between 1999-2016. On the other hand, our A15 sequences formed a monophyletic group separate from the global genomes collected in 2008 and 2019. Improved phylogenetic resolution was observed with the genome phylogenies compared to the VP4/2 phylogenies. Conclusions: We present a type-specific full genome sequencing approach for obtaining HRV genomic data and characterizing infections.","Luka, Martha M.; Kamau, Everlyn; de Laurent, Zaydah R.; Morobe, John Mwita; Alii, Leonard K.; Nokes, D.

FICare incorporates psychological, educational, communication, and environmental strategies to support parents to cope with the NICU environment and to prepare them to be able to emotionally, cognitively, and physically care for their infant. FICare has been associated with improved infant feeding, growth, and parent wellbeing and self‐efficacy; important mediators for long‐term improved infant neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcomes. FICare implementation requires multi‐disciplinary commitment, staff motivation, and sufficient time for preparation and readiness for change as professionals relinquish power and control to instead develop collaborative partnerships with parents. Successful FICare implementation and culture change have been applied by neonatal teams internationally, using practical approaches suited to their local environments. Strategies such as parent and staff meetings and relational communication help to break down barriers to change by providing space for the co‐creation of knowledge, the negotiation of caregiving roles and the development of trusting relationships. The COVID‐19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability within programs supporting parental presence in neonatal units and the profound impacts of parent‐infant separation. New technologies and digital innovations can help to mitigate these challenges, and support renewed efforts to embed FICare philosophy and practice in neonatal care during the COVID‐19 recovery and beyond.","Waddington, Chandra; van Veenendaal, Nicole R.; O’Brien, Karel; Patel, Neil",Pediatr Investig,https://doi.org/10.1002/ped4.12277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179713/,144

To identify asymptomatic cases among patients receiving active cancer treatment, the Federico II University Hospital in Naples performs rapid serological tests in addition to hospital standard clinical triage for COVID-19 infection. METHODS: From 6 to 17 April 2020, all candidates for chemotherapy, radiotherapy or target/immunotherapy, if negative at the standard clinical triage on the day scheduled for anticancer treatment, received a rapid serological test on peripheral blood for COVID-19 IgM and IgG detection. In case of COVID-19 IgM and/or IgG positivity, patients underwent a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 test to confirm infection, and active cancer treatment was delayed. RESULTS: Overall 466 patients, negative for COVID-19 symptoms, underwent serological testing in addition to standard clinical triage. The average age was 61 years (range 25–88 years). Most patients (190, 40.8%) had breast cancer, and chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy was administered in 323 (69.3%) patients. Overall 433 (92.9%) patients were IgG-negative and IgM-negative, and 33 (7.1%) were IgM-positive and/or IgG-positive. Among the latter patients, 18 (3.9%), 11 (2.4%) and 4 (0.9%) were IgM-negative/IgG-positive, IgM-positive/IgG-negative and IgM-positive/IgG-positive, respectively. All 33 patients with a positive serological test, tested negative for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test. No patient in our cohort developed symptoms suggestive of active COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Rapid serological testing at hospital admission failed to detect active asymptomatic COVID-19 infection.

However, understanding of immunity and protection offered by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against circulating variants of concern (VOC) is rapidly evolving. We investigated the mRNA vaccine-induced antibody responses against the referent WIV04 (Wuhan) strain, circulating variants, and human endemic coronaviruses in 168 naïve and previously infected people at three-time points. Samples were collected prior to vaccination, after the first and after the second doses of one of the two available mRNA-based vaccines. After full vaccination, both naïve and previously infected participants developed comparable robust SARS-CoV-2 specific spike IgG levels, modest IgM and IgA binding antibodies, and varying degrees of HCoV cross-reactive antibodies. However, the strength and frequency of neutralizing antibodies produced in naïve people were significantly lower than in the previously infected group. We also found that 1/3rd of previously infected people had undetectable neutralizing antibodies after the first vaccine dose; 40% of this group developed neutralizing antibodies after the second dose. In all subjects neutralizing antibodies produced against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants were weaker than those produced against the reference and B.1.1.7 strains.

Through interviews with the parents and facilitators involved with the pilot, this article provides an example of how strength-based interventions can promote parental engagement in education in marginalised groups, such as families considered disadvantaged. The programme consisted of six one-to-one sessions with 25 parents. Semi-structured interviews with five parents and four facilitators revealed that parents reported increased self-efficacy and confidence in supporting their children’s education. Key features of the programme contributing to sustainable changes were the programmes person-centred approach and the use of strength-based strategies.

Much less is known about the spectrum of disease in entire populations. In this study, we examine a representative cohort of primarily symptomatic cases in an administrative district in Southern Germany. METHODS: We contacted all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in the administrative district. Consenting participants answered a retrospective survey either via a telephone, electronically or via mail. Clinical and sociodemographic features were compared between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. Additionally, we assessed potential risk factors for hospitalization and time to hospitalization in a series of regression models. RESULTS: We included 897 participants in our study, 69% out of 1,305 total cases in the district with a mean age of 47 years (range 2–97), 51% of which were female and 47% had a pre-existing illness. The percentage of asymptomatic, mild, moderate (leading to hospital admission) and critical illness (requiring mechanical ventilation) was 54 patients (6%), 713 (79%), 97 (11%) and 16 (2%), respectively. Seventeen patients (2%) died. The most prevalent symptoms were fatigue (65%), cough (62%) and dysgeusia (60%). The risk factors for hospitalization included older age (OR 1.05 per year increase; 95% CI 1.04–1.07) preexisting lung conditions (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.62–5.88). Female sex was a protective factor (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.33–0.77). CONCLUSION: This representative analysis of primarily symptomatic COVID-19 cases confirms age, male sex and preexisting lung conditions but not cardiovascular disease as risk factors for severe illness.

The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted among five patients with COVID-19. Peripheral inflammatory markers were also collected in patients, both at baseline and within ± three days of completing the on-line survey. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P < 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of “Perceived Helplessness”, the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = .37, P = 0.003, Spearman’s correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.","Guo, Qian; Zheng, Yuchen; Shi, Jia; Wang, Jijun; Li, Guanjun; Li, Chunbo; Fromson, John A.; Xu, Yong; Liu, Xiaohua; Xu, Hua; Zhang, Tianhong; Lu, Yunfei; Chen, Xiaorong; Hu, Hao; Tang, Yingying; Yang, Shuwen; Zhou, Han; Wang, Xiaoliang; Chen, Haiying; Wang, Zhen; Yang, Zongguo",Brain Behav Immun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416290/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159120306188; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159120306188?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.038,144

The accurate diagnosis of influenza is critical to the timely clinical treatment of patients and the control of outbreaks to protect public health. Commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) that are operated by visual readout are widely used in clinics to screen influenza infections, but RIDTs suffer from imperfect analytical sensitivity, especially when the virus concentration in the sample is low. Fortunately, the sensitivity can be simply improved through an add-on signal amplification step, i.e., thermal contrast amplification (TCA). To demonstrate the advantage of TCA for influenza diagnosis, we conducted a prospective cohort study on 345 clinical specimens collected for influenza A and B testing during the 2017–2018 influenza season. All samples were tested using the Quidel QuickVue Influenza A + B test, followed by a TCA readout, and then confirmatory polymerase chain reaction testing. Through the TCA detecting sub-visual weak positives, TCA reading improved the overall influenza sensitivity by 53% for influenza A and 33% for influenza B over the visual RIDTs readings. Even though the specificity was compromised slightly by the TCA protocol (relative decrease of 0.09% for influenza A and 0.01% for influenza B), the overall performance was still better than that achieved by visual readout based on comparison of their plots in receiver operating characteristic space and F1 scores (relative increase of 14.5% for influenza A and 12.5% for influenza B). Performing a TCA readout on wet RIDTs also improved the overall TCA performance (relative increase in F1 score of 48%). Overall, the TCA method is a simple and promising way to improve the diagnostic performance of commercial RIDTs for infectious diseases, especially in the case of specimens with low target analytes.","Liu, Yilin; Zhan, Li; Wang, Yiru; Kangas, Joseph; Larkin, Daniel; Boulware, David R.; Bischof, John C.",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11030462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33800088/,144

This outpatient case of EVALI prompts primary care providers to raise suspicion of this condition, and enquire about the use of e-cigarettes, particularly THC-containing vaping products. Furthermore, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, similar clinical and radiographic presentations between COVID-19 and EVALI can be seen.","Galo, Jason; Celli, Diego; Gross, Dana; Holt, Gregory; Campos, Michael",Respir Med Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2020.101154; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213007120303671; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213007120303671?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32690998/,144

To examine changes in abortions in Louisiana before and after the COVID-19 pandemic onset and assess whether variations in abortion service availability during this time might explain observed changes. Methods. We collected monthly service data from abortion clinics in Louisiana and neighboring states among Louisiana residents (January 2018-May 2020) and assessed changes in abortions followin pandemic onset. We conducted mystery client calls to 30 abortion clinics in Louisiana and neighboring states (April-July 2020) and examined the percentage of open and scheduling clinics and median waits. Results. The number of abortions per month among Louisiana residents in Louisiana clinics decreased 31% (incidence rate ratio = 50.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 50.59, 0.79) from before to after pandemic onset, while the odds of having a second-trimester abortion increased (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 51.91; 95% CI = 51.10, 3.33). The decrease was not offset by an increase in out-of-state abortions. In Louisiana, only 1 or 2 (of 3) clinics were open (with a median wait >.2 weeks) through early May. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic onset was associated with a significant decrease in the number of abortions and increase in the proportion of abortions provided in the second trimester among Louisiana residents. These changes followed service disruptions. (Am J Public Health.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital between July 2018 and June 2020. Eighty-five children with WS who presented within one year from the onset of epileptic spasms were included. The details of the treatment costs (direct medical and nonmedical) incurred during the first year from the onset of epileptic spasms were noted from a parental interview and case record review. Unit cost was fixed for drugs and specific services. Total cost was estimated by multiplying the unit cost by the number of times a drug or service was availed. The determinants of the financial burden were also explored. RESULTS: The median monthly per-capita income of the enrolled families (n = 85) was INR 3000 (Q1, Q3, 2000, 6000). The median cost of treatment over one year was INR 27035 (Q1, Q3, 17,894, 39,591). Median direct medical and nonmedical expenses amounted to INR 18802 (Q1, Q3, 12,179, 25,580) and INR 6550 (Q1, Q3, 3500, 15,000), respectively. Seven families had catastrophic healthcare expenditure. Parental education and choice of first-line treatment were important determinants driving healthcare expenses. The age at onset of epileptic spasms, etiology, treatment lag, the initial response to treatment, and relapse following initial response did not significantly influence the illness-related expenditure by the families. CONCLUSION: WS imposes a substantial financial burden on the families and indirectly on the healthcare system.

651290,Compliance with international guidelines in adults with encephalitis,2020-04-14,"BACKGROUND: Hospital at home (HaH) schemes allow early discharge of patients hospitalised with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Traditional outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) following an AECOPD has an established evidence-base, but there are issues with low referral, uptake and completion. One commonly cited barrier to PR post-hospitalisation relates to poor accessibility. To address this, the aim of this project was to enrol service users (patients with COPD and informal carers) and healthcare professionals to co-design a model of care that integrates home-based exercise training within a HaH scheme for patients discharged from hospital following AECOPD. METHODS: This accelerated experience-based co-design project included three audio-recorded stakeholder feedback events, using key “touchpoints” from previous qualitative interviews and a recent systematic review. Audio-recordings were inductively analysed using directed content analysis. An integrated model of care was then developed and finalised through two co-design groups, with the decision-making process facilitated by the tables of changes approach. RESULTS: Seven patients with COPD, two informal carers and nine healthcare professionals (from an existing outpatient PR service and HaH scheme) participated in the stakeholder feedback events. Four key themes were identified: 1) individualisation, 2) progression and transition, 3) continuity between services, and 4) communication between stakeholders. Two patients with COPD, one informal carer and three healthcare professionals participated in the first joint co-design group, with five healthcare professionals attending a second co-design group. These achieved a consensus on the integrated model of care. The agreed model comprised face-to-face supervised, individually tailored home-based exercise training one to three times a week, delivered during HaH scheme visits where possible by a healthcare professional competent to provide both home-based exercise training and usual HaH care. CONCLUSION: An integrated model of care has been co-designed by patients with COPD, informal carers and healthcare professionals to address low uptake and completion of PR following AECOPD. The co-designed model of care has now been integrated within a well-established HaH scheme.","Barker, Ruth E; Brighton, Lisa J; Maddocks, Matthew; Nolan, Claire M; Patel, Suhani; Walsh, Jessica A; Polgar, Oliver; Wenneberg, Jenni; Kon, Samantha S C; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A; Man, William D C; Farquhar, Morag",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907391/; https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s293048,144
651542,An Updated Investigation Prior To COVID-19 Vaccination Program In Indonesia: Full-Length Genome Mutation Analysis Of SARS-CoV-2,2021-01-27,"BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an idiopathic systemic vasculitis that predominantly damages coronary arteries in children. Various pathogens have been investigated as triggers for KD, but no definitive causative pathogen has been determined. As KD is diagnosed by symptoms, several days are needed for diagnosis. Therefore, at the time of diagnosis of KD, the pathogen of the trigger may already be diminished. The aim of this study was to explore comprehensive pathogens in the sera at the acute stage of KD using high-throughput sequencing (HTS). METHODS: Sera of 12 patients at an extremely early stage of KD and 12 controls were investigated. DNA and RNA sequences were read separately using HTS. Sequence data were imported into the home-brew meta-genomic analysis pipeline, PATHDET, to identify the pathogen sequences. RESULTS: No RNA virus reads were detected in any KD case except for that of equine infectious anemia, which is known as a contaminant of commercial reverse transcriptase. Concerning DNA viruses, human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B, two cases) and Anelloviridae (eight cases) were detected among KD cases as well as controls. Multiple bacterial reads were obtained from KD and controls. Bacteria of the genera Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Delfita, Roseomonas, and Rhodocyclaceae appeared to be more common in KD sera than in the controls. CONCLUSION: No single pathogen was identified in serum samples of patients at the acute phase of KD. With multiple bacteria detected in the serum samples, it is difficult to exclude the possibility of contamination; however, it is possible that these bacteria might stimulate the immune system and induce KD.","Torii, Yuka; Horiba, Kazuhiro; Hayano, Satoshi; Kato, Taichi; Suzuki, Takako; Kawada, Jun-ichi; Takahashi, Yoshiyuki; Kojima, Seiji; Okuno, Yusuke; Ogi, Tomoo; Ito, Yoshinori",BMC Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-02380-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33059644/,144

In order to achieve the goal of the study, several novel convergence tests were used, including the Kong et al. (J Econom 209:185–207, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2018.12.022) and Phillips and Sul (Econometrica 75:1771–1855, 2007. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2007.00811.x) approaches. Moreover, club convergence analysis was carried out in four different configurations, varying in the technique of trend component extraction from the data. In particular, three well-known methods of time series decomposition were used, i.e. the Hodrick–Prescott, Butterworth and Christiano–Fitzgerald filters, as well as the most recent boosted Hodrick–Prescott filter. The results indicated that rental prices across the studied cities do not share a common path in the long run. It is possible, however, to identify convergence clubs where rents are moving towards a club-specific steady state. Detailed analysis of the structure of estimated clusters showed that data filtering using the boosted Hodrick–Prescott method leads to the most reliable allocation of cities to convergence clubs. Moreover, the estimation of logit models revealed that the likelihood of any two cities belonging to the same convergence club depends mainly on similar levels in terms of the unemployment rate, housing stock, city area, and the number of students. Finally, recommendations for local and national policy-makers concerning the development of the rental market have been formulated, particularly in the areas of urban land-use planning policy, housing legislation and public–private partnerships.","Tomal, Mateusz",Empir Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121800/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181-021-02080-w,144

A large number of such assays have been developed and are now commercially available. However, there are limited studies evaluating the performance of these tests. We evaluated the performances of the following six commercially available serological assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: (i) Genscript cPass surrogate virus neutralization test (Genscript cPass), (ii) Diasorin-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG detection (Diasorin-S1/S2 IgG), (iii) Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG II (Alinity IgG II), (iv) Diasorin-SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG (Diasorin-TrimericS IgG), (v) Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2-cobas (Roche Elecsys), and (vi) AESKU enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (AESKULISA). The results of these tests were compared against the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Roche Elecsys had the highest sensitivity, and the Genscript cPass had the highest specificity. Diasorin-TrimericS IgG had the best overall performance with the highest agreement with the PRNT results. Parallel testing of Genscript cPass with Diasorin-TrimericS IgG and Diasorin-S1/S2 IgG had the optimum performance. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, lowering the cutoff from 30% to 20% in the Genscript cPass significantly increased the sensitivity and the overall agreement with the PRNT results. Commercially available serological assays are good alternatives to the standard PRNT. However, further studies on larger sample numbers are required for optimization of the assay cutoff values and for evaluation of cost effectiveness. IMPORTANCE Commercial serological assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now widely available. This study adds new knowledge regarding the optimization of these assays for evaluating postvaccination antibodies status. It highlights the positive and negative aspects of each assay in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, compared to the gold standard neutralization test. When using serological assays to assess postvaccine immune status, a balance of all parameters needs to be considered and not simply the high specificity. This balance is particularly relevant in the current situation where countries are aiming to mass vaccinate their populations and bring this pandemic under control. Assays with good sensitivity will have a lower percentage of false negatives and thus provide confidence for vaccination. Understanding the strengths and limitations of commercially available serological assays is important, not only for better application of these tests but also to understand the immune response and the duration of protection postvaccination.","Mahmoud, Sally A; Ganesan, Subhashini; Naik, Shivaraj; Bissar, Safaa; Zamel, Isra Al; Warren, K N; Zaher, Walid A; Khan, Gulfaraz",Microbiol Spectr,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00733-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34585943/,144

However, while the One Health approach gains increasing momentum, its practical application meets hindrances. This paper investigates the environmental pillar of the One Health approach, using two case studies to highlight the integration of environmental considerations. The first case study pertains to the Danish monitoring and surveillance programme for antimicrobial resistance, DANMAP. The second case illustrates the occurrence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in milk in dairy-producing ruminants in Italian regions. Method: A scientific literature search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science to locate articles informing the two cases. Grey literature was gathered to describe the cases as well as their contexts. Results: 19 articles and 10 reports were reviewed and informed the two cases. The cases show how the environmental component influences the apparent impacts for human and animal health. The DANMAP highlights the two approaches One Health and farm to fork. The literature provides information on the comprehensiveness of the DANMAP, but highlights some shortcomings in terms of environmental considerations. The AFM1 case, the milk metabolite of the carcinogenic mycotoxin aflatoxin B1, shows that dairy products are heavily impacted by changes of the climate as well as by economic drivers. Conclusions: The two cases show that environmental conditions directly influence the onset and diffusion of hazardous factors. Climate change, treatment of soils, water and standards in slaughterhouses as well as farms can have a great impact on the health of animals, humans and the environment. Hence, it is important to include environmental considerations, for example, via engaging environmental experts and sharing data.

Of the three major ORFs identified, two were found to encode the major and minor coronavirus membrane proteins M and sM. A potentially single ORF, designated ORF3 according to the pattern of the viral subgenomic mRNAs, could be identified between the S and sM genes. A striking variability, essentially generated by short deletions clustered in a few loci, was observed in the ORF3 of both isolates. The largest predicted polypeptide of 223 amino acids showed homology with polypeptides potentially encoded by other members of the same genetic subset, including two shorter polypeptides of human respiratory virus HCV 229E and one of transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV. This homology suggests that the two HCV ORFs may have originated from a single precursor. The function of these polypeptides is not known, but the predicted products of the PEDV ORF3 and related ORFs share features suggestive of a membrane-associated protein.","Duarte, Mariela; Tobler, Kurt; Bridgen, Anne; Rasschaert, Denis; Ackermann, Mathias; Laude, Hubert",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8291230/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682284710580; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682284710580,144

Rapid detection and differentiation of S-OIV from seasonal influenza is crucial for patient management and control of the epidemics. A one-step, single-tube accelerated and quantitative S-OIV-specific H1 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RTLAMP) assay for clinical diagnosis of S-OIV by targeting the H1 gene is reported in this article. A comparative evaluation of the H1-specific RTLAMP assay vis-à-vis the World Health Organization-approved real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), involving 239 acute-phase throat swab samples, demonstrated exceptionally higher sensitivity by picking up all of the 116 H1N1-positive cases and 36 additional positive cases among the negatives that were sequence-confirmed as S-OIV H1N1. None of the real-time RTPCR-positive samples were missed by the RTLAMP system. The comparative analysis revealed that S-OIV RTLAMP was up to tenfold more sensitive than the World Health Organization real-time RTPCR; it had a detection limit of 0.1 tissue culture infectious dosage of (50)/ml. One of the most attractive features of this isothermal gene amplification assay is that it seems to have an advantage in monitoring gene amplification by means of SYBR Green I dye-mediated naked-eye visualization within 30 minutes compared to 2 to 3 hours for a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. This suggests that the RTLAMP assay is a valuable tool for rapid, real-time detection and quantification of S-OIV in acute-phase throat swab samples without requiring sophisticated equipment.","Parida, Manmohan; Shukla, Jyoti; Sharma, Shashi; Ranghia Santhosh, Sanna; Ravi, Vasanthapuram; Mani, Reeta; Thomas, Maria; Khare, Shashi; Rai, Arvind; Kant Ratho, Radha; Pujari, Sujit; Mishra, Bijayanti; Lakshmana Rao, Putcha Venkata; Vijayaraghavan, Rajagopalan",The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525157810000176; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2010.11.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525157810000176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21227400/,144

657253,Human metapneumovirus as a causative agent of acute bronchiolitis in infants,2004-05-06,"Cost-effective and sensitive aptasensor with guanine chemiluminescence detection capable of simply quantifying thrombin in human serum was developed using thrombin aptamer (TBA), one of the G-quadruplex DNA aptamers, without expensive nanoparticles and complicated procedures. Guanines of G-quadruplex TBA-conjugated carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) bound with thrombin do not react with 3,4,5-trimethoxylphenylglyoxal (TMPG) in the presence of tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide (TPA), whereas guanines of free TBA- and TBA-conjugated 6-FAM immobilized on the surface of graphene oxide rapidly react with TMPG to emit light. Thus, guanine chemiluminescence in 5% human serum with thrombin was lower than that without thrombin when TBA-conjugated 6-FAM was added in two samples and incubated for 20 min. In other words, the brightness of guanine chemiluminescence was quenched due to the formation of G-quadruplex TBA-conjugated 6-FAM bound with thrombin in a sample. High-energy intermediate, capable of emitting dim light by itself, formed from the reaction between guanines of TBA and TMPG in the presence of TPA, transfers energy to 6-FAM to emit bright light based on the principle of chemiluminescence energy transfer (CRET). G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor devised using the rapid interaction between TBA-conjugated 6-FAM and thrombin quantified trace levels of thrombin without complicated procedures. The limit of detection (LOD=background+3×standard deviation) of G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor with good linear calibration curve, accuracy, precision, and recovery was as low as 12.3 nM in 5% human serum. Using the technology reported in this research, we expect that various types of G-quadruplex DNA aptasensors capable of specifically sensing a target molecule such as ATP, HIV, ochratoxin, potassium ions, and thrombin can be developed.","Cho, Sandy; Park, Lucienne; Chong, Richard; Kim, Young Teck; Lee, Ji Hoon",Biosens Bioelectron,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24080210/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.09.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566313006350; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566313006350,144
657822,Application of Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing in the Diagnosis of Pulmonary Infectious Pathogens From Bronchoalveolar Lavage Samples,2021-03-11,"Abstract Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi is a well-known medicinal plant native of South America. This species has demonstrated important biological activities such as antihypertensive and vasodilator, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. However, no studies have been, so far, reported with the fruits of S. terebinthifolius as a protector of the placenta against Zika virus infection and as sunscreen agents. The present study aimed to investigate new uses for the ethanolic fruit extracts of S. terebinthifolius, from fruits’peel (STPE) and from the whole fruits (STWFE). Zika virus (ZIKV) has been linked to several fetal malformations, such as microcephaly and other central nervous system abnormalities. Thus, the potential of these natural extracts against ZIKV infection was evaluated, using an in vitro method. The photoprotective potential, determined by spectrometry, along with phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and chemical composition of both extracts were also evaluated. The chemical composition of the extracts was evaluated by HPLC-UV / vis. The cytotoxicity of peel and whole fruit extracts in vero E6 cell lines, in placental cell lines and placental explant cultures were evaluated by the MTT assay. The infectivity of placental cells and explants was evaluated by qRT-PCR and the effects of extracts on ZIKV infection were investigated using HTR-8/SVneo cells, pre-treated with 100 μg mL-1 of STWFE for 1 h, and infected with MR766 (AD) or PE243 (EH) ZIKV strains. STFE and STWFE were well-tolerated by both placental-derived trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo as well as by term placental chorionic villi explants, which indicate absence of cytotoxicity in all analysed concentrations. Two strains of ZIKV were tested to access if pre-treatment of trophoblast cells with the STWFE would protect them against infection. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that STWFE extract greatly reduced ZIKV infection. The extracts were also photoprotective with SPF values equivalent to the standard, benzophenone-3. The formulations prepared in different concentrations of the extracts (5-10%) had shown maximum SPF values of 32.21. STWFE represents a potential natural mixture to be used in pregnancy in order to restrain placental infection by ZIKV and might potentially protect fetus against ZIKV-related malformations. The extracts exhibited photoprotective activity and some of the phenolic compounds, mainly resveratrol, catechin and epicatechin, are active ingredients in all assayed activities. The development of biotechnological/medical products, giving extra value to products from family farming, is expected, with strong prospects for success.","dos Santos Oliveira, Mônika Bezerra; Valentim, Iara Barros; dos Santos Rocha, Tauane; Santos, Jaqueline Correia; Nobre Pires, Keyla Silva; Lira Tanabe, Eloiza Lopes; Cruz Borbely, Karen Steponavicius; Borbely, Alexandre Urban; Fonseca Goulart, Marília Oliveira",Ind Crops Prod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346222/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112503; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926669020304192; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669020304192?v=s5,144
658955,Viruses and asthma: the role of common respiratory viruses in asthma and its potential meaning for SARS‐CoV‐2,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a worldwide epidemic, and various countries have responded with different containment measures to reduce disease transmission, including stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns. Comparative studies have not yet been conducted to investigate the impact of these containment measures; these studies are needed to facilitate public health policy-making across countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the impact of national containment measures and policies (stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns) on decelerating the increase in daily new cases of COVID-19 in 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the pandemic in different jurisdictions worldwide. METHODS: We reviewed the effective dates of the national containment measures (stay-at-home order, curfew, or lockdown) of 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic (Wuhan, New York State, Lombardy, and Madrid), and we searched cumulative numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and daily new cases provided by health authorities. Data were drawn from an open, crowdsourced, daily-updated COVID-19 data set provided by Our World in Data. We examined the trends in the percent increase in daily new cases from 7 days before to 30 days after the dates on which containment measures went into effect by continent, World Bank income classification, type of containment measures, effective date of containment measures, and number of confirmed cases on the effective date of the containment measures. RESULTS: We included 122,366 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 54 countries and 24,071 patients from 4 epicenters on the effective dates on which stay-at-home orders, curfews, or lockdowns were implemented between January 23 and April 11, 2020. Stay-at-home, curfew, and lockdown measures commonly commenced in countries with approximately 30%, 20%, or 10% increases in daily new cases. All three measures were found to lower the percent increase in daily new cases to <5 within one month. Among the countries studied, 20% had an average percent increase in daily new cases of 30-49 over the seven days prior to the commencement of containment measures; the percent increase in daily new cases in these countries was curbed to 10 and 5 a maximum of 15 days and 23 days after the implementation of containment measures, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Different national containment measures were associated with a decrease in daily new cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection. Stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns curbed the percent increase in daily new cases to <5 within a month. Resurgence in cases within one month was observed in some South American countries.","Wong, Carlos K H; Wong, Janet Y H; Tang, Eric H M; Au, Chi Ho; Lau, Kristy T K; Wai, Abraham K C",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/19904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32658858/,144

659681,Skepticism and defiance: Assessing credibility and representations of science,2021-09-01,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may result in severe complications, multiorgan dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, and death. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and places healthcare workers at significant risk, especially during aerosol-generating procedures, including airway management. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review outlines the underlying respiratory pathophysiology of patients with COVID-19 and discusses approaches to airway management in the emergency department (ED) based on current literature. DISCUSSION: Patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection are at high risk for acute respiratory failure requiring airway management. Among hospitalized patients, 10–20% require intensive care unit admission, and 3–10% require intubation and mechanical ventilation. While providing respiratory support for these patients, proper infection control measures, including adherence to personal protective equipment policies, are necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers. A structured approach to respiratory failure in these patients includes the use of exogenous oxygen via nasal cannula or non-rebreather, as well as titrated high-flow nasal cannula and non-invasive ventilation. This review offers several guiding principles and resources designed to be adapted in conjunction with local workplace policies for patients requiring endotracheal intubation. CONCLUSIONS: While the fundamental principles of acute respiratory failure management are similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, there are some notable differences, including a focus on provider safety. This review provides an approach to airway management and respiratory support in the patient with COVID-19.","Montrief, Tim; Ramzy, Mark; Long, Brit; Gottlieb, Michael; Hercz, Dan",Am J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.08.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720306823; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720306823?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046288/,144

Understanding the extent of pre-existing immunity induced by seropositivity to endemic seasonal coronaviruses and the impact of cross-reactivity on COVID-19 disease progression remains a key research question in immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and the immunopathology of COVID-2019 disease. This paper describes a panel of lentiviral pseudotypes bearing the spike (S) proteins for each of the seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs), generated under similar conditions optimized for high titre production allowing a high-throughput investigation of antibody neutralization breadth. Optimal production conditions and most readily available permissive target cell lines were determined for spike-mediated entry by each HCoV pseudotype: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 best transduced HEK293T/17 cells transfected with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV preferentially entered HUH7 cells, and CHO cells were most permissive for the seasonal betacoronavirus HCoV-HKU1. Entry of ACE2 using pseudotypes was enhanced by ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in target cells, whilst TMPRSS2 transfection rendered HEK293T/17 cells permissive for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 entry. Additionally, pseudotype viruses were produced bearing additional coronavirus surface proteins, including the SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) and Membrane (M) proteins and HCoV-OC43/HCoV-HKU1 Haemagglutinin-Esterase (HE) proteins. This panel of lentiviral pseudotypes provides a safe, rapidly quantifiable and high-throughput tool for serological comparison of pan-coronavirus neutralizing responses; this can be used to elucidate antibody dynamics against individual coronaviruses and the effects of antibody cross-reactivity on clinical outcome following natural infection or vaccination.","Sampson, Alexander Thomas; Heeney, Jonathan; Cantoni, Diego; Ferrari, Matteo; Sans, Maria Suau; George, Charlotte; Di Genova, Cecilia; Mayora Neto, Martin; Einhauser, Sebastian; Asbach, Benedikt; Wagner, Ralf; Baxendale, Helen; Temperton, Nigel; Carnell, George",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452443/,144

Measures adopted by FPs across the country in the fight against the scourge include triaging patients as they present to the family medicine clinics; health education and enlightenment of the populace; and ensuring social distancing, regular handwashing and compulsory use of face mask by both physicians and patients during clinical consultations. Other measures include incorporating family-focused behavioural interventions in their practice, home-based care to reduce the number of persons visiting the hospital, telemedicine and Hospice and palliative care services to the elderly and terminally ill.

With the ongoing health concerns related to COVID-19, there is an increased need for social workers who can competently deliver evidence-based interventions, such as SBIRT, via telehealth. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional SBIRT training approaches using face-to-face (FTF) instruction and FTF simulated practice may not be a safe or feasible way to develop students’ SBIRT- related skills. This study explores 35 social work graduate students’ experiences of learning SBIRT skills in a remote learning format and subsequently delivering a SBIRT intervention to a live “client” via a peer-to-peer simulated telehealth session. Overall, students reported that the shift from FTF to remote learning made learning SBIRT skills difficult, and that providing brief intervention and referral was the most difficult step of the simulated SBIRT telehealth intervention. Qualitative feedback indicates that overall, students found the simulated telehealth sessions a valuable learning experience, but also reported that richer educational experiences would have resulted from additional practice opportunities and real time feedback.

In this work, we will focus on connecting several sensors to work together as a system that can discover people infected with the Coronavirus remotely, this will reduce the spread of the disease. The proposed system consists of several devices called smart medical sensors such as: pulse, thermal monitoring, and blood sensors. The system is working sequentially starting by pulse sensor and end by blood sensor including an algorithm to manage the data given from sensors. The pulse sensor is devoted to acquire a high quality data using a smartphone equipped by a mobile dermatoscope with 20× magnification. The processing is used RGB color system to perform moving window to segment regions of interest (ROIs) as inputs of the heart rate estimation algorithm. The heart rate (HR) estimation is then given by computing the dominant frequency by identifying the most prominent peak of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) technique. The thermal monitoring is used for fever detection using a smart camera that can provide an optimum solution for fever detection. The infrared sensor can quickly measure surface temperature without making any contact with a person’s skin. A blood sensor is used to measure percentages of white, red blood (WBCs, RBCs) volume and platelets non-invasively using the bioimpedance analysis and independent component analysis (ICA). The proposed sensor consists of two electrodes which can be used to send the current to the earlobe and measure the produced voltage. A mathematical model was modified to describe the impedance of earlobe in different frequencies (i.e., low, medium, and high). The COMSOL model is used to simulate blood electrical properties and frequencies to measure WBCs, RBCs and Platelets volume. These devices are collected to work automatically without user interaction for remote checking the coronavirus patients.

665297,Geographic components of SARS-CoV-2 expansion: a hypothesis,2020-08-01,"INTRODUCTION: Recently, based on data from the PREDICT study, the European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure (EF‐CLIF) consortium proposed pathophysiological/prognostic groups in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis: stable decompensated cirrhosis (SDC), unstable decompensated cirrhosis (UDC), pre‐acute‐on‐chronic liver failure (pre‐ACLF), and ACLF. We evaluated the outcomes of these subgroups in a real‐life cohort of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: Patients with cirrhosis developing first AD between 09/2010 and 12/2017 at the Vienna General Hospital were evaluated for this retrospective analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred and ten patients with cirrhosis (aged 57.6 ± 11.8 years) including n = 45 (21.4%) SDC, n = 100 (47.6%) UDC, n = 28 (13.3%) pre‐ACLF, and n = 37 (17.6%) with ACLF were considered. The proposed AD subgroups discriminated between patients with favorable (1‐year mortality: SDC: 6.7% and UDC: 19.6%) and dismal prognosis (90‐day mortality: pre‐ACLF: 42.9%). Interestingly, systemic inflammation gradually increased (e.g., C‐reactive protein, SDC: 0.9 mg/dl, vs. UDC: 2.0 mg/dl vs. pre‐ACLF: 3.2 mg/dl, p < 0.001) while renal function was progressively deteriorating (creatinine levels, SDC: 0.8 mg/dl vs. UDC: 0.9 mg/dl vs. pre‐ACLF: 1.2 mg/dl, p < 0.001) across prognostic subgroups in patients with cirrhosis. DISCUSSION: The recently proposed pathophysiological/prognostic EF‐CLIF subgroups are also reproduceable in a real‐life cohort of cirrhotic patients. As ACLF is a common and important complication, patients at risk of pre‐ACLF at index AD should be evaluated and if disease proceeds, been treated early and aggressively to avoid excessive mortality.","Balcar, Lorenz; Semmler, Georg; Pomej, Katharina; Simbrunner, Benedikt; Bauer, David; Hartl, Lukas; Jachs, Mathias; Paternostro, Rafael; Bucsics, Theresa; Pinter, Matthias; Trauner, Michael; Mandorfer, Mattias; Reiberger, Thomas; Scheiner, Bernhard",United European Gastroenterol J,https://doi.org/10.1002/ueg2.12089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34050619/,144

666231,Subversion of host stress granules by coronaviruses: Potential roles of π‐rich disordered domains of viral nucleocapsids,2020-06-19,"The initiation and management of anticoagulation is a fundamental practice for a wide variety of indications in cardiovascular critical care, including the management of patients with acute MI, stroke prevention in patients with AF or mechanical valves, as well as the prevention of device thrombosis and thromboembolic events with the use of mechanical circulatory support and ventricular assist devices. The frequent use of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy, in addition to the presence of concomitant conditions that may lead to a propensity to bleed, such as renal and liver dysfunction, present unique challenges. The use of viscoelastic haemostatic assays provides an additional tool allowing clinicians to strike a delicate balance of attaining adequate anticoagulation while minimising the risk of bleeding complications. In this review, the authors discuss the role that viscoelastic haemostatic assay plays in cardiac populations (including cardiac surgery, heart transplantation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, acute coronary syndrome and left ventricular assist devices), and identify areas in need of further study.","Rali, Aniket S; Salem, Ahmed M; Gebre, Melat; Garies, Taylor M; Taduru, Siva; Bracey, Arthur W",Card Fail Rev,https://doi.org/10.15420/cfr.2020.22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708416/,144

We estimate the sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational-wave signals for the third (O3), fourth (O4) and fifth observing (O5) runs, including the planned upgrades of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We study the capability of the network to determine the sky location of the source for gravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of binary systems of compact objects, that is binary neutron star, neutron star–black hole, and binary black hole systems. The ability to localize the sources is given as a sky-area probability, luminosity distance, and comoving volume. The median sky localization area (90% credible region) is expected to be a few hundreds of square degrees for all types of binary systems during O3 with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo (HLV) network. The median sky localization area will improve to a few tens of square degrees during O4 with the Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (HLVK) network. During O3, the median localization volume (90% credible region) is expected to be on the order of [Formula: see text] for binary neutron star, neutron star–black hole, and binary black hole systems, respectively. The localization volume in O4 is expected to be about a factor two smaller than in O3. We predict a detection count of [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] ) for binary neutron star mergers, of [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] ) for neutron star–black hole mergers, and [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] ) for binary black hole mergers in a one-calendar-year observing run of the HLV network during O3 (HLVK network during O4). We evaluate sensitivity and localization expectations for unmodeled signal searches, including the search for intermediate mass black hole binary mergers.","Abbott, B. P.; Abbott, R.; Abbott, T.

666723,How severe RNA virus infections such as SARS-CoV-2 disrupt tissue and organ barriers—Reconstitution by mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes,2021-06-25,"Coronaviruses are animal and human pathogens that can cause lethal zoonotic infections like SARS and MERS. They have polycistronic plus-stranded RNA genomes and belong to the order Nidovirales, a diverse group of viruses for which common ancestry was inferred from the common principles underlying their genome organization and expression, and from the conservation of an array of core replicase domains, including key RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Coronavirus genomes (~ 26–32 kilobases) are the largest RNA genomes known to date and their expansion was likely enabled by acquiring enzyme functions that counter the commonly high error frequency of viral RNA polymerases. The primary functions that direct coronavirus RNA synthesis and processing reside in nonstructural protein (nsp) 7 to nsp16, which are cleavage products of two large replicase polyproteins translated from the coronavirus genome. Significant progress has now been made regarding their structural and functional characterization, stimulated by technical advances like improved methods for bioinformatics and structural biology, in vitro enzyme characterization, and site-directed mutagenesis of coronavirus genomes. Coronavirus replicase functions include more or less universal activities of plus-stranded RNA viruses, like an RNA polymerase (nsp12) and helicase (nsp13), but also a number of rare or even unique domains involved in mRNA capping (nsp14, nsp16) and fidelity control (nsp14). Several smaller subunits (nsp7–nsp10) act as crucial cofactors of these enzymes and contribute to the emerging “nsp interactome.” Understanding the structure, function, and interactions of the RNA-synthesizing machinery of coronaviruses will be key to rationalizing their evolutionary success and the development of improved control strategies.","Snijder, E.J.; Decroly, E.; Ziebuhr, J.",Adv Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352716300471; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352716300471; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2016.08.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27712628/,144

This study aims to investigate whether there are significant differences between socio‐demographic variables and household and family activities before and during the partial lockdown in Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. A descriptive cross‐sectional method was used in this study. Online surveys were distributed via WhatsApp to a convenience non‐probability sample of 728 participants. The survey contained socio‐demographic information and a 22‐item questionnaire of activities that participants practiced before and during the partial lockdown. An IBM SPSS (25.0) package was utilised to analyse the data. The study found that males and homemakers reported obvious changes for both house and family activities before and during the lockdown. Participants between 40 and 49 years old reported higher scores for family activities before the lockdown. Married participants reported higher scores for house and family activities during the lockdown. The outcomes of this study demonstrate that under certain circumstances in society, cultural gender activities may change due to various reasons such as health precaution regulations, prevention policies, and social isolation.","Al‐Kazi, Lubna Ahmed; Al‐Sejari, Maha Meshari; Al‐Ma'seb, Hend Batel",Int Soc Sci J,https://doi.org/10.1111/issj.12283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548688/,144

CASE PRESENTATION: We present a preterm Iranian infant born to a Persian mother with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The mother underwent cesarean delivery, and amniotic fluid yielded a positive result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The newborn infant showed early-onset infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed on pharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR assay within 24 hours after birth, suggesting vertical transmission. Unfortunately, the mother died 14 days after delivery. We describe the clinical course and outcome of the infant up to 7 months of age. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in pregnant women may increase maternal morbidity, mortality and possibly vertical transmission in severe cases. However, it does not seem to progress to serious early or late neonatal complications.","Farhadi, Roya; Mehrpisheh, Shahrokh; Ghaffari, Vajiheh; Haghshenas, Mohammadreza; Ebadi, Aghdas",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33892788/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-021-02835-0,144
668781,Protecting clinical trials in cystic fibrosis during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: risks and mitigation measures,2021-08-28,"BACKGROUND: Development and dissemination of public health (PH) guidance to healthcare organizations and the general public (e.g., businesses, schools, individuals) during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic is vital for policy, clinical, and public decision-making. Yet, the rapidly evolving nature of these events poses significant challenges for guidance development and dissemination strategies predicated on well-understood concepts and clearly defined access and distribution pathways. Taxonomies are an important but underutilized tool for guidance authoring, dissemination and updating in such dynamic scenarios. OBJECTIVE: To design a rapid, semi-automated method for sampling and developing a PH guidance taxonomy using widely available Web crawling tools and streamlined manual content analysis. METHODS: Iterative samples of guidance documents were taken from four state PH agency websites, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization. Documents were used to derive and refine a preliminary taxonomy of COVID-19 PH guidance via content analysis. RESULTS: Eight iterations of guidance document sampling and taxonomy revisions were performed, with a final corpus of 226 documents. The preliminary taxonomy contains 110 branches distributed between three major domains: stakeholders (24 branches), settings (25 branches) and topics (61 branches). Thematic saturation measures indicated rapid saturation (≤5% change) for the domains of “stakeholders” and “settings”, and “topic”-related branches for clinical decision-making. Branches related to business reopening and economic consequences remained dynamic throughout sampling iterations. CONCLUSION: The PH guidance taxonomy can support public health agencies by aligning guidance development with curation and indexing strategies; supporting targeted dissemination; increasing the speed of updates; and enhancing public-facing guidance repositories and information retrieval tools. Taxonomies are essential to support knowledge management activities during rapidly evolving scenarios such as disease outbreaks and natural disasters.","Taber, Peter; Staes, Catherine J.; Phengphoo, Saifon; Rocha, Elisa; Lam, Adria; Del Fiol, Guilherme; Maviglia, Saverio M.; Rocha, Roberto A.",J Biomed Inform,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192573/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046421001817; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421001817?v=s5,144

Our original paper prepared in March 2020 analyzed the outbreaks of COVID-19 in the US and its selected states to identify the rise, peak, and decrease of cases within a given geographic population, as well as a rough calculation of accumulated total cases in this population from the beginning to the end of June 2020. The current report will describe how well the later actual trend from March to June fit our model and prediction. Similar analyses are also conducted to include countries other than the US. From such a wide global data analysis, our results demonstrated that different US states and countries showed dramatically different patterns of pandemic trend.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the most important predictors of hospital discharge and mortality from measurements at admission for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Electronic records from hospitalized patients. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted between March 3(rd) and August 24(th) with COVID-19 in Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals. EXPOSURES: 216 phenotypic variables collected within 48 hours of admission. MAIN OUTCOMES: We used age-stratified (<60 and >=60 years) random survival forests with competing risks to identify the most important predictors of death and discharge. Fine-Gray competing risk regression (FGR) models were then constructed based on the most important RSF-derived covariates. RESULTS: Of 2212 patients, 1913 were discharged (age 57±19, time-to-discharge 9±11 days) while 279 died (age 75±14, time to death 14±15 days). Patients >= 60 years were nearly 10 times as likely to die within 60 days of admission as those <60. As the pandemic evolved, the rate of hospital discharge increased in both older and younger patients. Incident death and hospital discharge were accurately predicted by measures of respiratory distress, inflammation, infection, renal function, red cell turn over and cardiac stress. FGR models for each of hospital discharge and mortality as outcomes based on these variables performed well in the older (AUC 0·80–0·85 at 60-days) and younger populations (AUC >0·90 at 60-days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identified markers collected within 2 days of admission that predict hospital discharge and mortality in COVID-19 patients and provide prediction models that may be used to guide patient care. Our proposed model suggests that hospital discharge and mortality can be forecasted with high accuracy based on 8–10 variables at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also point to several specific pathways that could be the focus of future investigations directed at reducing mortality and expediting hospital discharge among COVID-19 patients. Probability of hospital discharge increased over the course of the pandemic.","Ambale-Venkatesh, Bharath; Quinaglia, Thiago; Shabani, Mahsima; Sesso, Jaclyn; Kapoor, Karan; Matheson, Matthew B; Wu, Colin O; Cox, Christopher; Lima, Joao A C",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251758v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619510/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.21251758,144

The loading behavior include variations of filtration efficiency and pressure drop and distribution of deposited aerosols in the filters all having the same fiber basis weight (3.060 gsm). Through the filtration efficiency variations of uncharged/charged, single-/multi-layer filters with aerosol loading, it was observed that mechanical PVDF filters had continuously increasing filtration efficiency, while PVDF electret filters had initially decreasing and subsequently increasing filtration efficiency until reaching 100% due to diminishing electrostatic effect and enhancing mechanical effect. By combining the pressure drop evolution of different filters during aerosol loading and detailed SEM images of the loaded filters, we have demonstrated that multilayer PVDF filters, especially the electret ones, could significantly slow down the pace of filter clogging (skin effect) and increase significantly the aerosol holding capacity during depth filtration. Generally, the multilayer nanofiber filters received the most aerosol deposit during depth filtration, whereas the single-layer nanofiber filters with the same basis weight of fibers received the most deposit during cake filtration. The multilayer nanofiber filters had approximately 70% aerosol deposit in the filter during depth filtration fully utilizing the full filter thickness, especially for the electret filters that had charged fibers, and only 30% deposit in the cake. On the contrary, the single-layer uncharged/charged nanofiber filters were exactly the reverse due to persistency of the skin effect with only 30% deposit in the filter mostly located in the upstream layer, yet 70% deposit in the cake. During depth filtration, the pressure drop per added mass deposit for the multilayer electret filter was very low at 11 Pa gsm(−1), which was at least twice below any other nanofiber filters. This was all attributed to the uniform capture of aerosols by electrostatic effect across the entire filter depth from the upstream to downstream layers of the multilayer electret filter. The above conclusion was confirmed by the detailed SEM images taken across the different filter layers for the multilayer filter configuration. The 4-layer electret nanofiber filter with a 3.060-gsm basis weight has 4 times more aerosol holding capacity than the single uncharged/charged nanofiber filter with the same fiber basis weight in depth filtration. Based on the standpoint of highest efficiency and capacity with maximum pressure drop 800 Pa imposed on the filtration operation, the 4-layer nanofiber electret was the best among all 4 filters. It had 52% more aerosol holding capacity than the single layer uncharged nanofiber filter and 38% more capacity than the charged single-layer and the uncharged multilayer nanofiber filters. The multilayer PVDF electret filters have excellent filtration performance for long-term aerosol filtration and also great potential applications in the fields of personal health care and environmental protection.","Sun, Qiangqiang; Leung, Wallace Woon-Fong",Sep Purif Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288610/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116606; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383586619359994; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1383586619359994,144

The H1N1 flu vaccine experience provides lessons learned to address and prevent racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccinations. We aim to identify racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in H1N1 vaccinations among Medicaid enrollees to inform equitable COVID-19 vaccination policies and strategies. METHODS: The study population included people under 65 who were continuously enrolled in Medicaid in 2009 and 2010 from 28 states and the District of Columbia. H1N1 vaccinations were identified from Medicaid outpatient claims. Vaccination rates were calculated for the overall sample and subpopulations by race/ethnicity and state. RESULTS: 3,708,894 (12.3%) Medicaid enrollees in the sample were vaccinated for H1N1 in 2009–2010. Race-specific vaccination rates ranged from 8.1% in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) to 19.8% in Asian/Pacific Islander Medicaid enrollees. NHB enrollees had lower vaccination rates than non-Hispanic White (NHW) enrollees in all states, with the exceptions of Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, and Washington. The largest disparity between NHB and NHW was in Pennsylvania (1.0% vs. 7.0%), while the largest absolute difference between NHB and NHW enrollees was in Georgia (17.4% vs. 30.7%).

And to offer fundamental materials for making improvements in current surveillance system was our purpose. METHODS: A study was conducted by reviewing the number of cases reported as acute diarrheal syndrome (mass type) from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention between June, 2002 and July, 2008. And the data were compared with the number of mass food poisoning cases during the same period, reported from the Korea Food and Drug Administration. The difference between two groups was measured and their transitions were compared. RESULTS: The emergency department syndromic surveillance system's reports of the numbers of acute diarrheal syndrome (mass type) cases were different from the transition of mass food poisonings, reported by the Korea Food and Drug Administration. Their reports were not accurate and they could not follow the trends of increase in mass food poisonings since 2002. CONCLUSIONS: Current problems in the emergency department syndromic surveillance system in Korea are mostly related to inaccuracies of daily data reporting system. Manual data input by the reporters could play a big role in such inaccuracies. There need to be improvements in the ways of reporting data, such as automated information transport system linking electronic medical record.","Ahn, Shin; Lee, Jae Ho; Kim, Won; Lim, Kyung Soo",Healthc Inform Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21818437/; https://doi.org/10.4258/hir.2010.16.3.177,144
672700,Respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinoviruses are the major causes of severe lower respiratory tract infections in Kuwait,2010-06-22,"Abstract The current COVID-19 pandemic started several months ago and is still exponentially growing in most parts of the world – this is the most recent and alarming update. COVID-19 requires the collaboration of nearly 200 countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while gaining time to explore and improve treatment options especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and immunocompromised patients, who appear to be at high-risk to die from cardiopulmonary failure. Currently unanswered questions are why elderly people, particularly those with pre-existing comorbidities seem to exhibit higher mortality rates after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether intensive care becomes indispensable for these patients to prevent multi-organ failure and sudden death. To face these challenges, we here summarize the molecular insights into viral infection mechanisms and implications for cardiovascular disease. Since the infection starts in the upper respiratory system, first flu-like symptoms develop that spread throughout the body. The wide range of affected organs is presumably based on the common expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry-receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Physiologically, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II, the master regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), thereby converting it into vasodilatory molecules, which have well-documented cardio-protective effects. Thus, RAAS inhibitors, which may increase the expression levels of ACE2, are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and CVD. This, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2 for cell-entry, have spurred controversial discussions on the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients.

Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for ICU and mortality. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose, MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation or death within 28 days (composite primary endpoint) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. RESULTS: Findings are reported as MP (n=83) vs. control (n=90). The composite primary endpoint was met by 19 vs. 40 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.72]. Transfer to ICU and need for invasive MV was necessary in 15 vs. 27 (p=0.07) and 14 vs. 26 (p=0.10), respectively. By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs. 21, adjusted HR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.12-0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0 ± 9.0 vs. 17.5 ± 12.8; p=0.001). Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO(2):FiO(2) and CRP levels. The complication rate was similar for the two groups (p=0.84). CONCLUSION: In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71%) and decreased ventilator dependence. Treatment was safe and did not impact viral clearance. A large RCT (RECOVERY trial) has been performed that validates these findings.

The arrival of these vaccines has created hope for people with Parkinson’s disease (PD), as this can help to mitigate their risk of becoming infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can lead to serious, life-threatening disease, at least among those with more advanced PD. However, both persons with PD and physicians looking after these individuals have expressed concerns about the vaccine’s efficacy and safety in the specific context of PD and its symptomatic treatment. Here, we discuss our perspective on these concerns, based on our interpretation of the literature plus the unfolding experience with widespread vaccination in the population at large. Because the benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccines do not appear to be different than in the general population, we recommend COVID-19 vaccination with approved vaccines to persons with PD, unless there is a specific contraindication. Some caution seems warranted in very frail and terminally ill elderly persons with PD living in long-term care facilities.","Bloem, Bastiaan R.; Trenkwalder, Claudia; Sanchez-Ferro, Alvaro; Kalia, Lorraine V.; Alcalay, Roy; Chiang, Han-Lin; Kang, Un Jung; Goetz, Christopher; Brundin, Patrik; Papa, Stella M.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33523021/; https://doi.org/10.3233/jpd-212573,144
674867,More targeted use of oseltamivir and in-hospital isolation facilities after implementation of a multifaceted strategy including a rapid molecular diagnostic panel for respiratory viruses in immunocompromised adult patients,2019-04-07,"In the presence of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and other new viral agents, one of the fundamental problems in science is the evaluation of environmental and social weaknesses of cities/regions to the exposure of infectious diseases for preventing and/or containing new COVID-19 outbreaks and the diffusion of other viral agents that generate a negative impact on public health and economy of countries. The current monitoring of transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is mainly based on reproduction number (R(0)) and fatality rates. However, this approach is a real-time monitoring of transmission dynamics for mitigating the numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths. Reproduction number does not provide information to cope with future epidemics or pandemics. The main goal of this study is to propose the Index c (as contagions) that quantifies, ex-ante, the environmental risk of exposure of cities/regions to future epidemics of the COVID-19 and similar vital agents. This Index c synthetizes environmental, demographic, climatological and health risk factors of cities/regions that indicate their exposure to infectious diseases. Index c has a range from 1 (environmental and social weakness of urban areas leading to high levels of exposure to infectious diseases) to 0 (environment that reduces the risk of exposure to infectious diseases in society). The statistical evidence here, applied on case study of Italy, seems in general to support the predictive capacity of the Index c as a particularly simple but superior indicator in detecting the global correlation between potential risk of exposure of cities/regions to infectious diseases and actual risk given by infected individuals and deaths of the COVID-19. The Index c can support a proactive environmental strategy to help policymakers to prevent future pandemics similar to the COVID-19.","Coccia, Mario",Environ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32871151/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110155; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120310525; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120310525,144
675077,Early expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells inhibits SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response and may predict fatal COVID-19 outcome,2020-10-27,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Kidneys are among the affected organs in COVID-19 and there may be different etiologies resulting in acute kidney injury (AKI) in different stages of the disease. There have been previous studies focusing on incidence and mortality of AKI in COVID-19 but none has made in depth analysis in relation to the background pathophysiology. Based on previous observations, we hypothesized that all AKIs seen in COVID-19 are not uniform and we aimed to analyze the etiologies and prognosis of AKI among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to the time of AKI during different phases of the disease. METHOD: A total of 1056 patients were admitted to the designated COVID-19 clinics from March to July in 2020. 77 Patients who were younger than 18 years old and 7 kidney transplant patients were excluded from the study. 427 of the remaining patients were confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.). As eGFR below 60 mL/min/1,73 m(2) was already shown to be related to mortality, these patients (44) were also excluded. As immunologic response is generally accepted to start with the second week of COVID-19 course, patients were classified into three groups, those who had AKI on admission, those who developed AKI in the first week and those who developed AKI starting from 7(th) day. Initial lymphocyte counts, creatinine levels, electrolytes, acid-base status and changes in the inflammatory markers were compared between the groups. A comparison between patients who survived and who died was also performed. RESULTS: 89 of the 383 included COVID-19 patients developed AKI. 24% of those who developed AKI died. Patients who developed AKI later had higher peak CRP and D-dimer levels with lower nadir lymphocyte counts (p=0,000, 0,004 and 0,003 respectively). Additionally, patients who died had higher initial inflammatory marker levels and lower lymphocyte counts than those who survived. Mortality of patients who had AKI on hospital admission (13%) was similar to the overall COVID-19 mortality for inpatients, however it was as high as 44% for those who developed AKI after 7(th) day. Early AKI was related to pre-renal causes and had a milder course. However, later AKIs were more related to immunologic response and had significantly higher mortality. Patients who died had significantly higher ferritin and d-dimer levels upon their hospital admissions (p=0,000). Electrolyte disturbances, metabolic acidosis and mortality were also higher in patients who developed AKI later. Hypernatremia (OR: 6,5, 95% CI: 3 – 13,9) and phosphorus disturbances (both hyperphosphatemia (OR: 3,3; 95%CI: 1,6 – 6,9) and hypophosphatemia (OR: 3,9; 95% CI: 2,0-7,9)) were related to mortality.

675522,The diagnostic accuracy of seven commercial molecular in vitro SARS-CoV-2 detection tests: a rapid meta-analysis,2021-06-01,"Background: During the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands, thousands of former nurses have returned to nursing to support healthcare staff. After a period of absence and with little time to prepare, these former nurses re-entered during a challenging, uncertain and rapidly evolving pandemic. Little is known about the experiences and needs of these re-entering nurses. Objectives: Assessing the needs and experiences of re-entering nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Qualitative study using a pragmatist approach within the interpretative paradigm. Settings: This study took place in the following settings within the Dutch healthcare system: Intensive care units, COVID and regular departments within hospitals, nursing home settings, a rehabilitation centre and newly established COVID-19 departments within nursing home settings. Participants: We purposively selected 20 nurses who had re-entered nursing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between March 2020 and June 2020 in the Netherlands. The first interview was conducted on the eighth of May 2020. Methods: We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews in Dutch. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed via thematic content analysis in the coding program of MAXQDA2020. This study followed the SRQR and COREQ guidelines. Results: Seven main themes were identified. Clear job description: Participants mentioned that a lack of a clear job description led to lack of clarity about the kind of tasks that re-entering nurses were expected and allowed to perform. Training: the majority of the participants had received none or little training prior to their return. Training content: Re-entering nurses mentioned to wish for an easily accessible mentorship structure and an individualised and practical training program. Positive team dynamic: Re-entering nurses felt supported by a positive team dynamic, which was shaped by the sense of urgency and relevance of their work and helped them deal with stressful experiences. Mental health: Nearly all participants mentioned that re-entering during a pandemic did not lead to impairment of their mental health. mental health support: Most participants mentioned being able to cope with their mental health independently, sharing experiences with family and colleagues Conclusion: The results indicate that a rapid and safe return to nursing during a pandemic could be facilitated by: a clear description of roles and responsibilities; an individualised assessment determining the competences and knowledge disparities of re-entering nurses; practical training focussing on competencies needed during a pandemic; and a collaborative mentorship structure to guide re-entering nurses.

676512,Immunotherapy for SARS-CoV-2: potential opportunities,2020-08-12,"BACKGROUND: Antiviral drugs are administered in patients with severe COVID‐19 respiratory syndrome, including those treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Concomitant administration of antiviral agents has the potential to increase their plasma concentration. A series of patients managed in the Cremona Thrombosis Center were admitted at Cremona Hospital for SARS‐CoV‐2 and started antiviral drugs without stopping DOAC therapy. DOAC plasma levels were measured in hospital and results compared with those recorded before hospitalization. METHODS: All consecutive patients on DOACs were candidates for administration of antiviral agents (lopinavir, ritonavir, or darunavir). Plasma samples for DOAC measurement were collected 2to 4 days after starting antiviral treatment, at 12 hours from the last dose intake in patients on dabigatran and apixaban, and at 24 hours in those on rivaroxaban and edoxaban. For each patient, C‐trough DOAC level, expressed as ng/mL, was compared with the one measured before hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 1039 patients hospitalized between February 22 and March 15, 2020 with COVID‐19 pneumonia and candidates for antiviral therapy, 32 were on treatment with a DOAC. DOAC was stopped in 20 and continued in the remaining 12. On average, C‐trough levels were 6.14 times higher during hospitalization than in the pre‐hospitalization period. CONCLUSION: DOAC patients treated with antiviral drugs show an alarming increase in DOAC plasma levels. In order to prevent bleeding complications, we believe that physicians should consider withholding DOACs from patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 and replacing them with alternative parenteral antithrombotic strategies for as long as antiviral agents are deemed necessary and until discharge.","Testa, Sophie; Prandoni, Paolo; Paoletti, Oriana; Morandini, Rossella; Tala, Maurizio; Dellanoce, Claudia; Giorgi‐Pierfranceschi, Matteo; Betti, Monia; Battista Danzi, Gian; Pan, Angelo; Palareti, Gualtiero",J Thromb Haemost,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329231/,144

Here, we rationally designed and developed chimeric antisense oligonucleotides to degrade envelope and spike RNAs of SARS-CoV-2. Each oligonucleotide comprises a 3’ antisense sequence for target recognition and a 5’-phosphorylated 2’-5’ poly(A)4 for guided ribonuclease L (RNase L) activation. Since RNase L can potently cleave single strand RNA during innate antiviral response, the improved degradation efficiency of chimeric oligonucleotides was twice as much as classic antisense oligonucleotides in Vero cells, for both SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets. In pseudovirus infection models, one of chimeric oligonucleotides targeting spike RNA achieved potent and broad-spectrum inhibition of both SARS-CoV-2 and its recently reported N501Y and/or ΔH69/ΔV70 mutants. These results showed that the constructed chimeric oligonucleotides could efficiently degrade pathogenic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 facilitated by immune activation, showing promising potentials as antiviral nucleic acid drugs for COVID-19.","Su, Xiaoxuan; Ma, Wenxiao; Cheng, Boyang; Wang, Qian; Guo, Zefeng; Zhou, Demin; Tang, Xinjing",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.04.433849,144

Guidelines recommend natriuretic peptide (NP) testing in primary care to prioritise referral for specialist diagnostic assessment. We aimed to assess association of baseline NP with hospitalisation and mortality in people with newly diagnosed HF. METHODS: Population-based cohort study of 40 007 patients in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in England with a new HF diagnosis (48% men, mean age 78.5 years). We used linked primary and secondary care data between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2018 to report one-year hospitalisation and 1-year, 5-year and 10-year mortality by NP level. RESULTS: 22 085 (55%) participants were hospitalised in the year following diagnosis. Adjusted odds of HF-related hospitalisation in those with a high NP (NT-proBNP >2000 pg/mL) were twofold greater (OR 2.26 95% CI 1.98 to 2.59) than a moderate NP (NT-proBNP 400-2000 pg/mL). All-cause mortality rates in the high NP group were 27%, 62% and 82% at 1, 5 and 10 years, compared with 19%, 50% and 77%, respectively, in the moderate NP group and, in a competing risks model, risk of HF-related death was 50% higher at each timepoint. Median time between NP test and HF diagnosis was 101 days (IQR 19-581). CONCLUSIONS: High baseline NP is associated with increased HF-related hospitalisation and poor survival. While healthcare systems remain under pressure from the impact of COVID-19, research to test novel strategies to prevent hospitalisation and improve outcomes-such as a mandatory two-week HF diagnosis pathway-is urgently needed.","Taylor, Clare J; Lay-Flurrie, Sarah L; Ordóñez-Mena, José M; Goyder, Clare R; Jones, Nicholas R; Roalfe, Andrea K; Hobbs, Fd Richard",Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183432/; https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2021-319196,144

This review attempts to provide an overview of the effects of TKIs licensed for children (e.g., imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib) on immune function, as well as its implications on immunizations. We discuss surveillance strategies (e.g., immunoglobulin blood serum levels and hepatitis B reactivation) and immunizations. All inactivated vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal, and streptococcal) can be given during the treatment of CML in the chronic phase, although their efficacy may be lower. As shown in single cases of children and adults with CML, live vaccines (e.g., varicella, measles, mumps, rubella, and yellow fever) may be administered under defined circumstances with great precautions. We also highlight important aspects of COVID-19 in this patient population (e.g., the outcome of COVID-19 infection in adults with CML and in children with varying hemato-oncological diseases) and discuss the highly dynamic field of presently available different vaccination options. In conclusion, TKI treatment for CML causes humoral and cellular immune dysfunction, which is mild in most patients, and thus infectious complications are rare.

681024,How Does SARS-CoV-2 Affect the Central Nervous System? A Working Hypothesis,2020-11-16,"Coronavirus membrane (M) protein can form virus-like particles (VLPs) when coexpressed with nucleocapsid (N) or envelope (E) proteins, suggesting a pivotal role for M in virion assembly. Here we demonstrate the self-assembly and release of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) M protein in medium in the form of membrane-enveloped vesicles with densities lower than those of VLPs formed by M plus N. Although efficient N-N interactions require the presence of RNA, we found that M-M interactions were RNA-independent. SARS-CoV M was observed in both the Golgi area and plasma membranes of a variety of cells. Blocking M glycosylation does not appear to significantly affect M plasma membrane labeling intensity, M-containing vesicle release, or VLP formation. Results from a genetic analysis indicate involvement of the third transmembrane domain of M in plasma membrane-targeting signal. Fusion proteins containing M amino-terminal 50 residues encompassing the first transmembrane domain were found to be sufficient for membrane binding, multimerization, and Golgi retention. Surprisingly, we found that fusion proteins lacking all three transmembrane domains were still capable of membrane binding, Golgi retention, and interacting with M. The data suggest that multiple SARS-CoV M regions are involved in M self-assembly and subcellular localization.","Tseng, Ying-Tzu; Wang, Shiu-Mei; Huang, Kuo-Jung; Lee, Amber I-Ru; Chiang, Chien-Cheng; Wang, Chin-Tien",Journal of Biological Chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20154085/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925820550667; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820550667; http://www.jbc.org/content/285/17/12862.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m109.030270,144
681057,Wastewater Tracks Community Infection,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the genotypes and the main characteristics of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in hospitalized children in Medellín and neighboring municipalities during the period 2011–2012. METHODS: The M. pneumoniae genotype was determined by PCR and sequencing of the p1 and 23S rRNA genes from induced sputum samples and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). Samples were obtained from children with CAP who were hospitalized in 13 healthcare centers. In addition, a spatio-temporal analysis was performed to identify the potential risk areas and clustering of the cases over time. RESULTS: A variant of type 2 was the dominant genotype in the induced sputum (96.1%) and NPS (89.3%) samples; the type 1 variant was identified in 3.9% and 10.7% of these samples, respectively. No strains with mutations in the 23S rRNA gene associated with macrolide resistance were found. The cases in Medellín were mainly concentrated in the northeastern areas and western districts. However, no temporal relationship was found among these cases. CONCLUSIONS: A variant of type 2 of M. pneumoniae prevailed among children with CAP during the study period. No strains with mutations associated with macrolide resistance were found.","Copete, Angela Rocio; Aguilar, Yudy Alexandra; Rueda, Zulma Vanessa; Vélez, Lázaro Agustín",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2017.11.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971217303016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29155089/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971217303016,144

Subject COVID-19 spread like wildfire to over 200 countries of the world across all continents. The causative agent, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is being counter attacked by a thorough application of disinfectants and sterilants. However, the virus mutated over 30 times during this global pandemic, creating panic and leading to enhanced pathogenicity and consequently to more stringent sanitation measures for controlling it. However, excessive use of different types of biocides for disinfecting surfaces is highly alarming in several cases. Extensive application of biocides affects the microbial flora, leading to an abrupt decrease in the number and diversity of beneficial microbes that may directly affect the functioning of nutrient cycles. Results The increased concentration of biocides in agricultural land via surface water or pond water indirectly affect the soil and water ecosystem, soil aggregation and fertility. This will also lead to the flourishing of resistant strains due to loss of competition from the other species, which fail to persist after prolonged use of biocides. Conclusion It is necessary to realize the environmental impacts of biocides and sterilants. It is the right time to stop their entry into the agricultural ecosystem by following adequate management strategies and complete neutralization.","Paul, Debarati; Mondal, Suresh K.; Mandal, Santi M.",Biol Futur,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42977-021-00069-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34554548/,144

The current study aimed to determine the effect of MOLP on the physical quality, nutritional composition and consumer acceptability of white and brown breads. The texture, colour and nutritional composition of white and brown bread samples substituted with 5% and 10% (w/w) MOLPs were analysed using standard methods and compared with the control (0% MOLP). A consumer panel evaluated the acceptability of the bread samples using a nine-point hedonic scale. Bread samples became darker as the concentration of MOLP was increased, whilst nutrient levels increased. The overall consumer acceptability of the bread samples decreased with increasing concentrations of MOLP. However, brown bread samples were significantly more acceptable compared with corresponding white bread samples (p < 0.05). Under the experiment conditions of the current study, it seems that the bread containing 5% MOLP can be used to contribute significantly to addressing malnutrition, with respect to protein deficiency.","Govender, Laurencia; Siwela, Muthulisi",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods9121910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371222/,144

The implications are much beyond just health crisis, and it has long-lasting psychosocial and economic implications. Although the psychological offshoots such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and sleep disturbances are being studied in-depth, there is a dearth of literature on the sexual well-being and sexual practices during this pandemic. Considering the physical distancing; travel restrictions; the high human–human transmission rate; misinformation and uncertainty about the sexual routes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2; and fear about intimacy, sexuality, and safe sexual practices have increased significantly. This is more prominent in newly settled or distanced couples and the frontline health workers, with increased risk exposure to the virus. For them, guilt and distress associated with sexual relationships might increase primary psychiatric and sexual disorders. This, in turn, impacts relationships and emotional bonding in couples and affects healthy coping during the pandemic crisis. Although sexual abstinence is the safest practice to prevent transmission, it is not practically feasible in all cases. Risk reduction counseling, sex with quarantined partners, and digital sex are other options that are worth exploring. There are additional concerns of digital safety, unhealthy use of technology, cyber-crimes, and online extortion. Keeping this in the background, this advocacy article glances through the effects of past outbreaks on sexuality, reviews the current recommendations, and proposes methods and approaches for sexual well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is vital for overall public health.","Banerjee, Debanjan; Rao, T.

During the outbreak of COVID-19, mental health of the general population in Hubei province may be affected. This study aimed to assess the psychological status and associated risk factors of the general population in Hubei province during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was used to evaluate the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety, which were assessed by the Chinese version of the Impact of Event Scale—Revised, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, respectively. Coping style was assessed by the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to detect factors associated with mental health outcomes. Results: Among 9,225 participants, 44.5% rated symptoms of PTSD, and 17.9 and 12.7% suffered from moderate and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Individuals who were geographically located in Wuhan and familiar with someone who has COVID-19 had more severe symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, as well as a higher score in passive coping style (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that people who were geographically located in Wuhan [odds ratio (OR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14–1.36, P < 0.001] were associated with severe symptoms of PTSD. Besides, individuals who were familiar with someone who had COVID-19 (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 2.07–2.63, P < 0.001; OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.66–2.17, P < 0.001; OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.78–2.39, P < 0.001) and had a higher score in passive coping style (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.14–1.17, P < 0.001; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.15–1.19, P < 0.001; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.15–1.19, P < 0.001) were associated with severe symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Moreover, a higher score in active coping style (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.95–0.97, P < 0.001; OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.93–0.94, P < 0.001; OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.94–0.96, P < 0.001) was associated with a lower risk of symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Conclusions: During the midphase of COVID-19 outbreak, quite a few people have mental health problems; nearly half of the respondents rated symptoms of PTSD, and approximately one-fifth reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. Our findings may lead to better comprehend the psychological status of the general public and alleviate the public mental health crisis during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Chen, Guanmao; Gong, Jiaying; Qi, Zhangzhang; Zhong, Shuming; Su, Ting; Wang, Jurong; Fu, Siying; Huang, Li; Wang, Ying",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968877/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.622762,144
686289,Reliability of self-sampling for accurate assessment of respiratory virus viral and immunologic kinetics,2020-04-06,"OBJECTIVE: Several therapeutic agents have been assessed for the treatment of COVID-19, but few approaches have been proven efficacious. Because leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast have been shown to reduce both cytokine release and lung inflammation in preclinical models of viral influenza and acute respiratory distress syndrome, we hypothesized that therapy with montelukast could be used to treat COVID-19. The objective of this study was to determine if montelukast treatment would reduce the rate of clinical deterioration as measured by the COVID-19 Ordinal Scale. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 confirmed hospitalized patients treated with or without montelukast. We used “clinical deterioration” as the primary endpoint, a binary outcome defined as any increase in the Ordinal Scale value from Day 1 to Day 3 of the hospital stay, as these data were uniformly available for all admitted patients before hospital discharge. Rates of clinical deterioration between the montelukast and non-montelukast groups were compared using the Fisher’s exact test. Univariate logistic regression was also used to assess the association between montelukast use and clinical deterioration. A total of 92 patients were analyzed, 30 who received montelukast at the discretion of the treating physician and 62 patients who did not receive montelukast. RESULTS: Patients receiving montelukast experienced significantly fewer events of clinical deterioration compared with patients not receiving montelukast (10% vs 32%, p = 0.022). Our findings suggest that montelukast associates with a reduction in clinical deterioration for COVID-19 confirmed patients as measured on the COVID-19 Ordinal Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with montelukast had fewer events of clinical deterioration, indicating that this treatment may have clinical activity. While this retrospective study highlights a potential pathway for COVID-19 treatment, this hypothesis requires further study by prospective studies.","Khan, Ahsan R.; Misdary, Christian; Yegya-Raman, Nikhil; Kim, Sinae; Narayanan, Navaneeth; Siddiqui, Sheraz; Salgame, Padmini; Radbel, Jared; Groote, Frank De; Michel, Carl; Mehnert, Janice; Hernandez, Caleb; Braciale, Thomas; Malhotra, Jyoti; Gentile, Michael A.; Jabbour, Salma K.",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2021.1881967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577360/,144

We aim to describe the incidence, associated variables, and outcomes of rhabdomyolysis in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: Data for all critically ill adult patients (≥18 years old) admitted to the ICU at a large academic medical center with confirmed COVID-19 between March 13, 2020 and April 18, 2020 were prospectively collected. Patients with serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations greater than 1000 U/L were diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Patients were further stratified as having moderate (serum CK concentration 1000-4999 U/L) or severe (serum CK concentration ≥5000 U/L) rhabdomyolysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify outcomes and variables associated with the development of rhabdomyolysis. Results: Of 235 critically ill COVID-19 patients, 114 (48.5%) met diagnostic criteria for rhabdomyolysis. Patients with rhabdomyolysis more often required mechanical ventilation (p-value<0.001), prone positioning (p-value<0.001), pharmacological paralysis (p-value<0.001), renal replacement therapy (p-value=0.010), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (p-value=0.025).

688910,Infectious disease aerobiology: miasma incarnate,2012-12-19,"Background and objectives SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cause of a worldwide pandemic, currently with limited therapeutic options. Whilst vaccines are at the forefront of the therapeutic initiative, drug repurposing remains a promising approach for SARS-CoV-2 treatment. BromAc (Bromelain & Acetylcysteine) has synergistic action against glycoproteins by the synchronous breakage of glycosidic linkages and disulfide bonds. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, formed of glycoprotein and disulfide bridges for stabilization, represents an attractive target as it is essential for binding to the ACE2 receptor in host cells present in nasal mucosa. We sought to determine the effect of BromAc on the Spike and Envelope proteins and its potential to reduce infectivity in host cells. Design Recombinant Spike and Envelope proteins were treated by single agent and combination BromAc at 50 and 100 µg/20mg/mL and analyzed by electrophoresis. Ultraviolet analysis of disulfide bond reduction was performed for both Spike and Envelope proteins after treatment with Acetylcysteine. In vitro whole virus culture inactivation of pre-treated wild type and an S1/S2 Spike mutant SARS-CoV-2 with BromAc from 25 to 250 µg/20mg/mL was measured by cytopathic effect, cell lysis assay, and replication capacity by RT-PCR. Results Recombinant Spike and Envelope SARS-CoV-2 proteins were fragmented by BromAc at both 50 and 100 µg/20mg/mL whilst single agents had minimal effect. Spike and Envelope protein disulfide bonds were reduced by Acetylcysteine. In vitro whole virus culture of both wild type and Spike mutant SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a concentration-dependent inactivation from BromAc treatment but not from single agents. Conclusion BromAc disintegrates SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Envelope proteins. In vitro tests on whole virus support this finding with inactivation of its replication capacity most strongly at 100 and 250 µg/20mg/mL BromAc, even in Spike mutant virus. Clinical testing through nasal administration in patients with early SARS-CoV-2 infection is imminent. Author Summary There is currently no suitable therapeutic treatment for early SARS-CoV-2 aimed to prevent disease progression. BromAc is under clinical development by the authors for mucinous cancers due to its ability to alter complex glycoproteins structure. The potential of BromAc on SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Envelope glycoproteins stabilized by disulfide bonds was examined and found to disintegrate recombinant Spike and Envelope proteins whilst reducing disulfide stabilizer bridges. BromAc also showed an inhibitory effect on wild-type and Spike mutant SARS-CoV-2 by inactivation of its replication capacity in vitro. Hence, BromAc may be an effective therapeutic agent for early SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite mutations, and even have potential as a prophylactic in people at high risk of infection.","Akhter, Javed; Quéromès, Grégory; Pillai, Krishna; Kepenekian, Vahan; Badar, Samina; Mekkawy, Ahmed H.; Frobert, Emilie; Valle, Sarah J; Morris, David L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.07.286906,144

In this review, we have used a bioinformatics approach to elucidate the immune response triggered by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in primary human lung epithelial and transformed human lung alveolar. Additionally, we have examined the potential mechanism behind several complications that have been associated with COVID‐19 and determined that a specific cytokine storm is leading to excessive neutrophil recruitment.

Study Design: In this prospective cohort study at a large, academic urban U.S. hospital, we evaluated pregnant women with positive polymerase-chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 between March and September 2020. Testing was performed for reported symptoms or on admission by universal screening protocol. Women were systematically queried using a standardized review of symptoms. In our hospital, all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of pregnancy, were recommended to have baseline labs - leukocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and ferritin - as these markers of inflammation were felt to potentially stratify disease severity. Labs were repeated if the clinical course worsened. Mann-Whitney U tests compared peak biomarker levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women. Result(s): We identified 157 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 of whom 83 (53%) were symptomatic. Of symptomatic women, the most commonly reported symptoms were cough, congestion or sore throat (29%);fever (22%);respiratory distress or dyspnea (15%);and myalgias (15%). Compared to asymptomatic women, women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection had increased procalcitonin and ALT levels (Table 1). However, only 38% and 6% of symptomatic patients developed a clinical elevation in procalcitonin or ALT, respectively. There were no significant differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic women for all other biomarkers. Conclusion(s): Inflammatory biomarkers used to differentiate morbidity in non-pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 may not have the same utility in pregnant women. Given the severity of infection in pregnant women, future research should continue to evaluate markers of SARS-CoV-2 that account for pregnancy physiology.

689540,Protracted yet coordinated differentiation of long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells during COVID-19 convalescence,2021-04-29,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) genome has 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF is translated from the full-length genomic mRNA while the remaining ORFs are translated from eight subgeomic RNAs (sgRNAs). In this study, we designed small interference RNAs (siRNAs) targeting sgRNA 2, 3 and 7 and tested their efficiency and specificity in silencing the protein translated from the targeted sgRNA. Our results demonstrated that siRNA 7 could inhibit sgRNA 7, which showed 19/19 nucleotides (nt) matching, and sgRNA 8, which showed 18/19 nt matching; but, it did not inhibit the full-length genomic mRNA which showed 17/19 nt matching. Overall, each of the siRNAs can inhibit the targeted sgRNA without affecting the full-length genomic mRNA or the other sgRNAs that showed mismatch of two or more nt. Thus, siRNA could be designed so as to knockdown the expression of viral protein(s) from a targeted sgRNA during viral infection, thereby allowing the contribution of individual viral proteins to viral infection to be delineated. When Vero E6 cells expressing siRNA 2, 3 or 7 were infected with SARS-CoV, a significant reduction in the yield of progeny virus was observed. Indirect immunofluorescence assays showed that in the infected cells expressing each of the siRNAs, there was aspecific silencing of S, 3a and 7a, respectively, but the expression of nucleocapsid protein was not affected. Thus, our data suggests that the accessory proteins, i.e. 3a and 7a, could play an important role during the replication cycle of the SARS-CoV.","Åkerström, Sara; Mirazimi, Ali; Tan, Yee-Joo",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17112601/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354206003172; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354206003172,144
690511,Engineering Insights for Multiplexed Real-Time Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification (NASBA): Implications for Design of Point-of-Care Diagnostics,2013-05-16,"BackgroundThis research explored awareness, perception, and practice of COVID 19 prevention among residents of communities in all the local government areas (districts) in Rivers State during the early stages of the pandemic response. DesignThis was a descriptive cross-sectional survey which employed an interviewer-administered four-page questionnaire built into the Open Data Kit application for android phones. Knowledge and practice scores were computed by scoring every correct response/action as 1 and wrong responses as 0. Knowledge was graded as excellent for scores of [â¥]80%, good for scores of 50-79% and poor for scores of <50%. Respondents who washed all critical parts of the hand were categorized as having correct handwashing practice. SettingRivers State in the South-South region of Nigeria had recorded over 2000 cases of COVID 19 as of 18th August 2020, ranking 5th among the high burden states in Nigeria. As with any epidemic of an infectious nature, panic, fear, and misconceptions are rife. Risk communication utilizes multi-faceted activities geared towards facilitating correct and consistent knowledge and prevention practice. ParticipantsStudy involved 1,294 adult community residents in the 23 districts of the state. ResultsThe respondents were aged between 18 and 80 years with average age of 39.6 years (SD = 11.9 years). A total of 710 (54.9%) were male, 476 (36.8%) were unemployed with 685 (52.9%) having secondary education. Almost all respondents 1,271 (98.2%) had heard about COVID 19. The three most common sources of information about COVID 19 were radio jingles 1102 (86.7%), television adverts 940 (74.0%) and announcements in Church 612 (48.2%). Overall, 608 (47.0%) of the respondents had poor knowledge of COVID 19. About 1167 (90.2%) of the respondents who were aware of COVID 19 acknowledged that COVID 19 is a problem in the state while 443 (34.9%) respondents believed they were unlikely contract the virus. Only 505 (39.0%) of the respondents washed all critical parts of the hand correctly. ConclusionsRisk communication interventions during pandemics need to be based on an understanding of the gaps in knowledge, attitude, perceptions, and practice. Broadcast media has a pivotal role to play in risk communication for behaviour change for the control of current and future epidemics in this population.","Owhonda, Golden; Maduka, Omosivie; Nwadiuto, Ifeoma; Tobin-West, Charles; Azi, Esther; Ojimah, Chibianotu; Alasia, Datonye; Olofinuka, Ayo-Maria; Agala, Vetty; Paul, John Nwolim; Nria, Doris; Okafor, Chinenye; Ndekwu, Ifeoma; Opara, Chikezie; Newsom, Chris",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.11.20210864; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210864v1?rss=1,144
