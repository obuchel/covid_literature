METHODS Whereas pancreatic tail resection is routinely and safely performed in several institutions, the laparoscopic resection of the pancreatic head is only performed by a handful of surgeons. RESULTS In this article, we present our hybrid approach with complete laparoscopic pylorus-preserving pancreatic head resection and successive reconstruction via a small retrieval incision, which might combine the advantages of the laparoscopic resection with the safety of an open and routine pancreatic anastomosis.","Keck, Tobias; Kuesters, Simon; Wellner, Ulrich; Hopt, Ulrich Theodor; Karcz, Wojciech Konrad",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,852,1

Additionally, to gather information from parents about healthcare experiences, family stressors and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: A prospective longitudinal single site cohort study Setting: Royal Childrens Hospital, Melbourne, Australia Participants: 151 parents of children aged 1.5-17 years (M = 9.8 years, 58.3% male) with a CHC (colorectal disorder, cleft palate and neurofibromatosis type 1) completed the survey. Main outcome measures: An adapted version of the COVID-19 Wellbeing and Mental Health Survey for Children and Adolescents (Parent/Caregiver version) (CRISIS) was utilised. The CRISIS tool collects data on child activities and mental health and parent mental health prior to, and during, the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare experiences families was also examined. Parents completed the Kessler 10. Results: Compared to pre-COVID lockdown, parents reported their children were experiencing higher rates of loneliness, irritability, worry and anxiety. Parents reported that the restrictions in face-to-face contact with family and friends had been stressful for 80.0% of children. The activities of the children changed considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic with screen time increasing by 40%. Thirty percent of parents reported significant distress of their own. Parents felt telehealth were of poorer quality than face-to-face appointments. Conclusions: Children with CHC experienced a significant increase in mental health symptoms during lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the increased need for clinical monitoring for children with CHC during periods of community stress and restrictions.","Crowe, L.; Clarke, C.; Hearps, S.; Pugh, R.; Kilpatrick, N.; Branson, E.; Payne, J.; Haebich, K.; McCloughan, N.; Kintakas, C.; Charles, G.; Trajanovska, M.; Hsieh, I.; Hartmann, P.; King, S.; Anderson, N.; Anderson, V.",,852,14

Recent work on hot-rolled Zr-2.5Nb has shown that the texture of the two phases are related, with coupled strengthening of the α near {112¯0}〈101¯0〉, which produces strong 0002 pole intensities along the transverse direction, and β with {001}〈110〉 rotated cube, particularly when the relative volume fraction is around 50:50. To investigate the origin of this texture coupling, we studied a hot-rolled model Zr alloy with 7 wt.% Nb, in which the as-deformed α + β microstructure is preserved on cooling. The alloy was hot-rolled to different reductions at 725∘C, which corresponds to a relative α:β volume fraction of 30:70, where the characteristic textures are known to develop quickly at first and then weaken with further reduction. The rolled material was characterised using both 2D and 3D electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). This analysis uncovered evidence that both recrystallization and phase transformation cause the disappearance of specific α variants during rolling, favouring the formation of “soft” primary α grains flattened in 〈112¯0〉 and elongated along 〈101¯0〉 during rolling, which in turn has an effect on surrounding β orientations, promoting the stronger rotated cube component. At higher reductions, these elongated α-grains start to break up, as does the β surrounding it, forming bands of characteristic coupled textures. These observations imply that non-plasticity effects should be included in models of texture evolution during processing of α + β Zr and Ti alloys. © 2020","Daniel, C. S.; Garner, A.; Honniball, P.

With this in mind, the present study examines the performance of academic and job-readiness of two groups of graduates. One group comprised a pre-COVID-19 cohort for face-to-face teaching mode while the other used the online mode during the pandemic. While the official secondary data are collected from the sampled university, primary data are gathered through an ‘empirical survey’ of 120 students in each group (i.e., before and during COVID-19, a total of 240). Findings suggest that the pre-pandemic group did poorly academically unlike their during-pandemic counterparts. Although both groups achieved well academically, there is a difference when comparing their job-readiness scores which included both aptitude and practicum tests. The pre-COVID-19 students achieved better job-readiness scores than their counterparts. Performance in academy and job-readiness is not proportionately linked. These findings suggest that higher education is generally not that active from the job market perspective, while online learning has in fact made education much more passive.

However, not much is known about virtual patient-provider interactions or device sharing behaviors. Objective To characterize how participants with or at risk for AF are engaging with their providers in the context of telemedicine and utilizing commercially wearable devices to manage their health. Methods We developed a survey to describe participant behaviors around telemedicine encounters and commercial wearable device use. The survey was distributed to participants diagnosed with AF or those at risk for AF (being at least 65 years old and CHA2DS2-VASc > 2) in the University of Massachusetts Memorial Health Care system. Results The survey was distributed to 23,530 patients and there were 1,222 participant responses. Among the participants, 327 had AF and 895 were at risk for AF. Neither device ownership nor device type use differed by AF status. After adjusting for covariates that may influence surveyed participant communication patterns, we found AF participants were more likely to share their device-derived data with providers (aOR 1.87, 95% Cl 1.02-3.41). Rates of sharing physical activity or sleep data were low for both groups and did not differ by AF status. Conclusion Compared to participants at risk for developing AF, participants with AF were more likely to share heart rate and rhythm data from their commercial wearable device with providers. However, both groups had similar rates of sharing physical activity and sleep data, telemedicine engagement, and technology use and ownership.","Nuvvula, Sri Ding Eric Y.; Saleeba, Connor Shi Qiming Wang Ziyue Kapoor Alok Saczynski Jane S.; Lubitz, Steven A.; Kovell, Lara C.; McKee, M.

Endogenous biomolecule zinc plays a critical role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Here, we found that currents recorded from heterologously expressed ASIC1a/3 channels using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique were regulated by zinc with dual effects. Co-application of zinc dose-dependently potentiated both peak amplitude and the sustained component of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 currents; pretreatment with zinc between 3 to 100 µM exerted the same potentiation as co-application. However, pretreatment with zinc induced a significant inhibition of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels when zinc concentrations were over 250 µM. The potentiation of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels by zinc was pH dependent, as zinc shifted the pH dependence of ASIC1a/3 currents from a pH50 of 6.54 to 6.77; whereas the inhibition of ASIC1a/3 currents by zinc was also pH dependent. Furthermore, we systematically mutated histidine residues in the extracellular domain of ASIC1a or ASIC3 and found that histidine residues 72 and 73 in both ASIC1a and ASIC3, and histidine residue 83 in the ASIC3 were responsible for bidirectional effects on heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels by zinc. These findings suggest that histidine residues in the extracellular domain of heteromeric ASIC1a/3 channels are critical for zinc-mediated effects.","Jiang, Qian; Peterson, Andrew M; Chu, Yuyang; Yao, Xiaolan; Zha, Xiang-Ming; Chu, Xiang-Ping",Biomolecules,852,16

Although body image is important, the definition of this concept is inconsistent across the disciplines of nursing, medicine, and psychology. Use of a consistent definition in clinical practice and research could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of disturbances in body image, thereby advancing research-based knowledge and clinical practice. The purpose of this concept development was to advance the concept of body image as it relates to sexual health among women of reproductive age from the perspectives of 3 disciplines with a strong focus on body image: nursing, medicine, and psychology. METHODS: Strategies for concept development as described by Rodgers provided the basis for this work. The process includes a search, review, and synthesis of the literature surrounding the concept of interest. RESULTS: Seventy-one articles, mostly qualitative and quantitative descriptive, were included and used to develop the concept. Body image related to sexual health in women of reproductive age is a multifaceted concept that is composed of an emotional and behavioral response to one's perceived appearance, sexuality, and degree of femininity. An individual's body image is influenced by sociocultural identities, race, ethnicity, and health status. It has both physical and psychological impact on health outcomes. DISCUSSION: This interprofessional and comprehensive definition of body image should enhance understanding, assessment, and management of body image disturbances, thus bridging disciplines and enhancing interprofessional research and practice.","Wilson, Christina M; McGuire, Deborah B; Rodgers, Beth L",J. midwifery womens health,852,24

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and medRxiv databases were searched using a search strategy tailored to each database. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) checklists were used for the studies' qualitative assessment. The outcomes studied were mortality, all adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical improvement. The quantitative synthesis was conducted using fixed and random effects models in the CMA 2.2. Heterogeneity was tested using the I-squared (I2) measure. RESULTS: In general, six studies, including five randomized controlled trials and one cohort study were found eligible. Comparison of the findings related to both groups receiving remdesivir (10-day remdesivir group) and placebo/control group showed that remdesivir treatment had no significant effect on mortality at day 14 of the treatment (RR=0.769; 95% CI :0.563-1.050; p=0.098), and all adverse events (RR= 1.078; 95% CI: 0.908-1.279; p= 0.392). However, remdesivir had a significant effect on clinical improvement at day 14 compared to placebo/control (OR= 1.447; 95% CI: 1.005-2.085; p= 0.047) and reduced serious adverse events (RR= 0.736; 95% CI: 0.611-0.887; p= 0.001).

Design/methodology/approach: This study randomly collected 314 respondents through an online survey in May 2020 in South Korea. Structural equation modeling (SEM) assessed the overall hypothetical research model. Findings: Zero-Contact Marketing facilitates the positive impacts of Korean consumers' motivations (intrinsic and extrinsic) and service environment on their word-of-mouth (WOM) intention to spread information about a store offering Zero-Contact Marketing service and the store revisit intention. In addition, consumers' attitude toward Zero-Contact Marketing and shopping pleasure (SPL) has stronger impacts on consumers' WOM intention than they do on the store revisit intention. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study lies in that the survey participants responded only in South Korea, which may lead to biased results. To provide a more generalized insight, this study should be extended by considering consumers in other countries, since many consumers around the world tend to minimize face-to-face interaction and avoid unnecessary interruptions under the current pandemic. Practical implications: By minimizing the social interaction between employees and consumers, Zero-Contact Marketing may increase consumers' shopping satisfaction with free shopping moments and no disturbance, especially under the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: The findings provide theoretical contributions by empirically validating the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and service environment on consumers' internal and external responses in a Zero-Contact retail setting. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Park, A.; An, H.

[...]the US yellow fever vaccine-associated hepatitis fiasco had been preceded by an earlier such association in Brazil only two years previously. Amid this proliferation, scholars have raised concerns over North-South funding and power imbalances that shape aspects of the research enterprise, ranging from the questions to be answered and the interventions that are proposed to the distribution of project funding and the order of authorship in articles stemming from such projects.5-7 Even beyond these structural inequities, moreover, lay issues ofmutual trust and confidence among collaborators,8 as they apparently did eight decades prior.
