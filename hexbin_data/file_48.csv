497,Tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation weaning in children affected by respiratory virus according to a weaning protocol in a pediatric intensive care unit in Argentina: an observational restrospective trial,2011-01-19,"We describe difficult weaning after prolonged mechanical ventilation in three tracheostomized children affected by respiratory virus infection. Although the spontaneous breathing trials were successful, the patients failed all extubations. Therefore a tracheostomy was performed and the weaning plan was begun. The strategy for weaning was the decrease of ventilation support combining pressure control ventilation (PCV) with increasing periods of continuous positive airway pressure + pressure support ventilation (CPAP + PSV) and then CPAP + PSV with increasing intervals of T-piece. They presented acute respiratory distress syndrome on admission with high requirements of mechanical ventilation (MV). Intervening factors in the capabilities and loads of the respiratory system were considered and optimized. The average MV time was 69 days and weaning time 31 days. We report satisfactory results within the context of a directed weaning protocol.","Caprotta, Gustavo; Gonzalez Crotti, Patricia; Frydman, Judith",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3035030/,48
834,Severe imported malaria in an intensive care unit: a review of 59 cases,2012-03-29,"BACKGROUND: In view of the close relationship of Portugal with African countries, particularly former Portuguese colonies, the diagnosis of malaria is not a rare thing. When a traveller returns ill from endemic areas, malaria should be the number one suspect. World Health Organization treatment guidelines recommend that adults with severe malaria should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Severe cases of malaria in patients admitted to an ICU were reviewed retrospectively (1990-2011) and identification of variables associated with in-ICU mortality performed. Malaria prediction score (MPS), malaria score for adults (MSA), simplified acute physiology score (SAPSII) and a score based on WHO's malaria severe criteria were applied. Statistical analysis was performed using StataV12. RESULTS: Fifty nine patients were included in the study, all but three were adults; 47 (79,6%) were male; parasitaemia on admission, quantified in 48/59 (81.3%) patients, was equal or greater than 2% in 47 of them (97.9%); the most common complications were thrombocytopaenia in 54 (91.5%) patients, associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in seven (11.8%), renal failure in 31 (52.5%) patients, 18 of which (30.5%) oliguric, shock in 29 (49.1%) patients, liver dysfunction in 27 (45.7%) patients, acidaemia in 23 (38.9%) patients, cerebral dysfunction in 22 (37.2%) patients, 11 of whom with unrousable coma, pulmonary oedema/ARDS in 22 (37.2%) patients, hypoglycaemia in 18 (30.5%) patients; 29 (49.1%) patients presented five or more dysfunctions. The case fatality rate was 15.2%. Comparing the four scores, the SAPS II and the WHO score were the most sensitive to death prediction. In the univariate analysis, death was associated with the SAPS II score, cerebral malaria, acute renal and respiratory failure, DIC, spontaneous bleeding, acidosis and hypoglycaemia. Age, partial immunity to malaria, delay in malaria diagnosis and the level of parasitaemia were not associated with death in this cohort. CONCLUSION: Severe malaria cases should be continued monitored in the ICUs. SAPS II and the WHO score are good predictors of mortality in malaria patients, but other specific scores deserve to be studied prospectively.","Santos, Lurdes C; Abreu, Cândida F; Xerinda, Sandra M; Tavares, Margarida; Lucas, Raquel; Sarmento, António C",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3350412/,48
960,National intensive care unit bed capacity and ICU patient characteristics in a low income country,2012-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Primary health care delivery in the developing world faces many challenges. Priority setting favours HIV, TB and malaria interventions. Little is known about the challenges faced in this setting with regard to critical care medicine. The aim of this study was to analyse and categorise the diagnosis and outcomes of 1,774 patients admitted to a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) in a low-income country over a 7-year period. We also assessed the country’s ICU bed capacity and described the challenges faced in dealing with critically ill patients in this setting. FINDINGS: A retrospective audit was conducted in a general ICU in a university hospital in Uganda. Demographic data, admission diagnosis, and ICU length of stay were recorded for the 1,774 patients who presented to the ICU in the period January 2003 to December 2009. Their mean age was 35.5 years. Males accounted for 56.5% of the study population; 92.8% were indigenous, and 42.9% were referrals from upcountry units. The average mortality rate over the study period was 40.1% (n = 715). The highest mortality rate (44%) was recorded in 2004 and the lowest (33.2%) in 2005. Children accounted for 11.6% of admissions (40.1% mortality). Sepsis, ARDS, traumatic brain injuries and HIV related conditions were the most frequent admission diagnoses. A telephonic survey determined that there are 33 adult ICU beds in the whole country. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was 40.1%, with sepsis, head injury, acute lung injury and HIV/AIDS the most common admission diagnoses. The country has a very low ICU bed capacity. Prioritising infectious diseases poses a challenge to ensuring that critical care is an essential part of the health care package in Uganda.","Kwizera, Arthur; Dünser, Martin; Nakibuuka, Jane",BMC Res Notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3470976/,48
1189,Plasma in the PICU: why and when should we transfuse?,2013-06-02,"Whereas red blood cell transfusions have been used since the 19th century, plasma has only been available since 1941. It was originally mainly used as volume replacement, mostly during World War II and the Korean War. Over the years, its indication has shifted to correct coagulation factors deficiencies or to prevent bleeding. Currently, it remains a frequent treatment in the intensive care unit, both for critically ill adults and children. However, observational studies have shown that plasma transfusion fail to correct mildly abnormal coagulation tests. Furthermore, recent epidemiological studies have shown that plasma transfusions are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Therefore, plasma, as any other treatment, has to be used when the benefits outweigh the risks. Based on observational data, most experts suggest limiting its use either to massively bleeding patients or bleeding patients who have documented abnormal coagulation tests, and refraining for transfusing plasma to nonbleeding patients whatever their coagulation tests. In this paper, we will review current evidence on plasma transfusions and discuss its indications.","Labarinas, Sonia; Arni, Delphine; Karam, Oliver",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3698065/,48
3380,Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in the intensive care unit,2018-09-17,"The streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a severe complication associated with invasive infections by group A streptococci. In spite of medical progresses in the care of patients with septic shock during the last decades, this condition has remained associated with a high mortality. Early recognition and multidisciplinary management are key to the care of patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, with intensive and appropriate intensive support of failing organs, rapid diagnosis of infectious source(s), and surgical management. The epidemiology and risk factors for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome remain to be better studied, including the possible causal role of exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In this review article, the authors review the current knowledge of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and discuss the pathophysiology as well as its supportive and specific treatment.","Schmitz, Marylin; Roux, Xavier; Huttner, Benedikt; Pugin, Jérôme",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6141408/,48
3630,Severe toxicity from checkpoint protein inhibitors: What intensive care physicians need to know?,2019-02-01,"Checkpoint protein inhibitor antibodies (CPI), including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 inhibitors (ipilimumab, tremelimumab) and the programmed cell death protein 1 pathway/programmed cell death protein 1 ligand inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab), have entered routine practice for the treatment of many cancers. They improve the outcome for many cancers, and more patients will be treated with CPI in the future. Although CPI can lead to adverse events (AE) less frequently than for chemotherapy, their use can require intensive care unit admission in case of severe immune-related adverse events (IrAE). Moreover, some of these events, particularly late events, are poorly documented, so a high level of suspicion should be maintained for patients receiving CPI. Intensivists should be aware in general of the known complications and appropriate management of these AE. Nevertheless, a multidisciplinary collaboration remains essential for their diagnosis and management. This review described the most severe complications related to CPI.

3863,Preclinical septic shock research: why we need an animal ICU,2019-06-10,"Animal experiments are widely used in preclinical medical research with the goal of disease modeling and exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. In the context of sepsis and septic shock, the translation into clinical practice has been disappointing. Classical animal models of septic shock usually involve one-sex-one-age animal models, mostly in mice or rats, contrasting with the heterogeneous population of septic shock patients. Many other factors limit the reliability of preclinical models and may contribute to preclinical research failure in critical care, including the host specificity of several pathogens, the fact that laboratory animals are raised in pathogen-free facilities and that organ support techniques are either absent or minimal. Advanced animal models have been developed with the aim of improving the clinical translatability of experimental findings. So-called animal ICUs refer to the preclinical investigation of adult or even aged animals of either sex, using—in case of rats and mice—miniaturized equipment allowing for reproducing an ICU environment at a small animal scale and integrating chronic comorbidities to more closely reflect the clinical conditions studied. Strength and limitations of preclinical animal models designed to decipher the mechanisms involved in septic cardiomyopathy are discussed. This article reviews the current status and the challenges of setting up an animal ICU.","Guillon, Antoine; Preau, Sebastien; Aboab, Jérôme; Azabou, Eric; Jung, Boris; Silva, Stein; Textoris, Julien; Uhel, Fabrice; Vodovar, Dominique; Zafrani, Lara; de Prost, Nicolas; Radermacher, Peter",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6557957/,48

4591,Antimicrobial-associated harm in critical care: a narrative review,2020-01-29,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is considered as the primary pathogen of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), which results in significant economic losses worldwide. Clinically, PCV2 often causes disease through coinfection with other bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus suis (S. suis), and especially the highly prevalent S. suis serotype 2 (SS2). The present study determined that continuous PCV2 infection in piglets down-regulates tight junction proteins (TJ) ZO-1 and occludin in the lungs. Swine tracheal epithelial cells (STEC) were used to explore the mechanisms and consequences of disruption of TJ, and an in vitro tracheal epithelial barrier model was established. Our results show that PCV2 infection in STEC decreases the expression levels of ZO-1 and occludin and increases the permeability of the tracheal epithelial barrier, resulting in easier translocation of SS2. Moreover, Western blot analysis indicates that PCV2 infection activates the JNK/MAPK pathway. The disruption of TJ in SETC and increased permeability of the epithelial barrier induced by PCV2 could be alleviated by inhibition of JNK phosphorylation, which indicates that the JNK/MAPK pathway regulates the expression of ZO-1 and occludin during PCV2 infection. This study allows us to better understand the mechanisms of PCV2 coinfection with bacterial pathogens and provides new insight into controlling the occurrence of PCVAD.","Wang, Qing; Zhou, Hong; Lin, Huixing; Ma, Zhe; Fan, Hongjie",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7047418/,48
4595,Impact of protocolized diuresis for de-resuscitation in the intensive care unit,2020-02-28,"Sarcocystis neurona was recognised as an important cause of mortality in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) after an outbreak in April 2004 and has since been detected in many marine mammal species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Risk of S. neurona exposure in sea otters is associated with consumption of clams and soft-sediment prey and is temporally associated with runoff events. We examined the spatial distribution of S. neurona exposure risk based on serum antibody testing and assessed risk factors for exposure in animals from California, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska. Significant spatial clustering of seropositive animals was observed in California and Washington, compared with British Columbia and Alaska. Adult males were at greatest risk for exposure to S. neurona, and there were strong associations with terrestrial features (wetlands, cropland, high human housing-unit density). In California, habitats containing soft sediment exhibited greater risk than hard substrate or kelp beds. Consuming a diet rich in clams was also associated with increased exposure risk. These findings suggest a transmission pathway analogous to that described for Toxoplasma gondii, with infectious stages traveling in freshwater runoff and being concentrated in particular locations by marine habitat features, ocean physical processes, and invertebrate bioconcentration.","Burgess, Tristan L.; Tinker, M.

5752,Current management and outcome of tracheobronchial malacia and stenosis presenting to the paediatric intensive care unit,2001-02-16,"PURPOSE: Severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) is still associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. In this point-of-view review paper, a group of experts discuss the main controversies in SCAP: the role of severity scores to guide patient settings of care and empiric antibiotic therapy; the emergence of pathogens outside the core microorganisms of CAP; viral SCAP; the best empirical treatment; septic shock as the most lethal complication; and the need for new antibiotics. METHODS: For all topics, the authors describe current controversies and evidence and provide recommendations and suggestions for future research. Evidence was based on meta-analyses, most recent RCTs and recent interventional or observational studies. Recommendations were reached by consensus of all the authors. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The IDSA/ATS criteria remain the most pragmatic tool to predict ICU admission. The authors recommend a combination of a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor or a third G cephalosporin plus a macrolide in most SCAP patients, and to empirically cover PES (P. aeruginosa, extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus) pathogens when at least two specific risk factors are present. In patients with influenza CAP, the authors recommend the use of oseltamivir and avoidance of the use of steroids. Corticosteroids can be used in case of refractory shock and high systemic inflammatory response.","Torres, Antoni; Chalmers, James D.; Dela Cruz, Charles S.; Dominedò, Cristina; Kollef, Marin; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Niederman, Michael; Wunderink, Richard G.",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094947/,48

DESIGN: Prospective study in critically ill patients. SETTING: The study was performed in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit in a university hospital. PATIENTS: 23 non-immunocompromised, mechanically ventilated patients who were anti-CMV immunoglobulin G-positive. Ten immunocompromised patients with active CMV infection and 16 asymptomatic CMV seropositive non-immunocompromised patients constituted the positive and negative control groups. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The presence of CMV in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was evaluated by both viral cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thirty-seven blood and 22 BAL samples were investigated. Sequential samples were evaluated in 8 patients. For PCR, a 290 bp fragment in the first exon of the immediate early 1 gene was amplified. In order to exclude inhibitors of PCR amplification, a 268 bp fragment of the β-globin gene was concurrently amplified in all samples. Viral cultures of blood and BAL were negative in all 23 non-immunocompromised, mechanically ventilated patients. Moreover, no CMV DNA could be amplified in blood or BAL samples, whereas a β-globin amplification was observed in all samples. CONCLUSION: In a series of 23 critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation who were seropositive for CMV, no reactivation of CMV in blood or lung was demonstrated.","Stéphan, F.; Clergue, F.; Méhari, D.; Ricci, S.; Fajac, A.; Bernaudin, J. -F.",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094969/,48
5768,Increase in lung volume originated by extrinsic PEEP in patients with auto-PEEP: The role of static lung complicance,1992,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is pleiotropic mediator of a diverse array of physiological and neurological functions, including both normal regulatory functions and immune responses to infectious agents. Its role in the nervous system is prominent but paradoxical. Studies on uninflamed or “normal” brain have generally attributed TNF-α a neuromodulatory effect. In contrast, in inflamed or diseased brain, the abundance of evidence suggests that TNF-α has an overall neurotoxic effect, which may be particularly pronounced for virally mediated neurological disease. Still others have found TNF-α to be protective under some conditions of neurological insult. It is still uncertain exactly how TNF-α is able to induce these opposing effects through receptor activation of only a limited set of cell signaling pathways. In this paper, we provide support from the literature to advance our hypothesis that one mechanism by which TNF-α can exert its paradoxical effects in the brain is via crosstalk with signaling pathways of growth factors or other cytokines.","Perry, Seth W.; Dewhurst, Stephen; Bellizzi, Matthew J.; Gelbard, Harris A.",J Neurovirol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094979/,48

5796,Management of HIV-infected patients in the intensive care unit,2020-02-03,"Objectives: To compare cortisol levels during ""low-dose"" hydrocortisone therapy to basal and ACTH-stimulated endogenous levels and to assess whether clinical course and the need for catecholamines depend on cortisol levels and/or pretreatment adrenocortical responsiveness. Design and setting: Prospective observational study in a medical ICU of a university hospital. Patients: Twenty consecutive patients with septic shock and a cardiac index of 3.5 l/min or higher, started on ""low-dose"" hydrocortisone therapy (100 mg bolus, 10 mg/h for 7 days and subsequent tapering) within 72 h of the onset of shock. Measurements and results: Basal total and free plasma cortisol levels ranged from 203 to 2169 and from 17 to 372 nmol/l. In 11 patients cortisol production was considered ""inadequate"" because there was neither a response to ACTH of at least 200 nmol/l nor a baseline level of at least 1000 nmol/l. Following the initiation of hydrocortisone therapy total and free cortisol levels increased 4.2- and 8.5-fold to median levels of 3587 (interquartile range 2679–5220) and 1210 (interquartile range 750–1846) nmol/l on day 1, and thereafter declined to median levels of 1310 nmol/l and 345 nmol/l on day 7. Patients with ""inadequate"" steroid production could be weaned from vasopressor therapy significantly faster, although their plasma free cortisol concentrations during the hydrocortisone treatment period did not differ. Conclusions: (a) During proposed regimens of ""low-dose"" hydrocortisone therapy, initially achieved plasma cortisol concentrations considerably exceed basal and ACTH stimulated levels. (b) Cortisol concentrations decline subsequently, despite continuous application of a constant dose. (c) ""Inadequate"" endogenous steroid production appears to sensitize patients to the hemodynamic effects of a ""therapeutic rise"" in plasma cortisol levels.","Oppert, Michael; Reinicke, Albrecht; Gräf, Klaus-Jürgen; Barckow, Detlef; Frei, Ulrich; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095044/,48

DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective pilot study, a level III neonatal and pediatric intensive care unit at a University children's Hospital. PATIENTS: We studied 22 ventilated pediatric (n = 15) and neonatal (n = 7) intensive care patients (aged 3 days–16 years). Inclusion criteria were mechanical ventilation and signs of at least one additional organ dysfunction (cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, hematological, or renal). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Serum concentrations of the adhesion molecules were analyzed on the day of maximum organ dysfunction score and were quantitated by a sandwich ELISA technique. The overall mortality rate was 36% (8/22). Dysfunction of three or more organ systems was defined as MODS and was associated with a significant increase in VCAM-1 serum levels relative to dysfunction of three or fewer organ systems [median 1239 ng/ml (IQR 928–1615) vs. 766 ng/ml (644–915)]. A significant difference in E-selectin serum levels was found between organ failure of infectious (median 131 ng/ml, IQR 112–146) and noninfectious origin (68 ng/ml 49–105). CONCLUSIONS: Determination of adhesion molecules in pediatric intensive care patients raises the possibility of more specific pathophysiological understanding.

All children survived. One patient failed to show supranormal DO(2) ( > 570 ml/min per m(2)). Normalization of serum bicarbonate and lactate were associated with patient recovery. One patient presented an increasingly abnormal L/P ratio with normal lactate levels, suggesting an increased utilization of pyruvate rather than an increased cytosolic redox potential. Although values of gastric pHi < 7.30 were observed in 43 % of samples, serial measurements in individuals showed significant variability and unpredictable trends. Free fatty acid concentrations, ketone body production, and carnitine levels remained within the normal range.¶Conclusions: In this study, trends in serum bicarbonate and lactate somewhat characterized the recovery of children with septic shock.

5958,Treatment of sepsis in an intensive care unit,1990,"Study objective: To determine the relationship between delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) and outcomes including length of stay in the hospital. Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: The adult medical ICU of a tertiary care, university-based medical center. Participants: The study population consisted of 48 patients admitted to the ICU, 24 of whom received mechanical ventilation. Measurements: All patients were evaluated for the development and persistence of delirium on a daily basis by a geriatric or psychiatric specialist with expertise in delirium assessment using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) criteria of the American Psychiatric Association, the reference standard for delirium ratings. Primary outcomes measured were length of stay in the ICU and hospital. Results: The mean onset of delirium was 2.6 days (S.D.±1.7), and the mean duration was 3.4±1.9 days. Of the 48 patients, 39 (81.3%) developed delirium, and of these 29 (60.4%) developed the complication while still in the ICU. The duration of delirium was associated with length of stay in the ICU (r=0.65, P=0.0001) and in the hospital (r=0.68, P<0.0001). Using multivariate analysis, delirium was the strongest predictor of length of stay in the hospital (P=0.006) even after adjusting for severity of illness, age, gender, race, and days of benzodiazepine and narcotic drug administration. Conclusions: In this patient cohort, the majority of patients developed delirium in the ICU, and delirium was the strongest independent determinant of length of stay in the hospital. Further study and monitoring of delirium in the ICU and the risk factors for its development are warranted.","Ely, E.; Gautam, S.; Margolin, R.; Francis, J.; May, L.; Speroff, T.; Truman, B.; Dittus, R.; Bernard, G.; Inouye, S.",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095464/,48

6881,Interklinisch transport van ernstig zieke of gewonde kinderen,2006,"Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in leukemic children undergoing intensive chemotherapy should be promptly recognized so that specific therapy can be started. Our experience with the two cases reported here has led us to propose guidelines for the treatment of initial PTE in a pediatric hematology unit. Two children with leukemia developed PTE, the first during the relapse for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the second at the onset of acute promyelocytic leukemia. In both cases, the diagnosis of PTE was based on clinical assessment of sudden acute respiratory failure with positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy in spite of a negative chest X-ray. The subintensive supervision consisted of instrumental monitoring with the assistance of an intensive care anesthetist. The clinical monitoring was based on the serial registration of respiratory rate, cardiac rate, SaO(2) and body temperature. The thrombolytic therapy, together with heparin prophylaxis, was successfully administered in the hematology ward without the need for intensive care support (i.e. mechanical ventilation). The success of the treatment was documented by the criterion of a return to the normal cardiorespiratory parameters a few hours after the start of the thrombolytic treatment. Furthermore, a chest CT scan in case 1 and an arteriography in case 2 confirmed the PTE-related hypoperfusion. On the basis of this experience, the authors point out that in the course of acute respiratory failure in leukemic children, the combination of a negative chest X-ray and a positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy (compared whenever possible with ventilatory scintigraphy) in the presence of a negative CT scan could be a reliable diagnostic tool for PTE. This pathology should be treated promptly and with specific therapy to avoid progression to a severe, massive PTE.","Marchi, P.; Uderzo, C.; Riva, A.; Rovelli, A.; Biagi, E.; Arrigo, C.; Marraro, G.; Masera, G.",Support Care Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102284/,48

A wide range of conditions, from asthma to parasitic infections, autoimmune diseases, and certain forms of cancer, have been known to trigger abnormally high amount of eosinophils. It is essential to reach the correct diagnosis and treat the underlying disease aggresively. Definition of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome was offered in 1980s by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for surveillance purposes, and criteria were revised in 2001, with high specificity. We report a case of 59-year old female who started a special weight-reducing diet regimen that included excessive cashew nut ingestion. Several months after she has presented with periferal blood eosinophilia and constitutional symptoms. Detailed work-up has not found elements for haematological, systemic autoimmune, neoplastic or infectious disease. She was diagnosed with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome due to extreme L-tryptophan intake, a compound found in the cashew nut’s oil. She responded well to cashew nut withdrawal and steroid therapy. In the follow-up period she remained stable with normal eosinophil count and there was not a need for any specific therapy.","Barešić, Marko; Bosnić, Dubravka; Bakula, Marija; Žarković, Kamelija",Cent Eur J Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102313/,48

9611,Use of Blood Components in the Intensive Care Unit,2009-05-15,"Congenital heart disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (CHD-PAH) is one of the major complications in patients with CHD. A timely closure of the left-to-right shunt will generally result in the normalization of the pulmonary hemodynamics, but a few patients have severe prognosis in their early childhood. We hypothesized that wide-ranging pathological mechanism in PAH could elucidate the clinical state of severe CHD-PAH. Using electronic medical records, we retrospectively analyzed six infants with severe CHD-PAH who had treatment-resistant PH. All patients were born with congenital malformation syndrome. After starting on a pulmonary vasodilator, five of the six patients developed complications including pulmonary edema and interstitial lung disease (ILD), and four patients had alveolar hemorrhage. After steroid therapy, the clinical condition improved in four patients, but two patients died. The autopsy findings in one of the deceased patients indicated the presence of recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary venous hypertension, ILD, and PAH. Based on the clinical course of these CHD-PAH in patients and the literature, CHD-PAH can occur with pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (PVOD)/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH), ILD, and/or alveolar hemorrhage. The severity of CHD-PAH may depend on a genetic disorder, respiratory infection, and upper airway stenosis. Additionally, pulmonary vasodilators may be involved in the development of PVOD/PCH and ILD. When patients with CHD-PAH show unexpected deterioration, clinicians should consider complications associated with PVOD/PCH and/or pulmonary disease. In addition, the choice of upfront combination therapy for pediatric patients with CHD-PAH should be selected carefully.","Chida-Nagai, Ayako; Sagawa, Koichi; Tsujioka, Takao; Fujimoto, Takanori; Taniguchi, Kota; Sasaki, Osamu; Izumi, Gaku; Yamazawa, Hirokuni; Masaki, Naoki; Manabe, Atsushi; Takeda, Atsuhito",Heart Vessels,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152743/,48

However, little is known about the current evolution and therapeutic limitations of HFOV. We therefore aimed to describe its use in clinical practice and predict the risk of mortality for neonates receiving HFOV. A retrospective observational study of all neonates treated with HFOV in a quaternary referral NICU between January 2007 and December 2016 was conducted. We classified these patients into five subgroups based on primary respiratory diagnoses. We performed the logistic regression and decision tree regression analyses to identify independent factors of 30-day mortality following HFOV. A total of 1125 patients who were ever supported on HFOV were enrolled, of whom 64.1% received HFOV as a rescue therapy, 27.2% received it as an elective therapy, and 8.7% received it for air leak. An average oxygenation index (OI) greater than 25 in the first 24 hours after the initiation of HFOV and patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension were found to have the greatest risk of in-hospital mortality (p < 0.0001). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 25.8% (290/1125). Decision tree regression analysis revealed that neonates with refractory respiratory failure who had a pre-HFOV OI value higher than 20.5 and OI values higher than 21.5, 23.5 and 34 at 2 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours after the use of HFOV, respectively, had a significantly increased risk of 30-day mortality. We identified the predictors and cutoff points of OI before and after the initiation of HFOV in neonates with respiratory failure, which can be clinically used as a reference for 30-day mortality. Further efforts are still needed to optimize the outcomes.","Yang, Mei-Chin; Hsu, Jen-Fu; Hsiao, Hsiu-Feng; Yang, Lan-Yan; Pan, Yu-Bin; Lai, Mei-Yin; Chu, Shih-Ming; Huang, Hsuan-Rong; Chiang, Ming-Chou; Fu, Ren-Huei; Tsai, Ming-Horng",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171122/,48

A systematic evidence review (SER) can support future evidence-based guideline development for use of ES/GS in this patient population. METHODS: We undertook an SER to identify primary literature from January 2007 to March 2019 describing health, clinical, reproductive, and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in patients with CA/DD/ID. A narrative synthesis of results was performed. RESULTS: We retrieved 2654 publications for full-text review from 7178 articles. Only 167 articles met our inclusion criteria, and these were primarily case reports or small case series of fewer than 20 patients. The most frequently reported outcomes from ES/GS were changes to clinical management or reproductive decision-making. Two studies reported on the reduction of mortality or morbidity or impact on quality of life following ES/GS. CONCLUSION: There is evidence that ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID informs clinical and reproductive decision-making, which could lead to improved outcomes for patients and their family members. Further research is needed to generate evidence regarding health outcomes to inform robust guidelines regarding ES/GS in the care of patients with CA/DD/ID.","Malinowski, Jennifer; Miller, David T.; Demmer, Laurie; Gannon, Jennifer; Pereira, Elaine Maria; Schroeder, Molly C.; Scheuner, Maren T.; Tsai, Anne Chun-Hui; Hickey, Scott E.; Shen, Jun",Genet Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222126/,48
11216,Left ventricular overloading identified by critical care echocardiography is key in weaning-induced pulmonary edema,2020-05-06,"Public-interest goods benefit consumers and also generate external benefits boosting societal welfare. Despite this characteristic of these goods, their level of consumption or production are generally well below the socially desirable levels without intervention. Motivated by influenza vaccine market, this paper examines the intervention design problem for a public-interest good facing yield uncertainty in production as well as inefficiencies in distribution and allocation. The proposed mechanism considers two intervention tools with the aim of resolving the inefficiencies in the system and allowing the actors to take socially desirable decisions. The first tool is to intervene so that demand level for the good is increased; we call it demand increasing strategy. The second tool aims to support the production, allocation, and distribution by investing in research and development and better planning and enhances the availability; we call this as availability increasing strategy. The intervention design problem is based on stylized demand and availability models that take into account investments made to improve them. The model suggested is experimented by a numerical study to analyze the impact of applying proposed joint mechanism in US influenza vaccine market. The results show that proposed strategy is very effectual in terms of vaccination percentages achieved and budget savings realized beyond the current practices, and the improvement in vaccination percentages is even greater when uncertainty in the system is higher. Besides, the results suggest that as long as the parameter calibration and decision problems are solved consistently, availability can be approximated by its average value when necessary.","Demirci, Ece Zeliha; Erkip, Nesim Kohen",Flex Serv Manuf J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223427/,48
11225,External validation of a prognostic model for intensive care unit mortality: a retrospective study using the Ontario Critical Care Information System,2020-05-07,"Both public administration scholars and practitioners believe that “good governance” relies on the involvement of compassionate officials. However, they overlook the fact that “compassion fatigue” often occurs when officials face the dual pressure arising from superiors’ orders and empathy for service receivers. This would inevitably not only affect their individual behaviors, but also influence the effectiveness of their service. A full-scale investigation of animal protection administrators in Taiwan was conducted so as to analyze compassion fatigue that civil servants would encounter and further establish a relationship between various variables and the hypotheses of this study by combining the studies of public administration and psychology. It should be noted that compassion fatigue may affect animal protection administrators’ mental health in spite of little influence on their willingness to work hard. However, both “mindfulness” and “moral disengagement” are coping strategies which were developed for helping tackle the dilemma of compassion fatigue. Although applying the strategy of mindfulness can generate more positive impacts on individuals and organizations than that of moral disengagement, animal protection administrators tended to adopt the latter. Accordingly, encouraging animal protection administrators to adopt mindfulness instead of moral disengagement as their coping strategy will be a priority of work for the authorities in the future.","Wu, Chuang-Hsien",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223445/,48

This research study consists of a newly proposed mathematical system for transmission dynamics of the measles epidemic. The measles system is based upon mass action principle wherein human population is divided into five mutually disjoint compartments: susceptible S(t)—vaccinated V(t)—exposed E(t)—infectious I(t)—recovered R(t). Using real measles cases reported from January 2019 to October 2019 in Pakistan, the system has been validated. Two unique equilibria called measles-free and endemic (measles-present) are shown to be locally asymptotically stable for basic reproductive number [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] , respectively. While using Lyapunov functions, the equilibria are found to be globally asymptotically stable under the former conditions on [Formula: see text] . However, backward bifurcation shows coexistence of stable endemic equilibrium with a stable measles-free equilibrium for [Formula: see text] . A strategy for measles control based on herd immunity is presented. The forward sensitivity indices for [Formula: see text] are also computed with respect to the estimated and fitted biological parameters. Finally, numerical simulations exhibit dynamical behavior of the measles system under influence of its parameters which further suggest improvement in both the vaccine efficacy and its coverage rate for substantial reduction in the measles epidemic.","Memon, Zaibunnisa; Qureshi, Sania; Memon, Bisharat Rasool",Eur Phys J Plus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223692/,48

This study examines effects of geriatric-specific variables on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing elective major abdominal operations. METHODS: Patients included in the ACS NSQIP pilot Geriatric Surgery Research File program who underwent elective pancreatic, liver, and colorectal operations between 2014 and 2016 were examined. Multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate associations between patient-specific geriatric variables and risk of death, morbidity, readmission, and discharge destination. RESULTS: A total of 4165 patients were included. Patients ≥85 years were more likely to die, experience postoperative morbidity, and be discharged to a facility (all p ≤ 0.039) than younger patients. Preoperatively, patients ≥85 years were more likely to use a mobility aid, have a prior fall, have consent signed by a surrogate, and to live alone at home prior to operation (all p < 0.001). After adjustment for ACS NSQIP-estimated probabilities of morbidity or mortality, no geriatric-specific preoperative risk factors were significantly associated with increased risk of death or complications in any age group (all p > 0.055). Patients 75–84 and ≥85 years were more likely to be discharged to facility (OR 2.33 and 4.75, respectively, both p < 0.001) compared to patients 65–74 years. All geriatric-specific variables: use of mobility aid, living alone, consent signed by a surrogate, and fall history, were significantly associated with discharge to a facility (all p ≤ 0.001).

For this purpose, recombinant viral vectors and their heterologous prime-boost vaccinations, EBV-derived virus-like particles and viral envelope glycoprotein formulations are explored and are discussed in this review. Even so, cell-mediated immune control by cytotoxic lymphocytes protects healthy virus carriers from EBV-associated malignancies, antibodies might be able to prevent symptomatic primary infection, the most likely EBV-associated pathology against which EBV vaccines will be initially tested. Thus, the variety of EBV vaccines reflects the sophisticated life cycle of this human tumor virus and only vaccination in humans will finally be able to reveal the efficacy of these candidates. Nevertheless, the recently renewed efforts to develop an EBV vaccine and the long history of safe adoptive T cell transfer to treat EBV-associated malignancies suggest that this oncogenic γ-herpesvirus can be targeted by immunotherapies. Such vaccination should ideally implement the very same immune control that protects healthy EBV carriers.","Rühl, Julia; Leung, Carol S.; Münz, Christian",Cell Mol Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223886/,48

A cross-sectional survey was carried out by questionnaire to investigate knowledge of cervical cancer, HPV, and HPV vaccination. The 230 female participants were native residents of northeastern China, and their ages ranged between 18 and 65 years. Questionnaires were randomly acquired by the respondents from online and paper questionnaire distribution. The questionnaire included questions on three major aspects to record people’s perceptions of cervical cancer, HPV, and vaccines. Of the sample of 230 women surveyed, 80.9% had heard of cervical cancer, but understanding was only 15.7%; 38.3% knew about HPV; 20% knew about HPV vaccine; 39.6% agreed to receive HPV vaccination, and the remainder were mainly concerned about its safety and effectiveness. Data analysis showed that age, family income, and whether there was experience of screening all influenced knowledge of cervical cancer, but this was not statistically significant. The level of education had no obvious effect on the degree of knowledge about cervical cancer; however, with an improvement in education, women’s awareness of HPV vaccine improved significantly (p < 0.05). Women who have received cervical cancer screening had significantly greater knowledge about cervical cancer and HPV than those with no screening (p < 0.05). Women in northeastern China have little knowledge of cervical cancer, HPV, and HPV vaccine, lack disease knowledge, and hold a skeptical attitude about HPV vaccination. Medical institutions are the main channel providing information to these women.","Ning, Yu-e; Liu, Yao; Xu, Xiao-yu; Zhang, Xin-yu; Wang, Ning; Zheng, Li-qiang",J Cancer Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7677602/,48

We aimed to determine whether ventilation strategies using higher PEEP and/or RMs could decrease mortality in patients with ARDS. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL from 1996 to December 2019, included randomized controlled trials comparing ventilation with higher PEEP and/or RMs to strategies with lower PEEP and no RMs in patients with ARDS. We computed pooled estimates with a DerSimonian-Laird mixed-effects model, assessing mortality and incidence of barotrauma, population characteristics, physiologic variables and ventilator settings. We performed a trial sequential analysis (TSA) and a meta-regression. RESULTS: Excluding two studies that used tidal volume (V(T)) reduction as co-intervention, we included 3870 patients from 10 trials using higher PEEP alone (n = 3), combined with RMs (n = 6) or RMs alone (n = 1). We did not observe differences in mortality (relative risk, RR 0.96, 95% confidence interval, CI [0.84–1.09], p = 0.50) nor in incidence of barotrauma (RR 1.22, 95% CI [0.93–1.61], p = 0.16). In the meta-regression, the PEEP difference between intervention and control group at day 1 and the use of RMs were not associated with increased risk of barotrauma. The TSA reached the required information size for mortality (n = 2928), and the z-line surpassed the futility boundary. CONCLUSIONS: At low V(T), the routine use of higher PEEP and/or RMs did not reduce mortality in unselected patients with ARDS.

This randomized, controlled study enrolled a total of 110 caregivers of first-ever acute stroke patients, and randomly assigned to EMR (N = 55) and control (N = 55) groups. The caregivers in the EMR group received 12-month health education and progressive muscle relaxation, and those in control group were provided common rehabilitation advices. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale in caregivers were evaluated at the time of patients’ discharge from hospital (M0), then at month(M) 3, M6 and M12 after the discharge. HADS-anxiety score, anxiety rate and severity were similar at M0, M3, while were reduced at M6 and M12 in EMR group compared to control group. Furthermore, HADS-depression score was similar at M0 and M3 but was decreased at M6 and M12 in EMR group compared with control group, however, there was no difference of depression rate and severity between the 2 groups at each time point. Moreover, Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale score was similar at M0 and M3, but was decreased at M6 and M12; meanwhile, degree of care burden was similar at M0, M3 and M6, but was reduced at M12 in EMR group compared to control group. EMR program decreases anxiety, depression and care burden in caregivers of acute stroke survivors, suggesting its potential in improving mental health and further promoting quality of lives in these caregivers.","Wang, Jinhong; Liu, Jie; Li, Ling; Man, Jing; Yue, Shihong; Liu, Zhaojun",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7850736/,48

The work aimed to evaluate the economic and health impact for the Local Health Agency Barletta-Andria-Trani (BT). Through the Regional Information System data about naïve patients on NOAC treatment and patients on anti-vitamin-k (VKA), treatments were extrapolated. We assessed therapeutic continuity, pharmaceutical expenditure, hospitalizations, and deaths in 2017 and 2018. Therapeutic continuity was similar in the two groups. The number and the average cost of hospitalizations for a patient treated with VKAs were almost constant, while those of patients treated with NOACs decreased. The treatment of adult-aged naïve patients with NOACs, compared to VKAs therapy, involves an increase in expenditure of about 100€ for a patient, but the reduced hospitalizations could generate, in the long term, saving for the Health System. Clinical data, according to the Real-World Data, confirmed the safety and effectiveness of these drugs. However, attention to the special population is necessary to improve the safety and effectiveness of NOACs. Innovative formulations for pediatric patients are being developed. The challenge for Health Systems is the appropriate use of available resources through health interventions with transversal competences.","Grimaldi, Gianluca; Ancona, Domenica; Tricarico, Domenico; Stella, Paolo; Procacci, Cataldo; Germinario, Antonio; Bavaro, Vito; Montanaro, Vito; Delle Donne, Alessandro",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7918324/,48
16031,A critical care pandemic staffing framework in Australia – Authors' response,2021-03-09,"Lassa virus (LASV) belongs to the Mammarenavirus genus (family Arenaviridae) and causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. The glycoprotein complex (GPC) contains eleven N-linked glycans that play essential roles in GPC functionalities such as cleavage, transport, receptor recognition, epitope shielding, and immune response. We used three mutagenesis strategies (asparagine to glutamine, asparagine to alanine, and serine/tyrosine to alanine mutants) to abolish individual glycan chain on GPC and found that all the three strategies led to cleavage inefficiency on the 2nd (N89), 5th (N119), or 8th (N365) glycosylation motif. To evaluate N to Q mutagenesis for further research, it was found that deletion of the 2nd (N89Q) or 8th (N365Q) glycan completely inhibited the transduction efficiency of pseudotyped particles. We further investigated the role of individual glycan on GPC-mediated immune response by DNA immunization of mice. Deletion of the individual 1st (N79Q), 3rd (N99Q), 5th (N119Q), or 6th (N167Q) glycan significantly enhanced the proportion of effector CD4(+) cells, whereas deletion of the 1st (N79Q), 2nd (N89Q), 3rd (N99Q), 4th (N109Q), 5th (N119Q), 6th (N167Q), or 9th (N373Q) glycan enhanced the proportion of CD8(+) effector T cells. Deletion of specific glycan improves the Th1-type immune response, and abolishment of glycan on GPC generally increases the antibody titer to the glycan-deficient GPC. However, the antibodies from either the mutant or WT GPC-immunized mice show little neutralization effect on wild-type LASV. The glycan residues on GPC provide an immune shield for the virus, and thus represent a target for the design and development of a vaccine.

16368,Emergence of Nosocomial Pneumonia Caused by Colistin-Resistant Escherichia coli in Patients Admitted to Chest Intensive Care Unit,2021-02-24,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension are common chronic diseases mainly associated with the development and progression of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) leading to morbidity and mortality. Gene polymorphisms linked to the renin–angiotensin (AGT)–aldosterone system (RAAS) were broadly inspected in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) and hypertension. This study aimed to investigate the association of AGT gene polymorphisms (rs699 and rs4762) with ESRD in T2DM hypertensive Egyptian patients. Genotyping of rs699 and rs4762 was conducted using the tetra-primers amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS-PCR). The allelic distribution analysis was performed on 103 healthy control subjects, 97 non-ESRD patients, and 104 patients with ESRD. The allelic frequencies of AGT gene polymorphisms (rs4762 and rs699) in all study participants were assessed. For the non-ESRD group, the frequencies of the alleles of AGT-rs4762 (χ(2) = 31.88, p < 0.001, OR = 5.17, CI 95%: 2.81–9.51) and AGT-rs699 (χ(2) = 4.85, p = 0.027, OR = 1.56, CI 95%: 1.05–2.33) were significantly associated with the non-ESRD group. However, for the ESRD group, the T allele was significantly higher than that in the controls (χ(2) = 24.97, p < 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 4.35, CI 95%: 2.36–8.02). Moreover, AGT (rs699) genotypes showed no significant difference between the ESRD group and controls. In conclusion, AGT gene polymorphisms rs699 and rs4762 were associated with non-ESRD versus controls, without any significant risk observed in all patient groups. However, the AGT (rs4762) variant showed a significant risk in the ESRD group in comparison to controls in Egyptians.","El-Garawani, Islam M.; Shaheen, Eman M.; El-Seedi, Hesham R.; Khalifa, Shaden A.

16429,Impact of structured care systems on mortality in intensive care units,2021-03-27,"BACKGROUND: Gram-negative bacteria are an uncommon etiology of spontaneous community-acquired adult meningitis and meningoencephalitis. Escherichia coli is a Gram-negative bacterium that is normally present in the intestinal microbial pool. Some Escherichia coli strains can cause diseases in humans and animals, with both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations (extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli) such as urinary tract infections, bacteremia with sepsis, and, more rarely, meningitis. Meningitis continues to be an important cause of mortality throughout the world, despite progress in antimicrobial chemotherapy and supportive therapy. The mortality rate fluctuates between 15% and 40%, and about 50% of the survivors report neurological sequelae. The majority of Escherichia coli meningitis cases develop as a result of hematogenous spread, with higher degrees of bacteremia also being related to worse prognosis. Cases presenting with impaired consciousness (that is, coma) are also reported to have poorer outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 48-year-old caucasian woman with meningoencephalitis, with a marked alteration of consciousness on admission, and septic shock secondary to pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli, treated with targeted antimicrobial therapy and immunoglobulin-M-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin) preparation as adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSION: Despite the dramatic presentation of the patient on admission, the conflicting data on the use of immunoglobulins in septic shock, and the lack of evidence regarding their use in adult Escherichia coli meningoencephalitis, we obtained a remarkable improvement of her clinical condition, accompanied by partial resolution of her neurological deficits.","Pota, V.; Passavanti, M.

16779,Validation of the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool-Neuro in brain-injured adults in the intensive care unit: a prospective cohort study,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Prognostic uncertainty is a challenge for physicians in the neuro intensive care field. Questions about whether continued life-sustaining treatment is in a patient’s best interests arise in different phases after a severe traumatic brain injury. In-depth information about how physicians deal with ethical issues in different contexts is lacking. The purpose of this study was to seek insight into clinicians’ strategies concerning unresolved prognostic uncertainty and their ethical reasoning on the issue of limitation of life-sustaining treatment in patients with minimal or no signs of neurological improvement after severe traumatic brain injury in the later trauma hospital phase. METHODS: Interviews with 18 physicians working in a neurointensive care unit in a large Norwegian trauma hospital, followed by a qualitative thematic analysis focused on physicians’ strategies related to treatment-limiting decision-making. RESULTS: A divide between proactive and wait-and-see strategies emerged. Notwithstanding the hospital’s strong team culture, inter-physician variability with regard to ethical reasoning and preferred strategies was exposed. All the physicians emphasized the importance of team—family interactions. Nevertheless, their strategies differed: (1) The proactive physicians were open to consider limitations of life-sustaining treatment when the prognosis was grim. They initiated ethical discussions, took leadership in clarification and deliberation processes regarding goals and options, saw themselves as guides for the families and believed in the necessity to prepare families for both best-case and worst-case scenarios. (2) The “wait-and-see” physicians preferred open-ended treatment (no limitations). Neurologically injured patients need time to uncover their true recovery potential, they argued. They often avoided talking to the family about dying or other worst-case scenarios during this phase. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the individual physician in charge, ethical issues may rest unresolved or not addressed in the later trauma hospital phase. Nevertheless, team collaboration serves to mitigate inter-physician variability. There are problems and pitfalls to be aware of related to both proactive and wait-and-see approaches. The timing of best-interest discussions and treatment-limiting decisions remain challenging after severe traumatic brain injury. Routines for timely and open discussions with families about the range of ethically reasonable options need to be strengthened.","Robertsen, Annette; Helseth, Eirik; Førde, Reidun",BMC Med Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8043091/,48

18649,"Proceedings of Reanimation 2021, the French Intensive Care Society International Congress",2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy is one of the most frequent techniques in intensive care units (ICU). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) is a safety measure when performing a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT), but the controversy surrounding the routine use of FB as part of the procedure remains open. National surveys in some European countries showed that the use of FB is non-standardized. Retrospective studies have not shown a significant difference in complications between procedures performed with or without a bronchoscope. International guidelines have not been able to establish recommendations regarding the use of FB in PDT due to lack of evidence. DESIGN: This is a multicenter (three centers at the time of publishing this paper) randomized controlled clinical trial to examine the safety of percutaneous tracheostomy using FB. We will include all consecutive adult patients admitted to the ICU in whom percutaneous tracheostomy for prolonged mechanical ventilation is indicated and with no exclusion criteria for using FB. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive blind PDT or PDT under endoscopic guidance. All procedures will be performed by experienced intensivists in PDT and FB. A Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor the trial. The primary outcome is the incidence of perioperative complications. DISCUSSION: FB is a safe technique when performing PDT although its use is not universally accepted in all ICUs as a routine practice. Should PDT be monitored routinely with endoscopic guidance? This study will assess the role of FB monitoring during PDT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04265625.

METHODS: This cluster randomized trial with 1:1 allocation of clusters to intervention and control arm was conducted in the public and private schools of Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka, over a period of 10 months. Study participants included children from standard 5–7 in schools selected for the study. 10 schools that could accommodate 1100 students each, were randomly allocated to the interventional and control arm. A comprehensive child safety and injury prevention module was developed based on the opinions of school teachers through focus group discussions. This module was periodically taught to the students of intervention arm by the teachers. The children in control arm did not receive any intervention. Outcome was assessed by determining the incidence of unintentional injuries and type of injuries from the questionnaire used at the baseline, and at the end of three, six, and ten months. RESULTS: Unintentional injuries declined progressively from baseline until the end of the study in both the interventional arm (from 52.9% to 2.5%) and control arm (from 44.7% to 32%) [AOR (95% CI) 0.458 (0.405–0.518); P value <0.001]. The decline in incidence of injuries in the interventional arm was higher than that in the control arm (50.4% vs 12.7%; P <0.001).

Among these, personality traits have received consistent and significant attention, with a particular emphasis on conscientiousness. To delve deeper and detail these aspects, in the present research, a moderation model was hypothesized, with the aim of investigating the effect of age on the association between conscientiousness (and its subdimensions scrupulousness and perseverance) and job satisfaction. The age-moderated interactions of the other Big Five personality traits were also explored. The study involved 202 Italian workers (92 men, 110 women) with a mean age of 44.82 years (SD = 10.56) who completed the Big Five Questionnaire and the Job Satisfaction Scale. The results showed a positive association between conscientiousness and job satisfaction. This was moderated by age to the extent that it was significant for younger and average-age workers and was less significant for older workers. Similar results were found for the subdomain of perseverance, while the relationship between scrupulousness and job satisfaction was not significant. Furthermore, no age-moderated interaction between the other Big Five personality traits and Job satisfaction were found. Such data supports interactive models that highlight the need to integrate personality traits with other factors in exploring the antecedents of job satisfaction. These findings provide additional elements to an understanding of the factors contributing to workers satisfaction, and could have important applicative implications in a framework for healthy organizations and the well-being movement.","Topino, Eleonora; Di Fabio, Annamaria; Palazzeschi, Letizia; Gori, Alessio",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8313029/,48

Due to its rarity, the diagnosis of GS is often missed. METHODS: We used the hospital information system to retrospectively screen thymoma and hypogammaglobulinemia patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from Apr 2012 to Apr 2020. The clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data for these patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 181 screened thymoma patients, 5 thymoma patients with hypogammaglobulinemia were identified; 3 patients had confirmed diagnoses of GS, and the other 2 did not have a diagnosis of GS recorded in the hospital information system. A retrospective review of the clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and follow-up data for these 2 undiagnosed patients confirmed the diagnosis of GS. All 5 GS patients presented with pneumonia, 2 patients presented with recurrent skin abscesses, 2 patients presented with recurrent cough and expectoration, 1 patient presented with recurrent oral lichen planus and diarrhea, and 1 patient presented with tuberculosis and granulomatous epididymitis. In the years after the diagnosis of hypogammaglobulinemia with mild symptoms, all 5 patients had received irregular intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. As the course of the disease progressed, the clinical symptoms of all patients worsened, but the symptoms were partly resolved with IVIG in these patients. However, 4 patients died due to comorbidities. CONCLUSION: GS should be investigated as a possible diagnosis in thymoma patients who present with hypogammaglobulinemia, especially those with recurrent opportunistic infections, recurrent skin abscesses, chronic diarrhea, or recurrent lichen planus.","Ni, Jinyao; Zhang, Junwu; Chen, Yanxia; Wang, Weizhong; Liu, Jinlin",BMC Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328998/,48

22000,Handgrip strength to predict extubation outcome: a prospective multicenter trial,2021-10-02,"BACKGROUND: Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is common in critically ill patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. High positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) can reverse lung volume and oxygenation decline caused by IAH, but its impact on alveolar overdistension is less clear. We aimed to find a PEEP range that would be high enough to reduce atelectasis, while low enough to minimize alveolar overdistention in the presence of IAH and lung injury. METHODS: Five anesthetized pigs received standardized anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. Peritoneal insufflation of air was used to generate intra-abdominal pressure of 27 cmH(2)O. Lung injury was created by intravenous oleic acid. PEEP levels of 5, 12, 17, 22, and 27 cmH(2)O were applied. We performed computed tomography and measured arterial oxygen levels, respiratory mechanics, and cardiac output 5 min after each new PEEP level. The proportion of overdistended, normally aerated, poorly aerated, and non-aerated atelectatic lung tissue was calculated based on Hounsfield units. RESULTS: PEEP decreased the proportion of poorly aerated and atelectatic lung, while increasing normally aerated lung. Overdistension increased with each incremental increase in applied PEEP. “Best PEEP” (respiratory mechanics or oxygenation) was higher than the “optimal CT inflation PEEP range” (difference between lower inflection points of atelectatic and overdistended lung) in healthy and injured lungs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in a large animal model suggest that titrating a PEEP to respiratory mechanics or oxygenation in the presence of IAH is associated with increased alveolar overdistension.

22047,Effect of oral chlorhexidine de-adoption and implementation of an oral care bundle on mortality for mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (CHORAL): a multi-center stepped wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial,2021-10-05,"BACKGROUND: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease involving the neuromuscular junction. Myasthenic crisis (MC), which is characterized by respiratory failure and the requirement of mechanical ventilation in patients with MG, is still a medical emergency despite the decrease in mortality with the advances in acute management. Hemogram is a cost-effective test for evaluating hematological complications and systemic inflammation, and hemogram data have been used to predict various clinical outcomes of several diseases. The relationship between hemogram and MG has been discussed, but the role of hemogram data in predicting the prognosis of MC patients has not been established. METHODS: To identify whether hemogram data can predict in-hospital mortality in patients with MC, we retrospectively investigated 188 myasthenic crisis events from the Chang Gung Research Database between April 2001 and March 2019. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected, as well as hemogram data before intubation and extubation. The endpoints were mortality during mechanical ventilation and mortality after extubation. RESULTS: The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 22%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis for predicting mortality during mechanical ventilation showed that old age at MC onset (OR = 1.039, p = 0.022), moderate-to-severe anemia (OR = 5.851, p = 0.001), and extreme leukocytosis (OR = 5.659, p = 0.022) before intubation were strong predictors of mortality, while acute management with plasma exchange or double-filtration plasmapheresis (PE/DFPP) significantly decreased mortality (OR = 0.236, p = 0.012). For predicting mortality after extubation, moderate-to-severe anemia before extubation (OR = 8.452, p = 0.017) and non-treated with disease-modifying therapy before MC (OR = 5.459, p = 0.031) were crucial predictive factors. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that both old age at MC onset and moderate-to-severe anemia are important predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with MC, and extreme leukocytosis is another crucial predictor of mortality during mechanical ventilation. The suggested mechanism is that anemia-induced hypoxia may enhance the release of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbate systemic inflammation, and lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and, finally, mortality.","Hsu, Che-Wei; Chen, Nai-Ching; Huang, Wei-Chin; Lin, Hui-Chen; Tsai, Wan-Chen; Huang, Chih-Cheng; Cheng, Ben-Chung; Tsai, Nai-Wen",BMC Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493047/,48
22285,Design and implementation of needs-specific critical care response teams,2007-03-22,"This study uses protection motivation theory (PMT) to examine the quitting intentions and behaviours of smokers who have varying levels of nicotine dependence. Our goals are to identify the psychological factors that influence smoking cessation and to provide valuable evidence to promote theory-guided interventions. This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted from July to August 2020. Participants were randomly selected on the streets of 26 provinces on mainland China. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews. Our analysis was conducted in three steps. First, we employed descriptive statistics to present the overall characteristics of our sample. Second, we analysed the association between PMT constructs and quitting intentions stratified by nicotine dependence. Third, we tested how quitting intentions were associated with quitting behaviours in each subgroup using logistic regression models. For intention, almost all the PMT constructs were significantly associated with quitting intention in the low-dependence group. For the moderate- and high-dependence groups, only perceived vulnerability (coefficient = 0.35, P = 0.04) was positively associated with quitting intention. For behaviour, we found a stronger association between quitting intention and behaviour in the low-dependence group (Coef. = 1.67, P = 0.00) than for the other groups. We found a significant association between e-cigarette use and quitting behaviour only in the low-dependence group (Coef. = 1.34, P = 0.00). Coefficients for the moderate- and high-dependence groups were not statistically significant. Smokers at various levels of nicotine dependence have different psychological factors that influence their intentions to stop smoking. Quitting intention was more significantly associated with quitting behaviour for the low nicotine-dependence group than for the other groups. More convincing research is necessary to determine how e-cigarette use affects quitting behaviour in the long term.","Lin, Haoxiang; Chen, Meijun; Yun, Qingping; Zhang, Lanchao; Chang, Chun",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511040/,48

In this work, whole and separated skin pomaces from fermented (red) and un-fermented (white) grape by-products were characterized for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in order to exploit them as functional food ingredient. Antioxidant activity, measured by both ORAC and TEAC assays, was higher in whole than in skin pomace extracts. The characterization of phenolic composition in whole and skin pomace extracts confirmed the peculiarity of some compounds such as anthocyanins (107.84 + 10.3 mg/g TP) in red skin pomace and a great amount of flavanols (80.73 + 4.04 mg/g TP) in white skin pomace. Whole and skin pomace extracts displayed the same antibacterial activity at 250 µg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/mL. Red and white skin pomace extracts showed a Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 31.25–62.5 GAE/mL against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Pseudomonas spp. were more sensitive to red skin pomace extracts rather than white skin pomace extracts. Given these results, both red and white pomace extracts could be exploited for future application in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry.","Gerardi, Carmela; Pinto, Loris; Baruzzi, Federico; Giovinazzo, Giovanna",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8512049/,48

Herein, we provide data of a comparative study on optimization of transfection condition by electroporation and chemical methods for Huh-7 and Vero cells. Different cell confluencies, DNA/reagent ratios and total transfection volumes were optimized for two chemical reagents including jetPEI™ and Lipofectamine™ 2000. Besides, the effects of electric field strength and pulse length were investigated to improve electroporation efficiency. Transfection of cells by pEGFP-N1 vector and tracking the expression of GFP by FACS and Fluorescence Microscopy analysis were the employed methods to evaluate transfection efficiencies. Optimized electroporation protocols yielded 63.73 ± 2.36 and 73.9 ± 1.6% of transfection in Huh-7 and Vero cells respectively, while maximum achieved level of transfection by jetPEI™ was 14.2 ± 0.69 and 28 ± 1.11% Huh-7 and Vero cells, respectively. Post transfectional chilling of the cells did not improve electrotransfection efficiency of Huh-7 cells. Compared to chemical based reagents, electroporation showed superior levels of transfection in both cell lines.

The basic reproduction numbers r (0)(F) (t) and R (0)(F)(t) are defined for the bird with the avian influenza and for the human with the mutant avian influenza of the free boundary problem, respectively. Properties of these two time-dependent basic reproduction numbers are obtained. Sufficient conditions both for spreading and for vanishing of the avian influenza are given. It is shown that if r (0)(F) (0) < 1 and the initial number of the infected birds is small, the avian influenza vanishes in the bird world. Furthermore, if r (0)(F) (0) < 1 and R (0)(F)(0) < 1, the avian influenza vanishes in the bird and human worlds. In the case that r (0)(F) (0) < 1 and R (0)(F)(0) > 1, spreading of the mutant avian influenza in the human world is possible.

Moderate and strong water deficit decreased the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and biomass production. Water use efficiency and the root-to-shoot ratio increased significantly in response to water deficit, indicating a high tolerance to drought. Weak water deficit did not decrease root biomass production, but significantly increased the production of glycyrrhizic acid (by 89%) and liquiritin (by 125%) in the roots.

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence, patients’ characteristics, length of stay and mortality for US adults hospitalized with CAP due to Sp-PCV13VT. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of adults hospitalized between October 7, 2013 and September 30, 2016 with radiographically confirmed CAP in 19 centers in the US. Patients were included if the following 5 criteria were met: 1) Age 18 years and older; 2) Presence of two or more of the following: fever, hypothermia, chills or rigors, pleuritic chest pain, cough, sputum production, dyspnea, tachypnea, malaise, and abnormal auscultatory findings suggestive of pneumonia; 3) Radiographic finding consistent with pneumonia; 4) Able to provide urine sample; 5) Signed informed consent. The presence of Sp-PCV13VT was investigated using a Luminex-based urinary antigen detection (UAD) assay or serotyping from a positive Sp isolate. Data on patients’ characteristics, length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality (IHM) were collected. RESULTS: From a total of 12,055 hospitalized patients with CAP, VT Sp-PCV13 was detected in 552 patients via UAD or culture (4.6%). Among patients hospitalized with CAP due to Sp-PCV13VT, median age was 64 years, and the most common comorbidities were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (46.2%) and diabetes (27.3%). Median LOS was 6 days, and IHM was 5.4%. There were no clinically significant differences when this population was compared with the population of patients with non-PCV13 VT Sp-CAP. CONCLUSION: In approximately 5% of US adults hospitalized with CAP, the etiologic agent is VT Sp-PCV13. Clinical characteristics and outcomes in this population were similar when compared with the general population of hospitalized patients with CAP. In conclusion, this study indicates a persistent burden of disease for adult patients hospitalized with CAP due to vaccine preventable Sp serotypes.

23878,Postoperative Care of the Liver-Transplant Patient,2010,"A decline in immune function is a hallmark of aging that leads to complicated illness from a variety of infectious diseases, cancer and other immune-mediated disorders, and may limit the ability to appropriately respond to vaccination. How vaccines might alter the senescent immune response and what are the immune correlates of protection will be addressed from the perspective of 1) stimulating a previously primed response as in the case of vaccines for seasonal influenza and herpes zoster, 2) priming the response to novel antigens such as pandemic influenza or other viruses, 3) vaccination against bacterial pathogens such as pneumococcus, and 4) altering the immune response to an endogenous protein as in the case of a vaccine against Alzheimer’s disease. In spite of the often limited efficacy of vaccines for older adults, influenza vaccination remains the only cost-saving medical intervention in this population. Thus, considerable opportunity exists to improve current vaccines and develop new vaccines as a preventive approach to a variety of diseases in older adults. Strategies for selecting appropriate immunologic targets for new vaccine development and evaluating how vaccines may alter the senescent immune response in terms of potential benefits and risks in the preclinical and clinical trial phases of vaccine development will be discussed.","McElhaney, Janet E.",Handbook on Immunosenescence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120001/,48

They have been largely employed as research tools and are emerging as therapeutic molecules for the treatment of human diseases as viral pathologies, cancer and misfolding diseases. The fast growing bio-market of recombinant antibodies provides intrabodies with enhanced binding specificity, stability and solubility, together with lower immunogenicity, for their use in therapy.

However, such important immune functions are known to decline with age in many mammals, including humans. It is a matter of clinical importance that the incidence of various age-associated diseases such as infections, cancer and vascular disorders increases with a decrease in immunological vigor. The extent of immunologic decline is variable and exhibits wide inter-individual variations. Thus, it is important to assess the extent of immunologic decline in both patients suffering from various diseases and in healthy people in order to maintain healthy conditions. To this end, we have developed a scoring system that analyzes immune parameters according to a database of known age-associated immune changes obtained from a healthy population. Using this scoring system, we can combine several different immunological parameters and express the immune status of individuals as a simple numeral. After determining immunological vigor for individuals, it is necessary to replenish immune defects and restore them to normalcy for individuals with depressed immunological scores. This chapter provides methods of immunological restoration in animal models and introduces some similar attempts in humans. The effect of any immunological restoration varies with the individual and must therefore verified. Currently, the proposed immune scoring system proposed is useful to determine whether the methods employed are effective for the restoration of immune functions.","Hirokawa, Katsuiku; Utsuyama, Masanori; Kikuchi, Yuko; Kitagawa, Masanobu",Handbook on Immunosenescence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120189/,48

24476,Mycobacterial Sepsis and Multiorgan Failure Syndrome,2011-03-26,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a part of the sunlight reaching Earth surface. The UV spectrum of solar radiation is by convention divided into three parts: UV-A: 310–400 nm, UV-B: 280–310 nm and UV-C: less than 280 nm. UV-B is the most energetic component reaching Earth surface because the stratospheric ozone layer effectively absorbs completely wavelengths below 290 nm. UV-B is an increasing threat due to increasing UV-B levels on Earth surface as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric O(3). In general, the effects of atmospheric UV-B radiation are negative for biological life. Enhanced levels of UV-B radiation can indeed negatively change plant physiological processes, growth and productivity. However, while studying UV-B effects on medicinal plants, some interesting phenomena have been discovered. For example, basil plants respond positively to UV-B radiation by increasing oil yield (Chang et al. J Horticult For 1:27–31, 2009). In other studies medicinal plants show beneficial aspects in term of increase in volatile oil yield and secondary metabolite production (Kumari et al. Ecotoxicol Environ Safety 72:2013–2019, 2009c, 2010). Medicinal herbs have great market value in India and worldwide. The medicinal value of plants depends upon phenolics, antioxidants and volatile yield. Therefore further UV-B experiments increasing the levels of these compounds are needed. Here we review the effect of UV-B exposure on metabolites, volatiles, and antioxidants potential in medicinal plants. This chapter reports: (1) aspects of the global market for medicinal and aromatic plants in India in order to assist the medicinal plant industry to make informed decisions. (2) The biodiversity loss due to wild harvesting of plants, and as an alternative the cultivation strategy of medicinal plants. (3) Main medicinal plant species having rich antioxidant potential. (4) Main secondary metabolites of plant origin such as phenylpropanoids, terpenes, alkaloids, and volatile oil, and other important metabolites containing high antioxidant level used in human diet and health. (5) UV-B factors that enhance the quality of medicinal plant by increasing the content of secondary bioactive products.

Children who are likely to suffer permanent intestinal failure and benefit from intestinal transplantation include those with a remaining small bowel length of less than 30–40 cm, absence of the ileocecal valve, colonic resection and malabsorptive syndromes. Indications for transplant include frequent severe bouts of catheter associated sepsis, threatened loss of vascular access and the development of liver cirrhosis from cholestasis. Children who are more likely to experience cholestasis from total parenteral nutrition include those who experience persistent hyperbilirubinemia (greater than 6 mg/dl despite enteral nutrition), those with recurrent sepsis and/or bacterial overgrowth and those with minimal tolerance of any enteral feeds in the first few months post resection. The 1 year survival rate after intestinal transplantation has markedly improved over the last several years but long term survival rates have remained unchanged. The improved short term survival rates have led to an increased prevalence of this patient population in intensive care units. Management of intestinal and multivisceral transplant recipients is uniquely challenging because of complications arising from the high incidence of transplant rejection and its treatment. In the ICU, the complexity of medical care for the transplant recipient requires a multidisciplinary approach with coordination by an intensivist in collaboration with the transplant surgeon, gastroenterologist, and other specialists.","McLaughlin, Gwenn E.; Kato, Tomoaki",Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122145/,48

26236,Severe Sepsis in the Elderly,2005,"The term pandemic refers to an international or worldwide outbreak of an infectious disease which is limited in time. Due to their high infectiousness and easy person-to-person transmission, flu viruses repeatedly lead to pandemics (approx. 3 pandemics per century.). In contrast to an epidemic, a pandemic is not restricted to one area. The mortality of an influenza pandemic is greater than the seasonal flu wave, and is not restricted to the classical risk groups: high rates of infection can occur in all age groups, with peaks frequently occurring amongst young adults. The specific virological characteristics of the influenza virus represent a great challenge for the health system. In principle, any influenza virus which has never before — or at least not for a long time — circulated within the population can develop into a pandemic virus. One possible candidate amongst others appears to be the influenza virus A-H5N1. Influenza pandemics usually occur at intervals of 11 to 39 years, and 30 years have now passed since the last pandemic. At the moment, the national and international pandemic plans have in most cases not yet been completely worked out. The co-operation between the individual countries should be intensified, and in Germany in particular, efforts should be made — in view of the different concepts of the individual federal states — to arrive at a uniform action plan. The consequences of a pandemic affect both the economic and the social sphere. Hospitals, practicing doctors and public health services must jointly develop action plans in order to be able to care for large numbers of patients within a very short time. Occupational medical specialists should form a link between health services, companies and doctors and hospitals, and already be developing plans and their communication for the companies under their care.","Wicker, Sabine; Dickmann, Petra; Rabenau, Holger F.; Gottschalk, René",Zentralbl Arbeitsmed Arbeitsschutz Ergon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123098/,48
26490,Antimicrobial Use in Surgical Intensive Care,2015-07-02,"Electrospinning is increasingly used as a simple and straightforward technique to fabricate one-dimensional fibers from both organic and inorganic materials. These one-dimensional fibers with controlled sizes possess some unique features such as large surface area to volume ratio, high porosity, and low density. Compared to other conventional materials, these features make them attractive for applications such as energy harvesting, energy storage, super-hydrophobic membranes, and sensors. This chapter provides an overview on the synthesis of inorganic fibers through polymer-mediated electrospinning. Some of the common techniques employed by many researchers, such as solgel combined with electrospinning, emulsion electrospinning, and electrospinning combined with solid–gas reaction, to fabricate metal oxide fibers are discussed. In addition, techniques to fabricate ceramic and metal oxide fibers having different morphologies and hierarchical structures are described. Recent applications of electrospun metal oxide fibers are finally highlighted with a focus on filtration, sensors, photocatalysis, and energy.","Baji, Avinash; Mai, Yiu-Wing",Polymer-Engineered Nanostructures for Advanced Energy Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123404/,48

31929,14 Het gastro-intestinale systeem,2017-02-03,"Zusammenfassung Insgesamt 179 Kot‐ und Darminhaltsproben von Hunden wurden vergleichend bakteriologisch und virologisch untersucht. Aus 108 Proben von Hunden (Einzeltiere) mit schweren Enteritiden gelang 22mal die Isolierung von C. f. subsp. jejuni und 46mal der Parvovirusnachweis. In 13 Fällen lagen beide Erreger gemeinsam vor. Bei 54 Kontrollproben gesunder Hunde konnte C. f. subsp. jejuni in 1 Fall und Parvovirus in 4 Fällen isoliert werden. 15 von 17 Hunden einer Versuchstierzucht, in der akute Gastroenteritiden aufgetreten waren, erwiesen sich ebenfalls als Träger von Campylobacter‐Keimen. Hier gelang der Parvovirusnachweis in 4 Fällen, davon 3mal gemeinsam mit C. f. subsp. jejuni. Die Ergebnisse lassen den Schluß zu, daß sowohl C. f. subsp. jejuni als auch Parvovirus eine eigenständige ätiologische Rolle bei akuten Gastroenteritiden des Hundes spielen. Der auffallend gehäufte gleichzeitige Nachweis beider Erreger bei schwer erkrankten Tieren spricht darüber hinaus für ein synergistisches Zusammenwirken. SUMMARY: Aetiological significance of Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni and Parvovirus for acute enteritis in dogs A total of 179 faecal and gut contents samples from dogs (individual animals) were compared by bacteriological and virological examination. From 108 samples from dogs with severe enteritis C. f. subsp. jejuni was isolated 22 times and Parvovirus 46 times. In 13 samples both agents were found. With 54 control samples from healthy dogs C. f. subsp. jejuni was isolated in one case and Parvovirus in four. 15 of 17 dogs in a breeding kennels where acute gastroenteritis had occurred were found to be carriers of Campylobacter. Here the isolation of parvovirus succeeded in 4 cases, in three of which C. f. subsp. jejuni was also isolated. The results lead to the conclusion that both C. f. subsp. jejuni and Parvovirus play an aetiological role in acute canine gastroenteritis. The frequent simultaneous isolation of both agents in severely sick animals also suggests a synergistic effect. RÉSUMÉ: A propos de la signification étiologique de Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni et Parvovirus dans des entérites aiguës du chien 179 échantillons de matières fécales et de contenu intestinal ont été examinés en comparaison bactériologiquement et virologiquement. Sur 108 échantillons provenant de chiens atteints d'une grave entérite, il a été possible d'isoler C. F. ssp. jejuni 22 fois et de mettre en évidence un Parvovirus 46 fois. On a rencontré les deux agents dans 13 cas. C. f. ssp. jejuni a été isolé dans 1 cas et Parvovirus dans 4 cas avec 54 échantillons de contrôle de chiens en bonne sante. 15 chiens sur 17 d'un élevage d'expérience ayant présenté une atteinte de gastroentérite aiguë se sont révélés être porteurs de Campylobacter. La mise en évidence dans ce cas de Parvovirus a été possible dans 4 cas, dont 3 avec C. f. ssp. jejuni. Les résultats permettent de conclure qu'aussi bien D. v. ssp. jejuni que Parvovirus jouent un rôle étiologique indépendant lors de gastroentérites aiguës du chien. La mise en évidence fréquente et frappante des deux germes chez des animaux gravement malades parle pour une action commune synergique.

Aquí se logró identificar el Parvovirus en 4 casos, 3 de ellos junto con C. f. ssp. jejuni. Los resultados obtenidos admiten el que se saque en conclusion que tanto C. J. ssp. jejuni como Parvovirus juegan un papel etiológico independiente en las gastroenteritis agudas del perro. La puesta en evidencia simultánea, sorprendentemente tan acumulada, de ambos agentes etiológicos en los animales enfermos de gravedad aboga, además de esto, a favor de un concurso sinergístico.","Rübsamen, S.; Danner, K.; Weiss, R.",J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7183812/,48

Children are greatly impacted by both natural disasters (forces of nature) and man-made (intentional, accidental) disasters. Their unique anatomical, physiological, behavioral, developmental, and psychological vulnerabilities must be considered when planning and preparing for disasters. The nurse or health care provider (HCP) must be able to rapidly identify acutely ill children during a disaster. Whether it is during a natural or man-made event, the nurse or HCP must intervene effectively to improve survival and outcomes.

VGLUTs contain two independent transport modes that facilitate glutamate packaging into synaptic vesicles and phosphate (Pi) ion transport into the synaptic terminal. While a transmembrane proton electrical gradient established by a vacuolar-type ATPase powers vesicular glutamate transport, recent studies indicate that binding sites and flux properties for chloride, potassium, and protons within VGLUTs themselves regulate VGLUT activity as well. These intrinsic ionic binding and flux properties of VGLUTs can therefore be modulated by neurophysiological conditions to affect levels of glutamate available for release from synapses. Despite their extraordinary importance, specific and high-affinity pharmacological compounds that interact with these sites and regulate VGLUT function, distinguish between the various modes of transport, and the different isoforms themselves, are lacking. In this review, we provide an overview of the physiologic sites for VGLUT regulation that could modulate glutamate release in an over-active synapse or in a disease state.","Pietrancosta, Nicolas; Djibo, Mahamadou; Daumas, Stephanie; El Mestikawy, Salah; Erickson, Jeffrey D.",Mol Neurobiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261050/,48

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prognostic factors associated with the incidence of microcephaly in congenital ZIKV infection. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (R) Epub ahead of print, Embase, Embase Classic, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, LILACS, and various thesis databases to identify human studies reporting microcephaly associated with congenital ZIKV infection. We requested primary data from the authors of the included studies to calculate summary estimates and conduct the meta-analysis of the most prevalent factors. RESULTS: We screened 4106 titles and abstracts, and identified 12 studies for inclusion in the systematic review. The assessment of ZIKV infection and the definition of microcephaly varied among studies. A total of 6154 newborns/fetuses were enrolled; of those, 1120 (18.20%) had a diagnostic of ZIKV infection, of which 509 (45.45%) were diagnosed with microcephaly. Nine studies addressed the link between congenital ZIKV infection and neurological findings in newborns/fetuses. Half of the studies provided primary data. Three out of 11 factors of interest seem to be prognostic factors of microcephaly: infant’s sex – males compared to females: Relative Risk (RR) 1.30, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) 1.14 to 1.49; the stage of pregnancy when infection occurred – infection in the first trimester of pregnancy compared to infection at other stages of pregnancy: RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.82; and asymptomatic infection compared to symptomatic infection during pregnancy: RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the female-biased resistance hypothesis and reinforce the risk associated with the stage of pregnancy when ZIKV infection occurs. Continued surveillance of ZIKV infection during pregnancy is needed to identify additional factors that could contribute to developing microcephaly in affected fetuses.

36697,Variability in the systems of care supporting critical neonatal intensive care unit transitions,2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical power (MP) is the energy delivered to the respiratory system over time during mechanical ventilation. Our aim was to compare the currently available methods to calculate MP during volume- and pressure-controlled ventilation, comparing different equations with the geometric reference method, to understand whether the easier to use surrogate formulas were suitable for the everyday clinical practice. This would warrant a more widespread use of mechanical power to promote lung protection. METHODS: Forty respiratory failure patients, sedated and paralyzed for clinical reasons, were ventilated in volume-controlled ventilation, at two inspiratory flows (30 and 60 L/min), and pressure-controlled ventilation with a similar tidal volume. Mechanical power was computed both with the geometric method, as the area between the inspiratory limb of the airway pressure and the volume, and with two algebraic methods, a comprehensive and a surrogate formula. RESULTS: The bias between the MP computed by the geometric method and by the comprehensive algebraic method during volume-controlled ventilation was respectively 0.053 (0.77, − 0.81) J/min and − 0.4 (0.70, − 1.50) J/min at low and high flows (r(2) = 0.96 and 0.97, p < 0.01). The MP measured and computed by the two methods were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.95 and 0.94, p < 0.01) with a bias of − 0.0074 (0.91, − 0.93) and − 1.0 (0.45, − 2.52) J/min at high-low flows. During pressure-controlled ventilation, the bias between the MP measured and the one calculated with the comprehensive and simplified methods was correlated (r(2) = 0.81, 0.94, p < 0.01) with mean differences of − 0.001 (2.05, − 2.05) and − 0.81 (2.11, − 0.48) J/min. CONCLUSIONS: Both for volume-controlled and pressure-controlled ventilation, the surrogate formulas approximate the reference method well enough to warrant their use in the everyday clinical practice. Given that these formulas require nothing more than the variables already displayed by the intensive care ventilator, a more widespread use of mechanical power should be encouraged to promote lung protection against ventilator-induced lung injury.","Chiumello, Davide; Gotti, Miriam; Guanziroli, Mariateresa; Formenti, Paolo; Umbrello, Michele; Pasticci, Iacopo; Mistraletti, Giovanni; Busana, Mattia",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351639/,48

National and regional experiences with COVID-19 have been hugely variable across the globe, reflecting ethnic, governmental, cultural, economic and healthcare differences. This thematic analysis was performed to identify scientific and clinical literature relating to the impact of COVID-19 on children with cancer and treatment. METHODS: The NHS Evidence portal was used to conduct a healthcare database advanced literature search. Duplicates were removed. Remaining results were screened using clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: 172 results were identified and data extracted. Literature was identified from all 5 continents, with lower and middle income countries well represented. Key themes identified included: 1: Impact on patients already diagnosed, including decreased treatment regimens, impact on outpatient clinics, COVID susceptibility and travel restrictions; 2: Delays in presentation and diagnosis, and national screening programs; 3: The impact of COVID on healthcare professionals; 4: Impact on current and future research; 5: Consequence of global economic crisis on childhood cancer care; 6: Impact on long-term survivorship, late effects and surveillance monitoring. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a profound effect on health care, and the literature reflects the extent to which communities involved in childhood cancer care have worked together to minimise the impact. It is inevitable that there have been consequences of the pandemic on the treatment of existing patients, and the diagnosis of new ones, but evidence suggest these effects in the short term are minimal.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and kinds of influenza can be given as example these diseases. The novel corona virus which is called COVID-19 is the most dangerous problem all around the world in these days. Early studies have revealed that COVID-19 cases are affected by environmental factors. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the number of novel coronavirus cases and several weather parameters in 81 provinces of Turkey. Mean incubation period of COVID-19 is in question. Thus, this paper also aims to provide better understanding of the exact incubation period in Turkey by employing four different timeframe which are on the day (lag 0), 3 days ago (lag 3), 7 days ago (lag 7) and 14 days ago (lag 14). We have considered population density as a control variable. The dataset cover COVID-19 cases, population density, average temperature, humidity, pressure, dew point, wind speed, and sunshine duration for 81 provinces of Turkey. We find that population density has a positive correlation with COVID-19 cases. We also find that in lag 3, all parameters except for sunshine duration are negatively correlated with COVID-19 cases and significant.

46032,User evaluation of the APP NAS software in intensive care unit,2021-02-22,"The effective protection of critical infrastructure against cyber and physical security threats involves many different steps from initially the identification of risks to finally the implementation of counter measures in the infrastructure. To derive counter measures and to come to intelligent decisions facing the identified risks, the impact calculation plays a central role. The impact of a specific threat can propagate through the systems of the infrastructure and thus needs to be analysed carefully. In this paper, the role of impact propagation of cyber-physical threats for infrastructure protection is discussed, exemplified for airport systems. In the ongoing EU-H2020 project SATIE (Security of Air Transport Infrastructure of Europe) a toolkit is developed containing two tools for impact propagation, namely the Business Impact Assessment (BIA) and the Impact Propagation Simulation (IPS). Both tools are described and for a small test case the propagation of a cyber threat and the transformation into a physical threat is demonstrated in a network representation as well as an agent-based model of the airport’s systems employing the IPS.","Köpke, Corinna; Srivastava, Kushal; König, Louis; Miller, Natalie; Fehling-Kaschek, Mirjam; Burke, Kelly; Mangini, Matteo; Praça, Isabel; Canito, Alda; Carvalho, Olga; Apolinário, Filipe; Escravana, Nelson; Carstengerdes, Nils; Stelkens-Kobsch, Tim",Cyber-Physical Security for Critical Infrastructures Protection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7888296/,48
46206,Sepsis profile and outcome of preterm neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care unit of Cairo University Hospital,2021-03-01,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a barrier to equal and evidence-based management of cancer in older adults. The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) formed a panel of experts to develop consensus recommendations on the implications of the pandemic on several aspects of cancer care in this age group including geriatric assessment (GA), surgery, radiotherapy, systemic treatment, palliative care and research. Age and cancer diagnosis are significant predictors of adverse outcomes of the COVID-19 infection. In this setting, GA is particularly valuable to drive decision-making. GA may aid estimating physiologic reserve and adaptive capability, assessing risk-benefits of either providing or temporarily withholding treatments, and determining patient preferences to help inform treatment decisions. In a resource-constrained setting, geriatric screening tools may be administered remotely to identify patients requiring comprehensive GA. Tele-health is also crucial to ensure adequate continuity of care and minimize the risk of infection exposure. In general, therapeutic decisions should favor the most effective and least invasive approach with the lowest risk of adverse outcomes. In selected cases, this might require deferring or omitting surgery, radiotherapy or systemic treatments especially where benefits are marginal and alternative safe therapeutic options are available. Ongoing research is necessary to expand knowledge of the management of cancer in older adults. However, the pandemic presents a significant barrier and efforts should be made to ensure equitable access to clinical trials and prospective data collection to elucidate the outcomes of COVID-19 in this population.","Kolb, Gerald",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7900458/,48

While various technologies and research have been developed and carried out to monitor medical adherence for patients, their approaches lack in terms of the assurance of medicine consumption and the cost effectiveness of their solutions. This paper provides a cloud-based medical adherence system that can track patients’ medicine intake based on the physical effects of the medicine on their bodies by tracking their vital signs. A machine learning model is trained to classify the patient health status and this data is used to determine whether their bodies are responding to the medicine, which is used to alert doctors to enable home hospitalization. The use of this system is proposed to serve as a secondary decision support provider to compliment and ease the decision-making process done by doctors.","Sherif, Abubaker Faisal Abubaker; Haw, Tan Wooi; Pun, Ooi Chee; Fei, Tan Yi",Computational Science and Technology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978973/,48

51496,Critical Care Education in a Pandemic through Tele–ICU,2020-12-03,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the Nova score for the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF) and evaluate its potential in reflecting the dietary share of UPF in Brazil. METHODS: This study was conducted in São Paulo with a convenience sample of 300 adults. Using a tablet, participants answered a 3-minute electronic self-report questionnaire on the consumption of 23 subgroups of UPF commonly consumed in Brazil, regarding the day prior the survey. Each participant score corresponded to the number of subgroups reported. The dietary share of UPF on the day prior to the survey, expressed as a percentage of total energy intake, was calculated based on data collected on a 30-minute complete 24-hour dietary recall administered by trained nutritionists. The association between the score and the dietary share of UPF was evaluated using linear regression models. The Pabak index was used to assess the agreement in participants’ classification according to the fifths of Nova score and the fifths of dietary share of UPF. RESULTS: The average dietary share of UPF increased linearly and significantly with the increase of the Nova score for the consumption of ultra-processed foods. We found a substantial agreement in participants’ classification according to the fifths of the distribution of scores and the fifths of the dietary share of UPF (Pabak index = 0.67). Age was inversely associated with a relatively high frequency of UPF consumption (upper fifth of the distribution) for both score and dietary share of UPF. CONCLUSION: The Nova score for the consumption of ultra-processed foods, obtained in a quick and practical manner, shows a good potential in reflecting the dietary share of UPF in Brazil.","Costa, Caroline dos Santos; de Faria, Franciane Rocha; Gabe, Kamila Tiemann; Sattamini, Isabela Fleury; Khandpur, Neha; Leite, Fernanda Helena Marrocos; Steele, Eurídice Martínez; Louzada, Maria Laura da Costa; Levy, Renata Bertazzi; Monteiro, Carlos Augusto",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023324/,48

60974,Ethics of Outbreaks Position Statement. Part 2: Family-Centered Care.,2018,"BACKGROUND We previously developed in vitro immunization based on a fusion protein containing the transcriptional transactivator (Tat) of human immunodeficiency virus and a double domain, called ZZ, derived from protein A of Staphylococcus aureus. In this approach, naïve human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) trigger a specific IgM antibody (Ab) response in the presence of ZZTat. In the present study, we attempted to raise a specific IgG Ab response. RESULTS We found that PBMCs incubated with ZZTat and a mixture containing anti-CD40, IL4 and IL21 secrete anti-Tat IgG Abs in their supernatants, indicating that the cytokine cocktail provides an isotypic switch. Then, we deciphered the Tat determinant involved in the phenomenon and found that it is located in the region 22-57 and that, within this region, the cysteine-rich domain and the basic residues play a crucial role. Finally, we prepared a fusion protein containing a fragment derived from the NY-ESO-1 cancer/testis antigen (Ag) and showed that PBMCs incubated with ZZfNY-ESO-1Tat trigger a specific anti-fNY-ESO-1 IgG Ab response, which demonstrates the possibility of transferring immunizing ability to an Ag unrelated to Tat. CONCLUSION Our ZZTat-based in vitro immunization approach that offers the possibility to raise an IgG Ab response against NY-ESO-1 might represent a valuable first stage for the generation of fully human IgG specific Abs.","Wijkhuisen, A; Savatier, A; Cordeiro, N; Léonetti, M",BMC biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-016-0253-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26911296/,48

Once implanted, it is infiltrated by recipient's cells and becomes incorporated in the repair. Here, we report the first series of using this device for chest wall reconstruction. METHODS The XCM Biologic Tissue Matrix was utilized to provide the restoration of chest wall defects. It was used either alone or in conjunction with the Synthes titanium system to provide additional support. The decision was made intraoperatively. RESULTS Since April 2010, 21 (12 females) patients received the device. Average age at operation was 47 ± 17 years. Eleven (52%) patients had the patch inserted alone, while the remaining 10 received it in combination with another implantable medical device. The biological tissue matrix was used to reconstruct chest wall defects in cancer involving chest wall (n = 9), chest wall deformity (n = 6), chest wall hernia (n = 5) and chest wall repair following empyema drainage (n = 1). Complications were witnessed in 3 patients receiving the combined XCM and Synthes bar mechanisms; infection (n = 2) and bar displacement and infection (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS The XCM patch can be safely used to provide the strength required for chest wall reconstruction and to replace previously infected reconstructions.","George, Robert S; Kostopanagiotou, Kostas; Papagiannopoulos, Kostas",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivt473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24263580/,48

PURPOSE To determine if scapular dyskinesis increases the risk of shoulder injury in athletes. STUDY DESIGN Meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic search was conducted on the MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, SPORTDiscus, and Embase databases to identify prospective studies examining scapular dyskinesis and shoulder injury risk in athletes. Studies were included if they assessed participants using a dynamic scapular assessment at baseline and monitored for the development of shoulder injury. Data from the studies were subject to meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method to produce a pooled risk ratio. RESULTS Seven studies were eligible for inclusion, resulting in 212 shoulder injuries observed across 923 athletes. Scapular dyskinesis was present in 46% of participants, and these athletes had an injury rate of 25%. The presence of scapular dyskinesis displayed a trend to increase the risk of shoulder injury, but this was not statistically significant (risk ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.85-1.34; P = .59).

OBJECTIVE To examine the contribution of the pandemic to parenting stress, exploring differences in parenting stress among new parents before and during the crisis, the role of background and personal variables, and the possibility that the study phase moderated the associations of gender and personal resources with parenting stress. METHOD Israeli parents (n = 1591) whose first child was 3-12 months old were recruited twice through social media: in 2019, before the spread of COVID-19 (n = 985); and in March 2020, during the pandemic (n = 606). RESULTS Sociodemographic variables, perception of the childbirth as traumatic, lower meaning in life, higher search for meaning, less marital satisfaction, and study phase all contributed to greater parenting stress. In addition, the association between gender and stress was moderated by study phase, with fathers reporting a greater increase in stress during the pandemic. Moreover, only during the pandemic did fathers report higher parenting stress than mothers. CONCLUSIONS The findings highlight the vulnerability of new parents of young infants to parenting stress during the crisis, and the special attention which should be paid to fathers. They indicate the value of strengthening meaning in life and preserving good marital relationships as resources that help to cope with the heightened parenting stress at this time.","Taubman-Ben-Ari, Orit; Ben-Yaakov, Ofir; Chasson, Miriam",Child abuse & neglect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33930664/,48
64667,Clinical Pearls.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND Asset-based indices are widely-used proxy measures of wealth in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). The stability of these indices within households over time is not known. METHODS We develop a harmonized household asset index using Principal Component Analysis for the participants (n = 2392) of INCAP Longitudinal Study, Guatemala using data from six waves of follow-up over the period of 1965-2018. We estimate its cross-sectional association with parental schooling (in 1967-75) and attained schooling (in 2015-18) of cohort members. We study how patterns of cross-sectional loadings change over time and between urban-rural settings. We assess its robustness to omission of assets or study waves and alternate specifications of factor extraction procedure (exploratory factor analysis, multiple correspondence analysis). RESULTS The harmonized index constructed using 8 assets and 11 housing characteristics explained 32.4% of the variance. Most households increased in absolute wealth over time with median wealth (25th percentile, 75th percentile; households) increasing from - 3.74 (- 4.42, - 3.07; 547) in 1967 to 2.08 (1.41, 2.67; 1145) in 2017-18. Ownership of television, electricity, quality of flooring and sanitary installation explained the largest proportion of variance. The index is positively associated with measures of schooling (maternal: r = 0.16; paternal: r = 0.10; attained: r = 0.35, all p < 0.001). In 2015-18, house ownership versus housing characteristics and ownership of electronic goods differentiate households in urban and rural areas respectively. The index is robust for omission of assets or study waves, indicator categorization and factor extraction method. CONCLUSION A temporally harmonized asset index constructed from consistently administered surveys in a cohort setting over time may allow study of associations of life-course social mobility with human capital outcomes in LMIC contexts. The approach permits exploration of trends in household wealth of the sample over a follow-up period against repeated cross-sectional surveys which permit the estimation of only the mean trajectory.","Varghese, Jithin Sam; Maluccio, John A; Cunningham, Solveig A; Ramirez-Zea, Manuel; Stein, Aryeh D",BMC medical research methodology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-021-01263-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33902451/,48
65021,Long-term adherence to a 5 day antibiotic course guideline for treatment of intensive care unit (ICU)-associated Gram-negative infections.,2014,"Background Therapeutic strategies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) counteract the immunosuppressive effects of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and ligand-1 (PD-L1). ICI treatment has emerged in first- and second-line therapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As immunotherapeutic treatment with ICIs is a dynamic field where new drugs and combinations are constantly evaluated, we conducted an up-to-date systematic review on comparative efficacy and safety in patients with advanced NSCLC. Methods We searched PubMed up to February 2020 and Embase, CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries up to August 2018. Additionally, we checked reference lists. We dually screened titles, abstracts and, subsequently, full-texts for eligibility. Two reviewers assessed the risk of bias and graded the certainty of evidence following GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). For second-line therapy, we performed random-effects meta-analyses. Due to considerable clinical heterogeneity, we reported first-line results narratively. Results Of 1497 references, we identified 22 relevant publications of 16 studies. For first-line therapy, a combination of an ICI with chemotherapy improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared to chemotherapy but increased the risk of serious adverse events. Single-agent pembrolizumab increased overall and progression-free survival in patients with PD-L1 expression of ≥50% and resulted in less TRAE than chemotherapy. Compared to placebo, maintenance therapy with durvalumab increased overall and progression-free survival at the downside of higher risk of TRAE. For second-line therapy, a random-effects meta-analysis yielded a statistically significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for ICIs compared to docetaxel (HR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.63-0.75 for OS; HR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77 - 0.93 for PFS; 6 studies, 3478 patients; median OS benefit in months: 2.4 to 4.2). In meta-analysis, risk of any treatment-related adverse events of any grade was lower for ICI than docetaxel as second-line therapy (RR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.73-0.79; 6 studies, 3763 patients). Conclusion In first-line therapy of patients with advanced NSCLC, ICI is effective when combined with chemotherapy not depending on PD-L1 expression, or as monotherapy in high PD-L1 expressing tumors. For second-line therapy, single-agent ICI improves efficacy and safety compared to docetaxel.","Wagner, Gernot; Stollenwerk, Hannah Karolina; Klerings, Irma; Pecherstorfer, Martin; Gartlehner, Gerald; Singer, Josef",Oncoimmunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/2162402x.2020.1774314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923134/,48
65132,The effects of active mobilisation and rehabilitation in ICU on mortality and function: a systematic review.,2017,"Lead halide perovskite has in recent years gained widespread interests due to its excellent physical and chemical properties, as well as superior optoelectronic performance. However, some restrictions still preclude full industrialization of the material, in particular toxicity issues and instability as a result to sensitivity to humidity. Lead-free all-inorganic double perovskite materials have thus recently become a focus of research. Herein, a new narrow bandgap lead-free double perovskite solar cell with a high-quality Cs2PtI6 film is proposed. It exhibits an optical bandgap of 1.37 eV, absorption within a wide range of wavelengths, and a high absorption coefficient. Importantly, this is the first time this novel material is used in solar cells. Following optimization, the device displays a best power conversion efficiency of 0.72% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.73 V, a short-circuit current of 1.2 mA/cm2 and a fill factor of 0.82. Crucially, it also demonstrates excellent stability when exposed to extreme conditions such as high humidity, high temperature and UV-light irradiation. Stability tests show that the PSCs can retain almost 80% of the original efficiency over 60 days stored in ambient temperature without any encapsulation, boosting prospects for applications of lead-free perovskite solar cells.","Yang, Shuzhang; Wang, Liang; Zhao, Shuai; Liu, Anmin; Zhou, Yi; Han, Qianji; Yu, Fengyang; Gao, Liguo; Zhang, Chu; Ma, Tingli",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c11429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32933250/,48

METHODS A cohort of 90 cladribine-treated patients with follow-up data reported by treating physicians and recorded in the Australian MSBase registry (database lock February 2016) were examined. Clinical data included Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, relapses and other disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) administered before and after cladribine treatment. RESULTS Mean age on starting cladribine was 47 years; mean age at MS onset was 34 years, and median baseline EDSS score was 5.25. Disability trajectories in patients with sufficient follow-up suggested an overall increasing trend prior to cladribine treatment which was reduced during the 2-year post-treatment. Approximately 80% of patients were EDSS progression-free, 65% remained relapse-free after 2 years and median time to next DMD was 1.7 years. CONCLUSION These observational data suggest a disease-modifying effect in this cohort of relapsing MS patients characterised by older and more disabled patients. Since these data represent a single-arm cohort, clinical trials and larger comparative post-marketing studies are needed to validate and extend these findings.","Lizak, Nathaniel; Hodgkinson, Suzanne; Butler, Ernest; Lechner-Scott, Jeannette; Slee, Mark; McCombe, Pamela Ann; Shaw, Cameron; Skibina, Olga; Vucic, Steve; Shuey, Neil; Barnett, Michael H; Parratt, John; Butzkueven, Helmut; Jack, Dominic; Fabris, Jessica; Kalincik, Tomas",Multiple sclerosis,https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458520921087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530363/,48

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the outcomes of LIH treated by mesh repair after renal transplantation. METHODS All consecutive patients who had undergone LIH mesh repair after renal transplantation were compared with patients who had undergone LIH mesh repair without renal transplantation. Demographic data, incisional hernia characteristics, operative data, and postoperative outcomes were prospectively recorded. Early complications and recurrence rates were evaluated. RESULTS Altogether, 112 patients were treated for LIH with mesh repair. Among these patients, 61 (54.4 %) underwent LIH after renal transplantation. The early complications were similar for the patients with and without renal transplantation (24.5 vs. 23.5 %, respectively; p = 0.896). The recurrence rates also were similar for the patients with and without renal transplantation (9.8 vs. 9.8 %, respectively; p = 1).

Thrombocytopenia represents a common problem for patients with MDS. ranging from mild to serious bleeding events and death. To manage thrombocytopenia, the current standard treatment includes platelet transfusion, unfortunately leading to a range of side effects. Thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics represent an alternative treatment option for MDS patients with thrombocytopenia. However, it remains unclear, whether TPO mimetics influence the increase of blast cells and therefore to premature progression to AML. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics for patients with MDS. SEARCH METHODS We searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (January 2000 to August 2017), trials registries (ISRCTN, EU clinical trials register and clinicaltrials.gov) and conference proceedings. We did not apply any language restrictions. Two review authors independently screened search results, disagreements were solved by discussion. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials comparing TPO mimetics with placebo, no further treatment or another TPO mimetic in patients with MDS of all risk groups, without gender, age or ethnicity restrictions. Additional chemotherapeutic treatment had to be equal in both arms. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials, disagreements were resolved by discussion. Risk ratio (RR) was used to analyse mortality during study, transformation to AML, incidence of bleeding events, transfusion requirement, all adverse events, adverse events >= grade 3, serious adverse events and platelet response. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) have been extracted as hazard ratios, but could not be pooled as results were reported in heterogenous ways. Health-related quality of life and duration of thrombocytopenia would have been analysed as standardised mean differences, but no trial reported these outcomes. MAIN RESULTS We did not identify any trial comparing one TPO mimetic versus another. We analysed six eligible trials involving 746 adult patients. All trials were reported as randomised and double-blind trials including male and female patients. Two trials compared TPO mimetics (romiplostim or eltrombopag) with placebo, one trial evaluated eltrombopag in addition to the hypomethylating agent azacitidine, two trials analysed romiplostim additionally to a hypomethylating agent (azacitidine or decitabine) and one trial evaluated romiplostim in addition to the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide. There are more data on romiplostim (four included, completed, full-text trials) than on eltrombopag (two trials included: one full-text publication, one abstract publication). Due to small sample sizes and imbalances in baseline characteristics in three trials and premature termination of two studies, we judged the potential risk of bias of all included trials as high.Due to heterogenous reporting, we were not able to pool data for OS. Instead of that, we analysed mortality during study. There is little or no evidence for a difference in mortality during study for thrombopoietin mimetics compared to placebo (RR 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.27, N = 6 trials, 746 patients, low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether the use of TPO mimetics induces an acceleration of transformation to AML (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.77, N = 5 trials, 372 patients, very low-quality evidence).Thrombopoietin mimetics probably improve the incidence of all bleeding events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99, N = 5 trials, 390 patients, moderate-quality evidence). This means that in the study population, 713 out of 1000 in the placebo arm will have a bleeding event, compared to 656 of 1000 (95% CI 613 to 699) in the TPO mimetics arm. There is little or no evidence for a difference that TPO mimetics significantly diminish the rate of transfusion requirement (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05, N = 4 trials, 358 patients, low-quality evidence). No studies were found that looked at quality of life or duration of thrombocytopenia.There is no evidence that patients given TPO mimetics suffer more all adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.07, N = 5 trials, 390 patients, moderate-quality evidence). There is uncertainty whether the number of serious adverse events decrease under therapy with TPO mimetics (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.46, N = 4 trials, 356 patients, very low-quality evidence).We identified one ongoing study and one study marked as completed (March 2015), but without publication of results for MDS patients (only results reported for AML and MDS patients together). Both studies evaluate MDS patients receiving eltrombopag in comparison to placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS No trial evaluated one TPO mimetic versus another.Six trials including adult patients analysed one TPO mimetic versus placebo, sometimes combined with standard therapy in both arms. Given the uncertainty of the quality of evidence, meta-analyses show that there is little or no evidence for a difference in mortality during study and premature progress to AML. However, these assumptions have to be further explored. Treatment with TPO mimetics resulted in a lower number of MDS patients suffering from bleeding events.There is no evidence for a difference between study groups regarding transfusion requirement. Enlarged sample sizes and a longer follow-up of future trials should improve the estimate of safety and efficacy of TPO mimetics, moreover health-related quality of life should be evaluated. As two ongoing studies currently investigate eltrombopag (one already completed, but without published results), we are awaiting results for this drug.","Dodillet, Helga; Kreuzer, Karl-Anton; Monsef, Ina; Skoetz, Nicole",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd009883.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28962071/,48

The pathogenesis of SARS remains poorly understood, although increasing evidence suggests that immunopathology could play an important role. We previously reported that the adaptive immune response plays an important protective role in MHV-1-infected resistant B6 mice and that both CD4 and CD8 T cells play a significant role in the development of morbidity and lung pathology following intranasal MHV-1 infection of susceptible C3H/HeJ and A/J mice. In this study, we have identified novel CD4 and CD8 epitopes in MHV-1-infected susceptible and resistant strains of mice. Susceptible C3H/HeJ mice mount robust and broad MHV-1-specific CD4 T cell responses, whereas in resistant B6 mice, Ag-specific CD8 T cell responses dominate. We also show that previously immunized susceptible C3H/HeJ mice do not develop any morbidity and are completely protected following a lethal-dose MHV-1 challenge despite mounting only a modest secondary T cell response. Finally, we demonstrate that the resistance displayed by B6 mice is not solely accounted for by the elaboration of a broad and vigorous MHV-1-specific CD8 T cell response, as MHV-1 infection of C3.SW-H2(b)/SnJ mice, which mount an equally robust CD8 T cell response of the same specificity, is still associated with significant morbidity. Thus, identification of novel CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes for MHV-1 permitted high-resolution analyses of pulmonary T cell responses in a mouse model of SARS.","Khanolkar, Aaruni; Fulton, Ross B; Epping, Lecia L; Pham, Nhat-Long; Tifrea, Dilea; Varga, Steven M; Harty, John T",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.0902749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20554960/,48
74716,Variability is adaptability…also during weaning!,2014,"Immunization with an inactivated virus is one of the strategies currently being tested towards developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. One of the methods used to inactivate viruses is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation to damage their nucleic acids. While gamma (γ) rays effectively induce lesions in the RNA, envelope proteins are also highly damaged in the process. This in turn may alter their antigenic properties, affecting their capacity to induce an adaptive immune response able to confer effective protection. Here, we modeled the effect of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation on SARS-CoV-2 using the Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA. With a realistic 3D target virus model, we calculated the expected number of lesions in the spike and membrane proteins, as well as in the viral RNA. Our findings showed that γ rays produced significant spike protein damage, but densely ionizing charged particles induced less membrane damage for the same level of RNA lesions, because a single ion traversal through the nuclear envelope was sufficient to inactivate the virus. We propose that accelerated charged particles produce inactivated viruses with little structural damage to envelope proteins, thereby representing a new and effective tool for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses.","Francis, Ziad; Incerti, Sebastien; Zein, Sara A; Lampe, Nathanael; Guzman, Carlos A; Durante, Marco",Radiation research,https://doi.org/10.1667/rade-20-00241.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411888/,48

74861,Resilience.,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Intravenous alteplase (tissue-type plasminogen activator) has been shown to be cost-effective because of savings in long-term disability. In October of 2005, an increased DRG payment to hospitals for alteplase-treated stroke patients was introduced. We sought to describe the trends in the cost of alteplase over time, in comparison to trends in hospital reimbursement in the United States. METHODS Using publicly available information on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website (www.cms.gov), we obtained CMS quarterly payment amounts between January 1, 2005, and October 1, 2014, for alteplase, listed as alteplase recombinant, per mg. CMS payment amounts are the manufacturer's average sales price+6% until April 2014, when it was lowered to +4.3%. Estimates for DRG base payments were calculated within the Medicare Provider and Analysis Review (MEDPAR) for fiscal years 2006 (DRG 559) and 2013 (MS DRGs 61, 62, and 63) as (DRG relative weights)×(standardized operating and capital amount). The consumer price index was also queried for all prescription drugs, urban areas, during the same study period as reference. RESULTS The CMS payment amount for alteplase per milligram was $30.50 in January 2005 and $64.30 in October 2014. Trends in the CMS payment amounts for alteplase increased by 111% between 2005 and 2014. The consumer price index for all prescription drugs increased by 30.2% in the same time frame. The base payment for alteplase-treated stroke admissions was $11 173 in 2006 and $12 064 in 2013, an 8% increase. CONCLUSIONS We found a striking increase in the cost of alteplase over the last decade, with a 100 mg vial now with a CMS payment of ≈$6400, a >100% increase over 10 years. During the same time frame, the DRG base payment to hospitals increased by only 8%, and alteplase cost increased from 27% of the payment in 2006 to 53% in 2013. Researchers and stroke physicians should be aware of these changes in drug costs and their impact on cost-effectiveness analyses.","Kleindorfer, Dawn; Broderick, Joseph; Demaerschalk, Bart; Saver, Jeffrey",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.116.015822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28536176/,48

79735,Mass-casualty incidents: how does an ICU prepare?,2008,"OBJECTIVES Plaque ruptures and attenuated plaques are considered to be unstable and have been identified in both culprit and nonculprit lesions of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, there are limited data available on the natural evolution of these plaques and their long-term clinical outcome. We investigated the natural evolution and long-term impact of plaque ruptures and attenuated plaques in untreated segments of infarct-related arteries in patients with STEMI. METHODS In the Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial, 389 patients with 429 lesions underwent intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at baseline. Follow-up IVUS at 13 months was conducted in 245 patients. Three-year follow-up data were available for all patients. RESULTS Segments not treated between baseline and follow-up were compared. Baseline IVUS identified 29 plaque ruptures in 27 patients (7%). Of 11 plaque ruptures with follow-up IVUS, four healed and seven persisted. Conversely, through follow-up IVUS, nine new plaque ruptures in nine patients (4%) were identified. Attenuated plaques were identified in 31 of 38 plaque ruptures (81.5%), of which 24 were in the same circumferential segment as the ruptured cavity and seven were within 5 mm proximal or distal to the plaque rupture. Morphologic changes during follow-up, including new plaque ruptures and changes in the attenuated plaque frequency and distribution, were not accompanied by either serious lumen compromise or clinical events. CONCLUSION Serial IVUS analysis demonstrated that the morphology of unstable plaques within untreated segments in STEMI patients treated with optimal systemic therapies markedly changed during the 13-month follow-up period, without lumen compromise or clinical events at the 3-year follow-up.","Souza, Cristiano F; Doi, Hiroshi; Mintz, Gary S; Lansky, Alexandra J; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Guagliumi, Giulio; Brodie, Bruce R; Kellett, Mirle A; Xu, Ke; Mehran, Roxana; Stone, Gregg W; Maehara, Akiko",Coronary artery disease,https://doi.org/10.1097/mca.0000000000000251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25919902/,48

ICG is a water-soluble dye that fluoresces bright green when viewed under near-infrared light (700-1000 nm). This technology has been applied to robotic partial nephrectomy, first to potentially allow for the differentiation of renal tumor from normal parenchyma. In this application, it has been hypothesized that normal kidney tissue fluoresces green, while the tumor commonly remains hypofluorescent, thereby aiding tumor excision. Secondly, NIRF imaging with ICG has been employed to facilitate selective arterial clamping during robotic partial nephrectomy, allowing for a regional perfusion deficit in the kidney to be readily identified and therefore targeted at a given tumor. Recent studies have shown the associated decrease in global ischemia to minimize resultant loss of renal function at certain time endpoints. This review presents the most recent studies and evidence on the intraoperative administration of indocyanine green for robotic partial nephrectomy.","Bjurlin, Marc A; McClintock, Tyler R; Stifelman, Michael D",Current urology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11934-015-0495-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25698588/,48

82211,Candida bloodstream infections in intensive care units: analysis of the extended prevalence of infection in intensive care unit study.,2011,"BACKGROUND Systematic technical effects-also called batch effects-are a considerable challenge when analyzing DNA methylation (DNAm) microarray data, because they can lead to false results when confounded with the variable of interest. Methods to correct these batch effects are error-prone, as previous findings have shown. RESULTS Here, we demonstrate how using the R function ComBat to correct simulated Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450 K) and Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Kit (EPIC) DNAm data can lead to a large number of false positive results under certain conditions. We further provide a detailed assessment of the consequences for the highly relevant problem of p-value inflation with subsequent false positive findings after application of the frequently used ComBat method. Using ComBat to correct for batch effects in randomly generated samples produced alarming numbers of false discovery rate (FDR) and Bonferroni-corrected (BF) false positive results in unbalanced as well as in balanced sample distributions in terms of the relation between the outcome of interest variable and the technical position of the sample during the probe measurement. Both sample size and number of batch factors (e.g. number of chips) were systematically simulated to assess the probability of false positive findings. The effect of sample size was simulated using n = 48 up to n = 768 randomly generated samples. Increasing the number of corrected factors led to an exponential increase in the number of false positive signals. Increasing the number of samples reduced, but did not completely prevent, this effect. CONCLUSIONS Using the approach described, we demonstrate, that using ComBat for batch correction in DNAm data can lead to false positive results under certain conditions and sample distributions. Our results are thus contrary to previous publications, considering a balanced sample distribution as unproblematic when using ComBat. We do not claim completeness in terms of reporting all technical conditions and possible solutions of the occurring problems as we approach the problem from a clinician's perspective and not from that of a computer scientist. With our approach of simulating data, we provide readers with a simple method to assess the probability of false positive findings in DNAm microarray data analysis pipelines.","Zindler, Tristan; Frieling, Helge; Neyazi, Alexandra; Bleich, Stefan; Friedel, Eva",BMC bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03559-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32605541/,48

We adopted structural equation modeling to examine the hypotheses. RESULTS Safety culture was significantly associated with second victim experience and burnout (p < 0.01). Second victim experience had a partial mediating role on the relationship between safety culture and burnout (p < 0.01). The mediating model including major variables showed satisfactory fitness (X2 /df =2.11, P< 0.01, Comparative Fit Index =0.94, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation=0.062).

The limited investigations focusing on the acute wound environment and dressing techniques and the subsequent lack of evidence-based standards complicate clinical wound care decisions. OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of occlusive dressings on healing of standardized, partial-thickness abrasions. DESIGN Controlled, counterbalanced, repeated-measures design. SETTING University laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Sixteen healthy women (n = 10) and men (n = 6). INTERVENTION(S) Four standardized, partial-thickness abrasions were inflicted. Film, hydrogel, and hydrocolloid occlusive dressings and no dressing (control) were applied. Participants returned on postwound days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 for digital imaging. Wound healing time was measured by change in wound contraction (cm(2)) and change in wound color (chromatic red) and luminance in red, green, and blue color values. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Wound contraction, color (chromatic red), and luminance. RESULTS A day-by-dressing interaction was found for wound contraction, color, and luminance. Post hoc testing indicated that the film and hydrocolloid dressings produced greater wound contraction than the hydrogel and no dressing on days 7 and 10. Film, hydrogel, and hydrocolloid dressings also resulted in greater wound contraction than the control on day 14. Hydrocolloid dressings produced smaller measures of color and greater measures of luminance than no dressing on day 7. Film, hydrogel, and hydrocolloid dressings also resulted in smaller measures of color and greater measures of luminance compared with no dressing on days 10 and 14. CONCLUSIONS When compared with the control (no dressing), the film, hydrogel, and hydrocolloid occlusive dressings were associated with a faster healing rate of partial-thickness abrasions across time measured by wound contraction, color, and luminance. Overall, these data indicate that occlusive dressings were more effective in healing than no dressing was.","Beam, Joel W",Journal of athletic training,https://doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-43.6.600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19030138/,48
83986,Prevention of nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit.,2008,"Loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. Such wounds then become chronically infected. Topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of Next Science wound gel technology (NxtSc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. In vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that NxtSc inhibited biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. The gel formulation NxtSc-G5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 CFU/disc or CFU/g. In vivo, NxtSc-G5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. Storage of NxtSc-G5 at room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. These results establish that NxtSc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. This novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life, shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.","Miller, Kyle G; Tran, Phat L; Haley, Cecily L; Kruzek, Cassandra; Colmer-Hamood, Jane A; Myntti, Matt; Hamood, Abdul N",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00108-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637684/,48

However, reviews that evaluate the relationship between parenting style and weight-related outcomes have not focused on prospective studies. METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and PsychInfo for studies published between 1995 and 2016 that evaluated the prospective relationship between parenting style experienced in childhood and subsequent weight outcomes. RESULTS We identified 11 prospective cohort studies. Among the eight studies that categorized parenting style into distinct groups (i.e. authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and neglectful), five provided evidence that authoritative parenting was associated with lower body mass index gains. Among the six highest quality studies, four suggested a protective role of authoritative parenting style against adverse weight-related outcomes. However, only one study controlled for a comprehensive set of confounders, and the small number of studies conducted within certain age groups precluded our ability to ascertain critical periods when parenting style is most strongly related to child weight. CONCLUSIONS The present literature supports the idea that authoritative parenting may be protective against later overweight and obesity, although findings are mixed. More prospective cohort studies of longer durations, with more sophisticated methods that examine age-varying relationships, and that control for a comprehensive set of confounders, are needed.","Sokol, R L; Qin, B; Poti, J M",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28086262/,48

The high-altitude indigenous Ecuadorian patient presented several health problems such as anhidrosis, bone fractures, self-mutilation, osteochondroma, intellectual disability and Riga-Fede disease. After the mutational analysis of NTRK1, the patient showed a clearly autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with the pathogenic mutation rs763758904 (Arg602*) and the second missense mutation rs80356677 (Asp674Tyr). Additionally, the genomic analysis showed 69 pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic variants in 46 genes possibly related to phenotypic heterogeneity, including the rs324420 variant in the FAAH gene. The gene ontology enrichment analysis showed 28 mutated genes involved in several biological processes. As a novel contribution, the protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that NTRK1, SPTBN2 and GRM6 interact with several proteins of the pain matrix involved in the response to stimulus and nervous system development. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study that associates clinical, genomics and networking analyses in a Native American patient with consanguinity background in order to better understand CIPA pathogenesis.","López-Cortés, Andrés; Zambrano, Ana Karina; Guevara-Ramírez, Patricia; Echeverría, Byron Albuja; Guerrero, Santiago; Cabascango, Eliana; Pérez-Villa, Andy; Armendáriz-Castillo, Isaac; García-Cárdenas, Jennyfer M; Yumiceba, Verónica; Pérez-M, Gabriela; Leone, Paola E; Paz-Y-Miño, César",BMC medical genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12920-020-00764-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807182/,48

While older adults appear at high risk for severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 among children have been relatively rare. Integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of developing mouse lung with temporally-resolved immunofluorescence in mouse and human lung tissue, we found expression of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein primer TMPRSS2 was highest in ciliated cells and type I alveolar epithelial cells (AT1), and TMPRSS2 expression increased with aging in mice and humans. Analysis of autopsy tissue from fatal COVID-19 cases detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA most frequently in ciliated and secretory cells in airway epithelium and AT1 cells in peripheral lung. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was highly colocalized in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Together, these data demonstrate the cellular spectrum infected by SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelium and suggest that developmental regulation of TMPRSS2 may underlie the relative protection of infants and children from severe respiratory illness.","Schuler, Bryce A; Habermann, A Christian; Plosa, Erin J; Taylor, Chase J; Jetter, Christopher; Negretti, Nicholas M; Kapp, Meghan E; Benjamin, John T; Gulleman, Peter; Nichols, David S; Braunstein, Lior Z; Hackett, Alice; Koval, Michael; Guttentag, Susan H; Blackwell, Timothy S; Webber, Steven A; Banovich, Nicholas E; Kropski, Jonathan A; Sucre, Jennifer M S",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci140766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180746/,48
86927,Viral Respiratory Infections of Adults in the Intensive Care Unit.,2016,"Introduction Diabetic obese patients are susceptible to the development of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and cardiac dysfunction culminating in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC), which represents a life-threatening health problem with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. The aim of the study is to characterize the effects of a new benzofuran N-acylhydrazone compound, LASSBio-2090, on metabolic and cardiovascular alterations in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats presenting DC. Methods Male non-diabetic lean Zucker rats (ZL) and ZDF rats treated with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide) or LASSBio-2090 were used in this study. Metabolic parameters, cardiovascular function, left ventricle histology and inflammatory protein expression were analyzed in the experimental groups. Results LASSBio-2090 administration in ZDF rats reduced glucose levels to 85.0 ± 1.7 mg/dL (p < 0.05). LASSBio-2090 also lowered the cholesterol and triglyceride levels from 177.8 ± 31.2 to 104.8 ± 5.3 mg/dL and from 123.0 ± 11.4 to 90.9 ± 4.8 mg/dL, respectively, in obese diabetic rats (p < 0.05). LASSBio-2090 normalized plasma insulin, insulin sensitivity and endothelial function in aortas from diabetic animals (p < 0.05). It also enhanced systolic and diastolic left-ventricular function and reverted myocardial remodeling by blocking the threefold elevation of TNF-α levels in hearts from ZDF rats. Conclusion LASSBio-2090 alleviates metabolic disturbance and cardiomyopathy in an obese and diabetic rat model, thus representing a novel strategy for the treatment of cardiovascular complications in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Costa, Gizele Cabral; Montagnoli, Tadeu Lima; Da Silva, Jaqueline Soares; de Alencar, Allan Kardec Nogueira; Reina Gamba, Luis Eduardo; Alves, Bryelle Eccard Oliveira; da Silva, Marina Moraes Carvalho; Trachez, Margarete Manhães; do Nascimento, José Hamilton M; Pimentel-Coelho, Pedro Moreno; Mendez-Otero, Rosália; Lima, Lidia Moreira; Barreiro, Eliezer J; Sudo, Roberto Takashi; Zapata-Sudo, Gisele","Drug design, development and therapy",https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s258459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884238/,48
87113,The psychological burden of restricted parental visiting in paediatric intensive care.,2020-09-09,"Objective To generate recommendations on the management of radiotherapeutic treatments during the pandemic, adapted to a country with limited health resources. Methods We did a rapid review of the literature, searching for papers that describe any measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection, as well as management guidelines to reduce the workload, in radiotherapy units. The following conditions were included in the scope of this review: gynecological tumors, breast cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, genitourinary tumors, head and neck tumors, skin cancer, tumors of the central nervous system, and lymphomas. An expert group discussed online the extracted data and drafted the recommendations. Using a modified Delphi method, the consensus was reached among 14 certificated radio-oncologists. The quality of the evidence that supported the recommendations on treatment schedules was assessed. Results A total of 57 documents were included. Of these, 25 provided strategies to reduce the risk of infection. Recommendations for each condiction were extracted from the remaining documents. The recommendations aim to establish specific parameters where treatments can be omitted, deferred, prioritized, and shortened. Treatment schemes are recommended for each condition, prioritizing hypo-fractionated schemes whenever possible. Conclusions We propose strategies for the management of radiotherapy services to guarantee the continuity of high-quality treatments despite the health crisis caused by COVID-19.","Montero-Oleas, Nadia; Puente-Vallejo, Raúl; León-Micheli, Bárbara; Imbaquingo-Cabrera, Andrés; Silva, Mónica; Gamarra, Elizabeth; Álvarez-Rodas, Byron; Segovia, Nelson; Aldaz-Roldan, Pablo; Nuñez-Silva, Cristina; Zurita-Vivero, Karina; Carrión, Alex; Molina-Jaramillo, José; Rodríguez-Balarezo, Andrés; Betancourt, Yuri; De Los Reyes, Luis",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2020.08.8012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956343/,48
87136,"Effect of a hypertonic balanced ketone solution on plasma, CSF and brain beta-hydroxybutyrate levels and acid-base status.",2013,"The seasonal variability of the lateral flux of total alkalinity (TAlk) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of the tropical Hooghly estuary is analyzed in this work. In situ observations of water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, TAlk, and pH were measured in four different stations of the Hooghly estuary. It was measured once every month during 2015-2016, and subsequently, DIC was estimated. A carbon budget was constructed to quantify carbon flows through the freshwater-marine continuum of the Hooghly estuary, and plausible impacts on the adjacent coastal ocean, the northern Bay of Bengal, were examined. The biogeochemical mass balance box model was used to compute the seasonal flow of carbon flux, and subsequently, the annual budgeting of lateral fluxes of TAlk and DIC to the adjacent coastal ocean was carried out. The net annual TAlk and DIC flux from the Hooghly estuary to the adjacent coastal ocean were 4.45 ± 1.90 × 1011 mol and 4.59 ± 1.70 × 1011 mol, respectively. The net annual DIC flux of the Hooghly estuary is about 30 to 60 times higher than surface area integrated air-water CO2 flux, which is an indication of promoting acidification in the adjacent coastal ocean. The present study indicates that the lateral DIC flux has increased substantially in the Hooghly estuary during the last two decades. The increase in inorganic carbon load in the Hooghly estuary due to the enhanced discharge of inorganic and organic matter load in the upper reaches of the estuary led to this increase in lateral DIC flux. The results strongly establish the need of having such regional studies for better understanding the estuarine carbon dynamics, and its role in controlling the adjacent coastal ocean dynamics.","Ghosh, Jayashree; Chakraborty, Kunal; Chanda, Abhra; Akhand, Anirban; Bhattacharya, Trishneeta; Das, Sourav; Das, Isha; Hazra, Sugata; Choudhury, S B; Wells, Mark",Environmental monitoring and assessment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09191-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117931/,48

89616,Health Care Professional Students' Perceptions of Teamwork and Roles After an Interprofessional Critical Care Simulation.,2021,"OBJECTIVE Persons with severe dementia are less likely to have a role in preference assessment due to communication challenges associated with the disease. Research is limited on how to support preference communication while using existing preference assessment tools (e.g., the Minimum Data Set 3.0). METHODS This study examined the effect of two assessment conditions (standard verbal; visual-and-text supported;) on residents' (N = 21) social and leisure preference consistency over 1-week and utterance types (acknowledgment, elaboration, off-topic, request for clarification) in response to preference questions. Residents with severe dementia were recruited from four nursing homes (n = 11) and three assisted living facilities (n = 10). As a preliminary measure of provider acceptability and social validity, a sample of 10 naïve judges (University students) listened to the interviews and rated residents' communication clarity and their confidence with understanding residents' preferences. RESULTS Neither assessment condition promoted significantly greater levels of consistency (i.e., the same preference rating at Time 1 and Time 2). Residents expressed significantly fewer requests for clarification in the visual-and-text supported condition. Naïve judges rated residents' communication positively, with no significant differences between conditions. CONCLUSIONS This study addresses a gap in current research and holds important implications for enhancing care planning participation by residents with severe dementia. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Residents with severe dementia can successfully participate in activity preference discussions without proxy participation. Residents may comprehend interview questions better when provided in a supported format.","Burshnic, Vanessa L; Bourgeois, Michelle S",Clinical gerontologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2020.1764686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633699/,48
89900,Preventing Surgical Site Infections Related to Abdominal Drains in the Intensive Care Unit.,2018,"The clinicopathological value of microRNA-141-3p (miR-141-3p) and its prospective target genes in endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains unclear. The present study determined the expression level of miR-141-3p in EC via quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). RT-qPCR showed a markedly higher expression level of miR-141-3p in EC tissues than in non-EC endometrium tissues (P < 0.0001). The microarray and miRNA-seq data revealed upregulation of miR-141-3p. Integrated analysis based on 675 cases of EC and 63 controls gave a standardized mean difference of 1.737, confirmed the upregulation of miR-141-3p. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that a higher expression of miR-141-3p positively corelated with a poorer prognosis. Combining the predicted targets and downregulated genes in EC, we obtained 271 target genes for miR-141-3p in EC. Two potential targets, PPP1R12A and PPP1R12B, were downregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. This study indicates that the overexpression of miR-141-3p may play an important part in the carcinogenesis of EC. The overexpression of miR-141-3p may be a risk factor for the prognosis of patients with EC.","Yang, Lin-Jie; Gao, Li; Guo, Yi-Nan; Liang, Zi-Qian; Li, Dong-Ming; Tang, Yu-Lu; Liu, Yi-Hong; Gao, Wan-Jing; Zeng, Jing-Jing; Shi, Lin; Wei, Kang-Lai; Chen, Gang",Bioengineered,https://doi.org/10.1080/21655979.2021.1943111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180758/,48

92184,Post intensive care syndrome across the life course: Looking to the future of paediatric and adult critical care survivorship.,2021-03-01,"AIM Acute kidney injury (AKI) is diagnosed by a 50% increase in creatinine. For patients without a baseline creatinine measurement, guidelines suggest estimating baseline creatinine by back-calculation. The aim of this study was to evaluate different glomerular filtration rate (GFR) equations and different GFR assumptions for back-calculating baseline creatinine as well as the effect on the diagnosis of AKI. METHODS The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) and the Mayo quadratic (MQ) equation were evaluated to estimate baseline creatinine, each under the assumption of either a fixed GFR of 75 mL min-1 1.73 m-2 or an age-adjusted GFR. Estimated baseline creatinine, diagnoses and severity stages of AKI based on estimated baseline creatinine were compared to measured baseline creatinine and corresponding diagnoses and severity stages of AKI. RESULTS The data of 34 690 surgical patients were analysed. Estimating baseline creatinine overestimated baseline creatinine. Diagnosing AKI based on estimated baseline creatinine had only substantial agreement with AKI diagnoses based on measured baseline creatinine [Cohen's κ ranging from 0.66 (95% CI 0.65-0.68) to 0.77 (95% CI 0.76-0.79)] and overestimated AKI prevalence with fair sensitivity [ranging from 74.3% (95% CI 72.3-76.2) to 90.1% (95% CI 88.6-92.1)]. Staging AKI severity based on estimated baseline creatinine had moderate agreement with AKI severity based on measured baseline creatinine [Cohen's κ ranging from 0.43 (95% CI 0.42-0.44) to 0.53 (95% CI 0.51-0.55)]. CONCLUSION Diagnosing AKI and staging AKI severity on the basis of estimated baseline creatinine in surgical patients is not feasible. Patients at risk for post-operative AKI should have a pre-operative creatinine measurement to adequately assess post-operative AKI.","Kork, F; Balzer, F; Krannich, A; Bernardi, M H; Eltzschig, H K; Jankowski, J; Spies, C",Acta physiologica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.12763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27461744/,48

AIM To investigate the timing of end-of-life recognition, palliative registration, and the recording of end-of-life preferences in primary care for people aged ≥75 years. DESIGN AND SETTING Retrospective cohort study using national primary care record data, covering 34% of GP practices in England. METHOD ResearchOne data from electronic healthcare records (EHRs) of people aged ≥75 years who died in England between 1 January 2015 and 1 January 2016 were examined. Clinical codes relating to end-of-life recognition, palliative registration, and end-of-life preferences were extracted, and the number of months that elapsed between the code being entered and death taking place were calculated. The timing for each outcome and proportion of relevant EHRs were reported. RESULTS Death was recorded for a total of 13 149 people in ResearchOne data during the 1-year study window. Of those, 6303 (47.9%) records contained codes suggesting end of life had been recognised at a point in time prior to the month of death. Recognition occurred ≥12 months before death in 2248 (17.1%) records. In total, 1659 (12.6%) people were on the palliative care register and 457 (3.5%) were on the register for ≥12 months before death; 2987 (22.7%) records had a code for the patient's preferred place of care, and 1713 (13.0%) had a code for the preferred place of death. Where preferences for place of death were recorded, a care, nursing, or residential home (n = 813, 47.5%) and the individual's home (n = 752, 43.9%) were the most common. CONCLUSION End-of-life recognition in primary care appears to occur near to death and for only a minority of people aged ≥75 years. The findings suggest that older people's deaths may not be anticipated by health professionals, compromising equitable access to palliative care.","Stow, Daniel; Matthews, Fiona E; Hanratty, Barbara",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp20x713417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139331/,48
92584,Sleep continuity: a new metric to quantify disrupted hypnograms in non-sedated intensive care unit patients.,2014,"Nasal continuous positive airway pressure is used increasingly to treat pulmonary immaturity in premature neonates. Nasal injury is common with nasal continuous positive airway pressure use, with full-thickness tissue loss at the columella among the most devastating complications. Columellar necrosis often imparts a full-thickness injury to the overlying columellar skin, the medial crura of the lower lateral nasal cartilages, the anteromedial inner nasal mucosal lining, and potentially the anterior septal cartilage. Consequently, the columella can become scarred and shortened. Although multiple techniques have been described to reconstruct the columella, no known technique has been specifically developed to treat the unique columellar defect common to severe nasal continuous positive airway pressure injury. Donor-site morbidity related to these techniques, and how growth of the reconstructed nose will proceed, are obvious concerns, especially in young children. The authors present a novel reconstruction technique that uses recreation of the defect with posteriorly based book flaps and auricular chondrocutaneous composite graft interposition. This technique has several advantages, including avoiding central facial scars, supplying well-matched skin color and texture, and facilitating robust tip support. The authors retrospectively review the use and outcomes of this technique from 1995 and 2016 on all patients with a history of nasal continuous positive airway pressure columellar necrosis at their center.","Chang, Catherine S; Swanson, Jordan W; Wilson, Anthony; Low, David W; Bartlett, Scott P",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000003978; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28938361/,48

98115,Intensive care unit disaster preparation: keep it simple.,2008,"BACKGROUND First Contact Physiotherapy (FCP) is an emerging model of care whereby a specialist physiotherapist located within general practice undertakes the first patient assessment, diagnosis and management without a prior GP consultation. Despite institutional and professional body support for this model and NHS commitment to its implementation, data regarding current FCP provision are limited. OBJECTIVES To identify current FCP service provision across the UK, including models of provision and key professional capabilities. DESIGN Cross-sectional online survey, targeting physiotherapists and service managers involved in FCP. METHODS Recruitment involved non-probability sampling targeting those involved in FCP service provision through emails to members of known clinical networks, snowballing and social media. The survey gathered data about respondents, FCP services and the role and scope of physiotherapists providing FCP. RESULTS The authors received 102 responses; 32 from service managers and 70 working in FCP practice from England (n=60), Scotland (n=22), Wales (n=14), and Northern Ireland (n=2). Most practitioners were NHS band 7 or 8a (91%, n=63), with additional skills (e.g. requesting investigations, prescribing). 17% (12/70) worked 37.5hours/week; 37% (26/70) ≤10hours; most (71%, 50/70) used 20-minute appointments (range 10-30minutes); varying arrangements were reported for administration and follow-up. Services covered populations of 1200 to 600,000 (75% <100,000); access mostly involved combinations of self-booking and reception triage. Commissioning and funding arrangements varied widely; NHS sources provided 90% of services. CONCLUSIONS This survey provides new evidence regarding variation in FCP practice across the UK, indicating that evidence-informed, context specific guidance on optimal models of provision is required.","Halls, Serena; Thomas, Rachel; Stott, Hannah; Cupples, Margaret E; Kersten, Paula; Cramp, Fiona; Foster, Dave; Walsh, Nicola",Physiotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physio.2020.04.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32693238/,48

METHODS According to the data of COVID-19 patients and the resident population at the end of 2018 in Henan Province, statistical description and analysis of epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan Province were conducted, including the time distribution, population distribution, and regional distribution. RESULTS The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in Henan Province was 1.32/100 000, the cure rate was 98.03%, and the fatality rate was 1.73% by March 9, 2020. The incidence curve showed that the epidemic peak reached from January 24 to January 28. The high-incidence area was Xinyang, with a standardized cumulative incidence rate of 4.36/100 000. There were 580 female COVID-19 patients (45.60%), 688 males (54.09%) in Henan Province. The incidence of males was 1.41/100 000, while the incidence of females was 1.23/100 000. The age with the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Henan Province was 20-69 years old (88.68%). The incidence rate was highest in men aged 30-39 (2.51/ 100 000), while the lowest rate in women aged 0-9 (0.16/100 000). There were 1 225 local patients (96.31%), and the rural patients (45.73%) were slightly higher than the urban patients (44.02%) in Henan Province. A total of 63.60% patients had traveled or lived in Hubei or contacted with people who came from Hubei to Henan. The proportion of patients whose family members suffered from COVID-19 was 32.70%. Global spatial autocorrelation analysis suggested that there was a statistically significant positive correlation in the spatial distribution of COVID-19 patients in Henan Province (Moran's I=0.248, Z=2.955, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS There are differences in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients in different areas of Henan Province, with epidemic peak reaching from January 24 to January 28. Henan is dominated by local patients, male patients, and patients with contact history in Hubei.

Management of mechanically ventilated patients may pose a challenge to novice residents, many of which may not have received formal dedicated critical care instruction prior to starting their residency training. There is a paucity of data regarding simulation and mechanical ventilation training in the medical education literature. The purpose of this study was to develop a curriculum to educate first-year residents on addressing and troubleshooting ventilator alarms. Methods. Prospective evaluation was conducted of seventeen residents undergoing a twelve-hour three-day curriculum. Residents were assessed using a predetermined critical action checklist for each case, as well as pre- and postcurriculum multiple-choice cognitive knowledge questionnaires and confidence surveys. Results. Significant improvements in cognitive knowledge, critical actions, and self-reported confidence were demonstrated. The mean change in test score from before to after intervention was +26.8%, and a median score increase of 25% was noted. The ARDS and the mucus plugging cases had statistically significant improvements in critical actions, p < 0.001. A mean increase in self-reported confidence was realized (1.55 to 3.64), p = 0.049.

102782,Intensive Care Unit Built Environments: A Comprehensive Literature Review (2005-2020).,2021-05-18,"Around 6 million tonnes of edible food are being wasted (post-farm gate) in the UK each year. This fraction of edible wasted food is known as avoidable food waste. In a circular economy food is a valuable resource that must be captured at all stages of the food supply chain and, where possible, redistributed for consumption. This can prevent avoidable food waste generation, and dissipation of food's multidimensional value that spans environmental, economic, social, technical and political/organisational impacts. While the importance and benefits of surplus food redistribution have been well documented in the global literature, there are still barriers that prevent perfectly edible food from being wasted. This study looks at the main stages of the food supply chain, and amasses the opportunities, challenges and trade-offs associated with surplus food redistribution to the UK economy. It highlights points in the food system where interventions can be made, to improve food's circularity and sustainability potential. Stakeholder interrelations, regulatory and socio-economic aspects are discussed in relation to their influence on decreasing avoidable food waste. The main output from this work is a diagrammatic depiction of where challenges and trade-offs occur along the food supply chain, and how policy and socio-economic reforms are needed to maximise avoidable food waste prevention, and the surplus avoidable food redistribution in the food supply chain for social benefit.","Patel, Shivalee; Dora, Manoj; Hahladakis, John N; Iacovidou, Eleni","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x20983427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33517869/,48
103386,Using Simulation to Teach Transitions of Care for Hospitalized Patients.,2021,"BACKGROUND Acute type A aortic dissection repair is a surgical emergency associated with high mortality. In 2007, Liverpool Heart & Chest Hospital was the first institution in the United Kingdom to implement a thoracic aortic on-call dissection rota. We set out to investigate whether the dissection rota improved hospital quality outcomes and long-term survival. METHODS Data from a prospectively collected database was analysed following case note validation. Two hundred patients underwent acute type A aortic dissection repair between October 1998 and November 2015. To assess the effect of the post-dissection rota on operative and postoperative outcomes, propensity matching of pre- and post-dissection rota patients was used. RESULTS Eighty patients were identified from the pre-dissection rota era and 120 from the post-dissection rota era. Sixty patients from each era were then propensity matched. Comparative analyses showed that patients who underwent acute type A dissection repair in the post-dissection rota period were less likely to suffer in-hospital mortality in both the matched and unmatched groups (30% vs. 13.3%; P=0.004 and 28.3% vs. 11.7%; P=0.055, respectively). A similar improvement was shown in acute renal failure (26.3% vs. 14.2%; P=0.033 and 31.7% vs. 15.0%; P=0.044, respectively). However, cardiopulmonary bypass times and aortic cross clamp times were still significantly longer in the matched post-dissection rota cohort. There was a significant improvement in 5-year survival for the pre- and post-dissection rota in both the matched and unmatched patients (P=0.004 and P=0.034). CONCLUSIONS Reorganization of surgical expertise, activity and implementation of a dissection rota within our hospital have resulted in lower in-hospital mortality and better survival outcomes in this group of patients.","Bashir, Mohamad; Shaw, Matthew; Field, Mark; Kuduvalli, Manoj; Harrington, Deborah; Fok, Mathew; Oo, Aung Y",Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/acs.2016.05.09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27386408/,48

However, recent institutional and vertebrate conservation scientists' publication data suggest that China has a growing conservation research capacity deficit. China lacks a pipeline for the training and development of conservation scientists locally and abroad. The network of active conservation scientists is rapidly shrinking and institutions are exhibiting signs of academic inbreeding. Career advancement policies are perversely incentivized away from practical conservation research, thereby constraining capacity building. Comparative data indicate that China severely lags behind the United States and United Kingdom in research quality and capacity. We outline possible recommendations that include developing a different performance evaluation system, promoting training and international exchanges, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration, and fostering international collaborative networks for China-based conservation scientists. For global biodiversity governance, China must act to make up for considerable shortfalls in conservation research capacity and research collaborative networks.","Fan, Peng-Fei; Yang, Li; Liu, Yang; Lee, Tien Ming",Nature ecology & evolution,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-1253-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32690907/,48
104803,Troponin I as an Early Biomarker of Cardiopulmonary Parameters Within the First 24 Hours After Nontraumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Intensive Care Unit Patients.,2019,"PURPOSE Practice patterns for inguinal hernia repair vary significantly among surgeons. The purpose of this study was to identify perceived indications for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR), and to identify barriers to its adoption and educational needs for surgeons. METHODS A web-based survey was sent to general surgery members of several North American surgical societies, and to surgical residents through program directors. The 33-item survey was divided in 4 sections: demographics, utilization of techniques, management based on 11 clinical scenarios, reasons for not performing LIHR and educational needs for those who want to learn. RESULTS Six hundred and ninety-seven general surgeons and 206 general surgery residents responded to the survey. Surgeons with MIS fellowships, and surgeons at the beginning of their careers are more likely to perform LIHR. Out of the 11 clinical scenarios, surgeons preferred a laparoscopic approach (totally extraperitoneal or transabdominal preperitoneal) for bilateral (48 %) and recurrent (44 %) hernias. However, 46 % of respondents never perform LIHR. Of these, 70 % consider the benefits of laparoscopy to be minimal, 59 % said they lack the requisite training, and 26 % are interested in learning. Surgeons (70 %) and residents (73 %) agreed that the best educational method would be a course followed by expert proctoring. CONCLUSION Surgeons remain divided on the utility of laparoscopic surgery for inguinal hernia repair. Nearly half of responding surgeons never perform LIHR, and the other half offer it selectively. One quarter of surgeons who do not perform LIHR are interested in learning. This reveals a knowledge gap that could be addressed with educational programs.","Trevisonno, M; Kaneva, P; Watanabe, Y; Fried, G M; Feldman, L S; Lebedeva, E; Vassiliou, M C",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-014-1287-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25079224/,48

In the current study, a novel ""symptomics"" approach was employed to examine the association between acute transdiagnostic symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and burnout and work and relationship difficulties in FHCWs at an urban tertiary care hospital in New York City. METHODS Symptoms of COVID-19-related PTSD (4-item PTSD Checklist-5), MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), burnout (Single-Item Mini-Z Burnout Assessment), and functional difficulties (Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning) were assessed. Relative importance analyses were conducted to identify PTSD, MDD, and GAD symptoms associated with burnout and functional difficulties. RESULTS The total number of eligible participants included 6,026 presumed FHCWs, of which 3,360 (55.8%) completed the survey and 2,579 (76.8%) of whom endorsed directly treating patients with COVID-19 and provided sufficient responses to our outcome variables for analysis. Feeling tired/having little energy, being easily annoyed or irritable, and feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge were most strongly associated with burnout; feeling tired/having little energy accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 15%). Negative expectations of oneself or the world, trouble concentrating, and feeling easily annoyed or irritable were most strongly associated with work difficulties; negative expectations of oneself or the world accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 9%). Feeling easily annoyed or irritable, negative expectations about oneself or the world, and feeling bad about oneself were most strongly associated with relationship difficulties; feeling easily annoyed or irritable accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 10%). CONCLUSIONS Results of this study underscore the importance of a transdiagnostic, symptom-based approach when examining associations between acute psychopathology and burnout and functional difficulties in FHCWs. Further work is needed to determine if early interventions aimed at ameliorating specific psychiatric symptoms may help mitigate risk for peri- and posttraumatic burnout and functional difficulties in this population.","Kachadourian, Lorig K; Feder, Adriana; Murrough, James W; Feingold, Jordyn H; Kaye-Kauderer, Halley; Charney, Dennis; Southwick, Steven M; Peccoralo, Lauren; Ripp, Jonathan; Pietrzak, Robert H",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.20m13766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34004095/,48
107910,"Incidence of respiratory distress and its predictors among neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",2020,"OBJECTIVES A range of communication skills training programmes have been developed targeting trainees in various medical specialties, predominantly in oncology but to a lesser extent in psychiatry. Effective communication is fundamental to the assessment and treatment of psychiatric conditions, but there has been less attention to this in clinical practice for psychiatrists in training. This review examines the outcomes of communication skills training interventions in psychiatric specialty training. METHODS The published English-language literature was examined using multiple online databases, grey literature and hand searches. The review was conducted and reported using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Studies examining the efficacy of communication skills training were included. Randomised controlled trials, pseudo-randomised studies and quasi-experimental studies, as well as observational analytical studies and qualitative studies that met criteria, were selected and critically appraised. No limits were applied for date of publication up until 16 July 2016. RESULTS Total search results yielded 2574 records. Of these, 12 studies were identified and reviewed. Two were randomised controlled trials and the remaining 10 were one-group pretest/posttest designs or posttest-only designs, including self-report evaluations of communication skills training and objective evaluations of trainee skills. There were no studies with outcomes related to behaviour change or patient outcomes. Two randomised controlled trials reported an improvement in clinician empathy and psychotherapeutic interviewing skills due to specific training protocols focused on those areas. Non-randomised studies showed varying levels of skills gains and self-reported trainee satisfaction ratings with programmes, with the intervention being some form of communication skills training. CONCLUSION The heterogeneity of communication skills training is a barrier to evaluating the efficacy of different communication skills training programmes. Further validation studies examining specific models and frameworks would support a stronger evidence base for communication skills training in psychiatry. It remains a challenge to develop research to investigate behaviour change over time in clinical practice or to measure patient outcomes due to the effects of communication skills training.","Ditton-Phare, Philippa; Loughland, Carmel; Duvivier, Robbert; Kelly, Brian",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867417707820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28462636/,48
108138,Postoperative Bedside Critical Care of Thoracic Surgery Patients.,2018,"Introduction In Central Brooklyn, Downstate Health Sciences University (DHSU) serves a diverse population that has experienced worsening rates of chronic disease and elevated rates of morbidity and mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The medical community has shown an interest in addressing clinical and nonclinical disparities impacting patients' health and safety. As such, health policy knowledge is of special importance during a time of social and political unrest. Health policy and advocacy are listed in medical education guidelines, but there is a lack of standardized guidelines for implementation of a robust health policy curriculum within the rigors of clinical education. Methods Faculty from the Department of Family Medicine and the Department of Health Policy and Administration devised a health policy curriculum to be delivered virtually in the wake of COVID-19-related quarantine. To assess the effectiveness of the curriculum, we administered pre- and postsurveys composed of learning objectives placed on a 5-point Likert scale, at each learning session. Results The results of these surveys showed an increase in confidence in the learning objectives of each educational session. Conclusion This pilot study warrants further research to fully assess the effect of a health policy curriculum on students' confidence in health policy knowledge and skills.""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.""-Nelson Mandela.","Walton, Rebecca; Greenberg, Alexandra; Ehlke, Daniel; Solá, Orlando",PRiMER,https://doi.org/10.22454/primer.2020.557079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111056/,48
108289,Facilitating Virtual Visitation in Critical Care Units During a Pandemic.,2021,"UNLABELLED The spike proteins of coronaviruses are capable of binding to a wide range of cellular targets, which contributes to the broad species tropism of coronaviruses. Previous reports have demonstrated that Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) predominantly utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for cell entry. However, additional cellular binding targets of the MERS-CoV spike protein that may augment MERS-CoV infection have not been further explored. In the current study, using the virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA), we identified carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) as a novel cell surface binding target of MERS-CoV. CEACAM5 coimmunoprecipitated with the spike protein of MERS-CoV in both overexpressed and endogenous settings. Disrupting the interaction between CEACAM5 and MERS-CoV spike with anti-CEACAM5 antibody, recombinant CEACAM5 protein, or small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of CEACAM5 significantly inhibited the entry of MERS-CoV. Recombinant expression of CEACAM5 did not render nonpermissive baby hamster kidney (BHK21) cells susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Instead, CEACAM5 overexpression significantly enhanced the attachment of MERS-CoV to the BHK21 cells. More importantly, the entry of MERS-CoV was increased when CEACAM5 was overexpressed in permissive cells, which suggested that CEACAM5 could facilitate MERS-CoV entry in conjunction with DPP4 despite not being able to support MERS-CoV entry independently. Taken together, the results of our study identified CEACAM5 as a novel cell surface binding target of MERS-CoV that facilitates MERS-CoV infection by augmenting the attachment of the virus to the host cell surface. IMPORTANCE Infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is associated with the highest mortality rate among all known human-pathogenic coronaviruses. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection. The identification of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) as a novel cell surface binding target of MERS-CoV advanced our knowledge on the cell binding biology of MERS-CoV. Importantly, CEACAM5 could potentiate the entry of MERS-CoV by functioning as an attachment factor. In this regard, CEACAM5 could serve as a novel target, in addition to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), in the development of antiviral strategies for MERS-CoV.","Chan, Che-Man; Chu, Hin; Wang, Yixin; Wong, Bosco Ho-Yin; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Jie; Yang, Dong; Leung, Sze Pui; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yeung, Man-Lung; Yan, Jinghua; Lu, Guangwen; Gao, George Fu; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01133-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27489282/,48

METHODS A questionnaire was administered to pediatric intensivists in North and South America, Asia, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand for the main study. We compared the Brazilian cohort with cohorts in the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, and India. RESULTS Overall, 501 physicians responded, 127 of which were in Brazil. Only 63.8% of respondents in Brazil had a high-flow nasal cannula available, in contrast to 100% of respondents in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The attending physician was responsible for the decision to start a high-flow nasal cannula according to 61.2% respondents in Brazil, 95.5% in the United Kingdom, 96.6% in the United States, 96.8% in Canada, and 84.7% in India. A total of 62% of respondents in Brazil, 96.3% in the United Kingdom, 96.6% in the United States, 96.8% in Canada, and 84.7% in India reported that the attending physician was responsible for the decision to wean or modify the high-flow nasal cannula settings. When high-flow nasal cannula therapy failed due to respiratory distress/failure, 82% of respondents in Brazil would consider a trial of noninvasive ventilation before endotracheal intubation, compared to 93% in the United Kingdom, 88% in the United States, 91.5% in Canada, and 76.8% in India. More Brazilian intensivists (6.5%) than intensivists in the United Kingdom, United States, and India (1.6% for all) affirmed using sedatives frequently with high-flow nasal cannulas. CONCLUSION The availability of high-flow nasal cannulas in Brazil is still not widespread. There are some divergences in clinical practices between Brazilian intensivists and their colleagues abroad, mainly in processes and decision-making about starting and weaning high-flow nasal cannula therapy.","Colleti Júnior, José; Kawaguchi, Atsushi; Araujo, Orlei Ribeiro de; Garros, Daniel",Revista Brasileira de terapia intensiva,https://doi.org/10.5935/0103-507x.20210055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586298/,48

Laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) is a technically challenging procedure, especially for esophagojejunal anastomosis (EJA). Various techniques have been described to overcome these difficulties using staplers with variable results. We report successfully performed complete intracorporeal hand-sewn EJA after LTG. The perioperative clinical data and short-term outcomes for 30 patients who underwent LTG using hand-sewn EJA for gastric cancer between 2013 and 2015 have been retrospectively reviewed. The mean age was 49.9 years; 64 % of patients were male and 36 % were female. The mean body mass index (kg/m2) was 22.4, and the mean American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score was 1.4. Eleven patients had co-morbidities, and six patients had previous abdominal operations. The mean operative time, time for EJA, and blood loss was 136.9 min, 13.25 min, and 166 ml, respectively. The conversion rate was nil. The mean time for the first oral feeding and mean hospital stay was 8.3 and 9.8 days respectively. The postoperative complications were found in 16 % of patients with one case of 30-day mortality because of lobar pneumonia. There were three cases of anastomotic stenosis; however, no leakage was identified both clinically and radiologically. Complete intracorporeal hand-sewn EJA is a safe and feasible technique in the hands of experienced surgeons that can be considered as an alternative cost-effective method when performing LTG.","Puntambekar, Shailesh; Badran, Reda; Parikh, Hirav; Bansal, Arpit; Sharma, Vikrant; Chitale, Mihir; Jadhav, Saptesh",The Indian journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12262-016-1509-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29217899/,48

METHODS Data were from Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals from April 1, 2003, to June 30, 2013. We looked at trends in number of hospitals providing endovascular therapy, the use of endovascular therapy in these hospitals and clinical outcomes. We analyzed hospital and patient characteristics associated with endovascular therapy use. RESULTS Of 1087 hospitals, 454 provided endovascular therapy to ≥1 patient in the study period. From 2003 to 2012, proportion of hospitals providing endovascular therapy increased by 1.6% per year (from 12.9% to 28.9%; P<0.0001), with a modest drop to 23.4% in 2013. Utilization of endovascular therapy increased from 0.7% to 2% (P<0.001) with a modest drop to 1.9% in 2013. The overall rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage among endovascular therapy treated patients was 9.7%. In multivariable analyses, patient outcomes after endovascular therapy improved over time, with reductions in in-hospital mortality (29.6% in 2004 to 16.2% in 2013; P=0.002); and from late 2010, reduction in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (11% in 2010 to 5% in 2013; P<0.0001), increased independent ambulation at discharge (24.5% in 2010 to 33% in 2013; P<0.0001) and discharge home (17.7% in 2010 to 26.1% in 2013; P<0.0001). Trends for these outcomes persist in the analyses adjusted for baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.

The pace of development of respiratory failure is often rapid and can occur in previously healthy hosts, mandating close observation and timely intervention of infected individuals. Use of standard, contact, droplet and airborne isolation precautions is recommended to protect healthcare workers. Key components of ARDS management encompass appropriate mechanical ventilation including limiting tidal volume to </=6 mL/kg of predicted body weight, maintaining transpulmonary pressures </=30 cm H(2)O, and utilizing positive end-expiratory pressure to limit alveolar deflation and to improve oxygenation. Additional strategies include conservative fluid management and using nutrition supplemented with antioxidants. Use of corticosteroids is controversial for both early and late ARDS and although often used for avian influenza, beneficial effects on outcomes have not been demonstrated for corticosteroids. Prone positioning can improve oxygenation temporarily and might be useful as rescue therapy for severe hypoxemia. Administration of inhaled nitric oxide and high frequency oscillatory ventilation can improve oxygenation but have not been demonstrated to improve survival in ARDS-their role in avian influenza is uncertain and availability limited. Management of multiple organ failure may include vasopressor support for septic shock and renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure.","Sessler, Curtis N; Gray, Nicole D",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2008.01254.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18366526/,48

125533,Serum Biomarkers for Risk Assessment of Intrahospital Transports in Mechanically Ventilated Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit Patients.,2019-11-28,"The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns for programs overseeing donation and transplantation of cells, tissues and organs (CTO) that this virus might be transmissible by transfusion or transplantation. Transplant recipients are considered particularly vulnerable to pathogens due to immunosuppression, and SARS-CoV-2 is likely to generate complications if contracted. Several signs and symptoms observed in COVID-19 positive patients reflect damage to multiple organs and tissues, raising the possibility of extra-pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infections and risk of transmission. At the beginning of the pandemic, a consensus has emerged not to consider COVID-19 positive patients as potential living or deceased donors, resulting in a global decrease in transplantation procedures. Medical decision making at the time of organ allocation must consider safely alongside the survival advantages offered by transplantation. To address the risk of transmission by transplantation, this review summarizes the published cases of transplantation of cells or organs from donors infected with SARS-CoV-2 and assesses the current state of knowledge for the detection of this virus in different biological specimens, cells, tissues and organs. Evidence collected to date raises the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in some CTO, which makes it impossible to exclude transmission through transplantation. However, most studies focused on evaluating transmission under laboratory conditions with inconsistent findings, rendering the comparison of results difficult. Improved standardization of donors and CTO screening practices, along with a systematic follow-up of transplant recipients could facilitate the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk by transplantation.

The initial recognized symptoms were respiratory, sometimes culminating in severe respiratory distress requiring ventilation, and causing death in a percentage of those infected. As time has passed, other symptoms have been recognized. The initial reports of cutaneous manifestations were from Italian dermatologists, probably because Italy was the first European country to be heavily affected by the pandemic. The overall clinical presentation, course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children differ from those in adults, as do the cutaneous manifestations of childhood. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 in children after thorough and critical review of articles published in the literature and from the personal experience of a large panel of paediatric dermatologists in Europe. In Part 1, we discussed one of the first and most widespread cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19, chilblain-like lesions. In this part of the review, we describe other manifestations, including erythema multiforme, urticaria and Kawasaki disease-like inflammatory multisystemic syndrome. In Part 3, we discuss the histological findings of COVID-19 manifestations, and the testing and management of infected children for both COVID-19 and any other pre-existing conditions.","Andina, D; Belloni-Fortina, A; Bodemer, C; Bonifazi, E; Chiriac, A; Colmenero, I; Diociaiuti, A; El-Hachem, M; Fertita, L; van Gysel, D; Hernández-Martín, A; Hubiche, T; Luca, C; Martos-Cabrera, L; Maruani, A; Mazzotta, F; Akkaya, A D; Casals, M; Ferrando, J; Grimalt, R; Grozdev, I; Kinsler, V; Morren, M A; Munisami, M; Nanda, A; Novoa, M P; Ott, H; Pasmans, S; Salavastru, C; Zawar, V; Torrelo, A",Clinical and experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ced.14482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33166429/,48

However, it is one of the few to make such a fast jump in a powerful and efficient evolutionary shortcut. The incredible pattern of aggressiveness and the nude reality all over the world since the beginning of the outbreak is that 15 to 20% of those infected need hospitalization because of adverse clinical scenarios, and 5% evolve to critical conditions, not limited to respiratory-related issues, but rather to systemic involvement. A hugely exacerbated immunologic and inflammatory response to the virus surpasses the body's capacity to reestablish homeostasis and create a potentially deadly situation. The kidneys and testis have high expressions of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2), and this primary receptor opens up the cell to the CoVs spike protein to ligate. One issue science needs to answer is whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is sexually transmissible, and if it is viable in the ejaculate. Does the virus, its immunologic and inflammatory brutal response, cause direct sperm or indirect (testicular) dysfunction?

Replicating such structural features in artificial materials is of great significance yet remains a big challenge. Here, a facile strategy is reported to fabricate hydrogels with elaborate ordered structures of nanosheets (NSs) oriented under a distributed electric field. Multiple electrodes are distributed with various arrangements in the precursor solution containing NSs and gold nanoparticles. A complex electric field induces sophisticated orientations of the NSs that are permanently inscribed by subsequent photo-polymerization. The resultant anisotropic nanocomposite poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels exhibit rapid deformation upon heating or photoirradiation, owing to the fast switching of permittivity of the media and electric repulsion between the NSs. The complex alignments of NSs and anisotropic shape change of discrete regions result in programmed deformation of the hydrogels into various configurations. Furthermore, locomotion is realized by a spatiotemporal light stimulation that locally triggers time-variant shape change of the composite hydrogel with complex anisotropic structures. Such a strategy on the basis of the distributed electric-field-generated ordered structures should be applicable to gels, elastomers, and thermosets loaded with other anisotropic particles or liquid crystals, for the design of biomimetic/bioinspired materials with specific functionalities.","Zhu, Qing Li; Dai, Chen Fei; Wagner, Daniel; Daab, Matthias; Hong, Wei; Breu, Josef; Zheng, Qiang; Wu, Zi Liang",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202005567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079426/,48
133099,Optimizing Post-Intensive Care Unit Rehabilitation.,2019,"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic leads to several debates regarding the possible risk for healthcare professionals during surgery. SAGES and EAES raised the issue of the transmission of infection through the surgical smoke during laparoscopy. They recommended the use of smoke evacuation devices (SEDs) with CO2 filtering systems. The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of different SEDs evaluating the CO2 environmental dispersion in the operating theater. Methods. We prospectively evaluated the data of 4 group of patients on which we used different SEDs or standard trocars: AIRSEAL system (S1 group), a homemade device (S2 group), an AIRSEAL system + homemade device (S3 group), and with standard trocars and without SED (S4 group). Quantitative analysis of CO2 environmental dispersion was carried out associated to the following data in order to evaluate the pneumoperitoneum variations: a preset insufflation pressure, real intraoperative pneumoperitoneum pressure, operative time, total volume of insufflated CO2, and flow rate index. Results. 16 patients were prospectively enrolled. The [CO2] mean value was 711 ppm, 641 ppm, 593 ppm, and 761 ppm in S1, S2, S3, and S4 groups, respectively. The comparison between data of all groups showed statistically significant differences in the measured ambient CO2 concentration. Conclusion. All tested SEDs seem to be useful to reduce the CO2 environmental dispersion respect to the use of standard trocars. The association of AIRSEAL system and a homemade device seems to be the best solution combining an adequate smoke evacuation and a stable pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery.","Bracale, Umberto; Silvestri, Vania; Pontecorvi, Emanuele; Russo, Immacolata; Triassi, Maria; Cassinotti, Elisa; Merola, Giovanni; Montuori, Paolo; Boni, Luigi; Corcione, Francesco",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/15533506211014857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33961529/,48

This study aims to assess the exposure to 10 phthalates, DINCH, and environmental phenols (3 BPs, 7 PBs, and TCS) of Slovenian men (n = 548) and lactating primiparous women (n = 536). We observed urinary concentrations comparable to studies from other countries and significant differences among the sub-populations. In our study, men had significantly higher levels of phthalates, DINCH, and BPs, whereas the concentrations of PBs in urine were significantly higher in women. The most significant determinant of exposure was the area of residence and the year of sampling (2008-2014) that mirrors trends in the market. Participants from urban or industrialized sampling locations had higher levels of almost all monitored analytes compared to rural locations. In an attempt to assess the risk of the population, hazard quotient (HQ) values were calculated for individual compounds and the chemical mixture. Individual analytes do not seem to pose a risk to the studied population at current exposure levels, whereas the HQ value of the chemical mixture is near the threshold of 1 which would indicate a higher risk. We conclude that greater emphasis on the risk resulting from cumulative exposure to chemical mixtures and additional studies are needed to estimate the exposure of susceptible populations, such as children.","Runkel, Agneta A; Mazej, Darja; Snoj Tratnik, Janja; Tkalec, Žiga; Kosjek, Tina; Horvat, Milena",Chemosphere,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399256/,48

The secondary aim was to determine the potential role of spinal neurological mechanisms regarding the effect of WBV exercise on contralateral strength training.Materials and Methods: Forty-two young adult healthy volunteers were randomized into two groups: WBV exercise and Sham control. An isometric semi-squat exercise during WBV was applied regularly through 20 sessions. WBV training was applied to the right leg in the WBV group and the left leg was isolated from vibration. Sham WBV was applied to the right leg of participants in the Control group. Pre- and post-training isokinetic torque and reflex latency of both quadricepses were evaluated.Results: The increase in the strength of right (vibrated) knee extensors was 9.4 ± 10.7% in the WBV group (p = .001) and was 1.2 ± 6.6% in the Control group (p = .724). The left (non-vibrated) extensorsvibrated) knee extensors w4 ± 8.4% in the WBV group (p = .038), whereas it decreased by 1.4 ± 7.0% in the Control (p = .294). The strength gains were significant between the two groups. WBV induced the reflex response of the quadriceps muscle in the vibrated ipsilateral leg and also in the non-vibrated contralateral leg, though with a definite delay. The WBV-induced muscle reflex (WBV-IMR) latency was 22.5 ± 7.7 ms for the vibrated leg and 39.3 ± 14.6 ms for the non-vibrated leg.Conclusions: Chronic WBV training has an effect of the cross-transfer of strength to contralateral homologous muscles. The WBV-induced muscular reflex may have a role in the mechanism of cross-transfer strength.","Aydın, Tuğba; Kesiktaş, Fatma Nur; Baskent, Akın; Karan, Ayşe; Karacan, Ilhan; Türker, Kemal S",Somatosensory & motor research,https://doi.org/10.1080/08990220.2020.1720635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32024411/,48

METHODS The epidemic data was obtained from the official website of Hunan Province's Health Commission. The data of each city of Hunan Province was analyzed separately. Spatial distribution of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 patients and the cumulative occurrence rate was drawn by ArcGIS software for each city in Hunan Province. Some regional indexes were also compared with that in the whole country. RESULTS The first patient was diagnosed in January 21, sustained patient growth reached its plateau in around February 17. Up to March 14, the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 patients stopped at 1 018. The cumulative occurrence rate of COVID-19 patients was 0.48 per 0.1 million person. The number of cumulative severe patients was 150 and the number of cumulative dead patients was 4. The mortality rate (0.39%) and the cure rate (99.6%) in Hunan Province was significantly lower and higher respectively than the corresponding average rate in the whole country (0.90% and 96.2%, Hubei excluded). The first 3 cities in numbers of the confirmed patients were Changsha, Yueyang, and Shaoyang. While sorted by the cumulative occurrence rate, the first 3 cities in incidence were Changsha, Yueyang, and Zhuzhou. CONCLUSIONS The epidemic of COVID-19 spread out smoothly in Hunan Province. The cities in Hunan Province implement anti-disease strategies based on specific situations on their own and keep the epidemic in the range of controllable.","Mao, Yitao; Zeng, Huihui; Wang, Ying; Xiao, Juxiong; Yang, Wei; Zhou, Gaofeng; Liao, Weihua",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

The most common cause of SMAS is known as rapid and significant weight loss. PATIENT CONCERNS A 61-year-old man who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and maintained a stable diet before admission. When the patient re-started feeding by gastrostomy tube after 5 days of therapeutic fasting due to gastric ulcer caused by gastrostomy tube irritation, he presented postprandial vomiting, abdominal distention, and tachycardia. Since fasting, his weight has been reduced by about 3 kg. DIAGNOSIS Based on clinical symptoms and radiological findings, diagnose of SMAS was finally made. Abdomen computed tomography confirmed decreased aortomesenteric distance and tubography confirmed gastric and proximal duodenum distension above the compressed part. INTERVENTIONS We performed jejunal tube insertion and the amount of feeding through the jejunal tube was gradually increased while maintaining parenteral nutrition. OUTCOMES The presenting symptoms of the patient gradually improved. Follow-up abdomen computed tomography and tubography showed improvement in duodenal narrowing and stomach distension. CONCLUSION SMAS should be considered when there is an abrupt observation of symptom of gastrointestinal obstruction in patients with predisposing condition such as a low body weight, even if the weight loss is relatively small.","Kang, Dong-Ha; Baik, Sung Woon; Won, Yu Hui; Ko, Myoung-Hwan",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629635/,48

Herein, we demonstrate that the integration of shape memory property and surface treatment enabled hygromorphic responsivity endows a single-component polymer film with programmable moisture-driven actuating behaviors. The solvent-processed polyethylene-co-acrylic acid (EAA) copolymer film is soft and stretchable at room temperature, and has a good thermal-responsive shape memory property. By surface treatment using base/acid solutions, the reversible gradient conversion between carboxyl groups and carboxylate salts along the thickness direction enables the film to exhibit designed hygroscopic actuations. The shape memory property and moisture-driven actuating behaviors can be combined to realize 3D-3D morphing by first programming the films into 3D shapes and then conducting the surface treatments. Both shape programming and surface treatment processes can be reprogrammed to make the actuation behavior readily tunable. We also show that the created surface patterns can act as moisture-sensitive conducting paths to detect human breathes, and the combination of shape memory, moisture-responsive morphing and conductivity change leads to some interesting applications such as smart switch in conducting circuit. This work provides a new and general strategy for the design of advanced humidity-responsive actuators.","Ge, Yuhua; Wang, Hanxiao; Xue, Jieying; Jiang, Jinqiang; Liu, Zhaotie; Liu, Zhongwen; Li, Guo; Zhao, Yue",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c11862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369771/,48

METHODS Using a 2-by-2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned participants without cardiovascular disease who had an elevated INTERHEART Risk Score to receive a polypill (containing 40 mg of simvastatin, 100 mg of atenolol, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, and 10 mg of ramipril) or placebo daily, aspirin (75 mg) or placebo daily, and vitamin D or placebo monthly. We report here the outcomes for the polypill alone as compared with matching placebo, for aspirin alone as compared with matching placebo, and for the polypill plus aspirin as compared with double placebo. For the polypill-alone and polypill-plus-aspirin comparisons, the primary outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart failure, or revascularization. For the aspirin comparison, the primary outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS A total of 5713 participants underwent randomization, and the mean follow-up was 4.6 years. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was lower by approximately 19 mg per deciliter and systolic blood pressure was lower by approximately 5.8 mm Hg with the polypill and with combination therapy than with placebo. The primary outcome for the polypill comparison occurred in 126 participants (4.4%) in the polypill group and in 157 (5.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.00). The primary outcome for the aspirin comparison occurred in 116 participants (4.1%) in the aspirin group and in 134 (4.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.10). The primary outcome for the polypill-plus-aspirin comparison occurred in 59 participants (4.1%) in the combined-treatment group and in 83 (5.8%) in the double-placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.69; CI, 0.50 to 0.97). The incidence of hypotension or dizziness was higher in groups that received the polypill than in their respective placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS Combined treatment with a polypill plus aspirin led to a lower incidence of cardiovascular events than did placebo among participants without cardiovascular disease who were at intermediate cardiovascular risk.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case review. SETTING Tertiary care academic medical center. PATIENTS Inclusion criteria were patients who underwent otologic/neurotologic surgery and were seen in at least one telemedicine visit for postoperative care. INTERVENTION (S) Telemedicine visit for postoperative care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE (S) Comparison of the number of patient calls, unplanned visits, and delayed complications between telemedicine patients and controls matched for age, procedure, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status. RESULTS Eighteen patients were seen in telemedicine visits postoperatively after the following otologic/neurotologic surgical procedures: cochlear implant surgery (10), vestibular schwannoma resection (4), combined middle fossa and transmastoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak repair (2), middle fossa repair of superior canal dehiscence (1), and stapedectomy (1). All telehealth visits were for the second postoperative visit. The mean number of patient calls after surgery was 2.3 for the telemedicine group and 1.9 for matched controls which was not a statistically significant difference (p = 0.466). Both groups each had two patients who went to the emergency room, with one in each group being admitted. There was one delayed complication in the control group. CONCLUSION Our preliminary experience suggests telemedicine may be used safely in caring for patients after otologic/neurotologic surgery, though it may be associated with more patient phone calls. Further study and experience, including assessing patient satisfaction, will clarify the future role of telemedicine in otology and neurotology.","Shapiro, Scott B; Lipschitz, Noga; Kemper, Nathan; Zuccarello, Mario; Breen, Joseph T; Pensak, Myles L; Samy, Ravi N","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000002774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769958/,48

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between measures of screen time in adolescence and Working Memory. Data from the 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study were analyzed (N = 3625). Self-reported screen time was collected at ages 11, 15 and 18. Working Memory performance (Digit Span backward score) was examined at age 22. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the associations between three screen time measures (television, video game and computer time) for each age and WM at age 22. We also evaluated the direct and indirect effect by mediation analysis, using the intelligence quotient (IQ) at 18 years as mediator. In men, television and video game time at 11 years and computer at ages 11 and 15 years had a positive effect on WM. Also, these effects were mediated through IQ. In women there was no significant association between screen time measures at ages 11, 15, and 18 and WM. This study provides new insights about the relationship between television, videogame, and computer time with WM in adolescents, by exploring the paths of these associations and considering the important mediating role of IQ.","Soares, Pedro San Martin; de Oliveira, Paula Duarte; Wehrmeister, Fernando César; Menezes, Ana Maria Baptista; Gonçalves, Helen",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725639/,48

Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO®) is an established hub-and-spoke tele-education model aimed at building capacity and expertise in primary care providers. Our qualitative study explored how learning experiences within an ECHO mental health care program supported provider learning and ability to solve complex clinical problems. METHODS We sampled ECHO sessions across a 34-week cycle and analyzed audio transcribed data. Two individuals coded participant interactions during 2-hour recorded sessions using an iterative, constant comparative methodology. RESULTS The authors identified four key mechanisms of learning in ECHO: (1) fostering participants' productive struggle with cases, (2) development of an integrated understanding, (3) collaborative reformulation of cases, and (4) generation of conceptual solutions based on a new understanding. Throughout the ECHO sessions, learning was observed to be multidirectional from both the hub-to-spoke and between spoke sites. DISCUSSION Despite the widespread implementation of Project ECHO and other virtual learning models, a paucity of research has focused on mechanisms of virtual learning within these models. Our study demonstrated a bidirectional exchange of knowledge between hub specialist teams and primary care provider spokes that aligned with the development of adaptive expertise through specific learning experiences in Project ECHO. Moreover, the ECHO structure may further support the development of adaptive expertise to better prepare participants to address patients' complex mental health needs.","Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Rajaratnam, Thiyake; Zhou, Carrol; Serhal, Eva; Crawford, Allison; Mylopoulos, Maria",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,https://doi.org/10.1097/ceh.0000000000000349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34009840/,48
154015,Lung ultrasound in a tertiary intensive care unit population: a diagnostic accuracy study.,2021-09-17,"Background The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is threatening public health in many ways. The psychological situation of individuals is important and limited data is available from Iran. In this study, we aimed to illustrate the psychological distress of the general population and evaluate the factors affecting it. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from 29th to 31st March 2020 in South Khorasan province, affected later than other parts of the country. We included sociodemographic questions, Hospital Anxiety, and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, and questions addressing various symptoms and diseases. Most questions had multiple choices to select from and some were open questions. Univariate and multivariate analysis in SPSS software was used to find significant relationships. Results A total of 844 responses were collected, of which 788 records were included in the analysis. The mean age of responders was 36.61±10.97 (age range: 18-88) and 484 (61.4%) of them were females. The mean scores in the anxiety and depression subscale of the HADS questionnaire were 7.01±3.68 and 6.72±3.71 respectively. Experiencing cardiovascular and COVID-19 related symptoms was significantly associated with a higher number of individuals having abnormal anxiety and depression results (p<0.001). Widowed individuals, females, and those experiencing the above-stated symptoms showed a significant association with increased anxiety and depression in multivariate analysis. Conclusion Although many existing elements influence the psychological well-being of society during a pandemic, experiencing symptoms related to other diseases or having multiple chronic diseases may cause an extra burden on the psychological state of the society.","Ansari Ramandi, Mohammad Mostafa; Yarmohammadi, Hossein; Beikmohammadi, Somayeh; Hassan Hosseiny Fahimi, Behzad; Amirabadizadeh, Alireza",Caspian journal of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.22088/cjim.11.0.; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425265/,48

WHO has declared the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern owing to its high contagiosity, mortality rate, and morbidity. Till now, there is no approved vaccine or drug to combat the COVID-19 and avert this global crisis. AREAS COVERED In this narrative review, we summarized the updated results (January to August 2020) of the most promising repurposing therapeutic candidates to treat the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. The repurposed drugs classified under four headlines like antivirals, anti-parasitic, immune-modulating, and miscellaneous drugs were discussed with their in vitro efficacy to recent clinical advancements against COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION Currently, palliative care, ranging from outpatient management to intensive care, including oxygen administration, ventilator support, intravenous fluids therapy, with some repurposed drugs, are the primary weapons to fight against COVID-19. Until a safe and effective vaccine is developed, an evidence-based drug repurposing strategy might be the wisest option to save people from this catastrophe. Several existing drugs are now under clinical trials, and some of them are approved in different places of the world for emergency use or as adjuvant therapy in COVID-19 with standard of care.","Hossain, Md Jamal; Rahman, S M Abdur",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2021.1864327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355520/,48
156832,"Dysphagia in the intensive care unit: epidemiology, mechanisms, and clinical management.",2019,"INTRODUCTION Faculty Development (FD) plays a key role in supporting education, especially during times of change. The effectiveness of FD often depends upon organizational factors, indicating a need for a deeper appreciation of the role of institutional context. How do organizational factors constrain or enhance the capacity of faculty developers to fulfil their mandates? METHODS Using survey research methodology, data from a survey of FD leaders at Canadian medical schools were analyzed using Bolman and Deal's four frames: Symbolic, Political, Structural, and Human Resource (HR). RESULTS In the Symbolic frame, FD leaders reported lack of identity as a FD unit, which was seen as a constraining factor. Within the Political frame, developing visibility was seen as an enhancing factor, though it did not always ensure being valued. In the Structural frame, expanding scope of practice was seen as an enhancing factor, though it could also be a constraining factor if not accompanied by increased resources. In the HR frame, a sense of instability due to changing leadership and uncertainty about human resources was seen as a constraining factor. CONCLUSION While broadening the mandate of FD can generally be considered as positive, it is imperative that it is appropriately resourced and accompanied by recognition of FD as a valued contributor to the educational mission.","Kolomitro, Klodiana; Hamilton, Joanne; Leslie, Karen; Hazelton, Lara; Veerapen, Kiran; Kelly-Turner, Kenna; Keegan, David",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2021.1931078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057867/,48
156846,ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: Management and association with prognosis during the COVID-19 pandemic in France.,2021-04-14,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to evaluate the acute and chronic fixation strength of fibrin sealant (FS) as an alternative method of fixation for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR). METHODS Representative mesh types for LVHR included one nonabsorbable barrier mesh (Composix) and three absorbable barrier meshes (Sepramesh, Proceed, and Parietex composite). Macroporous polypropylene mesh (Prolite Ultra) served as the control mesh. Three methods of fixation were used, namely, 0-polypropylene suture+FS (ARTISS 4 IU), FS alone (ARTISS), and tacks alone, to secure 3×4-cm pieces of mesh (10 of each combination) to the peritoneal surface of New Zealand white rabbit abdominal wall. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, specimens underwent acute testing. Subsequently, a chronic phase was completed using the aforementioned fixation methods (10 of each combination), in which two 4×4-cm pieces of mesh were secured intraperitoneally in each of 75 New Zealand white rabbits, which survived 8 weeks until they were sacrificed. A transparent grid overlay was used to measure the mesh and adhesion area. Adhesion tenacity was characterized using the Garrard adhesion scale. In both the acute and chronic samples, a 3×3-cm area of mesh-tissue interface underwent lap shear testing at a rate of 0.42 mm/s using a tensiometer (Instron 5542). The maximum load sustained by the mesh-tissue construct was recorded as the acute fixation strength in newtons (N). Data are given as means±standard error of the mean. Statistical significance (p<0.05) was determined using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) posttest or a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test (adhesion scores). RESULTS The acute fixation strength was significantly greater for all the meshes secured with either suture+FS or tacks alone than for FS alone (p<0.001 for all comparisons). All the meshes except Proceed demonstrated greater acute fixation strength with suture+FS than with tacks alone (p≤0.016). Composix achieved greater acute fixation with suture+FS than all the other meshes (p≤0.022). Acute fixation with suture + FS was greater for Parietex Composite and ProLite Ultra than for Proceed (p≤0.015). When the animals were sacrificed, 48 of 50 meshes fixed with FS alone were insufficiently affixed to the abdominal wall, which may have resulted in hernia recurrence in a hernia model. The chronic fixation strength was greater for all the mesh types with either suture+FS or tacks only than with FS alone (p≤0.0005). The chronic fixation strength was greater with suture+FS than with tacks for Proceed and ProLite Ultra (p≤0.013). Neither mesh area nor adhesion tenacity differed significantly with any mesh/fixation method combination. CONCLUSIONS In a chronic rabbit model of LVHR, fixation strength with FS alone was inadequate for selected nonabsorbable and absorbable barrier-coated meshes. The acute and chronic fixation strengths of suture+FS were equivalent or superior to the fixation strength of tacks alone. Using a combination of suture and FS for mesh fixation in LVHR may provide adequate fixation while decreasing postoperative pain due to spiral titanium tacks. In this preclinical series, mesh secured to the peritoneal surface by FS alone may have led to early recurrence.","Jenkins, Eric D; Melman, Lora; Desai, Salil; Brown, Shaun R; Frisella, Margaret M; Deeken, Corey R; Matthews, Brent D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1230-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20652323/,48
158022,Impact of prolonged assisted ventilation on diaphragmatic efficiency: NAVA versus PSV.,2016,"OBJECTIVES Patients undergoing radical cystectomy with ileal conduit formation usually receive training on the use of their stoma during their initial hospitalization - while actively recovering from surgery - often with little follow-up or reinforcement. Many of these patients are not equipped to deal with these significant body changes, which can lead to additional clinic visits, stoma-related complications, and decreased patient satisfaction/health-related quality of life (HRQOL). In an effort to improve patient education, we sought to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a preoperative comprehensive stoma education session termed the ""stoma bootcamp"" for patients scheduled for a radical cystectomy and ileal conduit (RCIC). We tracked patient related outcomes to determine its impact. METHODS We performed a longitudinal, quality-improvement feasibility study at the University of Kansas Health System. All patients who were scheduled to undergo a RCIC for bladder cancer were offered enrollment into the study at their preoperative clinic visit. The ""stoma boot camp"" consisted of a 3-hour group session within 2 weeks of the surgery date. Patients were given a short presentation by residents and advanced practice providers regarding the operation, recovery, and expectations for their post-operative care. Ostomy nurses then demonstrated basic urostomy care - pouching, sizing, emptying - along with trouble-shooting tips for common ostomy problems. Measurements of HRQOL questionnaires were completed at the initial visit, after ""boot camp,"" and at defined time points after surgery for 12 weeks. This included using an ostomy adjustment score. Length of stay, unplanned stoma-related interventions, and re-admissions within 30 days were also tracked. RESULTS In this initial pilot program, 51 patients participated in the stoma bootcamp. The patients had an average ostomy adjustment score (OAS) of 150.4 (95% CI 142.0, 158.8) at discharge from the hospital, and these high OAS levels persisted throughout the 12 weeks of follow-up data without any significant decline. Short-form 36 (SF-36) scores demonstrated numerical improvements in each individual category at the 6-week mark above baseline. These improvements persisted at the 12-week mark. CONCLUSIONS In this study we were able to establish the feasibility of implementing a preoperative comprehensive stoma education session for patients scheduled for a RCIC. Additionally, we were able to document favorable HRQOL data and improved ostomy adjustment scores surrounding the education session.","Zganjar, Andrew; Glavin, Katie; Mann, Kathleen; Dahlgren, Alexandra; Thompson, Jeffrey; Wulff-Burchfield, Elizabeth; Wyre, Hadley; Lee, Eugene; Taylor, John; Holzbeierlein, Jeffrey; Mirza, Moben",Urologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urolonc.2021.04.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140243/,48

However, the complex interplay between COVID-19, T2DM and its complications (e.g., diabetic nephropathy), and ALI creates a great challenge in the management of the disease. Here, we present a case of a 59-year-old diabetic female with progressive pain in her left leg in the last five years, which was significantly intensified following COVID-19 diagnosis. Bluish coloration, numbness and functional impairments were observed during examinations with no palpable pulsation on left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. The patient also had diabetic nephropathy (stage III), hypoalbuminemia, anemia and a urinary tract infection that complicated the management of the disease.

Methods: The anonymous online survey consisted of 53 COVID-related questions. It was sent to all healthcare professionals in gynaecological oncology centres across Europe and the Pan-Arabian region from April 2020 to October 2020. All healthcare professionals treating women with gynecological cancers were able to participate in the survey. Results: A total of 243 answers were collected from 30 different countries. The majority (73%) of participants were gynecological oncologists from university hospitals(71%) with at least an Intensive care unit with cardiopulmonary support available at their institutions. Most institutions continued to perform elective surgeries only for oncological cases (98%). Patients had to wait on average 2 weeks longer for their surgery appointments compared to previous years(range 0-12 weeks). Cases that were prioritised for surgical intervention across all tumors (Ovarian, Endometrium, Cervical) were early stage disease (74%), primary situation (61%), and good ECOG status (63%). The radicality of surgery did not change in the majority of cases (78%) across all tumor types. During the pandemic, only 38% of clinicians stated they would start a new clinical trial. 45% stated the pandemic has negatively impacted the financial structure and support for clinical trials. 79% do not routinely screen patients included in trials for SARS CoV2. Overall, approx. 20% of clinicians did not feel well informed regarding clinical pathways for COVID-19 patients throughout the pandemic. The majority preferred regular updates and training via Webinars (75%), followed by tumorboards and interdisciplinary conferences (45%). 30% of clinicians stated that they are currently experiencing difficulties in providing adequate medical care due to staff shortage. Conclusions: Despite well-established guidelines for patient care and performing clinical trials in gynecological oncology, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted clinical research, and financial structures. Longer waiting times for operative interventions, less support for clinical trials and concerns regarding provision of adequate medical care and triaging patients are very real. This survey underlines the necessity for building robust emergency algorithms tailored to gynecological oncology patients in the future.","Nasser, S.; Fotopoulou, C.; Guktekin, M.; Dimitrova, D.; Morice, P.; Sehouli, J.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.5564,48

Methods: We did a real-world, prospective observational cohort study where recruited high-school students and staff from two high-schools in Montreal (Canada) were followed from January 25th to June 10th, 2021. Twenty-five percent of asymptomatic participants were tested weekly by RADT (nasal) and PCR (gargle). Class contacts of a case were tested. Symptomatic participants were tested by RADT (nasal) and PCR (nasal and gargle). The number of cases/outbreak and number of outbreaks were compared to other high schools in the same area. Results: Overall, 2,099 students and 286 school staff members consented to participate. The overall RADT specificity varied from 99.8 to 100%, with a lower sensitivity, varying from 28.6% in asymptomatic to 83.3% in symptomatic participants. The number of outbreaks was not different in the 2 participating schools compared to other high schools in the same area, but included a greater proportion of asymptomatic cases. Returning students to school after a 7-day quarantine, with a negative PCR on D6-7 after exposure, did not lead to subsequent outbreaks, as shown by serial testing. Of cases for whom the source was known, 37 of 57 (72.5%) were secondary to household transmission, 13 (25%) to intra-school transmission and one to community contacts between students in the same school. Conclusion: RADT did not perform well as a screening tool in asymptomatic individuals. Reinforcing policies for symptom screening when entering schools and testing symptomatic individuals with RADT on the spot may avoid subsequent significant exposures in class.","Blanchard, A.

174010,Essential Emergency and Critical Care - a consensus among global clinical experts,2021-03-20,"Tweety homologs (TTYHs) comprise a conserved family of transmembrane proteins found in eukaryotes with three members (TTYH1-3) in vertebrates. They are widely expressed in mammals including at high levels in the nervous system and have been implicated in cancers and other diseases including epilepsy, chronic pain, and viral infections. TTYHs have been reported to form Ca2+- and cell volume-regulated anion channels structurally distinct from any characterized protein family with potential roles in cell adhesion, migration, and developmental signaling. To provide insight into TTYH family structure and function, we determined cryo-EM structures of Mus musculus TTYH2 and TTYH3 in lipid nanodiscs. TTYH2 and TTYH3 adopt a novel fold which includes an extended extracellular domain with a partially solvent exposed pocket that may be an interaction site for hydrophobic molecules. In the presence of Ca2+, TTYH2 and TTYH3 form homomeric cis-dimers bridged by extracellularly coordinated Ca2+. Strikingly, in the absence of Ca2+, TTYH2 forms trans-dimers that span opposing membranes across a ~130 Å intermembrane space as well as a monomeric state. All TTYH structures lack ion conducting pathways and we do not observe TTYH2-dependent channel activity in cells. We conclude TTYHs are not pore forming subunits of anion channels and their function may involve Ca2+-dependent changes in quaternary structure, interactions with hydrophobic molecules near the extracellular membrane surface, and/or association with additional protein partners.","Li, Baobin; Hoel, Christopher M.; Brohawn, Stephen G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.15.456437,48

We found that increasing the rate of early treatment among high-risk patients who received treatment more than 48 hours after symptoms onset, would substantially avert infections and influenza-induced hospitalizations. We found that treatment of the elderly has the highest impact on reducing hospitalizations, whereas treating high-risk individuals aged 5-19 years old has the highest impact on transmission.

This exploration of resilience was undertaken as part of the delivery of the first-year undergraduate computer science degree programme in a UK university. Resilience was measured by the Nicholson McBride Resilience Questionnaire (NMRQ) and three open-ended questions exploring what has supported their study most during the COVID-19 pandemic, what had been the greatest challenge, and how that challenge was resolved. The preliminary results of this survey (N=103) illustrate how learner responses differed to the delivery depending upon their measured resilience level. Additionally, the results provide valuable insight into learners' perceptions of the challenges of online learning, teaching and assessment. Given the continued impact on educational settings from COVID-19, online/blended learning is likely to remain a significant feature of future delivery;hence the insights offered from this UK institutional study can inform future sector practice. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Crick, T.; Prickett, T.; Walters, J.","26th ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3456565.3460050,48

The current methods include both direct and amplification-based RNA detection. These methods require complicated procedures, suffering from low sensitivity, slow turnaround, and amplification bias. The CRISPR/Cas13a system is a direct RNA detection method via target RNA induced collateral cleavage activity. However, to detect low concentration RNA with CRISPR/Cas13a, target amplification is always required. Herein, we optimize the components of the CRISPR/Cas13a assay to enhance the sensitivity of viral RNA detection which improve the detection limit from 1 pM up to 100 fM. In addition, the integration of CRISPR/Cas13a biosensing and single molecule super resolution imaging is a novel strategy for direct and amplification-free RNA detection. After surface modification, fluorescent RNA reporters are immobilized on the glass coverslip surface and fluorescent signals are captured by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), shifting the measurement from spectroscopy to imaging. We quantify the fluorescence signal intensity before and after collateral cleavage of the CRISPR system when viral RNA is present and achieve a detection limit of 10 fM. Therefore, we provide a novel TIRFM-based system to visualize the CRISPR trans-cleavage for direct and robust RNA detection.","He, Qian; Chen, Qun; Li, Fang; Yuan, Xi; Wang, Chuhui; Liu, Changyue; Xu, Lidan; Zhong, Xiaoyun; Wei, Jiazhang; Pandey, Vijay; Yu, Dongmei; Dong, Yuhan; Zhang, Yongbing; Deng, Lin; Du, Ke; Qin, Peiwu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.17.452803,48

Increased risk perception of contracting the virus has been associated with adverse psychological outcomes and reduced life satisfaction. However, susceptibility to psychological distress is influenced by personality-related characteristics. This study focuses on fortitude as a potential protective factor. The aim of this study is to investigate the parallel and serial mediating roles of fortitude, loneliness, and depression in the relationship between risk perception and life satisfaction. The participants were young adults (N?=?337) who have completed five self-report questionnaires: University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale, Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Fortitude Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and COVID-19 Risk Perception Scale. Descriptive statistics were generated, and structural equation modelling was used to examine the parallel and serial mediating roles of loneliness, depression, and fortitude. Positive associations were found between risk perception and loneliness and depression, and fortitude was found to mediate the relationship between risk perception and life satisfaction, between loneliness and life satisfaction, and between depression and life satisfaction. The overall serial mediation was also found to be significant, thereby supporting the hypothesis that those who perceive themselves to be at a risk of contracting COVID-19 have higher loneliness scores, which in turn is associated with higher depression scores. These findings confirm that fortitude is a salient protective factor and suggest that improving the perception of the ability to manage the risk of infection can enhance psychological wellbeing.","Padmanabhanunni, Anita Pretorius Tyrone",South African Journal of Psychology,https://doi.org/10.1177/00812463211037811,48

People with mental health problems may suffer even more from its consequences. AIM Measuring mental health, experiences with outpatient care and government measures of 105 people in mental health care in the Northern Netherlands during the first wave of COVID-19. METHOD Anonymous, online survey among people in care with autism- or FACT-teams in the Northern Netherlands between July-September 2020. RESULTS Few participants reported recent COVID-19-related symptoms (n=2); no participant had lab-confirmed COVID-19. Both positive (clear world, tranquility, few stimuli: 28%) and negative experiences (missing face-to-face contact with mental health care professionals: 22%) were reported. Although there was some fluctuation in happiness, the average happiness score did not change due to the first wave. Three-quarters were satisfied with their mental health care. Although in-person contact with mental health care professionals was missed, the continuation of care through (video)calling was appreciated. One third reported an increased or new care need in mental health symptoms or daily functioning. The 'physical' government measures were considered pleasant and doable, but 'social' measures were harder. Newsletters with practical information about the consequences of the measures for personal healthcare were appreciated.

Such elements include promoters, enhancers, and transcriptional repressors that may require interactions with distal RNA sequences for function. We previously determined that a non-sequence-specific hairpin (M1H) in the interior of a subviral RNA (satC) associated with Turnip crinkle virus is required for fitness and that its function might be to bridge flanking sequences (X. Sun and A. E. Simon, J. Virol. 77:7880-7889, 2003). To establish the importance of the flanking sequences in replication and satC-specific virion repression, segments on both sides of M1H were randomized and subjected to in vivo functional selection (in vivo SELEX). Analyses of winning (functional) sequences revealed three different conserved elements within the segments that could be specifically assigned roles in replication, virion repression, or both. One of these elements was also implicated in the molecular switch that releases the 3' end from its interaction with the repressor hairpin H5, which is possibly involved in controlling the level of minus-strand synthesis.","Sun, Xiaoping; Zhang, Guohua; Simon, Anne E",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15596844/,48

Timely microbiologic surveillance and assessment of antimicrobial resistance is important for dealing with nosocomial infections. This retrospective review was conducted to evaluate the microbiologic spectrum and susceptibility pattern in the pediatric intensive care unit from 2001 to 2006. METHODS The microbiologic data and antimicrobial susceptibility of all clinical isolates in the pediatric intensive care unit between 2001 and 2006 were reviewed. The incidence and distribution of nosocomial infections and the associated pathogens were also analyzed. RESULTS 1163 clinical isolates were analyzed. The frequencies of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were 30.4% and 56.2%, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate among the Gram-positive organisms, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the 3 leading Gram-negative isolates. The proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to all S. aureus was 65.2%. Six vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated in 2003. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae accounted for 20% of K. pneumoniae isolates since 2005. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa accounted for 34% of P. aeruginosa isolates. The nosocomial infection rate was not reduced after moving to a new hospital building in 2003. Urinary tract infection (30.2%) was the most common nosocomial infection, followed by bloodstream infection (26.5%) and lower respiratory tract infection (25.3%). CONCLUSIONS MRSA, carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were the major concerns in this study.

Here, we utilize molecular beacons to directly detect the viral genome and characterize a clinical isolate of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV) in living cells. Molecular beacons are dual-labeled, hairpin oligonucleotide probes with a reporter fluorophore at one end and a quencher at the other; they are designed to fluoresce only when hybridizing to a complementary target. By imaging the fluorescence signal of molecular beacons, the spread of bRSV was monitored for 7 days with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 to 200, and the measured time course of infection was quantified with a mathematical model for viral growth. We found that molecular beacon signal could be detected in single living cells infected with a viral titer of 2 x 10(3.6) 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml diluted 1,000 fold, demonstrating high detection sensitivity. Low background in uninfected cells and simultaneous staining of fixed cells with molecular beacons and antibodies showed high detection specificity. Furthermore, using confocal microscopy to image the viral genome in live, infected cells, we observed a connected, highly three-dimensional, amorphous inclusion body structure not seen in fixed cells. Taken together, the use of molecular beacons for active virus imaging provides a powerful tool for rapid viral infection detection, the characterization of RNA viruses, and the design of new antiviral drugs.","Santangelo, Philip; Nitin, Nitin; LaConte, Leslie; Woolums, Amelia; Bao, Gang",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16378971/,48
193708,INtENsiVE CaRE.,1988,"The small envelope (E) protein has recently been shown to play an essential role in the assembly of coronaviruses. Expression studies revealed that for formation of the viral envelope, actually only the E protein and the membrane (M) protein are required. Since little is known about this generally low-abundance virion component, we have characterized the E protein of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), an 83-residue polypeptide. Using an antiserum to the hydrophilic carboxy terminus of this otherwise hydrophobic protein, we found that the E protein was synthesized in infected cells with similar kinetics as the other viral structural proteins. The protein appeared to be quite stable both during infection and when expressed individually using a vaccinia virus expression system. Consistent with the lack of a predicted cleavage site, the protein was found to become integrated in membranes without involvement of a cleaved signal peptide, nor were any other modifications of the polypeptide observed. Immunofluorescence analysis of cells expressing the E protein demonstrated that the hydrophilic tail is exposed on the cytoplasmic side. Accordingly, this domain of the protein could not be detected on the outside of virions but appeared to be inside, where it was protected from proteolytic degradation. The results lead to a topological model in which the polypeptide is buried within the membrane, spanning the lipid bilayer once, possibly twice, and exposing only its carboxy-terminal domain. Finally, electron microscopic studies demonstrated that expression of the E protein in cells induced the formation of characteristic membrane structures also observed in MHV-A59-infected cells, apparently consisting of masses of tubular, smooth, convoluted membranes. As judged by their colabeling with antibodies to E and to Rab-1, a marker for the intermediate compartment and endoplasmic reticulum, the E protein accumulates in and induces curvature into these pre-Golgi membranes where coronaviruses have been shown earlier to assemble by budding.","Raamsman, M J; Locker, J K; de Hooge, A; de Vries, A A; Griffiths, G; Vennema, H; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10666264/,48

MARC-145 cells were incubated overnight with dilutions of supernatant fluids from HEK 293 cells infected with Ad5-swIFN-beta or with an Ad5 control virus (Ad5-Blue). Treated cells were infected with PRRSV; MARC-145 cells incubated with Ad5-Blue supernatants developed cytopathic effects (CPE), whereas those incubated with swIFN-beta showed no CPE. To confirm the antiviral activity of swIFN-beta, culture fluids from Ad5-swIFN-beta-infected cells were affinity-purified on a Sepharose-anti-swIFN-beta matrix, and the resulting fractions exhibited antiviral activity upon infection with PRRSV. The antiviral effects were specific, as they were blocked by mAbs against swIFN-beta. Additional cultures of MARC-145 cells treated with swIFN-beta-containing supernatants or affinity-purified swIFN-beta were infected with PRRSV and tested by real-time RT-PCR for viral RNA in culture supernatants at various times post-inoculation. These experiments confirmed the protective effects of swIFN-beta. swIFN-beta was also tested for antiviral activity on porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from PRRSV-negative swine. PAMs were treated with dilutions of swIFN-beta or Ad5-Blue culture fluids, infected with PRRSV and tested for viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR. The viral load data showed a dose-dependent protection in swIFN-beta-treated PAMs, whereas no protection was evident from Ad5-Blue culture fluids.

Although South Korea has drastically reduced the number of new confirmed cases and is stabilizing the situation with its exemplary disease prevention policies, there remains a problem. These are cases that had shown negative results to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (gene amplification) tests as the COVID-19 virus had become undetectable but turned re-positive after a short period. The Central Clinical Committee determined that these re-positive cases after COVID-19 viral clearance are due to the limits of the test method; it is considered that the genetic material of the ""dead virus"" remaining in a recovered patient's body is amplified during the test process. Comprehending the above evidence, re-positive cases of COVID-19 are not infectious; the virus is not even reactivated. However, further research is required as we lack research results on this subject. Until we can be sure, social distancing and other such policies should be maintained.","Kang, Yun-Jung",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,48

209733,Modified barrier enclosure for noninvasive respiratory support in COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"An association between a novel pediatric hyperinflammatory condition and SARS-CoV-2 was recently published and termed pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (in children) (MIS(-C)). We performed a systematic review and describe the epidemiological, clinical, and prognostic characteristics of 953 PIMS-TS/MIS(-C) cases in 68 records. Additionally, we studied the sensitivity of different case definitions that are currently applied. PIMS-TS/MIS(-C) presents at a median age of 8 years. Epidemiological enrichment for males (58.9%) and ethnic minorities (37.0% Black) is present. Apart from obesity (25.3%), comorbidities are rare. PIMS-TS/MIS(-C) is characterized by fever (99.4%), gastrointestinal (85.6%) and cardiocirculatory manifestations (79.3%), and increased inflammatory biomarkers. Nevertheless, 50.3% present respiratory symptoms as well. Over half of patients (56.3%) present with shock. The majority of the patients (73.3%) need intensive care treatment, including extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 3.8%. Despite severe disease, mortality is rather low (1.9%). Of the currently used case definitions, the WHO definition is preferred, as it is more precise, while encompassing most cases.Conclusion: PIMS-TS/MIS(-C) is a severe, heterogeneous disease with epidemiological enrichment for males, adolescents, and racial and ethnic minorities. However, mortality rate is low and short-term outcome favorable. Long-term follow-up of chronic complications and additional clinical research to elucidate the underlying pathogenesis is crucial. What is Known: â¢ A novel pediatric inflammatory syndrome with multisystem involvement has been described in association with SARS-CoV-2. â¢ To date, the scattered reporting of cases and use of different case definitions provides insufficient insight in the full clinical spectrum, epidemiological and immunological features, and prognosis. What is New: â¢ This systematic review illustrates the heterogeneous spectrum of PIMS-TS/MIS(-C) and its epidemiological enrichment for males, adolescents, and racial and ethnic minorities. â¢ Despite its severe presentation, overall short-term outcome is good. â¢ The WHO MIS definition is preferred, as it is more precise, while encompassing most cases.","Hoste, Levi; Van Paemel, Ruben; Haerynck, Filomeen",Eur. j. pediatr,,48

211426,Admissions for and Quality of Care of ST-Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in the Post COVID-19 Era in China,2021,"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with more than 60 million cases worldwide and over 1.5 million deaths by March 2021. Its outbreak has caused a huge burden on healthcare systems all over the world. Several studies in the medical literature have suggested that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at higher risk for developing severe symptoms, poor prognosis, and high mortality rates. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of CVD risk factors among COVID-19 patients based on the Framingham risk score (FRS), and to evaluate the association of CVD risk factors with clinical outcomes. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we identified 264 confirmed cases with COVID-19 at King Saud University Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Patients aged 18-80 years were included, and their electronic records were reviewed. They were classified into low, intermediate, and high risk of CVD according to FRS classification. Results: Two-hundred-six patients (67% male) were included in this study. The mean age was 55.3 ± 15.1 years. Most patients had comorbidities: the most common were hypertension (48.1%), diabetes (45.1%), and ischemic heart disease (11.2%). More than half required intensive care admission, and 58 (28.2%) patients died. Pneumonia was the most frequently observed complication (85%), followed by mechanical ventilation (28.3%) and acute kidney injury (27.7%). Age, male gender, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus showed significant differences between FRS categories, and were associated with intermediate and high-risk groups of FRS (p < 0.05). Pneumonia and length of stay were associated with the Intermediate risk group of FRS. Conclusion: Cardiovascular disease risk factors are prevalent in Saudi patients infected with COVID-19. FRS could be a useful tool to identify CVD risk factors among COVID-19 patients and predict a complicated course.","Alshaikh, Mashael K; Alotair, Hadil; Alnajjar, Farrah; Sharaf, Hanaa; Alhafi, Bader; Alashgar, Lolwah; Aljuaid, Mohammed",Vasc Health Risk Manag,,48

METHODS: We described all adults with COVID-19 or influenza discharged from inpatient medical services and medical-surgical intensive care units (ICUs) between Nov. 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, at 7 hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario. We compared patient outcomes using multivariable regression models, controlling for patient sociodemographic factors and comorbidity level. We validated the accuracy of 7 externally developed risk scores to predict mortality among patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 1027 hospital admissions with COVID-19 (median age 65 yr, 59.1% male) and 783 with influenza (median age 68 yr, 50.8% male). Patients younger than 50 years accounted for 21.2% of all admissions for COVID-19 and 24.0% of ICU admissions. Compared with influenza, patients with COVID-19 had significantly greater in-hospital mortality (unadjusted 19.9% v. 6.1%, adjusted relative risk [RR] 3.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.56-4.68), ICU use (unadjusted 26.4% v. 18.0%, adjusted RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.25-1.80) and hospital length of stay (unadjusted median 8.7 d v. 4.8 d, adjusted rate ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.25-1.69). Thirty-day readmission was not significantly different (unadjusted 9.3% v. 9.6%, adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.70-1.39). Three points-based risk scores for predicting in-hospital mortality showed good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] ranging from 0.72 to 0.81) and calibration. INTERPRETATION: During the first wave of the pandemic, admission to hospital for COVID-19 was associated with significantly greater mortality, ICU use and hospital length of stay than influenza. Simple risk scores can predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 with good accuracy.","Verma, Amol A; Hora, Tejasvi; Jung, Hae Young; Fralick, Michael; Malecki, Sarah L; Lapointe-Shaw, Lauren; Weinerman, Adina; Tang, Terence; Kwan, Janice L; Liu, Jessica J; Rawal, Shail; Chan, Timothy C Y; Cheung, Angela M; Rosella, Laura C; Ghassemi, Marzyeh; Herridge, Margaret; Mamdani, Muhammad; Razak, Fahad",CMAJ,,48

We offer the following improvements in tackling the issue: (i) standardization of the method of verification of the number of physicians in practice for a meaningful comparison between European states; (ii) managerial reorganization of medical education to increase the flexibility of teaching; (iii) education shortening, e.g., to 4 years, for nurses, paramedics, and the like; (iv) circumscription of unnecessary health records and the use of artificial intelligence to streamline the recording system to ease the burden on the medical staff.","Lorkowski, Jacek; Jugowicz, Agnieszka",Adv. exp. med. biol,,48

E-mental health technologies may offer an important solution to the problem. This topic was discussed in greater depth at the 9th Annual Canadian E-Mental Health Conference held in Toronto, Canada. Themes that emerged from the discussions at the conference include (1) the importance of trust, transparency, human centeredness, and compassion in the development and delivery of digital mental health technologies; (2) an emphasis on equity, diversity, inclusion, and access when implementing e-mental health services; (3) the need to ensure that the mental health workforce is able to engage in a digital way of working; and (4) co-production of e-mental health services among a diverse stakeholder group becoming the standard way of working.","Strudwick, Gillian; Impey, Danielle; Torous, John; Krausz, Reinhard Michael; Wiljer, David",JMIR Ment Health,,48
217421,Physiological effects of n95 ffp and ppe in healthcare workers in covid intensive care unit: A prospective cohort study,2020,"PURPOSE: Nationwide mass vaccination against Covid-19 started in Israel in late 2020. Soon we identified on [18F]FDG PET-CT studies vaccine-associated hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (VAHL) in axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes (ASLN) ipsilateral to the vaccination site. Sometimes, differentiation between the malignant and benign nature of the hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (HLN) could not be made, and equivocal HLN (EqHL) was reported. The purpose of the study was to determine the overall incidence of VAHL after BNT162b2 vaccination and also its relevance to PET-CT interpretation in oncologic patients. METHODS: A total of 951 consecutive patients that underwent [18F]FDG PET-CT studies in our department were interviewed regarding the sites and dates of the vaccine doses. A total of 728 vaccinated patients (All-Vac group) were included: 346 received the first dose only (Vac-1 group) and 382 received the booster dose as well (Vac-2 group). Studies were categorized as no HLN, malignant-HLN (MHL), VAHL, or EqHL. In studies with VAHL, location, [18F]FDG-intensity uptake and nodes size were recorded. RESULTS: The incidences of HLN were 45.6%, 36.4%, and 53.9% in All-Vac, Vac-1, and Vac-2 groups, respectively. VAHL was reported in 80.1% of vaccinated patients with HLN. Lower incidences of VAHL were found during the first 5 days or in the third week after the first vaccine and beyond 20 days after the booster dose. In 49 of 332 (14.8%) vaccinated patients, we could not determine whether HLN was MHL or VAHL. Breast cancer and lymphoma were the leading diseases with EqHL. CONCLUSION: VAHL is frequently observed after BNT162b2 administration, more commonly and with higher intensity following the booster dose. To minimize false and equivocal reports in oncological patients, timing of [18F]FDG PET-CT should be based on the time intervals found to have a lower incidence of VAHL, and choice of vaccine injection site should be advised, mainly in patients where ASLN are a relevant site of tumor involvement.","Cohen, Dan; Krauthammer, Shir Hazut; Wolf, Ido; Even-Sapir, Einat",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,,48

In this study, we develop primary human lung epithelial infection models to understand initial responses of proximal and distal lung epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differentiated air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of proximal airway epithelium and alveosphere cultures of distal lung AT2 cells are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2, leading to an epithelial cell-autonomous proinflammatory response with increased expression of interferon signaling genes.

This paper explores how this predicament has brought to the fore the nature of our engagement with digital knowledge practices and screen-based communication, arguing that the notion of 'virtual learning' is a flawed one. Instead, adopting a sociomaterial perspective, it argues that all aspects of digital engagement are in fact grounded in material and embodied entanglements with devices and other artefacts.","Gourlay, Lesley",Journal of New Approaches in Educational Research,,48

Taking into consideration that the persons with disabilities generally fall into poverty-stricken cluster of the population and Sri Lanka has been passing turbulent times even prior to COVID-19, this paper argues that the people with visual impairment and blindness have been pushed from bad to worse, due to the shocks of COVID-19 strike.

245070,Thirty years of career in Intensive Care Medicine,2021,"The Corona Virus Disease (COVID)-19 pandemic has disrupted the business and industry landscape and changed consumers' behavior. The purpose of this paper was to explore how the behavior of online shoppers and sellers changed because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The originality of this paper lies in combining four main constructs: digital promotion capability, supply chain capability, customer experience, and performance of the e-commerce platform. It incorporates intervening factors like seasonal pricing and logistics outsourcing in the context of COVID 19. The main findings were that, before the pandemic, customer review ratings had a significant positive effect on the performance of the e-commerce platform, but not after the outbreak. Meanwhile, logistics outsourcing does not intervene in the relationship between perceived supply chain capability and (relative) e-commerce platform performance, unlike before the pandemic. This research is a longitudinal study before and after the COVID 19 pandemic, with a call-back sample size of 88 end customer respondents and 55 seller respondents. Data gathered from previous and current e-commerce research were processed by multivariate regression using SPSS software.","Agus, A.

245835,Moral distress in the intensive care unit during the pandemic: the burden of dying alone,2020,"Previous human organotypic retinal culture (HORC) models have utilized detached retinas; however, without the structural support conferred by retinal pigment epithelium-choroid (RPE-choroid) and sclera, the integrity of the fragile retina can easily be compromised. The aim of this study was to develop a novel HORC model that contains the retina, RPE-choroid and sclera to maintain retinal integrity when culturing retinal explants. After cutting circumferentially along the limbus to remove iris and lens, four deep incisions were made to flatten the eyecup. In contrast to previous HORC protocols, a trephine was used to cut through not only the retina but also the RPE-choroid and sclera. The resultant triple-layered explants were cultured for 72 h. Hematoxylin and Eosin staining (H&E) was used to assess anatomical structures and retinal explants were further characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for apoptosis, Müller cell integrity and retinal inflammation. To confirm the possibility of disease induction, explants were exposed to high glucose (HG) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Cyt), to mimic diabetic retinopathy (DR). The Luminex magnetic bead assay was used to measure DR-related cytokines released into the culture medium. H&E staining revealed distinct retinal lamellae and compact nuclei in retinal explants with the underlying RPE-choroid and sclera, while retinas without the underlying structures exhibited reduced thickness and severe nuclei loss. IHC results indicated absence of apoptosis and retinal inflammation as well as preserved Müller cell integrity. The Luminex assays showed significantly increased secretion of DR-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines in retinal explants exposed to HG + Cyt relative to baseline levels at 24 h. We successfully developed and characterized a novel HORC protocol in which retinal integrity was preserved without apoptosis or retinal inflammation. Moreover, the induced secretion of DR-associated pro-inflammatory biomarkers when exposing retinal explants to HG + Cyt suggests that this model could be used for clinically translatable retinal disease studies.","Kuo, Charisse Y J; Louie, Henry H; Rupenthal, Ilva D; Mugisho, Odunayo O",J. vis. exp,,48

251049,Resilience,2021,"Cryptosporidium spp são protozoários cosmopolita que acometem peixes, répteis, anfíbios, aves e mamíferos. Mais de 20 espécies são reconhecidas dentro deste gênero. Os roedores, grupos de organismos abundantes e ubíquos, têm sido considerados reservatórios de Cryptosporidium para humanos e animais de produção. As seqüências codificadoras da menor unidade ribossômica (18S rRNA) de Cryptosporidium spp caracterizam-se por intercalações entre regiões conservadas e polimórficas ao longo dos seus 1700 pares de bases. O objetivo deste estudo foi desenhar primers específicos para o gene 18S rRNA, potencialmente capazes de amplificar qualquer espécie ou genótipo de Cryptosporidium spp. e avaliar os atributos diagnósticos da nested-PCR baseadas em tais sondas. O desenho dos primers foi realizado de forma a amplificar um segmento de menor dimensão possível para se maximizar a sensibilidade do ensaio molecular e preservando o potencial discriminatório das seqüências amplificadas. A nestedPCR padronizada neste estudo (nPCR-SH) foi comparada com outro ensaio similar que vem sendo largamente utilizado para detecção e identificação de Cryptosporidium spp. no mundo todo (nPCR-XIAO). Também se objetivou caracterizar molecularmente amostras de Cryptosporidum spp. isoladas de roedores sinantrópicos, empregando-se estas sondas e sondas moleculares direcionadas. Foram capturados 45 roedores em áreas públicas da região urbana da cidade de Umuarama, Paraná. As amostras foram submetidas a três provas moleculares, sendo duas direcionadas ao gene18S rRNA (nPCR-SH e nPCR-XIAO) e outra, ao gene codificador da actina. A nPCR-SH foi testada com as amostras de Cryptosporidum parvum, Cryptosporidum andersoni, Cryptosporidum meleagridis, Cryptosporidum hominis, Cryptosporidum canis, Cryptosporidum serpentis e todas foram positivas. Dezesseis amostras de roedores foram positivas para a nPCR-SH, seis pela nPCR-XIAO e cinco pela nPCR dirigida ao gene codificador da actina. O sequenciamento dos fragmentos amplificados possibilitou a identificação de Cryptosporidum muris em três amostras de Rattus rattus, e dois novos genótipos de Cryptosporidium, os genótipos rato II e III. Genótipo rato II foi encontrado em uma amostra de Mus musculus e o genótipo III em doze amostras, sendo cinco Rattus rattus e sete Mus musculus. Os resultados deste estudo demonstraram que os primers desenhados para detecção do Cryptosporidium spp em amostras de fezes foram mais eficientes em amplificar regiões que permitem a distinção entre as espécies do parasito do que aqueles usados na PCR-XIAO. Nas amostras estudadas não foram encontrados genótipos ou espécies de Cryptosporidium que podem ser transmitidos a outras espécies como os zoonóticos, o que sugere que a importância destes animais na transmissão zoonótica de criptosporidiose é pouco relevante","Silva, Sheila Oliveira de Souza",,,48

But the predictive biomarkers for characterizing the variability are still lacking. Since emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are functionally involved in a number of pathological processes, we hypothesize that these extracellular components maybe key determinants and/or predictors of COVID-19 severity. To test our hypothesis, we collected serum samples from 31 patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms at the time of their admission for discovery cohort. After symptomatic treatment without corticosteroids, 9 of the 31 patients developed severe/critical COVID-19 symptoms. We analyzed EV protein and exRNA profiles to look for correlations between these profiles and COVID-19 severity. Strikingly, we identified three distinct groups of markers (antiviral response-related EV proteins, coagulation-related markers, and liver damage-related exRNAs) with the potential to serve as early predictive biomarkers for COVID-19 severity. As the best predictive marker, EV COPB2 protein, a subunit of the Golgi coatomer complex, exhibited significantly higher abundance in patients remained mild than developed severe/critical COVID-19 and healthy controls in discovery cohort (AUC 1.00 (95% CI: 1.00-1.00)). The validation set included 40 COVID-19 patients and 39 healthy controls, and showed exactly the same trend between the three groups with excellent predictive value (AUC 0.85 (95% CI: 0.73-0.97)). These findings highlight the potential of EV COPB2 expression for patient stratification and for making early clinical decisions about strategies for COVID-19 therapy.","Fujita, Y.; Hoshina, T.; Matsuzaki, J.; Yoshioka, Y.; Kadota, T.; Hosaka, Y.; Fujimoto, S.; Kawamoto, H.; Watanabe, N.; Sawaki, K.; Sakamoto, Y.; Miyajima, M.; Lee, K.

255568,Aeonmed VG70 ventilator oxygen consumption by volume and UK intensive care unit surge capacity for mechanical ventilation,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread globally. Therapeutic options including antivirals, anti-inflammatory compounds, and vaccines are still under study. Convalescent plasma(CP) immunotherapy was an effective method for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. In the epidemic of COVID-19, a large number of literatures reported the application of CP. However, there is controversy over the efficacy of CP therapy for COVID-19. This systematic review was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to CP immunotherapy for COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Clinical Key, Wanfang Database; China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI) were used to search for the proper keywords such as SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, plasma, serum, immunoglobulins, blood transfusion, convalescent, novel coronavirus, immune and the related words for publications published until 15.10.2020. Other available resources were also used to identify relevant articles. The present systematic review was performed based on PRISMA protocol. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were performed by two reviewers. RESULTS: Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 45 articles were included in the final review. First, meta-analysis results of RCTs showed that, there were no statistically significant differences between CP transfusion and the control group in terms of reducing mortality(OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52-1.19, I2 = 28%) and improving clinical symptoms(OR 1.21, 95%CI 0.68-2.16; I2 = 0%). The results of controlled NRSIs showed that CP therapy may reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients(RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.53-0.66, I2 = 0%). Second, limited safety data suggested that CP is a well-tolerated therapy with a low incidence of adverse events. But, due to lack of safety data for the control group, it is really not easy to determine whether CP transfusion has an impact on moderate to serious AEs. Thirdly, for children, pregnant, elderly, tumor and immunocompromised patients, CP may be a well-tolerated therapy, if the disease cannot be controlled and continues to progress. Studies were commonly of low or very low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results of limited RCTs showed that CP cannot significantly reduce mortality, some non-RCTs and case report(series) have found that CP may help patients improve clinical symptoms, clear the virus, and reduce mortality, especially for patients with COVID-19 within ten days of illness. We speculate that CP may be a possible treatment option. High-quality studies are needed for establishing stronger quality of evidence and pharmacists should also be actively involved in the CP treatment process and provide close pharmaceutical care.","Wang, Ying; Huo, Pengfei; Dai, Rulin; Lv, Xin; Yuan, Shaofei; Zhang, Yang; Guo, Yiming; Li, Rui; Yu, Qian; Zhu, Kun",Int Immunopharmacol,,48

Objective: To compare chest CT features of COVID-19, influenza, and OP using a multireader design, and to assess radiologists' performance in distinguishing between these conditions. Methods: This retrospective study included 150 chest CT examinations in 150 patients (mean age 58±16 years) with diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or non-infectious OP (50 randomly selected abnormal CT examinations per diagnosis). Six thoracic radiologists independently assessed CT examinations for 14 individual CT findings and Radiologic Society of North America (RSNA) COVID-19 category and recorded a favored diagnosis. CT characteristics of the three diagnoses were compared using random effects models; readers' diagnostic performance was assessed. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly different (p<.05) from influenza pneumonia for seven of 14 chest CT findings, though different (p<.05) from OP for 4 of 14 findings [central or diffuse distribution in 10% and 7% of COVID-19 vs 20% and 21% of OP; unilateral distribution in 1% of COVID-19 vs 7% of OP; non-tree-in-bud nodules in 32% of COVID-19 vs 53% of OP; tree-in-bud nodules in 6% of COVID-19 vs 14% of OP]. A total of 70% of cases of COVID-19, 33% of influenza, and 47% of OP had an RSNA COVID-19 category of typical (p<.001). Mean percentage of correct favored diagnoses compared to actual diagnoses was 44% for COVID-19, 29% for influenza, and 39% for OP. Mean diagnostic accuracy of favored diagnoses was 70% for COVID-19 pneumonia and 68% for both influenza and OP. Conclusion: CT findings of COVID-19 substantially overlap with influenza and, to a greater extent, with OP. Radiologists' diagnostic accuracy was low in a study sample containing equal proportions of these three types of pneumonia. Clinical Impact: Recognized challenges in diagnosing COVID-19 by CT are furthered by our observed strong overlap between CT appearances of COVID-19 and OP. This challenge may be particularly evident in clinical settings with substantial proportions of patients with potential causes of OP such as ongoing cancer therapy or autoimmune conditions.","Garrana, Sherief H; Som, Avik; Ndakwah, Gabrielle S; Yeung, Tristan; Febbo, Jennifer; Heeger, Allen P; Lang, Min; McDermott, Shaunagh; Mendoza, Dexter P; Zhang, Eric W; Sharma, Amita; Narayan, Anand K; Little, Brent P",,,48

METHODS: We analyzed 29 patients: 14 seminomas and 15 non-seminomas. All of them underwent orquiectomy. Patients with seminomas stage II and III received adjuvant treatment with raditherapy, and those with non-seminomas stage II and III received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by lymphadenectomy. Mean followup for seminomas was 56 months and for non-seminomas it was 40 months. RESULTS: The most common complain was an increase in testis volume (57%) and pain (30%). The mean age in seminomas was 41.2 years and in non-seminomas it was 29.2 years. Previous criptorquidy was refered by 28.5% of patients with seminomas and 15.5% with non-seminomas. The respective proportions of stages I, II and III were 79%, 14% and 7% in seminomas, and 40%, 27% and 33% in non-seminomas. Patients with seminomas did not show serum rise of alfa-fetoprotein or b-HCG while those with non-seminomas such tumor markes were elevated respectively in 46.6% and 33.3% of the sample. Disease specific death occurred in 1 patient with seminoma and in 3 with non-seminoma tumor, but survival curves were similar for both groups. CONCLUSION: In spite of the earlier treatment of criptorquidy such an antecedent stand as an important risk factor for the development of testicular germ cell tumor. Even though non-seminomas presents with higher stages the survival curves are similar for both groups of tumors. Analyze 29 patients that were submitted to orquiectomy (14 seminomas e 15 non seminomas), concerning their age, signs and symptoms, risk factors, clinical staging, tumor markers follow up and survival rates. RESULTS: There was no statistically difference in survival rates of patients with seminomas and non-seminomas tumors.","Anastácio Dias Neto, José; Luiz Alonso Domingos, André; Carlos Pereira Martins, Antonio; Tucci Jr., Silvio; Jorge Suaid, Haylton; José Cologna, Adauto; Botene Schneider, Cassio",Acta cir. bras.,,48

Before 2015, the national health information system was fragmented, underfunded, of limited utility and accessed infrequently by health authorities. We built an electronic system that integrated mobile technologies and geographic information system data sets of every house, village and health facility in the country. We piloted the system in 184 health facilities across five provinces between 2015 and 2016. By the end of 2020, the system's mobile tablets were rolled out to 473 facilities in 13 provinces, while the online platform was available in health authorities of all 22 provinces, including church health services. Fractured data siloes of legacy health programmes have been integrated and a platform for civil registration systems established. We discuss how mobile technologies and geographic information systems have transformed health information systems in Papua New Guinea over the past 6 years by increasing the timeliness, completeness, quality, accessibility, flexibility, acceptability and utility of national health data. To achieve this transformation, we highlight the importance of considering the benefits of mobile tools and using rich geographic information systems data sets for health workers in primary care in addition to the needs of public health authorities.","Rosewell, Alexander; Shearman, Phil; Ramamurthy, Sundar; Akers, Rob",Bull World Health Organ,,48

270593,Patterns of COVID-19 illness in hospitalized children,2021,"The unwillingness of the health care system of different countries to counteract the spread of the COVID-19 virus in 2020 caused the introduction of quarantine restrictions by many countries, which had both positive and negative socioeconomic consequences. The economic consequences include the decrease in production and income of enterprises of almost all types of economic activity, increase in the number of unprofitable enterprises, closure and temporary suspension of small and mediumsized businesses, decline in real GDP. The economic consequences have led to the increase in intensity and manifestation of negative social consequences, including the increase in unemployment and social insecurity, scale and level of citizen poverty, decline in incomes and loss of working time. Influenced by the social and economic negative factors hindering sustainable development, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, socioeconomic risks in the social and labor sphere have intensified.

To anticipate this scenario, we used a multilayer network model developed to forecast the transmission dynamics of Covid-19 in Costa Rica, and to estimate the impact of the introduction of the Delta variant in the country, under two plausible vaccination scenarios, one sustaining Costa Rica's July 2021 vaccination pace of 30,000 doses per day and with high acceptance from the population and another with declining vaccination pace to 13,000 doses per day and with lower acceptance. Results suggest that the introduction and gradual dominance of the Delta variant would increase Covid-19 hospitalizations and ICU admissions between $35\%$ and $33.25\%$, from August 2021 to December 2021, depending on vaccine administration and acceptance. In the presence of the Delta variant, new Covid-19 hospitalizations and ICU admission would experience an average increase of $24.26\%$ and $27.19\%$ respectively in the same period if the vaccination pace drops.

The underlying mechanisms controlling water film growth are, however, misunderstood. Using infrared nanospectroscopy, amplitude-modulated atomic force microscopy, and molecular simulations, we show how water films grow from water vapor on hydrophilic mineral nanoparticles. We imaged films with up to four water layers that grow anisotropically over a single face. Growth usually begins from the near edges of a face where defects preferentially capture water vapor. Thicker films produced by condensation cooling completely engulf nanoparticles and form thicker menisci over defects. The high surface tension of water smooths film surfaces and produces films of inhomogeneous thickness. Nanoscale topography and film surface energy thereby control anisotropic distributions and thicknesses of water films on hydrophilic mineral nanoparticles.","Yalcin, Sibel Ebru; Legg, Benjamin A; Yesilbas, Merve; Malvankar, Nikhil S; Boily, Jean-François",Sci Adv,,48

280636,Book and Media Review,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is causative agent of COVID-19, which is responsible for severe social and economic disruption globally. Lack of vaccine or antiviral drug with clinical efficacy suggested that drug repurposing approach may provide a quick therapeutic solution to COVID-19. Nonstructural protein-15 (NSP15) encodes for an uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (EndoU) enzyme, essential for virus life cycle and an attractive target for drug development. We have performed in silico based virtual screening of FDA approved compounds targeting EndoU in search of COVID-19 drugs from commercially available approved molecules. Two drugs Glisoxepide and Idarubicin used for treatment for diabetes and leukemia, respectively, were selected as stronger binder of EndoU. Both the drugs bound to the active site of the viral endonuclease by forming attractive intermolecular interactions with catalytically essential amino acid residues, His235, His250, and Lys290. Molecular dynamics simulation studies showed stable conformation dynamics upon drugs binding to endoU. The binding free energies for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin were calculated to be -141 ± 11 and -136 ± 16 kJ/mol, respectively. The IC50 were predicted to be 9.2 µM and 30 µM for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin, respectively. Comparative structural analysis showed the stronger binding of EndoU to Glisoxepide and Idarubicin than to uridine monophosphate (UMP). Surface area calculations showed buried are of 361.8Å2 by Glisoxepide which is almost double of the area occupied by UMP suggesting stronger binding of the drug than the ribonucleotide. However, further studies on these drugs for evaluation of their clinical efficacy and dose formulations may be required, which may provide a quick therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.

Over the last few decades, the world has experienced several pandemic outbreaks of various pathogens and the frequency of the emergence of novel strains of infectious organisms has increased in recent decades. As per expert opinion, rapidly mutating viruses, emergence and re-emergence of epidemics with increasing frequencies, climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases are likely to be increasing over the years and the trends will continue and intensify. Susceptible disease hosts, anthropogenic activities and environmental changes contribute and trigger the 'adaptive evolution' of infectious agents to thrive and spread into different ecological niches and to adapt to new hosts. The overarching objective of this paper is to provide insight into the human actions which should be strictly regulated to help to sustain life on earth. To identify and categorize the triggering factors that contribute to disease ecology, especially repeated emergence of disease pandemics, a theory building approach, 'Total Interpretive Structural Modeling' (TISM) was used; also the tool, 'Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification' analysis (MICMAC) was applied to rank the risk factors based on their impacts on other factors and on the interdependence among them. This mathematical modeling tool clearly explains the strength, position and interconnectedness of each anthropogenic factor that contributes to the evolution of pathogens and to the frequent emergence of pandemics which needs to be addressed with immediate priority. As we are least prepared for another pandemic outbreak, significant policy attention must be focused on the causative factors to limit emerging outbreaks like COVID 19 in the future.","Priyadarsini, S Lakshmi; Suresh, M; Huisingh, Donald",,,48

286783,Characteristics of persons with positive COVID-19 pcr tests later testing negative for antibodies,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Given the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and much of the U.S. implementing social distancing owing to the lack of alternatives, there has been a push to develop a vaccine to eliminate the need for social distancing. METHODS: In 2020, the team developed a computational model of the U.S. simulating the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus and vaccination. RESULTS: Simulation experiments revealed that to prevent an epidemic (reduce the peak by >99%), the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60% when vaccination coverage is 100% (reproduction number=2.5-3.5). This vaccine efficacy threshold rises to 70% when coverage drops to 75% and up to 80% when coverage drops to 60% when reproduction number is 2.5, rising to 80% when coverage drops to 75% when the reproduction number is 3.5. To extinguish an ongoing epidemic, the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60% when coverage is 100% and at least 80% when coverage drops to 75% to reduce the peak by 85%-86%, 61%-62%, and 32% when vaccination occurs after 5%, 15%, and 30% of the population, respectively, have already been exposed to COVID-19 coronavirus. A vaccine with an efficacy between 60% and 80% could still obviate the need for other measures under certain circumstances such as much higher, and in some cases, potentially unachievable, vaccination coverages. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at least 70% to prevent an epidemic and of at least 80% to largely extinguish an epidemic without any other measures (e.g., social distancing).","Bartsch, Sarah M; O039,; Shea, Kelly J; Ferguson, Marie C; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Wedlock, Patrick T; Strych, Ulrich; McKinnell, James A; Siegmund, Sheryl S; Cox, Sarah N; Hotez, Peter J; Lee, Bruce Y",Am J Prev Med,,48

We examined the causal role of urinary sodium in these CVDs and risk factors using Mendelian randomization. METHODS: We identified strong, independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of urinary sodium from the most up to date genome wide association studies (GWAS) (n = 446,237) and applied them to GWAS of stroke and its subtypes (40,585 cases and 406,111 non-cases), atrial fibrillation (60,620 cases and 970,216 non-cases) and heart failure (47,309 cases and 930,014 non-case). We assessed the impact of sodium on these diseases and associated risk factors using inverse variance weighting. Sensitivity analyses included weighted median, contamination mixture method, MR-PRESSO, and multivariable Mendelian randomization. RESULTS: Higher log transformed urinary sodium was associated with higher risk of stroke (odds ratio (OR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 2.08), ischemic stroke (OR 1.60 95% CI 1.12 to 2.30), heart failure (OR 1.77 95% CI 1.19 to 2.62), and type 2 diabetes (OR 4.17 95% CI 1.53 to 11.35). Sensitivity analyses produced directionally similar estimates. CONCLUSION: Higher sodium likely increases stroke, heart failure and type 2 diabetes risk. Our study further supports public health policies to minimize population sodium intake, so as to reduce the associated disease burden.","Au Yeung, Shiu Lun; Schooling, Catherine Mary",Clin. nutr.

We identify the lead-lag relationship between oil and stock prices, and the intensity of this relationship at different frequency cycles and moments in time. Our unique findings show that co-movements between oil and stock prices manifest at 3-5-day cycle and are stronger in the first part of March and the second part of April 2020, when oil prices are leading stock prices. The partial wavelet coherence analysis, controlling for the effect of COVID-19 and US economic policy-induced uncertainty, reveals that the coronavirus crisis amplifies the shock propagation between oil and stock prices.","Albulescu, Claudiu; Mina, Michel; Oros, Cornel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05273v1.pdf,48
321454,Ventilatory Ratio with Proning in Covid-19 Ards Patients: a New Tool for an Old Strategy,2021,"A label superiority effect refers to the tendency of young children to categorize facial expressions based on emotion labels (e.g., ""happy"") more accurately than those based on photographs of facial expressions (e.g., ""smile""). However, it is unclear whether this effect stems from inaccuracies in children's spontaneous labeling of facial expressions or their tendency not to label facial expressions spontaneously. To further explore the label superiority effect, Japanese children aged 3-5 years (N = 48) were assigned to one of three conditions: label cue, photo cue, and compelled to label, and asked to categorize facial expressions by emotion by placing cards in a box. The children correctly put more facial expressions in the box for label cues than photo cues, but the compelled to label group performed as well as the label cues group. These results suggest that the label superiority effect occurs because children do not label facial expressions spontaneously, and this tendency may explain their difficulty in understanding facial expressions.","Ikeda, Shinnosuke",J Genet Psychol,,48

Extensive investigations have been performed to study the clinical and cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies have revealed the cellular changes due to the infection and identified a plethora of interactors for all SARS-CoV-2 components, except for the longest non-structural protein 3 (NSP3). Here, we expressed the full-length NSP3 proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to investigate their unique and shared functions using multi-omics methods. We conducted interactome, phosphoproteome, ubiquitylome, transcriptome, and proteome analyses of NSP3-expressing cells. We found that NSP3 plays essential roles in cellular functions such as RNA metabolism and immune response such as NF-{kappa}B signal transduction. Interestingly, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 has both endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial localizations. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 is more closely related to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, whereas SARS-CoV NSP3 is related to the cytosolic ribosomal proteins. In summary, our multi-omics studies of NSP3 enhance our understanding of the functions of NSP3 and offer valuable insights for the development of anti-SARS strategies.","Shi, Ruona; Feng, Zhenhuan; Zhang, Xiaofei",,,48

They have a high degree of efficacy in humans (70-95%) depending on the type of vaccine. However, little protection is provided against viral replication and shedding in the upper airways due to the lack of a local sIgA immune response, indicating a risk of transmission of virus from vaccinated individuals. A range of novel nasal COVID-19 vaccines are in development and preclinical results in non-human primates have shown a promising prevention of replication and shedding of virus due to the induction of mucosal immune response (sIgA) in upper and lower respiratory tracts as well as robust systemic and humoral immune responses. Whether these results will translate to humans remains to be clarified. An IM prime followed by an IN booster vaccination would likely result in a better well-rounded immune response, including prevention (or strong reduction) in viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts.","Tiboni, Mattia; Casettari, Luca; Illum, Lisbeth",Int J Pharm,,48

Usually, it is detected in outbreaks of respiratory disease, most often during the winter period. During the middle of October 2018, a serious outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in a cattle farm comprising about 300 heads located in Central Italy. The herd was affected by a severe flu-like syndrome unresponsive to any antibiotic treatment. Within 3 weeks, 39 adult animals died, and 12 abortions occurred. Direct and indirect laboratory tests were performed to detect the main pathogens causing the respiratory disease of the affected cattle. The results of laboratory investigations provided evidence of an acute and severe BRSV syndrome characterized by unusual mortality. In order to investigate the molecular underpinnings of this syndrome, phylogenetic analysis of the BRSV strain detected from the outbreak was carried out. The sequence analysis showed that the strain was genetically divergent from BRSV strains previously identified in Italy, as it showed high sequence similarity of more than 97% with strains isolated during a major BRSV epizootic that occurred in Sweden, Norway and Denmark during 2010-2011. The infection of the herd in Italy with this BRSV strain was likely due to the introduction of animals imported into Italy from abroad.","Giammarioli, Monica; Mangili, Piermario; Nanni, Alex; Pierini, Ilaria; Petrini, Stefano; Pirani, Silvia; Gobbi, Paola; De Mia, Gian Mario",Vet. med. sci,,48

330080,Early CT in COVID-19: Should I or Should I Not,2021,"For three decades now, knowledge-based scoring functions that operate through the ""potential of mean force"" (PMF) approach have continuously proven useful for studying protein structures. Although these statistical potentials are not to be confused with their physics-based counterparts of the same name-i.e. PMFs obtained by molecular dynamics simulations-their particular success in assessing the native-like character of protein structure predictions has lead authors to consider the computed scores as approximations of the free energy. However, this physical justification is a matter of controversy since the beginning. Alternative interpretations based on Bayes' theorem have been proposed, but the misleading formalism that invokes the inverse Boltzmann law remains recurrent in the literature. In this article, we present a conceptually new method for ranking protein structure models by quality, which is (i) independent of any physics-based explanation and (ii) relevant to statistics and to a general definition of information gain. The theoretical development described in this study provides new insights into how statistical PMFs work, in comparison with our approach. To prove the concept, we have built interatomic distance-dependent scoring functions, based on the former and new equations, and compared their performance on an independent benchmark of 60,000 protein structures. The results demonstrate that our new formalism outperforms statistical PMFs in evaluating the quality of protein structural decoys. Therefore, this original type of score offers a possibility to improve the success of statistical PMFs in the various fields of structural biology where they are applied.

Some peptides have been shown to translocate across the membrane spontaneously, and they could be thus used as drug-carriers. However, the advantageous peptide properties for the translocation remain unclear. Of particular interest is the effect of a proline-induced kink in &#945;-helical peptides, because the kink was previously reported to both increase and decrease the antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity of peptides could be related to their translocation across the membrane as is the case of the buforin 2 peptide investigated here. Using computer simulations with two independent models, we consistently showed that the presence of the kink has (1) no effect on the translocation barrier, (2) reduces the peptide affinity to the membrane, and (3) disfavors the transmembrane state. Moreover, we were able to determine that these effects are mainly caused by the peptide increased polarity, not the increased flexibility of the kink. The provided molecular understanding can be utilized for the design of cell-penetrating and drug-carrying peptides.","Brozek, Radim; Kabelka, Ivo; Vácha, Robert",J Phys Chem B,,48

Most neoplastic cases show the lipomatous change within the tumor silhouette, but band-like lipomatous metaplasia in the dermis under tumors has not been well-described. The aim of this study was to reveal the characteristics and relationship of intradermal band-like lipomatous metaplasia and coexisting skin tumors. A total of 20 cases with intradermal band-like lipomatous metaplasia were retrieved from 10,992 archive cases between April 1997 and March 2020 at Hyogo Cancer Center, and subjected to a detailed clinicopathologic analysis. Nine (45%) patients had superficial variant basal cell carcinoma as a coexisting neoplasm. Eight (40%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 5 of which were in situ. The remaining 3 (15%) cases were invasive extramammary Paget disease. All 20 cases showed at least one of 3 signs of tumor regression, namely, partial loss of overlying neoplasia, significant inflammatory infiltrate under the tumor, and fibrosis around the tumor. We concluded that intradermal band-like lipomatous metaplasia could be seen in association with the regressing process of cutaneous superficially-spreading neoplasms.","Takai, Toshihiro; Murata, Yozo; Goto, Keisuke",Am J Dermatopathol,,48

In fact, numerous flavonoids were found to have antiviral effects against SARS-and MERS-CoV by mainly inhibiting the enzymes 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro). In this review, we specifically focused on the search for flavonoids, polyphenolic compounds, which are proven to be effective against human CoVs. We therefore summarized and analyzed the latest progress in research to identify flavonoids for antiviral therapy and proposed strategies for future work on medicinal plants against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We discovered quercetin, herbacetin, and isobavachalcone as the most promising flavonoids with anti-CoV potential.","Solnier, J.; Fladerer, J. P.",Phytochemistry Reviews,,48

The increasing burden from this pandemic is seriously affecting everyone's life, and threating the global public health. Understanding the transmission, survival, and evolution of the virus in the environment will assist in the prevention, control, treatment, and eradication of its infection. Herein, we aimed to elucidate the environmental impacts on the transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, based on briefly introducing this respiratory virus. Future research objectives for the prevention and control of these contagious viruses and their related diseases are highlighted from the perspective of environmental science. This review should be of great help to prevent and control the epidemics caused by emerging respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs).","Zhan, Jing; Liu, Qian S.; Sun, Zhendong; Zhou, Qunfang; Hu, Ligang; Qu, Guangbo; Zhang, Jianqing; Zhao, Bin; Jiang, Guibin",Environ.

345854,Intensive Care Unit Built Environments: A Comprehensive Literature Review (2005-2020),2021,"INTRODUCTION: The present study aimed to evaluate the most common urgencies and emergencies in orthodontics during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess how orthodontists in Brazil were dealing with patients and challenges. METHODS: Early in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world, routine dental care was suspended in many countries, and only patients needing urgent or emergency care could be seen. During this period, orthodontists in Brazil were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. Over 48 hours (May 1-3, 2020), 395 orthodontists (specialists, MScs, and PhDs) responded. They answered questions regarding dental office and appointments during the pandemic, the type of urgency or emergency care provided, the type of appliance and urgencies, etc. The level of concern about the impact of the pandemic on patients' orthodontic treatments and the financial impact on the dental office was also evaluated. Descriptive statistics were performed with percentages, and responses were compared between specialists, MScs, and PhDs, using chi-square tests. RESULTS: Specialists were the majority of respondents. Most orthodontists were handling only emergencies or urgencies. The most frequent urgencies were bracket breakage, archwire breakage, and breakage of molar tubes and/or bands. Stainless steel fixed appliances were the most common type of appliance related to unscheduled appointments. The majority of patients got in touch with the orthodontist using the professional WhatsApp messenger (WhatsApp Inc, Menlo Park, Calif). Orthodontists were more concerned with the financial impact of the pandemic than with the orthodontic treatment itself. CONCLUSIONS: Breakage of brackets, archwires, or tubes and/or bands were the most common causes of urgency and/or emergency appointments during the pandemic. The level of concern about the financial impact of the stay-at-home orders and the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly greater for specialists and MScs than for PhDs.","Cotrin, Paula; Peloso, Renan Morais; Pini, Nubia Inocencya Pavesi; Oliveira, Renata Cristina; de Oliveira, Ricardo Cesar Gobbi; Valarelli, Fabricio Pinelli; Freitas, Karina Maria Salvatore",Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop,,48

The first onset of human coronavirus, SARS (SARS-CoV) appeared in 2003 which spanned five continents having lethal effects on human population accompanied by The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in 2012 with a death rate of 35%. The viruses remain a threat till date and are of serious concern since no vaccine or specified drug therapy has been approbated for treating human coronaviruses. The viruses became a pandemic worldwide with the emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV). SARS-CoV2 viral manifestation poses a serious human life risk by causing acute lung injury and various respiratory outcomes and has become a global concern. High pathogenicity and transmission rate of the viral strain has become the spotlight of research community throughout the world. With the ongoing studies on viral structure and host interactions, the intricacy of the viral proteome structure and replication cycle proposes a need to explore our understanding of host factors playing role in viral multiplication cycle. This review provides insight into our prevalent perception of coronavirus-host interactions, structure of SARS-CoV2, receptor mediated entry of virus inside the human cells, ongoing clinical trials, drug therapies and treatments that are being used to combat COVID-19 targeting viral fusion, replication and its multiplication.","Manhas, Sweeta; Anjali, Anjali; Mansoor, Sheikh; Sharma, Vikas; Ahmad, Ajaz; Rehman, Muneeb U; Ahmad, Parvaiz",Arch Med Res,,48
349262,SORT maneuver: ease and safety for the practitioner and the patient,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with droplets and contact as the main means of transmission. Since the first case appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the outbreak has gradually spread nationwide. Up to now, according to official data released by the Chinese health commission, the number of newly diagnosed patients has been declining, and the epidemic is gradually being controlled. Although most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis after infection, some patients developed severe and die from multiple organ complications. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans remains unclear. Immune function is a strong defense against invasive pathogens and there is currently no specific antiviral drug against the virus. This article reviews the immunological changes of coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and other viral pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV-2. Combined with the published literature, the potential pathogenesis of COVID-19 is inferred, and the treatment recommendations for giving high-doses intravenous immunoglobulin and low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant therapy to severe type patients are proposed.","Lin, Ling; Lu, Lianfeng; Cao, Wei; Li, Taisheng",Emerg Microbes Infect,,48
351155,A distinctive skin rash associated with coronavirus disease 2019?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to estimate and describe the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibodies (immunoglobulin M and/or immunoglobulin G) in Portugal in May-July 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey was developed after the peak of the first epidemic wave on a sample of 2301 Portuguese residents, aged 1 year or older. Survey sample was selected using a two-stage stratified non-probability sampling design (quota sampling). SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies were measured in serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seroprevalence estimates of immunoglobulin M and/or immunoglobulin G and 95% confidence intervals were stratified by sex, age group, health region and education. RESULTS: Overall, seroprevalence was 2.9% (95% confidence interval: 2.0% - 4.2%). Higher prevalence rates were observed in male (4.1%, 95% confidence interval: 2.6% - 6.6%) and those with secondary education (6.4%, 95% confidence interval: 3.2% - 12.5%). Differences in seroprevalence by age group and region were not statistically significant. DISCUSSION: The estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the cumulative incidence reported by the National Surveillance System but far from necessary to reach herd immunity. CONCLUSION: Our results support limited extent of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the study population possibly due to early lockdown measures implemented in Portugal and support the need to continue monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in order to increase our knowledge about the evolution of the epidemic and to estimate the proportion of the susceptible population over time.","Kislaya, Irina; Gonçalves, Paulo; Barreto, Marta; Sousa, Rita; Garcia, Ana Cristina; Matos, Rita; Guiomar, Raquel; Rodrigues, Ana Paula",Acta Med Port,,48
351164,"Predicting Mortality in Covid-19: Comparison of Apache Iv, Mews, and Msofa",2021,"Our episodic memories vary in their specificity, ranging from a mere sense of familiarity to detailed recollection of the initial experience. Recent work suggests that alpha/beta desynchronization promotes information flow through the cortex, tracking the richness in detail of recovered memory representations. At the same time, as we age, memories become less vivid and detailed, which may be reflected in age-related reductions in alpha/beta desynchronization during retrieval. To understand age differences in the specificity of episodic memories, we investigated differences in alpha/beta desynchronization between younger (18-26 years, n = 31) and older (65-76 years, n = 27) adults during item recognition and lure discrimination. Alpha/beta desynchronization increased linearly with the demand for memory specificity, i.e., the requirement to retrieve details for an accurate response, across retrieval situations (correct rejections < item recognition < lure discrimination). Stronger alpha/beta desynchronization was related to memory success, as indicated by reliable activation differences between correct and incorrect memory responses. In line with the assumption of a loss of mnemonic detail in older age, older adults had more difficulties than younger adults to discriminate lures from targets. Importantly, they also showed a reduced modulation of alpha/beta desynchronization across retrieval demands. Together, these results extend previous findings by demonstrating that alpha/beta desynchronization dissociates between item recognition and the retrieval of highly detailed memories as required in lure discrimination, and that age-related impairments in episodic retrieval are accompanied by attenuated modulations in the alpha/beta band. Thus, we provide novel findings suggesting that alpha/beta desynchronization tracks mnemonic specificity and that changes in these oscillatory mechanisms may underlie age-related declines in episodic memory.","Karlsson, Anna E; Wehrspaun, Claudia C; Sander, Myriam C",Neuropsychologia,,48

In particular, this investigation would analyze digitalization choices as survival strategies for COVID-19 crisis in the case of Mexican enterprises. The selected country is of particular interest as research target in the Global South, in that public policy has offered little support to keep business organizations up and running, leaving entrepreneurs with no other option but to implement bottom-up resilience strategies, including digitalization. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has been proposed to identify combinations of conditions to explain the role played by COVID crisis-related contextual factors that may have led to particular forms of digitalization. Semi-structured interviews with industry associations are also proposed to gain knowledge about group responses to the crisis.","Larios-Hernandez, Guillermo J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09802v1.pdf,48
353807,Conscious Proning or Mixed Positioning for Improving Oxygenation-COVID-19 Brings Many Changes!,2020,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to analyse the impact that occupational health and safety policies have on employees' work and organisational commitment and, in turn, on their intention to leave the company. METHODS: For this study, we designed a questionnaire with a five-level Likert scale and distributed it among professionals from different companies in the IT consultancy sector in Spain. The data collected from 458 completed questionnaires were analysed using the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique using the SmartPLS software. RESULTS: From the analysis of the data, it was concluded that there is indeed a positive relationship between occupational health and safety policies and employees' work and organisational commitment, as well as a negative relationship between these policies and the intention to leave the company. Similarly, there is a negative relationship between employees' work and organisational commitment and their turnover intention. CONCLUSIONS: Although, due to the activity of professionals in the sector, occupational health and safety has not been an area of priority, it was concluded from this study that an improvement in these areas would have a beneficial effect on the commitment of workers to the company, thus helping to reduce the high levels of turnover in the sector. Future lines of research, as well as their practical application and the limitations of the study, are indicated at the end of the paper.","Suárez-Albanchez, Julio; Blazquez-Resino, Juan Jose; Gutierrez-Broncano, Santiago; Jimenez-Estevez, Pedro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,48

This study aimed to examine the proportion of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the Japanese population using a larger sample and more robust statistical methods than previously, and to identify factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. We conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional Internet survey on 8–26 February 2021, and calculated the proportion and odds ratios for vaccine hesitancy. Among 23,142 responses analyzed, the proportion of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 11.3% (10.9–11.7%). The proportion was higher among younger respondents and female respondents, and especially among younger female respondents (15.6%) compared with the lowest proportion among older male respondents (4.8%). The most cited reason for not getting vaccinated was concerns about adverse reactions in more than 70% of the respondents. The proportion of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Japan was comparable to that in previous studies overseas, and the proportion among younger respondents was more than double that among older respondents. Factors associated with the hesitancy were female sex, living alone, low socioeconomic status, and presence of severe psychological distress, especially among older respondents. Thus, adequate measures should be taken to ensure that vaccines are delivered to people with these factors.","Okubo, Ryo Yoshioka Takashi Ohfuji Satoko Matsuo Takahiro Tabuchi Takahiro",Vaccines,,48

A study of 163 cities, chosen from four different continents reveals a universal trend, whereby the risk induced by human mobility increases in those cities where mobility flows are predominantly between high population density centers. We apply our formalism to the spread of SARS-COV-2 in the United States, providing a plausible explanation for the observed heterogeneity in the spreading process across cities. Armed with this insight, we propose realistic mitigation strategies (less severe than lockdowns), based on modifying the mobility in cities. Our results suggest that an optimal control strategy involves an asymmetric policy that restricts flows entering the most vulnerable areas but allowing residents to continue their usual mobility patterns.","Hazarie, Surendra; Soriano-Panos, David; Arenas, Alex; G'omez-Gardenes, Jes'us; Ghoshal, Gourab",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00671v1.pdf,48

The objective of our study was to describe demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, medical interventions and outcomes of pediatric patients with COVID-19 treated at Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a tertiary care center in urban Detroit, an early hotspot during the initial surge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods. A retrospective chart review was performed of children &lt;=18 years of age who had polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing via NP swab or serum IgG antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 during March 1, 2020-June 30, 2020. Results. Seventy-eight COVID-19 infected children were identified of whom 85.8% (67/78) were from minority populations (African American, Hispanic). Hospitalization rate was 82% (64/78). About 44% (34/78) had an associated comorbidity with asthma and obesity being most common. Although all ages were affected, infants &lt;1 year of age had the highest hospitalization rate (19/64, 30%). In all disease severity categories, dichotomized non-whites had more severe disease by percentage within race/ethnicity than Whites, and also within percent disease severity (P-value = .197).

369749,ICU beds: less is more? No,2020,"BACKGROUND: Knowing the number of undetected cases of COVID-19 is important for a better understanding of the spread of the disease. This study analyses the temporal dynamic of detected vs. undetected cases to provide guidance for the interpretation of prevalence studies performed with PCR or antibody tests to estimate the detection rate. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to evaluate assumptions on the detection probability ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. For each general detection probability, we derived age-dependent detection probabilities and calibrated the model to reproduce the epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Austria from March 2020 to June 2020. We categorized infected individuals into presymptomatic, symptomatic unconfirmed, confirmed and never detected to observe the simulated dynamic of the detected and undetected cases. RESULTS: The calculation of the age-dependent detection probability ruled values lower than 0.4 as most likely. Furthermore, the proportion of undetected cases depends strongly on the dynamic of the epidemic wave: during the initial upswing, the undetected cases account for a major part of all infected individuals, whereas their share decreases around the peak of the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: The results of prevalence studies performed to determine the detection rate of COVID-19 patients should always be interpreted with regard to the current dynamic of the epidemic wave. Applying the method proposed in our analysis, the prevalence study performed in Austria in April 2020 could indicate a detection rate of 0.13, instead of the prevalent ratio of 0.29 between detected and estimated undetected cases at that time.","Rippinger, C; Bicher, M; Urach, C; Brunmeir, D; Weibrecht, N; Zauner, G; Sroczynski, G; Jahn, B; Mühlberger, N; Siebert, U; Popper, N",BMC Infect Dis,,48

379079,From phenotypes to black holes... and back,2020,"Every year, incoming medical students take the Hippocratic Oath and pledge that they: “will be an advocate for patients in need and strive for justice in the care of the sick,” yet guidance on how to engage in community and public health advocacy is not a mandatory component of medical education Therefore, students often feel insufficiently qualified to engage in advocacy efforts As the nation has struggled with a viral pandemic (COVID-19) and witnessed an uprising against anti-Black racism and police brutality, it became immediately apparent that activism that marries medicine to anti-racism advocacy was needed Further, we deduced that anti-racism activism at medical institutions would need to position medical students, often low in the medical hierarchy, as essential to the response With the support of our leaders and mentors, we created a concerted series of strategies for medical students to become front and center in advocacy efforts In this paper, we outline six strategies for medical students across the nation to champion anti-racism advocacy, based on our successful experiences in Central Ohio This approach may have utility for other medical schools across the nation These strategies include: embracing a common agenda;establishing formal structures;engaging affinity groups and allies;endorsing legislative advocacy;encouraging curricular reform;and enriching the pipeline It is our hope that medical students will feel empowered and activated to lead and organize “good trouble” efforts that will ultimately improve the lives and health of the communities and patients they are being trained to serve","Fadoju, Deborah Azap Rosevine A.; Olayiwola, J.

To assess the degree to which these impacts vary, we analyzed data from 3098 participants between the ages of 40 and 79 from an online survey in Germany. Data were collected at three measurement occasions between the start of the nationwide lockdown in mid-March 2020 and the end of the lockdown in early August 2020. The survey focused on everyday experiences during the COVID-19 crisis and collected various satisfaction ratings (e.g., general life satisfaction, satisfaction with family life, satisfaction with social contacts). At baseline, participants also provided retrospective ratings of satisfaction for the period before the COVID-19 crisis. In our analyses, we compared satisfaction ratings of middle-aged (40–64 years) and older individuals (65–79 years) and found that both middle-aged and older participants experienced the greatest decreases in satisfaction with social contacts, with more pronounced decreases seen in middle-aged participants. A similar pattern was observed for general life satisfaction, but the overall decreases were less pronounced in both groups compared to the decreases in satisfaction with social contacts. We also observed a partial recovery effect in all measures at the last measurement occasion, and this effect was more pronounced in older adults. Findings were also confirmed using age as a continuous variable and checking for linear and nonlinear effects of outcomes across the age range. Although ageism arose during the pandemic in the sense that older adults were labeled as a “risk group,” particularly at the start of the outbreak, we found consistently with other studies that middle-aged adults’ satisfaction decreased to a greater extent than that of older adults.

We aimed to describe the characteristics of liver function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection. METHODS: We enrolled all adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV co-infection admitted to Tongji Hospital from February 1 to February 29, 2020. Data of demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. The characteristics of liver function and its relation with the severity and prognosis of disease were described. RESULTS: Of 105 SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV co-infected patients, elevated levels of liver test were seen in several patients at admission, including elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (22, 20.95%), aspartate aminotransferase (29, 27.62%), total bilirubin (7, 6.67%), gamma-glutamyl transferase (7, 6.67%), and alkaline phosphatase (1, 0.95%). The values of the indices mentioned above increased substantially during hospitalization (all P < .05). Fourteen (13.33%) patients developed liver injury. Most of them (10, 71.43%) recovered after 8 (range 6-21) days. Notably, 4 (28.57%) patients rapidly progressed to acute-on-chronic liver failure. The proportion of severe COVID-19 was higher in patients with liver injury (P = .042). Complications including ACLF, acute cardiac injury and shock happened more frequently in patients with liver injury (all P < .05). The mortality was higher in individuals with liver injury (28.57% vs 3.30%, P = .004). CONCLUSION: Liver injury in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV co-infection was associated with severity and poor prognosis of disease. During the treatment of COVID-19 in chronic HBV-infected patients, liver function should be taken seriously and evaluated frequently.","Zou, Xiaojing; Fang, Minghao; Li, Shusheng; Wu, Liang; Gao, Bing; Gao, Hong; Ran, Xiao; Bian, Yi; Li, Renjie; Ling, Jianmin; Li, Donghui; Tian, Deying; Huang, Jiao",Clin. gastroenterol. hepatol,,48

395120,Thank you for your resilience,2020,"Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is the active oxidizing principle underlying drinking water disinfection, also delivered by numerous skin disinfectants and released by standard swimming pool chemicals used on a global scale, a topic of particular relevance in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the cutaneous consequences of human exposure to HOCl remain largely unknown, posing a major public health concern. Here, for the first time, we have profiled the HOCl-induced stress response in reconstructed human epidermis and SKH-1 hairless mouse skin. In addition, we have investigated the molecular consequences of solar simulated ultraviolet (UV) radiation and HOCl combinations, a procedure mimicking co-exposure experienced for example by recreational swimmers exposed to both HOCl (pool disinfectant) and UV (solar radiation). First, gene expression elicited by acute topical HOCl exposure was profiled in organotypic human reconstructed epidermis. Next, co-exposure studies (combining topical HOCl and UV) performed in SKH-1 hairless mouse skin revealed that the HOCl-induced cutaneous stress response blocks redox and inflammatory gene expression elicited by subsequent acute UV exposure (Nos2, Ptgs2, Hmox1, Srxn1), a finding consistent with emerging clinical evidence in support of a therapeutic role of topical HOCl formulations for the suppression of inflammatory skin conditions (e.g. atopic dermatitis, psoriasis). Likewise, in AP-1 transgenic SKH-1 luciferase-reporter mice, topical HOCl suppressed UV-induced inflammatory signaling assessed by bioluminescent imaging and gene expression analysis. In the SKH-1 high-risk mouse model of UV-induced human keratinocytic skin cancer, topical HOCl blocked tumorigenic progression and inflammatory gene expression (Ptgs2, Il19, Tlr4), confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis including 3-chloro-tyrosine-epitopes. These data illuminate the molecular consequences of HOCl-exposure in cutaneous organotypic and murine models assessing inflammatory gene expression and modulation of UV-induced carcinogenesis. If translatable to human skin these observations provide novel insights on molecular consequences of chlorination stress relevant to environmental exposure and therapeutic intervention.","Jandova, Jana; Snell, Jeremy; Hua, Anh; Dickinson, Sally; Fimbres, Jocelyn; Wondrak, Georg T",Redox Biol,,48

399865,Critical care for COVID-19 affected patients: updated position statement of the Indian society of critical care medicine,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic required the setting of a national lockdown in Italy from March 9, 2020, until May 18, 2020; therefore, most of the non-COVID-19 activities were postponed. As a consequence, many follow-up visits in patients with previously excised skin cancers were delayed. The aim of this retrospective real-life case-control study is demonstrating that delay in follow-up led to an increased incidence of advanced melanoma and keratinocyte cancers on the total of surgically excised skin cancers. METHODS: The incidence of excised advanced melanoma and keratinocyte cancers in our dermato-surgery division in the period May 18 to November 18, 2020, was compared to the same time span of 2019. All data were collected from the electronic database of our department. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to assess the risk of excised advanced skin cancers in 2020 compared to 2019. RESULTS: From May to November 2019, we performed 265 surgical excisions, while during the pandemic in 2020, we completed 280 surgeries. The number of advanced skin cancers excised between May 18 and November 18, 2020, was significantly higher compared with the same period in 2019 (54 vs. 22, OR: 2.64; 95% CI: 1.56-4.47; P = 0.0003). Significant differences were also observed regarding the number of surgically removed advanced BCCs (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.14-4.07; P = 0.0187) and advanced SCCs (OR 4.60; 95% CI 1.31-16.18; P = 0.0175). CONCLUSION: These results confirm that delay in follow-up and, consequently, postponed surgical excisions are related to an increased incidence of advanced skin tumors, resulting in poorer prognosis lifelong. Follow-up visits should be carried on even during COVID-19 pandemic, avoiding significant delays as much as possible.","Valenti, Mario; Pavia, Giulia; Gargiulo, Luigi; Facheris, Paola; Nucca, Ombretta; Mancini, Luca; Sacrini, Francesco; Borroni, Riccardo G; Narcisi, Alessandra; Costanzo, Antonio",Int. j. dermatol,,48
400117,Supraglottic airways in the management of COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: One of the challenges posed by the novel coronavirus pandemic is the infodemic risk, that is, a huge amount of information being published on the topic, along with misinformation and rumours; with social media, this phenomenon is amplified, and it goes faster and further. Around 100 million people in Brazil (50% of the inhabitants) are users of social media networks - almost half of the country's population. Most of the information on the Internet is unregulated, and its quality remains questionable. METHODS: In this study, we examine the main characteristics of misinformation published on the topic. We analysed 232 pieces of misinformation published by the Brazilian fact-checking service ""Agência Lupa"". The following aspects of each news item were analysed: a) In what social media has it circulated?; b) What is the content classification, sentiment and type of misinformation?; d) Are there recurrent themes in the sample studied? RESULTS: Most were published on Facebook (76%), followed by WhatsApp, with 10% of total cases. Half of the stories (47%) are classified as ""real-life"", that is, the focus is on everyday situations, or circumstances involving people. Regarding the type of misinformation, there is a preponderance of fabricated content, with 53% of total, followed by false context (34%) and misleading content (13%). Wrong information was mostly published in text format (47%). We found that 92.9% of misinformation classified as ""fabricated content"" are ""health tips"", and 88.9% of ""virtual scams"" are also fabricated. CONCLUSION: Brazilian media and science communicators must understand the main characteristics of misinformation in social media about COVID-19, so that they can develop attractive, up-to-date and evidence-based content that helps to increase health literacy and counteract the spread of false information.","Biancovilli, Priscila; Makszin, Lilla; Jurberg, Claudia",BMC Public Health,,48
400229,Selecting journal for publication in the era of “haste predatory journals and covid-19”,2020,"BACKGROUND: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine utilization was mostly used for postoperative visits only in neurosurgery. Shelter-in-place measures led the rapid expansion of telemedicine to address the needs of the neurosurgical patient population. Our goal is to determine the extent of adoption of telemedicine across tumor, vascular, spine, and function neurosurgery and utilization for new patient visits. METHODS: A single-center retrospective cohort study of patients who received neurosurgical care at a tertiary academic center from February to April 2020 was conducted. Patients evaluated from March to April 2019 were included for comparison. A total of 10,746 patients were included: 1247 patients underwent surgery, 8742 were seen in clinic via an in-person outpatient visit, and 757 were assessed via telemedicine during the study period. RESULTS: A 40-fold increase in the use of telemedicine was noted after the shelter-in-place measures were initiated with a significant increase in the mean number of patients evaluated via telemedicine per week across all divisions of neurosurgery (4.5 ± 0.9 to 180.4 ± 13.9, P < 0.001). The majority of telemedicine appointments were established patient visits (61.2%), but the proportion of new patient visits also significantly increased to an average of 8.2 ± 5.3 per week across all divisions. CONCLUSIONS: Use of telemedicine drastically increased across all 4 divisions within neurosurgery with a significant increase in online-first encounters in order to meet the needs of our patients once the shelter-in-place measures were implemented. We provide a detailed account of the lessons learned and discuss the anticipated role of telemedicine in surgical practices once the shelter-in-place measures are lifted.","Mouchtouris, Nikolaos; Lavergne, Pascal; Montenegro, Thiago S; Gonzalez, Glenn; Baldassari, Michael; Sharan, Ashwini; Jabbour, Pascal; Harrop, James; Rosenwasser, Robert; Evans, James J",World Neurosurg,,48

403953,Defecation and micturition may cause syncope in COVID-19 patients on high oxygen requirement,2021,"Achieving long term autonomy of robots operating in dynamic environments such as farms remains a significant challenge. Arguably, the most demanding factors to achieve this are the on-board resource constraints such as energy, planning in the presence of moving individuals such as livestock and people, and handling unknown and undulating terrain. These considerations require a robot to be adaptive in its immediate actions in order to successfully achieve long-term, resource-efficient and robust autonomy. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates a local dynamic path planner with a longer term objective based planner and advanced motion control methods, whilst taking into consideration the dynamic responses of moving individuals within the environment. The framework is motivated by and synthesizes our recent work on energy aware mission planning, path planning in dynamic environments, and receding horizon motion control. In this paper we detail the proposed framework and outline its integration on a robotic platform. We evaluate the strategy in extensive simulated trials, traversing between objective waypoints to complete tasks such as soil sampling, weeding and recharging across a dynamic environment, demonstrating its capability to robustly adapt long term mission plans in the presence of moving individuals and obstacles for real world applications such as large scale farming.","Eiffert, Stuart; Wallace, Nathan D.; Kong, He; Pirmarzdashti, Navid; Sukkarieh, Salah",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13413v1.pdf,48

408472,Raising the Bar: ICU Beds and Certificates of Need,2020,"Food insecurity is a huge public health concern in the UK (1). Recently, numbers of UK foodbanks have increased drastically (2), likely in response to an ever-increasing demand for emergency food, particularly in the North West of England. Foodbanks primarily exist in order to alleviate hunger on a short-term, emergency basis, yet recently, foodbanks are becoming increasingly relied upon as the primary source of food for food insecure individuals (2). Alongside this, rates of obesity and other diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are increasing in food insecure populations (3), with high proportions of low nutrient quality foods supplied by foodbanks making up a large proportion of the diet and playing a vital role in development of such NCDs (1). The Trussell Trust report that 90% of foods available within foodbanks are donated by the public (4) yet, thus far, in the UK there is little research regarding foodbank donors and their perceptions of the nutritional needs of foodbank users (5). Therefore, the aim of the present study is to explore the motivation and decision-making process of foodbank donors and their perceptions of the importance of nutrition both when donating and when consuming foods themselves. Qualitative research methods were utilised, consisting of semi-structured one-to-one interviews in order to explore, in depth, the perceptions of foodbank donors. Differences in food aid provision and food insecurity may be linked to deprivation and so a small convenience sample (n = 10) were recruited via social media from both the Wirral and West Cheshire, areas that differ in deprivation level. Interviews were conducted via Zoom videoconferencing, adhering to Covid-19 restrictions, and were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed according to the research aims. Participants donating to Trussell Trust foodbanks on the Wirral (n = 5) mostly aged 46 years or above, all female and have mostly donated more than 15 times. Meanwhile participants from West Cheshire (n = 5) were younger, mostly male and donated less regularly. All participants identified as White British. Participants indicated a distinct lack of nutritional knowledge and awareness of the Eatwell Guide among participants. Nutrition appeared to be secondary when donating food, with shelf-life being the primary consideration. Participants also highlighted wanting more information on how to donate foods in the best interests of foodbank users. Due to the low sample number, repeating the study with more participants may aid in confirming the results of the present study. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the need for more nutritional education among the general population, as well as highlighting that improvements in the operational capacity of foodbanks and more information available to foodbank donors, such as a list within supermarkets, would be of use in facilitating donation of foods that support the health of vulnerable and food insecure individuals.","Taylor, N.; Dunne, S.",Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,,48

METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of 383 patients with the definite outcome by March 1, 2020 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan were reviewed. The association between platelet parameters and mortality risk was estimated by utilizing Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: Among the 383 patients, 334 (87.2%) were discharged and survived, and 49 (12.8%) died. Thrombocytopenia at admission was associated with mortality of almost three times as high as that for those without thrombocytopenia (P < 0.05). Cox regression analyses revealed that platelet count was an independent risk factor associated with in-hospital mortality in a dose-dependent manner. An increment of per 50 × 109/L in platelets was associated with a 40% decrease in mortality (hazard ratio: 0.60, 95%CI: 0.43, 0.84).

One approach has been the distance learning problem-based learning (PBL) tutorial utilising the online peer-to-peer platform. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of students using distance learning PBL tutorials using with that of students utilising the conventional face-to-face approach. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in a single academic institution. We compared two groups of fourth-year medical students from the same class: one group used distance learning (DL); the other, the face-to-face (FF) method. We used students' baseline performance at the preceding block for one-to-one propensity score matching. Students utilising the PBL tutorial were given grades by their tutors according to a standardised scoring system encompassing five key areas (score range: 0-10). The main outcome was a student's total score (i.e., the sum of the scores from the five key areas, ranging from 0 to 50). RESULT: We matched 62 students in each group. With four tutorials, there were 490 observations, with 245 in each group. The mean total score for the DL group was 37.5 ± 4.6, which was significantly lower than that of the FF group (39.0 ± 4.4, p < 0.001). We noted that students in the DL group had a significantly lower scores for all five areas of proficiency: participation, communication, preparation, critical thinking and group skills. CONCLUSION: Findings of this study revealed that the performance of students utilising the DL PBL tutorials was lower than that of students participating in the conventional FF approach. Further studies are needed to ascertain the underlying cause.","Foo, Chi-Chung; Cheung, Billy; Chu, Kent-Man",BMC Med Educ,,48

The impact is felt in the informal sector, including scavengers, especially women scavengers who depend on garbage piles. The double burden position they have been doing so far has been exacerbated by the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper analyzes the condition of women scavengers at TPST Monang Maning, Denpasar, in their roles in the domestic and public spheres and reveals the implications during the pandemic. This research uses observation, interview and literature techniques. This paper uses an approach to the function of women in the domestic and public sphere and a subaltern study approach to see the implications of the double burden of women scavengers’s phenomenon during the pandemic. The results showed that the double burden phenomenon experienced by women scavengers was increasingly burdensome during the pandemic. Limited space for movement in the public sphere and additional burdens in the domestic sphere have implications for their position as a subaltern or dominated group. The patriarchal culture that led them to a subaltern position grew stronger during the pandemic.","Dharwiyanto Putro, Bambang",Jurnal Kajian Bali (Journal Of Bali Studies),,48

440274,Efficacy of chlorhexidine wipes on colonization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in both ventilator and nonventilator patients in pediatric intensive care unit,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has posed different kinds of challenges to society and churches over the past months. With various 'normal ministry practices' not permitted under lockdown regulations, as well as people starting to fear the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a sense of crisis can easily prevail. However, a small congregation in Bloemfontein, South Africa, responded by engaging their children and teenagers through reflection, content and outreach. Various methods, including virtual and face to face, were utilised to minister to and with children and teenagers. This response can now be analysed to find answers to the following questions: How did the pandemic influence specific methods chosen for faith formation? What made it different from 'ministry as usual'? What role did the Bible play in the methods and content used? Within the framework of the qualitative research, reflective practice from a hermeneutic perspective was utilised as theoretical approach to analyse the response of the pastors and Sunday school teachers. Reflection occurs on three levels, namely, technical (efficiency and effectiveness), practical (goals and consequences) and critical (analysis of one's practice within wider contexts). A literature study was also conducted on the influence of a pandemic on faith formation. Recommendations were made regarding different ways to engage with children and teenagers and involving them in ministry. This research contributes to knowledge as to how and why pastors/congregations react the way they do in a pandemic.","Hoffman, L.",Hts Teologiese Studies-Theological Studies,,48

Since its discovery more than 40 years ago, the IL-6 pathway has emerged as a pivotal pathway involved in immune regulation in health and dysregulation in many diseases. Targeting of the IL-6 pathway has led to innovative therapeutic approaches for various rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, as well as other conditions such as Castleman disease and cytokine release syndrome. Targeting this pathway has also identified avenues for potential expansion into several other indications, such as uveitis, neuromyelitis optica and, most recently, COVID-19 pneumonia. To mark the tenth anniversary of anti-IL-6 receptor therapy worldwide, we discuss the history of research into IL-6 biology and the development of therapies that target IL-6 signalling, including the successes and challenges and with an emphasis on rheumatic diseases.","Choy, Ernest H; De Benedetti, Fabrizio; Takeuchi, Tsutomu; Hashizume, Misato; John, Markus R; Kishimoto, Tadamitsu",Nat Rev Rheumatol,,48

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated glycemic control of individuals with T1DM using hybrid closed loop (HCL) system in the period before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy (February 10-23, 2020-Time 1), when movements were only reduced (February 24-March 8, 2020-Time 2) and during complete lockdown (March 9-22, 2020-Time 3). Information about regular PA (at least 3 h per week) prior and during the quarantine was collected. Results: The study included 13 individuals with a median age of 14.2 years and a good glycemic control at baseline (glucose management indicator of 7%, time in range [TIR] of 68%, time below range [TBR] of 2%). All individuals continued to show good glycemic control throughout the study period. There was an increase in TIR during the study period (+3%) and TIR was significantly higher during Time 3 (72%) than during Time 2 (66%). TBR was significantly lower during Time 3 (1%) both compared with Time 1 and Time 2 (2%). A meaningful variance in TIR at Time 3 between individuals who performed or not PA during quarantine and a significant increase in TIR between Time 2 and Time 3 in individuals both doing PA at baseline and during quarantine was found. At logistic regression, only the presence of PA during quarantine significantly predicted a TIR >70%. Conclusions: Glycemic control of T1DM in adolescents using HCL system did not worsen during the restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemics and further improved in those who continued PA during the quarantine. Maintaining regular PA in a safe home environment is an essential strategy for young individuals with T1DM during the COVID-19 crisis.","Tornese, Gianluca; Ceconi, Viola; Monasta, Lorenzo; Carletti, Claudia; Faleschini, Elena; Barbi, Egidio",Diabetes Technol Ther,,48

454613,Automated bag breathing unit for COVID-19 ventilator shortages,2021,"Porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a member of coronavirus that causes acute infectious disease and high mortality in piglets. The transcription factor IRF3 is a central regulator of type I interferon (IFN) innate immune signalling. Here, we report that PHEV infection of RAW264.7 cells results in strong suppression of IFN-ß production in the early stage. A comparative analysis of the upstream effector of IFN-ß transcription demonstrated that deactivation of IRF3, but not p65 or ATF-2 proteins, is uniquely attributed to failure of early IFN-ß induction. Moreover, the RIG-I/MDA5/MAVS/TBK1-dependent protective response that regulates the IRF3 pathway is not disrupted by PHEV and works well underlying the deactivated IRF3-mediated IFN-ß inhibition. After challenge with poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of dsRNA used to stimulate IFN-ß secretion in the TLR-controlled pathway, we show that PHEV and poly(I:C) regulate IFN-ß-induction via two different pathways. Collectively, our findings reveal that deactivation of IRF3 is a specific mechanism that contributes to termination of type I IFN signalling during early infection with PHEV independent of the conserved RIG-I/MAVS/MDA5/TBK1-mediated innate immune response.","Li, Zi; Yang, Yawen; Lu, Huijun; Zhang, Jing; Xu, Rongyi; Shi, Junchao; Lan, Yungang; Guan, Jiyu; Zhao, Kui; He, Hongbin; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi",Vet Microbiol,,48

We aim to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on radiotherapy (RT) practice in a hub cancer center. METHODS: Retrospective data collection of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection, identified by pathognomonic symptoms feedback at triage realized at the entrance to RT division. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of oncologic disease, COVID-19-related symptoms, and signed written informed consent. RESULTS: Between 1 March and 30 June 2020, 1,006 patients accessed our RT division for RT simulation or treatment. Forty-four patients matched inclusion criteria (4.4% of all patients): 29 women and 15 men. Seventeen patients had metastatic disease. Twenty-one patients reported fever, 6 presented dyspnea, 4 complained of ageusia and anosmia, and 3 developed conjunctivitis. Thirty-six patients underwent nasal swab, with 7 positive results. From our cohort, 4 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed with computed tomography scan imaging: 3 were related to COVID-19 infection, while the fourth was evaluated as an RT adverse event. From the entire series, 4 patients died: 3 during hospitalization in intensive care unit of complications of COVID-19 and 1 of other causes neither COVID-19 nor cancer-related.

475791,Use of a Multidisciplinary Mechanical Ventilation Weaning Protocol to Improve Patient Outcomes and Empower Staff in a Medical Intensive Care Unit,2021,"Purpose: Stay-at-home orders and additional fears of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in the presentation of patients with stroke symptoms in emergency departments across some regions in the U.S. but without a similar decline in mechanical thrombectomy (MT) (1). However, a significant decrease of MT cases was observed in other countries such as France (2). It is unknown if the same phenomenon was observed across the entire U.S. The purpose of this study was to review the volumes of code stroke activation, emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) activation, and MT cases in a Stroke Belt region during statewide stay-at-home measures to determine if the percentage of ELVO and MT cases to all code stroke activations were equally affected. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed hospital data for code stroke activations, code stroke activations for large vessel occlusion (LVO), and MT cases for the 53-day stay-at-home ordinance in North Carolina (March 30 to May 22, 2020). This data set was compared to the two preceding (Dec 14, 2019 to March 29, 2020) and two following (May 23, 2020, to September 5, 2020) 53-day time periods. Results: Code stroke activation volumes during the preceding two 53-day periods leading up to the stay-at-home ordinance were 857 and 785 but significantly decreased to 632 during the statewide stay-at-home orders (P &lt; 0.01);this was a 23% reduction in volume compared to the mean of the two prior periods. All activations then rebounded to baseline levels (890, 886) in the two time periods after lifting stay-at-home orders. Similar decreases were noted for ELVOs and MTs during the stay-at-home time period as there was no significant change in the percentage of ELVO activations per all stroke activations (9.6%, P = 0.50) and cases that ultimately underwent thrombectomy (5.7%, P = 0.80) when compared to both the mean of the prior two 53-day time periods (8.4%, 5.3%, respectively) and the subsequent two respective time periods (9.0%, 4.8%, respectively). Conclusions: In our large catch-basin metropolitan region within the Southeast stroke belt, there was an overall and similar percentage decline in all code stroke activations, ELVO activations, and MT cases during the implementation of statewide mandatory stay-at-home orders. The data suggests that patients were either deferring care during stay-at-home orders despite the severity of symptoms, or there was an actual decline in stroke incidence across all severities in our region during this time period.","Hines, A.; Rhoten, J.; Strong, D.; Prasad, T.; Wang, E.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,,48

482288,Intensive care accessibility and outcomes in pandemics,2020,"BACKGROUNDPediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection can be complicated by a dangerous hyperinflammatory condition termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The clinical and immunologic spectrum of MIS-C and its relationship to other inflammatory conditions of childhood have not been studied in detail.METHODSWe retrospectively studied confirmed cases of MIS-C at our institution from March to June 2020. The clinical characteristics, laboratory studies, and treatment response were collected. Data were compared with historic cohorts of Kawasaki disease (KD) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).RESULTSTwenty-eight patients fulfilled the case definition of MIS-C. Median age at presentation was 9 years (range: 1 month to 17 years); 50% of patients had preexisting conditions. All patients had laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seventeen patients (61%) required intensive care, including 7 patients (25%) who required inotrope support. Seven patients (25%) met criteria for complete or incomplete KD, and coronary abnormalities were found in 6 cases. Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevation in inflammatory markers, D-dimer, B-type natriuretic peptide, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were common but not ubiquitous. Cytopenias distinguished MIS-C from KD and the degree of hyperferritinemia and pattern of cytokine production differed between MIS-C and MAS. Immunomodulatory therapy given to patients with MIS-C included intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) (71%), corticosteroids (61%), and anakinra (18%). Clinical and laboratory improvement were observed in all cases, including 6 cases that did not require immunomodulatory therapy. No mortality was recorded in this cohort.CONCLUSIONMIS-C encompasses a broad phenotypic spectrum with clinical and laboratory features distinct from KD and MAS.FUNDINGThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Rheumatology Research Foundation Investigator Awards and Medical Education Award; Boston Children's Hospital Faculty Career Development Awards; the McCance Family Foundation; and the Samara Jan Turkel Center.","Lee, Pui Y; Day-Lewis, Megan; Henderson, Lauren A; Friedman, Kevin G; Lo, Jeffrey; Roberts, Jordan E; Lo, Mindy S; Platt, Craig D; Chou, Janet; Hoyt, Kacie J; Baker, Annette L; Banzon, Tina M; Chang, Margaret H; Cohen, Ezra; de Ferranti, Sarah D; Dionne, Audrey; Habiballah, Saddiq; Halyabar, Olha; Hausmann, Jonathan S; Hazen, Melissa M; Janssen, Erin; Meidan, Esra; Nelson, Ryan W; Nguyen, Alan A; Sundel, Robert P; Dedeoglu, Fatma; Nigrovic, Peter A; Newburger, Jane W; Son, Mary Beth F",J Clin Invest,,48

However, the understanding of potential linkages between restoration of visitors and nature-based tourism remains incomplete, resulting in a lack of orientation for researchers and managers. This study aimed to explore how visitors achieve restoration through nature by analyzing published literature on tourism. Using a systematic review method, this study examined destination types, participant traits, theoretical foundations, and potential restorative outcomes presented in 34 identified articles. A new framework that synthesizes relevant research and conceptualizes the restorative mechanisms of nature-based tourism from a human-nature interaction perspective was developed. Owing to the limitations in the theories, methods, cases, and the COVID-19 pandemic, interdisciplinary methods and multisensory theories are needed in the future to shed further light on the restoration of visitors through nature-based tourism. The findings provide a theoretical perspective on the consideration of nature-based tourism as a public-wellness product worldwide, and the study provides recommendations for future research in a COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 society.","Qiu, Mengyuan; Sha, Ji; Scott, Noel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,48

483014,Corticosteroid use in severely hypoxemic COVID-19 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is a persistent concern over the risk of respiratory pathogen transmission, including SARS-CoV-2, via the formation of aerosols (ie, a suspension of microdroplets and residual microparticles after evaporation) generated during high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy in critically ill patients. This concern is fueled by limited available studies on this subject. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that HFNC treatment is not associated with increased aerosol formation as compared to conventional oxygen therapy. METHODS: We used laser light scattering and a handheld particle counter to detect and quantify aerosols in healthy subjects and in adults with acute respiratory disease, including COVID-19, during HFNC or conventional oxygen therapy. RESULTS: The use of HFNC was not associated with increased formation of aerosols as compared to conventional oxygen therapy in both healthy subjects (n = 3) and subjects with acute respiratory disease, including COVID-19 (n = 17). CONCLUSIONS: In line with scarce previous clinical and experimental findings, our results indicate that HFNC itself does not result in overall increased aerosol formation as compared to conventional oxygen therapy. This suggests there is no increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission to health care workers during HFNC.","Bem, Reinout A; van Mourik, Niels; Klein-Blommert, Rozalinde; Spijkerman, Ingrid Jb; Kooij, Stefan; Bonn, Daniel; Vlaar, Alexander P",Respir Care,,48

484072,"Characteristics of critically ill patients infected with COVID-19 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",2020,"OBJECTIVES: To understand the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on asthma control in children based on caregivers' perspectives and experiences. DESIGN: This was a qualitative study deploying face-to-face, semistructured interviews. Thematic analysis was carried out to analyse the data. SETTING: Paediatric respiratory clinics in three tertiary hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 16 caregivers providing unpaid asthma-related care and assistance to children under 14 years who had been diagnosed with asthma for more than 1 year and were not only treated with short-acting ß2-agonists. RESULTS: Six main themes were identified: (1) improved asthma control; (2) decreased willingness to seek medical care driven by fear; (3) increased adherence due to enhanced awareness of asthma control; (4) coping strategies for changes caused by COVID-19; (5) a new opportunity and (6) managing new challenges in asthma control. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak and the measures in response to it have had significant impacts on asthma control among children. Children with asthma are advised to continue good asthma management, take their prescribed asthma medications as normal, wash their hands regularly and wear face masks. Regularly supported self-management and remote consultations should be provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, supporting people financially, providing continued medical support and alleviating any fear and anxiety should be considered. We anticipate that our findings will inform health promotion interventions.","Jia, Yuanmin; Bao, Jingxian; Yi, Mo; Zhang, Zeyi; Wang, Jingjing; Wang, Haixia; Li, Yizhang; Chen, Ou",BMJ Open,,48
486554,Igniting Change: Supporting the Well-Being of Academicians Who Practice and Teach Critical Care,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is having a catastrophic impact on human health. Widespread community transmission has triggered stringent distancing measures with severe socioeconomic consequences. Gaining control of the pandemic will depend on interruption of transmission chains until protective herd immunity arises. Ferrets and related members of the weasel genus transmit SARS-CoV-2 efficiently with minimal clinical signs, resembling spread in the young-adult population. We previously reported an orally efficacious nucleoside analog inhibitor of influenza viruses, EIDD-2801 (or MK-4482), that was repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 and is in phase II/III clinical trials. Employing the ferret model, we demonstrate in this study high SARS-CoV-2 burden in nasal tissues and secretions that coincides with efficient direct-contact transmission. Therapeutic treatment of infected animals with twice-daily MK-4482/EIDD-2801 significantly reduced upper respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 load and completely suppressed spread to untreated contact animals. This study identifies oral MK-4482/EIDD-2801 as a promising antiviral countermeasure to break SARS-CoV-2 community transmission chains.","Plemper, Richard; Cox, Robert; Wolf, Josef",,,48

496011,Improving Testing for COVID-19 for the Rural Southwestern American Indian Tribes,2020,"COVID-19 is predicted to overwhelm healthcare capacity in the US and worldwide and as such interventions that could prevent clinical decompensation and respiratory compromise in infected patients are desperately needed. Excessive cytokine release and activation of coagulation appear to be key drivers of COVID-19 pneumonia and associated mortality. Contact activation has been linked to pathologic upregulation of both inflammatory mediators and coagulation and accumulating preclinical and clinical data suggest it to be a rational therapeutic target in COVID-19 patients. Pharmacological inhibition of the interaction between coagulation factors XI and XII has been shown to prevent consumptive coagulopathy, pathologic systemic inflammatory response, and mortality in at least 2 types of experimental sepsis. Importantly, inhibition of contact activation also prevented death from S. aureus-induced lethal systemic inflammatory response syndrome in nonhuman primates. The contact system is likely dispensable for hemostasis, and may not be needed for host immunity, suggesting it to be a reasonably safe target that will not result in immunosuppression or bleeding. As a few drugs targeting contact activation are already in clinical development, immediate clinical trials for their use in COVID-19 patients are potentially feasible for the prevention or treatment of respiratory distress.","Shatzel, J.

METHODS: Prospective observational single-center cohort study of adult PLWH reporting symptoms of COVID-19. We assessed clinical characteristics, risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis and severity, and standardized incidence rate ratio for COVID-19 cases in PLWH cohort and in Barcelona. RESULTS: From 1 March 2020 to 10 May 2020, 53 out of 5683 (0.9% confidence interval 0.7-1.2%) PLWH were diagnosed with COVID-19. Median age was 44 years, CD4 T cells were 618/µl and CD4/CD8 was 0.90. All but two individuals were virologically suppressed. Cough (87%) and fever (82%) were the most common symptoms. Twenty-six (49%) were admitted, six (14%) had severe disease, four (8%) required ICU admission, and two (4%) died. Several laboratory markers (lower O2 saturation and platelets, and higher leukocytes, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, C reactive protein, procalcitonin, and ferritin) were associated with COVID-19 severity. No HIV or antiretroviral-related factors were associated with COVID-19 diagnosis or severity. Standardized incidence rate ratios of confirmed or confirmed/probable COVID-19 in PLWH were 38% (95% confidence interval 27-52%, Pâ<â0.0001) and 33% (95% confidence interval 21-50%, Pâ<â0.0001), respectively relative to the general population. CONCLUSION: PLWH with COVID-19 did not differ from the rest of the HIV cohort. Clinical presentation, severity rate, and mortality were not dependent on any HIV-related or antiretroviral-related factor. COVID-19 standardized incidence rate was lower in PLWH than in the general population. These findings should be confirmed in larger multicenter cohort studies.","Inciarte, Alexy; Gonzalez-Cordon, Ana; Rojas, Jhon; Torres, Berta; de Lazzari, Elisa; de la Mora, Lorena; Martinez-Rebollar, Maria; Laguno, Montserrat; Callau, Pilar; Gonzalez-Navarro, Azucena; Leal, Lorna; Garcia, Felipe; Mallolas, Josep; Mosquera, Mar; Marcos, Maria A; Ambrosioni, Juan; Miro, Josep M; Martinez, Esteban; Blanco, Jose L",AIDS,,48

501797,Severe Escalation of Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrests in Sars-cov-2-immersed Metropolitan Cities,2021,"In Japan, in response to the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a 'new normal' in the era of the COVID-19 was proposed by the government, which calls for thorough wearing of masks as an infection control measure in the era of the COVID-19, but related heat illness has been a great concern this summer. We applied quasi-Poisson regression models to the daily number of emergency transportations due to heat illness from 2008 to 2020 from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan, to estimate the expected weekly number of emergency transportations from heat illness, with adjustment for their long-term trend and the weather conditions, including temperatures. We found that, at the national level, the number of heat illness emergency transports did not significantly increase or decrease from the annual trend in 2020. By prefecture, on the other hand, there were some prefectures in which the number of heat illness emergency transports was less than the average year, and most of them were in the week of August 10-16. By age group, the number of heat illness emergency transports in the 0-17 and 18-64 age groups was particularly low in some prefectures, and by severity, those in mild cases was particularly low. A caution is necessary that there is a possibility that a decrease in cases possibly associated with COVID-19 measures, such as, outdoor activity restrictions at schools/universities and cancellation of public events, may offset the possible increase in heat illness cases occurring elsewhere associated with wearing masks. Given that the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is not expected yet, continuous and appropriate awareness-raising activities to prevent heat-related illness remain important.","Uryu, Shinya; Tanoue, Yuta; Nomura, Shuhei; Matsuura, Kentaro; Makiyama, Koji; Kawashima, Takayuki; Yoneoka, Daisuke; Eguchi, Akifumi; Kawamura, Yumi; Gilmour, Stuart; Sakamoto, Haruka; Shimizu, Kazuki; Ng, Chris Fook Sheng; Hashizume, Masahiro",Sci Total Environ,,48

508961,A Multicenter Questionnaire-based Study to Know the Awareness and Medical Treatment Plan of Physicians Involved in the Management of COVID-19 Patients,2020,"The timing of transmission plays a key role in the dynamics and controllability of an epidemic. However, observing generation times-the time interval between the infection of an infector and an infectee in a transmission pair-requires data on infection times, which are generally unknown. The timing of symptom onset is more easily observed; generation times are therefore often estimated based on serial intervals-the time interval between symptom onset of an infector and an infectee. This estimation follows one of two approaches: (i) approximating the generation time distribution by the serial interval distribution or (ii) deriving the generation time distribution from the serial interval and incubation period-the time interval between infection and symptom onset in a single individual-distributions. These two approaches make different-and not always explicitly stated-assumptions about the relationship between infectiousness and symptoms, resulting in different generation time distributions with the same mean but unequal variances. Here, we clarify the assumptions that each approach makes and show that neither set of assumptions is plausible for most pathogens. However, the variances of the generation time distribution derived under each assumption can reasonably be considered as upper (approximation with serial interval) and lower (derivation from serial interval) bounds. Thus, we suggest a pragmatic solution is to use both approaches and treat these as edge cases in downstream analysis. We discuss the impact of the variance of the generation time distribution on the controllability of an epidemic through strategies based on contact tracing, and we show that underestimating this variance is likely to overestimate controllability.","Lehtinen, Sonja; Ashcroft, Peter; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian",J R Soc Interface,,48

515728,Oxygen administration for patients with ARDS,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused much morbidity and mortality to patients but also health care providers. AIMS: We tabulated the cases of physician deaths from COVID-19 associated with front-line work in hopes of mitigating future events. METHODS: On 15 April 2020, a Google internet search was performed using the keywords 'doctor', 'physician', 'death', 'COVID' and 'coronavirus' in English and Farsi, and Chinese using the Baidu search engine. The age, sex and medical speciality of physicians who died from COVID-19 in the line of duty were recorded. Individuals greater than 90 years of age were excluded. RESULTS: We found 278 physicians who died with COVID-19 infection, but complete details were missing for 108 individuals. The average age of the physicians was 63.7 years with a median age of 66 years, and 90% were male (235/261). General practitioners and emergency room doctors (108/254), respirologists (5/254), internal medicine specialists (13/254) and anaesthesiologists (6/254) comprised 52% of those dying. Two per cent of the deceased were epidemiologists (5/254), 2% were infectious disease specialists (4/254), 6% were dentists (16/254), 4% were ENT (9/254) and 3% were ophthalmologists (8/254). The countries with the most reported physician deaths were Italy (121/278; 44%), Iran (43/278; 15%), Philippines (21/278; 8%), Indonesia (17/278; 6%), China (16/278; 6%), Spain (12/278; 4%), USA (12/278; 4%) and UK (11/278;4%). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians from all specialities may die from COVID. Lack of personal protective equipment was cited as a common cause of death. Consideration should be made to exclude older physicians from front-line work.","Ing, E B; Xu, Q A; Salimi, A; Torun, N",Occup Med (Lond),,48
518744,Acute Necrotizing Encephalitis as a Probable Association of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 long-term sequelae are ill-defined since only few studies have explored the long-term consequences of this disease so far. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the 6-month respiratory outcomes and exercise capacity of COVID-19 acute respiratory failure (ARF) patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during the first wave of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: retrospective observational study. PATIENTS: COVID-19 patients with ARF. INTERVENTIONS: CPAP during hospitalization and 6-month follow-up. MAIN MEASURES: frailty assessment through frailty index (FI), pO2/FiO2 during hospitalization and at follow-up, respiratory parameters, 6-min walking test (6MWT) and the modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) and Borg scale at follow-up. KEY RESULTS: more than half of the patients had no dyspnoea according to the mMRC scale. Lower in-hospital pO2/FiO2 correlated with higher BORG scale levels after 6MWT (&#961; 0.27; p 0.04) at follow up visit. FI was positively correlated with length of hospitalization (&#961; 0.3; p 0.03) and negatively with the 6MWT walked distance (&#961; -0.36; p 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: robust and frail patients with COVID-19 ARF treated with NIV outside the intensive care unit setting had good respiratory parameters and exercise capacity at 6-month follow-up, although more severe patients had slightly poorer respiratory performance compared to patients with higher PaO2/FiO2 and lower FI.

Inferior colliculus (IC) neuronal responses adapt to the most frequent sound level within an acoustic scene (adaptation to stimulus statistics), a mechanism that may preserve neuronal and behavioral thresholds for signal detection. However, it is still unclear if the presence of foreground stimuli and/or task involvement can modify neuronal adaptation. To investigate how task-engagement interacts with this mechanism, we compared the response of IC neurons to background noise, which caused adaptation to stimulus statistics, while macaque monkeys performed a masked tone detection task (task-driven condition) with responses recorded when the same background noise was presented alone (passive listening condition). In the task-dependent condition, monkeys performed a Go/No-Go task while 50 ms tones were embedded within an adaptation-inducing continuous background noise, whose level changed every 50 ms and were drawn from a probability distribution. The adaptation to noise stimulus statistics in IC neuronal responses was significantly enhanced in the task-driven condition compared to the passive listening condition, showing that foreground stimuli and/or task-engagement can modify IC neuronal responses. Additionally, the response of IC neurons to noise was significantly affected by the preceding sensory information (history effect) regardless of task involvement. These studies show that dynamic range adaptation in IC preserves behavioral and neurometric thresholds irrespective of noise type, and a dependence of neuronal activity on task-related factors at subcortical levels of processing.","Rocchi, Francesca; Ramachandran, Ramnarayan",J. neurophysiol,,48

590432,Particle and bioaerosol characteristics in a paediatric intensive care unit,2017-10-31,"The post-COVID syndrome is estimated to occur in up to 10% of patients who have had COVID-19. This condition manifests as lingering symptoms which persist for weeks to months after resolution of the acute illness. The syndrome is poorly understood and efforts are just beginning to appropriately characterize the symptoms expressed by this population. We present a population of patients with persistent symptoms as measured by a select number of PROMIS surveys (i.e. fatigue, sleep, pain, physical functioning, and social roles). We believe this to be the first use of the PROMIS survey data collected in this population and one of the first to attempt to measure social dysfunction secondary to the post-COVID syndrome. Our patient population is notably younger (30.9% were between 40-59 years of age), with a majority being female (60.5%). They also reported deficits in social roles (34.5%), and greater fatigue (14.7%), and pain (15.9%); along with a variety of disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to requiring admission. Despite this increased heterogeneity of population, the symptomatology of the post-COVID syndrome is preserved. These findings differ significantly from previously published data that demonstrated that outpatients can have duration of post-COVID syndrome similar to those who were hospitalized.","Ganesh, R.; Ghosh, A.

Methods: Descriptive ecological study based on numbers of 016-calls, policy reports, women killed, and protection orders (PO) issued due to IPV across Spain as a whole and by province (2015–2020). We calculated quarterly rates for each indicator. A cluster analysis was performed using 016-call rates and protection orders by province in the second quarters of 2019 and 2020. ANOVAs were calculated for clustering by province, unemployment rates by province, and the current IPV prevalence. Results: During the second quarter of 2020, the highest 016-call rate was recorded (12.19 per 10,000 women aged 15 or over). Policy report rates (16.62), POs (2.81), and fatalities (0.19 per 1,000,000 women aged 15 or over) decreased in the second quarter of 2020. In the third quarter, 016-calls decreased, and policy reports and POs increased. Four clusters were identified, and significant differences in unemployment rates between clusters were observed (F = 3.05, p < 0.05). Conclusions: The COVID-19 lockdown fostered a change in IPV-affected women’s help-seeking behavior. Differences between the volume of contacts made via 016-call and the policy reports generated provide evidence for the existence of barriers to IPV-service access during the lockdown and the period of remote working. More efforts are needed to reorganize services to cope with IPV in non-presential situations. The provinces with the highest 016-call and PO rates were also those with the highest rates of unemployment, a worrying result given the current socioeconomic crisis.","Vives-Cases, Carmen; Parra-Casado, Daniel La; Estévez, Jesús F.; Torrubiano-Domínguez, Jordi; Sanz-Barbero, Belén",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925021/,48
594078,Early experience with influenza A H1N109 in an Australian intensive care unit,2010-07-05,"This paper studies the effects of the centrality, connectivity and agglomeration of retail establishments on their long-term viability in three cities in the United States, United Kingdom and The Netherlands. As retail is declining in all three markets, there is a dearth of knowledge on the spatial patterns of this decline. This obstructs the substantiation of development decisions and public policy on urban retail retention and growth. Without knowing where stores are most at risk of closing, where can we decide to invest or divest? This paper uses a self-built dataset of store locations and store closures over the span of more than a century in the urban cores of Detroit, Michigan; Birmingham, England; and The Hague, The Netherlands. While taking different paths, all three cities have experienced significant retail decline over the past century. The probability of store closure over time is compared to the metric distance of stores to the retail center of gravity (centrality), store location along well-used streets as measured by their Choice value (connectivity), and the number of surrounding stores (agglomeration). These three comparisons are statistically analyzed using simple line regression, panel regression, and spatial autoregressive probit models. Across these models, store closure is most significantly affected by agglomeration, then by centrality, followed by connectivity. The significance of all three measures is strongest in The Hague, followed by Birmingham and Detroit – two cities that experienced large-scale urban renewal and socio-economic decline.","Kickert, Conrad; vom Hofe, Rainer; Haas, Tigran; Zhang, Wen; Mahato, Binita",Cities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921867/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2020.102918; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S026427512031266X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026427512031266X,48
596259,Clinician–family relationships may impact neonatal intensive care: clinicians’ perspectives,2021-06-05,"Abstract Mucosal vaccination, which is shown to elicit systemic and mucosal immune responses, serves as a non-invasive and convenient alternative to parenteral administration, with stronger capability in combatting diseases at the site of entry. The exploration of potent mucosal adjuvants is emerging as a significant area, based on the continued necessity to amplify the immune responses to a wide array of antigens that are poorly immunogenic at the mucosal sites. As one of the inspirations from the ocean, chitosan-based mucosal adjuvants have been developed with unique advantages, such as, ability of mucosal adhesion, distinct trait of opening the junctions to allow the paracellular transport of antigen, good tolerability and biocompatibility, which guaranteed the great potential in capitalizing on their application in human clinical trials. In this review, the state of art of chitosan and its derivatives as mucosal adjuvants, including thermo-sensitive chitosan system as mucosal adjuvant that were newly developed by author's group, was described, as well as the clinical application perspective. After a brief introduction of mucosal adjuvants, chitosan and its derivatives as robust immune potentiator were discussed in detail and depth, in regard to the metabolism, safety profile, mode of actions and preclinical and clinical applications, which may shed light on the massive clinical application of chitosan as mucosal adjuvant.","Xia, Yufei; Fan, Qingze; Hao, Dongxia; Wu, Jie; Ma, Guanghui; Su, Zhiguo",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X15011056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15011056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26271831/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.07.101,48
596610,Best-practice IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulin use in patients with sepsis,2020-10-07,"INTRODUCTION: Initiating treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) traditionally relies on in-person visits with trained therapists to provide hands-on instruction regarding CPAP usage and mask fit. To overcome geographic barriers and reduce COVID-19 transmission, health systems increasingly rely on remote set-ups of mailed equipment. Despite a strong rationale for the mailed approach, relative effectiveness is unclear. METHODS: Our VA medical center shifted from in-person to mailed CPAP dispensation during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Using VA administrative and wireless CPAP usage data, we assembled a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who initiated CPAP for the first time from July 2019 to August 2020. Our primary outcome was mean nightly usage over the first 90 days. We compared patients with in-person vs. mailed CPAP dispensation using generalized linear models adjusted for age, gender, race, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Among patients with >1 hour of overall usage, we compared secondary outcomes of leak, apnea hypopnea index (AHI), and obstructive/central apnea indices. RESULTS: We identified 693 patients with newly diagnosed OSA whose CPAP was provided in-person and 296 who had CPAP mailed. Nightly usage in the first 90 days was modest in both groups (in-person: 149.7, mailed: 152.9 min/night), and we did not detect a difference in adjusted models (+7.6 min/night, 95%CI -13.6–28.8). We also did not detect a difference in 95th percentile leak (-1.2 liter/minute, 95%CI -3.3-0.9). Device-detected AHI was relatively low overall (in-person: 3.2, mailed: 4.1 events/hour), but was greater in the mailout group (+1.0/hour, 95%CI 0.2–1.7). AHI differences appeared to be driven by obstructive (+0.5/hour, 95%CI 0.2–0.8) but not central events (-0.1, 95% CI -0.2–0.4). Risk of AHI>5 was comparable between groups (in-person: 17.3%, mailed: 19.0%, OR 1.2, 95%CI 0.8–1.7). CONCLUSION: We were able to switch from an in-person to a mail-based system of CPAP initiation without a change in CPAP adherence or mask leak. While AHI was slightly greater in the mailed group, the clinical significance of this finding is unclear. Future work will need to evaluate the impact of remote CPAP dispensation on patient-centered outcomes.

Managing enormous health issues associated with such a mass gathering requires a very vibrant health delivery plan. Related research is part of the strategy. This study was done to assess the pattern of patients and illnesses encountered at one health facility at Arafat on the 2nd day of Hajj, when all the pilgrims move from Mina and stay in Arafat for a few hours. The objective of the study was to provide input so that recommendations can be given for future improvement of health care during this mass transit. METHODS: All patients reporting sick to the Nimra Hospital on the Day of Arafat were included and documented on a detailed Performa and analyzed. RESULTS: We received 211 patients, essentially all of those were in need of acute medical intervention. Acute severe asthma and injuries were the major problems encountered. There were two deaths both related to heat stroke. Patients received were predominantly Arabic speaking. CONCLUSIONS: Only those needing acute intervention seek medical advice during transit.

600177,ICU outcomes of COVID-19 critically ill patients: an international comparative study,2020-07-03,"COVID-19 has resulted in a pandemic after its first appearance in a pneumonia patient in China in early December 2019. As per WHO, this global outbreak of novel COVID-19 has resulted in 28,329,790 laboratory-confirmed cases and 911,877 deaths which have been reported from 210 countries as on 12(th) Sep 2020. The major symptoms at the beginning of COVID-19 are fever (98%), tussis (76%), sore throat (17%), rhinorrhea (2%), chest pain (2%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%). Furthermore, acute respiratory distress syndrome (61.1%), cardiac dysrhythmia (44.4%), shock (30.6%), hemoptysis (5%), stroke (5%), acute cardiac injury (12%), acute kidney injury (36.6%), dermatological symptoms with maculopapular exanthema (36.1%), and death can occur in severe cases. Even though human coronavirus (CoV) is mainly responsible for the infections of the respiratory tract, some studies have shown CoV (in case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) to possess potential to spread to extra-pulmonary organs including the nervous system as well as gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Patients infected with COVID-19 have also shown symptoms associated with neurological and enteric infection like disorders related to smell/taste, loss of appetite, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, and pain in the abdomen. In the present review, we attempt to evaluate the understanding of basic mechanisms involved in clinical manifestations of COVID-19, mainly focusing on interaction of COVID-19 with gut-brain axis. This review combines both biological characteristics of the virus and its clinical manifestations in order to comprehend an insight into the fundamental potential mechanisms of COVID-19 virus infection, and thus endorse in the advancement of prophylactic and treatment strategies.","Shinu, Pottathil; Morsy, Mohamed A.; Deb, Pran Kishore; Nair, Anroop B.; Goyal, Manoj; Shah, Jigar; Kotta, Sabna",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33415126/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2020.606779,48

RAS-I (hazard ratio (HR)= 0.499, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.325–0.767) and ARB (HR = 0.410, 95% CI 0.240–0.700) use was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality among patients with COVID-19. For patients with hypertension, RAS-I and ARB applications were also associated with a reduced risk of mortality with HR of 0.352 (95% CI 0.162–0.764) and 0.279 (95% CI 0.115–0.677), respectively. RAS-I exhibited protective effects on the survival outcome of COVID-19. ARB use was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality among patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Huai-yu; Peng, Suyuan; Ye, Zhanghui; Li, Pengfei; Li, Qing; Shi, Xuanyu; Zeng, Rui; Yao, Ying; He, Fan; Li, Junhua; Liu, Liu; Ge, Shuwang; Ke, Xianjun; Zhou, Zhibin; Xu, Gang; Zhao, Ming-hui; Wang, Haibo; Zhang, Luxia; Dong, Erdan",Front Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34241787/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-021-0850-9,48
609545,Ethical considerations in the allocation of critical care resources when capacity is overwhelmed,2020-03-30,"Gene therapy is now an effective approach to treat many forms of retinal degeneration. Delivery agents that are cell-specific, allow for multiple dosing regimens, and have low immunogenicity are needed to expand the utility of gene therapy for the retina. We generated eight novel lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) ranging in size from 50 nm to 150 nm by changing the PEG content from 5% to 0.5%, respectively. Subretinal injections of LNP-mRNA encoding luciferase revealed that 0.5% PEG content within nanoparticles elicits the highest expression. Similar injections of LNP delivered cre mRNA into Ai9 mice revealed cell-specific protein expression in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), confirmed by fundus photography and immunohistochemistry of whole globe cross-sections. To investigate mechanisms of LNP delivery to the eye, we injected mCherry mRNA using the subretinal approach in apoE(-/-) and Mertk(-/-) mice. RPE transfection was observed in both mouse models suggesting that LNP intracellular delivery is not solely dependent on apolipoprotein adsorption or phagocytosis. To investigate LNP penetration, particles were delivered to the vitreous chamber via an intravitreal injection. The 0.5% PEG particles mediated the highest luciferase activity and expression was observed in the Müller glia, the optic nerve head and the trabecular meshwork, but failed to reach the RPE. Overall, particles containing less PEG (~150 nm in size) mediated the highest expression in the eye. Thus far, these particles successfully transfect RPE, Müller cells, the optic nerve head and the trabecular meshwork based on route of administration which can expand the utility of LNP-mediated gene therapies for the eye.","Ryals, Renee C.; Patel, Siddharth; Acosta, Chris; McKinney, Madison; Pennesi, Mark E.; Sahay, Gaurav",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119640/,48

Although more than one year has passed, effective treatments for COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses have not yet been developed. Therefore, the development of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors is an urgent priority. Given that the Mpro sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 are 100% identical in the catalytic domain for protein cleavage, the viral main protease (Mpro) is one of the most extensive drug targets in all the drug targets being investigated for SARS-CoV-2. To provide scientific researchers with timely anti-SARS-CoV drug development information for Mpro, we focus on the past and current drug design and development strategies for MPro in this review. We believe that this review will provide meaningful guidance for the design and development of innovative drugs against COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses in the future.","Yang, Huihui Yang Jinfei",MedChemComm,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1md00066g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355175/,48

POCT development has seldom been guided by explicitly identified clinical need and requirements of the intended users. Approaches for identifying POCT priorities and developing target product profiles (TPPs) for POCTs in primary medical care are not well developed, and there is no published TPP for a CA-LRTI POCT aimed at developed countries. METHODS: We conducted workshops with expert stakeholders and a survey with primary care clinicians to produce a target product profile (TPP) to guide the development of a clinically relevant and technologically feasible POCT for CA-LRTI. RESULTS: Participants with clinical, academic, industrial, technological and basic scientific backgrounds contributed to four expert workshops, and 45 practicing primary care clinicians responded to an online survey and prioritised community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as the CA-LRTI where a new POCT was most urgently needed. Consensus was reached on a TPP document that included information on the intended niche in the clinical pathway in primary medical care; diagnostic product specification (intended use statement and test concept), and minimum and ideal user specifications. Clinicians minimum requirements of a CA-LRTI POCT included the use of minimally invasive samples, a result in less than 30 minutes, no more than a single preparation step, minimum operational requirements, and detection of common respiratory pathogens and their resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This multidisciplinary, multistage partnership approach generated a clinically-driven TPP for guiding the development of a new POCT, and this approach as well as the TPP itself may be useful to others developing a new POCT.","Gal, Micaela; Francis, Nicholas A.; Hood, Kerenza; Villacian, Jorge; Goossens, Herman; Watkins, Angela; Butler, Christopher C.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30067760/,48
616316,A virologic survey of patients admitted to a critical care unit for acute cardiorespiratory failure,2005-11-19,"IMPORTANCE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to treatment delays for many patients with cancer. While published guidelines provide suggestions on which cases are appropriate for treatment delay, there are no good quantitative estimates on the association of delays with tumor control or risk of new metastases. OBJECTIVES: To develop a simplified mathematical model of tumor growth, control, and new metastases for cancers with varying doubling times and metastatic potential and to estimate tumor control probability (TCP) and metastases risk as a function of treatment delay interval. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical model describes a quantitative model for 3 tumors (ie, head and neck, colorectal, and non–small cell lung cancers). Using accepted ranges of tumor doubling times and metastatic development from the clinical literature from 2001 to 2020, estimates of tumor growth, TCP, and new metastases were analyzed for various treatment delay intervals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk estimates for potential decreases in local TCP and increases in new metastases with each interval of treatment delay. RESULTS: For fast-growing head and neck tumors with a 2-month treatment delay, there was an estimated 4.8% (95% CI, 3.4%-6.4%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 0.49% (0.47%-0.51%) increase in new distal metastases risk. A 6-month delay was associated with an estimated 21.3% (13.4-30.4) increase in local tumor control risk and a 6.0% (5.2-6.8) increase in distal metastases risk. For intermediate-growing colorectal tumors, there was a 2.1% (0.7%-3.5%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 2.7% (2.6%-2.8%) increase in distal metastases risk at 2 months and a 7.6% (2.2%-14.2%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 24.7% (21.9%-27.8%) increase in distal metastases risk at 6 months. For slower-growing lung tumors, there was a 1.2% (0.0%-2.8%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 0.19% (0.18%-0.20%) increase in distal metastases risk at 2 months, and a 4.3% (0.0%-10.6%) increase in local tumor control risk and a 1.9% (1.6%-2.2%) increase in distal metastases risk at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study proposed a model to quantify the association of treatment delays with local tumor control and risk of new metastases. The detrimental associations were greatest for tumors with faster rates of proliferation and metastasis. The associations were smaller, but still substantial, for slower-growing tumors.","Ng, John; Stovezky, Yael R.; Brenner, David J.; Formenti, Silvia C.; Shuryak, Igor",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.34065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33502482/,48

The full immersion of physicians into their scientific education and medical training makes it challenging to also comprehensively learn about personal finance. With the vast debt that most medical students undergo, it is crucial to focus on this issue. Methodology To address this challenge, faculty at The Florida State University College of Medicine (FSU COM) have created a fully online personal finance elective course for fourth-year medical students. This course, titled Personal Finance for the New Physician, focuses on critical fiscal topics that are directly relevant to future doctors. The elective is delivered remotely through the utilization of online discussion boards, weekly video conferences, and recorded lectures by financial experts. This innovative distribution model ensures that busy students can educate themselves regardless of time or location. Results Initially offered in January of 2019, Personal Finance for the New Physician quickly became the most chosen elective at FSU COM. To determine the course’s efficacy, students completed a questionnaire at both the start and end of the elective. The results show substantial improvements in fiscal knowledge and confidence in managing personal finances. The average financial competence score of those who completed the course increased from a 2.25/5 to a 4.45/5. Feedback from students so far has been exceedingly positive. Conclusions Personal Finance for the New Physician has been effective at addressing the lack of financial knowledge that is prevalent among medical students. Additionally, the unique online nature of this course would allow for realistic expansion to other medical programs. Course directors will continue to receive feedback from students, financial experts, and physicians to modify and improve the elective.","Grewal, Kabir; Sweeney, Michael J",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34277201/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15579,48

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine anti-TB drug resistance and compare the discordance between phenotypic and genotypic drug-susceptibility testing (DST). METHODS: Prospective enrollment and sputum collection from patients suspected of active pulmonary TB from May 2018 to December 2019 at the University of Gondar Hospital. Phenotypic DST study for streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol was done by MGIT 360 SIRE Kit. Genotypic resistance for isoniazid and rifampin was performed by MTBDRplus v2 line probe assay (LPA) and compared to phenotypic drug resistance. RESULTS: A total of 376 patients, median age 32 years, and 53.7% male were enrolled. Mtb was isolated from 126 patients. 106/126 (84%) patients were newly diagnosed with TB and 20 patients with prior TB treatment. Seventy (66.0%) were susceptible to all anti‐TB drugs tested. Twenty-five (19.8%) of the isolates were resistant to isoniazid, 12 (9.5%) to rifampicin and six (5%) were multidrug resistant. Among previously treated TB patients, 4 (20.0%) and 5 (25.0%) were mono-resistant and poly-resistant, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of LPA resistance for isoniazid were 94.4% and 100%, and for rifampin was 75.0% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The frequency of mono- and poly-drug resistance among both newly diagnosed and previously treated TB patients was high to the rest of the nation. MTBDRplus showed excellent concordance for isoniazid and rifampin. We concluded that DST should be performed for all patients to improve management and decrease spread of drug-resistant Mtb strains in the community.","Yigzaw, Wubet Birhan; Torrelles, Jordi B; Wang, Shu-Hua; Tessema, Belay",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33603414/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s292058,48
619296,The World Federation: Enhancing Global Critical Care Practice and Performance,2006-08-05,"[Image: see text] Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters human cells upon binding of its spike (S) glycoproteins to ACE2 receptors. Several nanobodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection by binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, but how their binding antagonizes S-ACE2 interactions is not well understood. Here, we identified interactions between the RBD and nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 by performing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. H11-H4 and H11-D4 can bind to RBD without overlapping with ACE2. H11-H4, and to a lesser extent H11-D4, binding dislocates ACE2 from its binding site due to electrostatic repulsion. In comparison, Ty1 overlaps with ACE2 on RBD and has a similar binding strength to ACE2. Mutations in the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 had a minor effect in RBD binding strengths of ACE2 and nanobodies, but reduced the ability of H11-H4 and H11-D4 to dislocate ACE2 from RBD. In comparison, the Beta variant weakened the RBD binding strengths of H11-H4 and H11-D4, which were less effective to dislocate ACE2 binding. Unexpectedly, mutations in Beta strengthened Ty1 binding to RBD, suggesting that this nanobody may be more effective to neutralize the Beta variant of SARS-CoV-2.","Golcuk, Mert; Hacisuleyman, Aysima; Erman, Burak; Yildiz, Ahmet; Gur, Mert",J Chem Inf Model,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34581563/,48

Troubleshooting Problems in the Ventilated Patient,2020-06-29,"and accurate prediction of clean energy can supply an important reference for governments to formulate social and economic development policies. This paper begins with the logistic equation which is the whitening equation of the Verhulst model, introduces the Riccati equation with constant coefficients to optimize the whitening equation, and establishes a grey prediction model (CCRGM(1,1)) based on the Riccati equation. This model organically combines the characteristics of the grey model, and flexibly improves the modelling precision. Furthermore, the nonlinear term is optimized by the simulated annealing algorithm. To illustrate the validation of the new model, two kinds of clean energy consumption in the actual area are selected as the research objects. Compared with six other grey prediction models, CCRGM(1,1) model has the highest accuracy in simulation and prediction. Finally, this model is used to predict the nuclear and hydroelectricity energy consumption in North America from 2019 to 2028. The results predict that nuclear energy consumption will keep rising in the next decade, while hydroelectricity energy consumption will rise to a peak and subsequently fall back, which offers important information for the governments of North America to formulate energy measures.","Luo, Xilin; Duan, Huiming; He, Leiyuhang",Energy (Oxf),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544220311920?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360544220311920; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.118085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32546893/,48
625235,Intensive Care Unit Preparedness During Pandemics and Other Biological Threats,2019-07-12,"Recent cases of emergent diseases have renewed interest in the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that promote parasite adaptation to novel hosts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Crucial to adaptation is the degree of mixing of original, susceptible hosts, and novel hosts. An increase in the frequency of the original host has two opposing effects on adaptation: an increase in the supply of mutant pathogens with improved performance on the novel host 7, 8, 9; and reduced selection to infect novel hosts, caused by fitness costs commonly observed to be associated with host switching 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. The probability of disease emergence will therefore peak at intermediate frequencies of the original host. We tested these predictions by following the evolution of a virus grown under a range of different frequencies of susceptible (original) and resistant (novel) host bacteria. Viruses that evolved to infect resistant hosts were only detected when susceptible hosts were at frequencies between 0.1% and 1%. Subsequent experiments supported the predictions that there was reduced selection and mutation supply at higher and lower frequencies, respectively. These results suggest that adaptation to novel hosts can occur only under very specific ecological conditions, and that small changes in contact rates between host species might help to mitigate disease emergence.","Benmayor, Rebecca; Hodgson, David J.; Perron, Gabriel G.; Buckling, Angus",Curr Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19375316/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209008276; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960982209008276,48

Design The study is a descriptive transversal, where was performed in the city of Caruaru, Pernambuco state, within the period of 20/02/2020 to 05/05/2020. It was considered all official reports for flu syndromes notified by municipality health department and the data collected through the participatory surveillance platform Brasil Sem Corona. Methods To verify a correlation between Participatory Surveillance (PS) and Traditional Surveillance (TS), it was carried out a linear regression. Results The PS has showed in Caruaru 861 active users, presenting an average of 1.2 report per user per week. It was started in March 20th and is officially used by the local health authority in order to improve the quality of information from traditional surveillance system. Regarding to the respiratory syndrome cases from TS, it was found out 1,588 individuals that were positive for this clinical outcome. The spatial scanning analysis has detected 18 clusters and 6 of them have presented statistical significance (p-value < 0.1). Clusters 3 and 4 presented an overlapping and this area was chosen by local authority to deploy the Covid-19 serology, where 50 individuals were tested. From there, 32% (n=16) presented reagent results for antibodies related to Covid-19. Conclusion The use of alternative methods as participatory surveillance showed a relevant role taking advantage on the insertion at community levels to complement traditional surveillance system.","Leal Neto, O.

To this end, pools of tracheal and cloacal swabs from European quail (Coturnix Coturnix) and intestinal tract from pheasants (Phasianus Colchicus) and partridge (Perdix Perdix) flocks, with or without enteric signs, were collected during 2015. Avian coronavirus (Gammacoronavirus) was detected in quail not vaccinated against Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and in pheasants vaccinated with an IBV Massachusetts serotype. Based on DNA sequences for the gene encoding the S protein, the avian coronaviruses detected in the quail and pheasant are related to the IBV 793B and Massachusetts types, respectively. However, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) analyses showed the susceptibility of quail also to Deltacoronaviruses, suggesting that quail and pheasant avian coronaviruses share spike genes identical to chicken IBV spike genes and quail might host Deltacoronavirus.","Torres, C.

METHODS: Surgical techniques were performed ex vivo using the electrosurgical device, scalpel, and mechanized drill on the muscle and bone of commercially available chicken. The liquid and gas dynamics were observed using a high-speed high-resolution Photron SA5 camera (0.125 to 8 ms temporal resolution, 0.016 to 0.054 mm/pixel spatial resolution) and stroboscopic lighting (Veritas 120 E LED Constellation). The analysis was performed using in-house algorithms and ImageJ software. RESULTS: The use of a mechanized drill at 35000 rpm and a 3 mm fluted burr generated aerosol with particle size 50 to 550 microns with a spread of 1.8 m radius. Surgical smoke was generated by an electrosurgical device in both cutting and coagulation modes. Dispersion of the smoke could be controlled significantly by the use of suction, mean smoke spread ratio being 0.065 without suction and 0.002 with use of suction within 2 cm. CONCLUSION: The quantification of the aerosol generation will help surgeons take practical decisions in their surgical techniques in the pandemic era.","Gupta, Roshmi; Pandey, Khushboo; Thomas, Rwituja; Basu, Saptarshi; Shetty, Bhujang; Shetty, Rohit; Roy, Abhijit Sinha",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_2859_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595513/,48

636848,Oxygen administration for patients with ARDS,2021-02-06,"BACKGROUND: Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a preferred vector for recombinant vaccine construction. Previously, we generated a TK&gE-deleted PRV (PRV(Δ)(TK&gE−AH02)) based on a virulent PRV AH02LA strain. It was shown to be safe for 1-day-old piglets with maternal PRV antibodies and 4 ~ 5 week-old PRV antibody negative piglets and provide rapid and 100 % protection in weaned pigs against lethal challenge with the PRV variant strain. It suggests that PRV(TK&gE−AH02) may be a promising live vaccine vector for construction of recombinant vaccine in pigs. However, insertion site, as a main factor, may affect foreign gene expression. RESULTS: In this study, we constructed four recombinant PRV-S bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) carrying the same spike (S) expression cassette of a variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain in different noncoding regions (UL11-10, UL35-36, UL46-27 or US2-1) from AH02LA BAC with TK, gE and gI deletion. The successful expression of S gene (UL11-10, UL35-36 and UL46-27) in recombinant viruses was confirmed by virus rescue, PCR, real-time PCR and indirect immunofluorescence. We observed higher S gene mRNA expression level in swine testicular cells infected with PRV-S(UL11-10)ΔTK/gE and PRV-S(UL35-36)ΔTK/gE compared to that of PRV-S(UL46-27)ΔTK/gE at 6 h post infection (P < 0.05). Moreover, at 12 h post infection, cells infected with PRV-S(UL11-10)ΔTK/gE exhibited higher S gene mRNA expression than those infected with PRV-S(UL35-36)ΔTK/gE (P = 0.097) and PRV-S(UL46-27)ΔTK/gE (P < 0.05). Recovered vectored mutant PRV-S (UL11-10, UL35-36 and UL46-27) exhibited similar growth kinetics to the parental virus (PRV(Δ)(TK&gE−AH02)). CONCLUSIONS: This study focuses on identification of suitable sites for insertion of foreign genes in PRV genome, which laids a foundation for future development of recombinant PRV vaccines.","Zhang, Chuanjian; Guo, Shiqi; Guo, Rongli; Chen, Saisai; Zheng, Yating; Xu, Mengwei; Wang, Zhisheng; Liu, Yamei; Wang, Jichun",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980225/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02887-w,48
637692,Thirty years of career in Intensive Care Medicine,2021-02-08,"BACKGROUND: While the range of possible transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in various settings has been thoroughly investigated, recently most authorities acknowledged the role of aerosol spread in the transmission of the virus especially in indoor environments where the ventilation is poor. Engineering controls are needed to mitigate aerosol transmission in high risk settings including hospital wards, classrooms, and offices. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of aerosol filtration by portable air cleaning devices with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters used in addition to standard building heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC). METHODS: Test rooms, including a hospital single-patient room, were filled with test aerosol to simulate aerosol movement. Aerosol counts were measured over time with various portable air cleaning devices and room ventilation systems to quantify the overall aerosol clearance rate. FINDINGS: Portable air cleaners were very effective in removing aerosols. In a small control room, the aerosols were cleared five times faster with portable air cleaners than the room with HVAC alone. A single bed hospital room equipped with an excellent ventilation rate (∼14 air changes per hour) can clear the aerosols in 20 minutes. However, with the addition of two air cleaners, the clearance time became three times faster. CONCLUSIONS: Inexpensive portable air cleaning devices should be considered for small and enclosed spaces in health care settings such as inpatient rooms and personal protective equipment donning/doffing stations. Portable air cleaners are particularly important where there is limited ability to reduce aerosol transmission with building HVAC ventilation.","Lee, Jung Hoon; Rounds, Max; McGain, Forbes; Schofield, Robyn; Skidmore, Grant; Wadlow, Imogen; Kevin, Kevin; Stevens, Ashley; Marshall, Caroline; Irving, Lou; Kainer, Marion; Buising, Kirsty; Monty, Jason",J Hosp Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670121003364?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34562547/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2021.09.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670121003364,48
638108,Use of an internet camera system in the neonatal intensive care unit: parental and nursing perspectives and its effects on stress,2021-01-28,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: In December 2019, the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan. Within two months, it had begun to spread around the world in what became an unprecedented pandemic. Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in a state of immunosuppression may be considered at risk for complications in the COVID-19 pandemic, although there is increasing evidence postulating a possible protective role of selective immunosuppression. One group of such immunosuppressants used in MS comprises the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) ocrelizumab and rituximab. Anti-CD20 mAbs bind to the surface of B cells, causing their depletion. We describe our experience in seven cases of patients with multiple sclerosis who have been affected by SARS-COV-2 (with a clinical/serological diagnosis or PCR diagnosis) and who were being treated with anti-CD20+ monoclonal antibodies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We review the development of patients during infection as well as the resolution of their clinical picture. We also analyze the serology status against SARS-CoV-2 after resolution of the infection. RESULTS: Although the severity of the clinical pictures was variable, patients' development was good. Not all patients, however, developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with anti-CD20+ have adequate resolution of COVID-19 despite the fact that the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in all cases. It is possible that the presence of humoral immunity is not always necessary fora good clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Meca-Lallana, Dra. Virginia; Aguirre, Dra.

638897,Almitrine as a non-ventilatory strategy to improve intrapulmonary shunt in COVID-19 patients,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Initial reports indicate a high incidence of abnormal liver tests and acute kidney injury (AKI) in the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). However, outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels at admission and their associations with AKI are not well understood. The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence of cytolysis at admission and its contribution to the development of AKI, severity of COVID-19 and outcomes. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of the register of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was performed (n=481). COVID-19 was defined as the laboratory-confirmed infection and/or presence of the typical computer tomography (CT) picture. We excluded patients with previously known liver disease, re-hospitalization, acute surgical pathology, single serum creatinine measurement during hospitalization. Abnormality in aminotransferases was deﬁned as ALT and/or AST >40 U/L. Definition of AKI was based on KDIGO criteria. P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: 462 patients were included (50.4% males, mean age 63±16 years, mean Charlson index 3±2.4, 67% with hypertension, 48% with obesity, 25% with diabetes mellitus). 26,4% (122) of patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU), 71,3% (87) of them were treated with mechanical ventilation. The median length of stay was 11 [9;15] days, in the ICU – 4 [2;9] days. 20% (92) of patients died. At admission 43% (200) of the patients had abnormal level of aminotransferases. Elevated AST was more common than ALT, (39% (178) vs 29% (132)). The median levels of AST and ALT at admission were 54.5[44;72] and 45.9[34;66] U/L in the group with cytolysis and 26[19;33] and 19[11;27] U/L in the group without it, respectively. The AKI incidence in the register was 24.8%. The 1(st) stage of AKI was observed in the majority of the patients (46% - 1(st) stage, 36% - 2(nd) stage, 18% - 3(rd) stage. Patients in ICU compared to non-ICU patients more often had AKI (50% vs 13%, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the group with AKI (54% vs 10% for patients with and without AKI development, respectively, p<0.001). Groups with and without aminotransferases elevation were similar in age, gender, presence of comorbidities, coagulation status, statins and frequency of antibiotic intake before admission. Increase in AST and/or ALT levels at admission showed no association with AKI severity. The higher incidence of elevated ALT or/and AST was observed in ICU compared with non-ICU patients (59% vs 37%, p<0.001). Patients with elevation of aminotransferases at admission compared to patients without it had more severe lung injury by CT scan (22.4% vs 18.6%, with 50-75% lung injury; 5.5% vs 0.4% with 75-90% lung injury, p=0.008 for the trend), higher ferritin (598[404;715] vs 391[189;587] µkg/l, p=0.03) and serum creatinine levels (91[78;118] vs 86[74;109] µmol/l, p=0.008), higher rate of AKI development (29% vs 18%, p=0.005) and in-hospital mortality (26% vs 15,4%, p=0.005). Elevated ALT and/or AST at admission were the independent predictors for the development of AKI (OR 1.87 95%CI 1.17-2.92, p=0.005) and in-hospital mortality (OR 1.89 95%CI 1.17-3.08, p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Syndrome of cytolysis is common among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Development of AKI and disease severity were associated with elevated levels of aminotransferases at admission, and are predictors for AKI development and in-hospital mortality in this population.","Khruleva, Yulia; Arisheva, Olga; Troitskaya, Elena; Efremovtseva, Marina; Kobalava, Zhanna",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab082.0023,48

METHODS: We performed systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase to identify articles reporting baseline imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. The quality of the articles was assessed using NIH quality assessment tool for case series studies. The pooled prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of imaging findings were calculated. RESULTS: Fifty-six studies (6007 patients, age, 2.1–70 years, 2887 females, 5762 CT, 396 radiographs,) were included. The mean interval between onset of symptoms and CT acquisition was 1–8 days. On CT, the pooled prevalence of ground glass opacities (GGO), GGO plus consolidation, and consolidation only was 66.9% (95% CI 60.8–72.4%), 44.9% (38.7–51.3%), and 32.1 (23.6–41.9%) respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of GGO on CT was 73% (71%–80%) and 61% (41%–78%), respectively. For GGO plus consolidation and consolidation only, the pooled sensitivities/ specificities were 58% (48%–68%)/ 58% (41%–73%) and 49% (20%–78%)/ 56% (30%–78%), respectively. The pooled prevalence of GGO and consolidation on chest radiograph was 38.7% (22.2%–58.3%) and 46.9% (29.7%–64.9%), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of radiographic findings could not be assessed due to small number of studies. CONCLUSION: GGO on CT has the highest diagnostic performance for COVID-19 pneumonia, followed by GGO plus consolidation and consolidation only. However, the moderate to low sensitivity and specificity suggest that CT should not be used as the primary tool for diagnosis. Chest radiographic abnormalities are seen half of the patients.","Garg, Mandeep; Gupta, Pankaj; Maralakunte, Muniraju; Kumar-M, Praveen; Sinha, Anindita; Kang, Mandeep; Agarwala, Ritesh; Sandhu, Manavjit Singha",Clin Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217674/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.11.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899707120304526?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899707120304526,48

Early events are considered to be a determinant of infection outcome. To investigate the dog's early immune response to L. chagasi, an in vitro priming system (PIV) using dog naïve PBMC was established. Until now, dog PIV immune response to L. chagasi has not been assessed. We co-cultivated PBMC primarily stimulated with L. chagasiin vitro with autologous infected macrophages and found that IFN-γ mRNA is up-regulated in these cells compared to control unstimulated cells. IL-4 and IL-10 mRNA expression by L. chagasi-stimulated PBMC was similar to control unstimulated PBMC when incubated with infected macrophages. Surprisingly, correlation studies showed that a lower IFN-γ/IL-4 expression ratio correlated with a lower percentage of infection. We propose that the direct correlation between IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio and parasite load is dependent on the higher correlation of both IFN-γ and IL-4 expression with lower parasite infection. This PIV system was shown to be useful in evaluating the dog immune response to L. chagasi, and results indicate that a balance between IFN-γ and IL-4 is associated with control of parasite infection in vitro.","Rodrigues, Cleusa Alves Theodoro; Batista, Luís Fábio da Silva; Filho, Roberto Santos Teixeira; Santos, Claire da Silva; Pinheiro, Cristiane Garboggini; Almeida, Taís Fontoura de; Freitas, Luiz Antônio Rodrigues de; Veras, Patrícia Sampaio Tavares",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242708007149; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.10.324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19054575/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242708007149,48
640870,An overview of intensive care unit services in Nigeria.,2021-07-27,"Background and Aims COVID-19 is associated with hepatocellular liver injury of uncertain significance. We aimed to determine whether development of significant liver injury during hospitalization is related to concomitant medications or processes common in COVID-19 (e.g. ischemia, hyperinflammatory or hypercoagulable states) and to determine whether it can result in liver failure and death. Methods 834 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included. Clinical, medication and laboratory data were obtained at admission and throughout hospitalization using an identified database. Significant liver injury was defined as an AST≥ 5X ULN; ischemia was defined as vasopressor use for a minimum of 2 consecutive days; hyper-inflammatory state as hs-CRP ≥100mg/L and hypercoagulability as D-dimer ≥5mg/L, any time during hospitalization. Results 105 (12.6%) patients developed significant liver injury. Compared to those without significant liver injury, ischemia [OR 4.3 (2.5-7.4, p <0.0001)] and tocilizumab use [OR 3.6 (1.9-7.0, p=0.0001)] were independent predictors of significant liver injury. While AST correlated closely with ALT (R=0.89) throughout hospitalization, AST did not correlate with INR (R= 0.10) or with bilirubin (R=0.09). Death during hospitalization occurred in 136 (16.3%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that significant liver injury was not associated with death [OR 1.4 (0.8-2.6, p=0.2)], while ischemic [OR 2.4 (1.4-4.0, p=0.001)] hypercoagulable [OR 1.7 (1.1-2.6, p=0.02)], and hyperinflammatory [OR 1.9 (1.2-3.1, p=0.02)] disease states were significant predictors of death. Conclusions Liver test abnormalities known to be associated with COVID-19 are secondary to other insults, mostly ischemia or drug-induced liver injury, and do not lead to liver insufficiency or death.","Chew, Michael; Tang, Zeyu; Radcliffe, Christopher; Caruana, Dennis; Doilicho, Natty; Ciarleglio, Maria M.; Deng, Yanhong; Tsao, Guadalupe Garcia-",Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34004326/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542356521005255?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2021.05.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1542356521005255,48

Compared to conventional antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used as pharmacological molecules have particular physical characteristics and modes of action, and, therefore, they should be considered as a distinct therapeutic class. Despite being historically validated, antibodies may represent a novel tool for combatting infectious diseases. The current high cost of mAbs' production, storage and administration (by injection only) and the consequent obstacles to development are outweighed by mAbs' clinical advantages. These are related to a low toxicity combined with high specificity and versatility, which allows a specific antibody to mediate various biological effects, ranging from the virus neutralization mechanisms to the modulation of immune responses. This review briefly summarizes the recent technological advances in the field of immunoglobulin research, and the current status of mAb-based drugs in clinical trials for HIV and HCV diseases. For each clinical trial the available data are reported and the emerging conceptual problems of the employed mAbs are highlighted. This overview helps to give a clear picture of the efficacy and challenges of the mAbs in the field of these two infectious diseases which have such a global impact.","Flego, Michela; Ascione, Alessandro; Cianfriglia, Maurizio; Vella, Stefano",BMC Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23289632/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-11-4,48

They mostly cause enteric or respiratory disease, which can be severe and life threatening, e.g., in the case of the zoonotic coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in humans. Despite the economic and societal impact of such coronavirus infections, and the likelihood of future outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses, our options to prevent or treat coronavirus infections remain very limited. This highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of these viruses and their interactions with the host. Compared to other +RNA viruses, coronaviruses have an exceptionally large genome and employ a complex genome expression strategy. Next to a role in basic virus replication or virus assembly, many of the coronavirus proteins expressed in the infected cell contribute to the coronavirus-host interplay. For example, by interacting with the host cell to create an optimal environment for coronavirus replication, by altering host gene expression or by counteracting the host’s antiviral defenses. These coronavirus–host interactions are key to viral pathogenesis and will ultimately determine the outcome of infection. Due to the complexity of the coronavirus proteome and replication cycle, our knowledge of host factors involved in coronavirus replication is still in an early stage compared to what is known for some other +RNA viruses. This review summarizes our current understanding of coronavirus–host interactions at the level of the infected cell, with special attention for the assembly and function of the viral RNA-synthesising machinery and the evasion of cellular innate immune responses.","de Wilde, Adriaan H.; Snijder, Eric J.; Kikkert, Marjolein; van Hemert, Martijn J.",Roles of Host Gene and Non-coding RNA Expression in Virus Infection,https://doi.org/10.1007/82_2017_25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28643204/,48

656415,Procalcitonin (in COVID-19): The Incessant Quest,2021-01-11,"BACKGROUND: Autonomic dysregulation may lead to blunted sympathetic reactivity in chronic pain states. Autonomic responses are controlled by the central autonomic network (CAN). Little research has examined sympathetic reactivity and associations with brain CAN structures in the presence of chronic pain; thus, the present study aims to investigate how chronic pain influences sympathetic reactivity and associations with CAN brain region volumes. METHODS: Sympathetic reactivity was measured as change in skin conductance level (ΔSCL) between a resting reference period and walking periods for typical and complex walking tasks (obstacle and dual-task). Participants included 31 people with (n = 19) and without (n = 12) chronic musculoskeletal pain. Structural 3 T MRI was used to determine gray matter volume associations with ΔSCL in regions of the CAN (i.e., brainstem, amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex). RESULTS: ΔSCL varied across walking tasks (main effect p = 0.036), with lower ΔSCL in chronic pain participants compared to controls across trials 2 and 3 under the obstacle walking condition. ΔSCL during typical walking was associated with multiple CAN gray matter volumes, including brainstem, bilateral insula, amygdala, and right caudal anterior cingulate cortex (p’s < 0.05). The difference in ΔSCL from typical-to-obstacle walking were associated with volumes of the midbrain segment of the brainstem and anterior segment of the circular sulcus of the insula (p’s < 0.05), with no other significant associations. The difference in ΔSCL from typical-to-dual task walking was associated with the bilateral caudal anterior cingulate cortex, and left rostral cingulate cortex (p’s < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sympathetic reactivity is blunted during typical and complex walking tasks in persons with chronic pain. Additionally, blunted sympathetic reactivity is associated with CAN brain structure, with direction of association dependent on brain region. These results support the idea that chronic pain may negatively impact typical autonomic responses needed for walking performance via its potential impact on the brain.","Yeater, Taylor D.; Clark, David J.; Hoyos, Lorraine; Valdes-Hernandez, Pedro A.; Peraza, Julio A.; Allen, Kyle D.; Cruz-Almeida, Yenisel",Chronic Stress (Thousand Oaks),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34286166/; https://doi.org/10.1177/24705470211030273,48

661445,Necrotizing enterocolitis,2011-12-20,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 can cause severe acute respiratory failure requiring management in intensive care unit with invasive ventilation and a 40% mortality rate. Cardiovascular manifestations are common and studies have shown an increase in right ventricular (RV) dysfunction associated with mortality. These studies, however, comprise heterogeneous patient groups with few requiring invasive ventilation. This study will investigate the prevalence and prognostic significance of RV dysfunction in ventilated patients with COVID-19 which may lead to targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective multicentre observational cohort study will perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in 150 patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive ventilation for more than 48 hours. RV dysfunction will be defined as TTE evidence of RV dilatation along with the presence of septal flattening. Baseline demographics, disease severity data and clinical information relating to proposed aetiological mechanisms of RV dysfunction (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disordered coagulation, direct myocardial injury and ventilation) will be collected and analysed. Primary outcome measures include the prevalence of RV dysfunction and its association with 30-day mortality. Exploratory outcome measures will investigate the association of the proposed aetiological mechanisms of RV dysfunction to the primary outcomes. Prevalence of RV dysfunction will be determined along with 95% Clopper-Pearson CIs and 30-day survival will be analysed using logistic regression adjusting for patient demographics, phase of disease and baseline severity of illness. The role of potential aetiological factors (ARDS, disordered coagulation, direct myocardial injury and ventilation) in relation to the primary outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval was gained from Scotland A Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 20/SS/0059). Findings will be disseminated by various methods including webinars, international presentations and publication in peer-reviewed journals.","Willder, Jennifer Mary; McCall, Philip; Messow, Claudia-Martina; Gillies, Mike; Berry, Colin; Shelley, Benjamin",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33441361/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042098,48

665171,Treating hypoxemic COVID-19 “ARDS” patients with almitrine: The earlier the better?,2020-07-09,"This paper proposes a generic scheme VaCoChain, that fuses blockchain (BC) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) underlying fifth-generation (5G) communication services for timely vaccine distribution during novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and future pandemics. The scheme offers 5G-tactile internet (5G-TI)-based services for UAV communication networks (UAVCN) monitored through ground controller stations (GCs). 5G-TI enabled UAVCN supports real-time dense connectivity at ultra-low round-trip time (RTT) latency of < 1 and high availability of 99.9999%. Thus, it can support resilient vaccine distributions in a phased manner at government-designated nodal centers (NCs) with reduced round trip delays from vaccine production warehouses (VPW). Further, UAVCNs ensure minimizes human intervention and controls vaccine health conditions due to shorter trip times. Once vaccines are supplied at NCs warehouses, then the BC ensures timestamped documentation of vaccinated persons with chronology, auditability, and transparency of supply-chain checkpoints from VPW to NCs. Through smart contracts (SCs), priority groups can be formed for vaccination based on age, healthcare workers, and general commodities. In the simulation, for UAV efficacy, we have compared the scheme against fourth-generation (4G)-assisted long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channels, and traditional logistics for round-trip time (RTT) latency, logistics, and communication costs. In the BC setup, we have compared the scheme against the existing 5G-TI delivery scheme (Gupta et al.) for processing latency, packet losses, and transaction time. For example, in communication costs, the proposed scheme achieves an average improvement of 9.13 for block meta-information. For 4000 transactions, the proposed scheme has a communication latency of 16s compared to 36s. The packet loss is significantly reduced to 2.5% using 5G-TI compared to 16% in 4G-LTE-A. The proposed scheme has a computation cost of 1.6 ms and a communication cost of 157 bytes, which indicates the proposed scheme efficacy against conventional approaches.","Verma, Ashwin; Bhattacharya, Pronaya; Zuhair, Mohammad; Tanwar, Sudeep; Kumar, Neeraj",IEEE j. biomed. health inform.

This study identifies comorbidities that predict death among a large sample of COVID-19 patients from Nigeria. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of medical records for 2184 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Lagos, southwest Nigeria. Extracted data included age, sex, severity of condition at presentation and self-reported comorbidities. The outcomes of interest were death or discharge from facility. RESULTS: Most of the cases were male (65.8%) and the median age was 43 years (IQR: 33–55). Four hundred and ninety-two patients (22.5%) had at least one comorbidity and the most common amongst them were hypertension (74.2%) and diabetes (30.3%). The mortality rate was 3.3% and a significantly higher proportion of patients with comorbidities died compared to those with none. The comorbidities that predicted death were hypertension (OR: 2.21, 95%CI: 1.22–4.01), diabetes (OR: 3.69, 95% CI: 1.99–6.85), renal disease (OR: 12.53, 95%CI: 1.97–79.56), cancer (OR: 14.12, 95% CI: 2.03–98.19) and HIV (OR: 1.77–84.15].

670222,Interleukin-9 promotes intestinal barrier injury of sepsis: a translational research,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND: Due to the overlapping clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza, parallels are often drawn between the two diseases. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are at a higher risk for severe manifestations of both illnesses. Considering the high transmission rate of COVID-19 and with the seasonal influenza approaching in late 2020, the dual epidemics of COVID-19 and influenza pose serious cardiovascular implications. This review highlights the similarities and differences between influenza and COVID-19 and the potential risks associated with coincident pandemics. MAIN BODY: COVID-19 has a higher mortality compared to influenza with case fatality rate almost 15 times more than that of influenza. Additionally, a significantly increased risk of adverse outcomes has been noted in patients with CVD, with ~ 15 to 70% of COVID-19 related deaths having an underlying CVD. The critical care need have ranged from 5 to 79% of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19, a proportion substantially higher than with influenza. Similarly, the frequency of vascular thrombosis including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is markedly higher in COVID-19 patients compared with influenza in which vascular complications are rarely seen. Unexpectedly, while peak influenza season is associated with increased cardiovascular hospitalizations, a decrease of ~ 50% in cardiovascular hospitalizations has been observed since the first diagnosed case of COVID-19, owing in part to deferred care. CONCLUSION: In the coming months, increasing efforts towards evaluating new interventions will be vital to curb COVID-19, especially as peak influenza season approaches. Currently, not enough data exist regarding co-infection of COVID-19 with influenza or how it would progress clinically, though it may cause a significant burden on an already struggling health care system. Until an effective COVID-19 vaccination is available, high coverage of influenza vaccination should be of utmost priority.","Khan, Muhammad Shahzeb; Shahid, Izza; Anker, Stefan D.; Solomon, Scott D.; Vardeny, Orly; Michos, Erin D.; Fonarow, Gregg C.; Butler, Javed",BMC Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01816-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33334360/,48

In some patients, the resulting hyperinflammation resembles a cytokine release syndrome. Our knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 is evolving and anti-cytokine therapies are under active investigation. This narrative review summarizes existing knowledge of the immune response to coronavirus infection and highlights the current and potential future roles of therapeutic strategies to combat the hyperinflammatory response of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DATA SOURCES: Relevant and up-to-date literature, media reports, and author experiences were included from Medline, national newspapers, and public clinical trial databases. STUDY SELECTION: The authors selected studies for inclusion by consensus. DATA EXTRACTION: The authors reviewed each study and selected approrpriate data for inclusion through consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: Hyperinflammation, reminiscent of cytokine release syndromes such as macrophage activation syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, appears to drive outcomes among adults with severe coronavirus disease 2019. Cytokines, particularly interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, appear to contribute importantly to such systemic hyperinflammation. Ongoing clinical trials will determine the efficacy and safety of anti-cytokine therapies in coronavirus disease 2019.

The majority of infected children had a normal leukocyte count, while the most common white blood cell abnormality was leukopenia. Lymphopenia, which may be a marker of severe disease, was rarer in children than in adults, possibly due to their immature immune system or due to the less severe manifestation of COVID‐19 in this age group. Age may have an impact, and in neonates and infants the most common abnormality was lymphocytosis. Abnormalities of red blood cells and platelets were uncommon.

METHODS: We compared relevant time metrics between patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) before and after the declared restrictions and state of emergency imposed in our region (March 17, 2020). RESULTS: We identified a significant increase in the median door-to-CT times for patients receiving intravenous tPA (19 min, interquartile range (IQR): 14–27 min vs. 13 min, IQR: 9–17 min, p = 0.008) and/or EVT (20 min, IQR: 15–33 min vs. 11 min, IQR: 5–20 min, p = 0.035) after the start of social and healthcare restrictions in our region compared to the previous 12 months.

680254,Ten diseases you need to know if you want to be a critical care specialist in Hong Kong,2014-05-14,"Background Comorbid conditions, including solid and hematologic malignancies, may impact risk of contracting SARS CoV-2 or having severe COVID-19. Data specific to individual cancer types is essential to differentiate impact of patient, disease, and therapy specific factors on risk and outcomes, as the pandemic remains uncontrolled. Goal The primary goal of the CANDID study was to rapidly collect and analyze information on COVID-19 cases among CML pts to define prognosis, risk factors and outcome. Defining risk and predisposing features in CML patients could guide interventions, therapy modifications, and clinical management for patients and physicians. Methods From March 12, 2020, the iCMLf sent an anonymized case collection form to its global network of physicians treating CML pts and partner organizations. Forms were reviewed and cases tracked by an iCMLf data manager. Updates were provided weekly. Only confirmed cases or those with high level of suspicion were collected. Denominators regarding affected cohort (% tested, % affected in CML population) were not available in most instances. Results As of July 1, 2020, 110 cases of COVID-19 were reported to iCMLf from 20 countries: 61% from Europe, 15% from Asia, 12% from South America, 10% from North America, 2% from Africa and 1% from Oceania. COVID-19 was diagnosed by PCR and/or serology in 93 pts (85%) and clinically suspected in 17 pts (15%). Forty-six physicians reported 91 of the CML pts with COVID-19 out of a total of 12,236 CML pts that they were following (0.7%). Median age at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis was 54 years (range: 18-89) and 55% of pts were males. Median time from CML diagnosis to COVID-19 was 7 years (range: 0-25). CML treatment at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis consisted of hydroxyurea in 1 pt (1%) and TKI in 77 (70%). Five (5%) pts were taking bosutinib, 12 (11%) dasatinib, 39 (36%) imatinib, 17 (16%), nilotinib, 2 (2%) ponatinib, 1 (1%) HQP1315 and 1 pt (1%) was treated with an unknown TKI. Eighteen (16%) pts were untreated at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, 8 due to elective treatment discontinuation (TFR) and 10 for other reasons (toxicity (5), stem cell transplantation (1), unknown (1) and newly diagnosed CML (3)). CML treatment information was lacking at the time of cut-off in 14 cases (13%). Thirty-three (30%) cases were reported as having interrupted TKI therapy during COVID-19. From 110 reports COVID-19 was asymptomatic in 8 cases (7%). In the 102 symptomatic pts (93%), COVID-19 was considered as mild (no hospitalization) in 49 cases (45%), moderate (hospitalization) in 19 cases (17%), severe (intensive care) in 19 cases (17%) and of unknown severity in 15 cases (14%). At the data cut-off date, COVID-19 was still active in 14 pts (13%) and outcome was unknown in 9 pts (8%). Among the 87 others, outcome was favorable in 75 pts (86%) and fatal in 12 (14%). We analyzed overall survival in the 87 patients with known outcome according to sex, age, CML duration, type of CML treatment, line of TKI therapy, history of smoking, comorbidities, TKI interruption due to COVID-19, administration of any treatment against COVID-19 (antimicrobial agents, steroids, oxygen or anti-IL-6 antibodies) and economic status of country. Univariate analysis identified older age (75 vs < 75 years; mortality rate: 60% vs 7%, p<0.001), severity of COVID-19 (severe v non-severe; mortality 63% vs 0%, p<0.001) and imatinib treatment (mortality: imatinib 25% vs 2nd gen TKI 3% vs no TKI 0%, p=0.003) as predictors for COVID-19 mortality (Figure 1). Notably, 25% of imatinib treated patients were over 75years old, compared to none of the patients treated with second generation TKI. Conclusion The CANDID study represents the largest global cohort study to date characterizing COVID-19 in CML. Currently, the mortality rate from COVID-19 in evaluable CML patients is 13.7%. Factors associated with a higher mortality rate are age and imatinib therapy. Imatinib may represent a confounder as opposed to a true adverse prognostic predictor given the strong link between imatinib treatment and advanced age. Further case reports and longer follow up are needed to better ascertain independent risk factors, the impact of COVID-19, and the possible role that TKI type may play in this population.

Once new cases are no longer detected over consecutive days, the probability of elimination is an important measure for informing decisions on when certain COVID-19 restrictions should be relaxed. Our model of COVID-19 spread in New Zealand estimates that after 2-3 weeks of no new reported cases, there is a 95% probability that COVID-19 has been eliminated. We assessed the sensitivity of this estimate to varying model parameters, in particular to different likelihoods of detection of clinical cases and different levels of control effectiveness. Under an optimistic scenario with high detection of clinical cases, a 95% probability of elimination is achieved after 10 consecutive days with no new reported cases, while under a more pessimistic scenario with low case detection it is achieved after 22 days.","Binny, Rachelle N; Hendy, Shaun C; James, Alex; Lustig, Audrey; Plank, Michael J; Steyn, Nicholas",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.10.20172361; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.10.20172361v1?rss=1,48

682727,"The SARS‐CoV‐2 epidemic, a step towards recognizing the speciality of critical care nursing in France",2021-01-15,"Background Obesity has been associated with more severe clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, this association can be affected by many correlates of these traits. Due to its large impact on human health, socioeconomic status (SES) could at least partially influence the association between obesity and COVID-19 severity. To estimate the independent effect of traits related to body size and SES on the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study analyzing the effect of obesity-related anthropometric traits on COVID-19 outcomes. Methods Applying two-sample MR approaches, we evaluated the effects of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference, (HIP) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) studied in up to 234,069 participants from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium with respect to three COVID-19 outcomes: severe respiratory COVID-19 (5,101 cases vs. 1,383,241 controls), hospitalized COVID-19 (9,986 cases vs. 1,877,672 controls), and COVID-19 infection (38,984 cases vs. 1,644,784 controls) obtained from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI). Finally, to test the effect of SES using multivariable MR methods, we analyzed genetic data related to self-reported household income (HI) information from 286,301 UK Biobank (UKB) participants. Results BMI and WC were associated with severe respiratory COVID-19 (BMI: OR = 1.68 p = 0.0004; WC: OR = 1.72, p = 0.007) and COVID-19 hospitalization (BMI: OR= 1.62, p = 1.35e-06; WC: OR = 1.62, p = 0.0001). Also, HIP influenced hospitalized COVID-19 (OR = 1.31, p = 0.012) and COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.18, p = 0.002). Conversely, HI was associated with lower odds of severe respiratory COVID-19 (OR = 0.57, p = 0.011) and hospitalized COVID-19 (OR = 0.71, p = 0.045). Testing these effects in multivariable MR models, we observed that the effect of these obesity-related anthropometric traits on COVID-19 outcomes is not independent of SES effect assessed as HI. Conclusions Our findings indicate that low SES is a contributor to the observed association between body size and COVID-19 outcomes.","Cabrera Mendoza, B.; Wendt, F.; Pathak, G.

683960,Do Intensive Care Data on Respiratory Infections Reflect Influenza Epidemics?,2013-12-31,"Background: Socioeconomic factors may impact the efficiency of COVID vaccine rollout; however, there are limited studies that examine how state socioeconomic status influences the speed of vaccine distribution. This study aimed to demonstrate how employment rates as one of the main socioeconomic factors affect vaccine coverage in 50 states of the United States. Methods: This study has obtained vaccine data for the 50 states in the United States, available in the electronic online database ourworldindata.org. In addition to employment rates, other socioeconomic determinants including poverty level, uninsured rates, population density, homeownership, educational level, the percentage of the elderly population, and educational level were obtained from ourworldindata.org data platform. Data from these 50 states were used for regression analyses to examine the relationship between socioeconomic and vaccination rates. Results: Our study revealed a positive linear association between unemployment and vaccine rates, and states with higher unemployment rates were more likely to have higher vaccination rates. However, other socioeconomic measures do not significantly associate with vaccine coverage. Conclusion: Despite other studies showing that vulnerable populations had lower vaccine rates, this study shows that states with higher unemployment rates are more likely to be vaccinated. However, the finding suggests a need for more research for the states with higher than 5% unemployment rates, as they had a lower vaccine coverage than states with a range of 4% to 5% unemployment rates.","Roghani, A.; Panahi, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.17.21255668; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.17.21255668v1?rss=1,48
684774,Current and evolving standards of care for patients with ARDS,2020-11-06,"The object of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of four commercially available IgM tests in the diagnosis of measles virus (MeV) primary infection and cases with a serological profile indicating reinfection. Sera from 187 patients with MeV primary infection, 30 patients with suspected reinfection (after vaccine failure), and 153 patients with rash-like symptoms after exclusion of MeV infection were retested with four IgM tests. MeV infection was verified by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and primary and suspected reinfections were differentiated by IgG avidity and neutralization assays. All IgM assays displayed significant agreement (Cohen’s κ, ≥0.604; all P < 0.001) and a higher diagnostic accuracy in primary infection than in suspected reinfection (indicated by high IgG avidity and significantly higher anti-MeV-IgG and neutralizing titers). In the overall cohort, the areas under the curve (AUC) were comparable among all tests, ranging from 0.875 to 0.931, with ranges increasing to 0.911 to 0.930 in the primary infection and decreasing to 0.765 to 0.940 in the setting of high anti-MeV-IgG avidity, and all tests displayed high specificity (81.1 to 92.2%). Of note, IgM tests with the highest diagnostic accuracy had discriminatory abilities not significantly different than PCR from serum. Although reinfections pose a challenge for IgM testing, IgM assays remain a cornerstone in the diagnosis of MeV infections. Especially in samples with a serological profile indicating reinfections, IgM tests displayed an equal or even superior diagnostic ability compared to PCR from serum.","Semmler, Georg; Aberle, Stephan Walter; Griebler, Hannah; Richter, Lukas; Schmid, Daniela; Stiasny, Karin; Holzmann, Heidemarie; Weseslindtner, Lukas",J Clin Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02047-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627321/,48

This retrospective comparative study aimed to characterize its impact on arthroplasty services in Hong Kong. METHODS: From January 1 to June 30, 2020, the patients of “COVID-19 cohort” underwent elective total hip or knee replacement in Hong Kong public hospitals. The cohort was compared to the “control cohort” during the same period in 2019. Data analysis was performed to compare the two cohorts’ numbers of operations, hospital admission, orthopaedic clinic attendances, and waiting time. RESULTS: A total of 33,111 patient episodes were analyzed. During the study period, the elective arthroplasty operations and hospitalizations decreased by 53 and 54%, respectively (P < 0.05). Reductions were most drastic from February to April, with surgical volume declining by 86% (P < 0.05). The primary arthroplasty operations decreased by 91% (P < 0.05), while the revision operations remained similar. Nevertheless, 14 public hospitals continued performing elective arthroplasty for patients with semi-urgent indications, including infection, progressive bone loss, prosthesis loosening, dislocation or mechanical failure of arthroplasty, and tumor. At the institution with the highest arthroplasty surgical volume, infection (28%) was the primary reason for surgery, followed by prosthesis loosening (22%) and progressive bone loss (17%). The orthopaedic clinic attendances also decreased by 20% (P < 0.05). Increases were observed in waiting time and the total number of patients on the waiting list for elective arthroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the challenges, public hospitals in Hong Kong managed to continue providing elective arthroplasty services for high-priority patients. Arthroplasty prioritization, infection control measures, and post-pandemic service planning can enhance hospital preparedness to mitigate the impact of current and future pandemics.","Lee, Lok Sze; Chan, Ping Keung; Fung, Wing Chiu; Cheung, Amy; Chan, Vincent Wai Kwan; Cheung, Man Hong; Fu, Henry; Yan, Chun Hoi; Chiu, Kwong Yuen",Arthroplasty,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42836-021-00093-5,48

Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or affects a broad array of proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1,300 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9,900 proteins conserved across mammals. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained proteins from the cellular functions they hijack and that (ii) despite this high constraint, virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions. Our results demonstrate that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes.","Enard, David; Cai, Le; Gwenapp, Carina; Petrov, Dmitri A",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/029397,48
690453,Is Watching TV Series an Adaptive Coping Strategy During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Insights From an Italian Community Sample,2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological data indicate that minority groups, especially Hispanic communities, experience higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19. It is important to understand the nature of this health disparity and the socioeconomic or behavioral factors that are placing Hispanic communities and other minority populations at higher risk for morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to assess current COVID-19–related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among a predominantly Hispanic population from Orange County, California, and identify risk factors that may contribute to increased susceptibility and vulnerability to contracting SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Our Orange County–wide community survey consists of quantitative survey questions in four domains: demographic information, COVID-19 knowledge questions, COVID-19 attitude questions, and COVID-19 practices questions. The survey questions are adapted from recent global KAP studies. Participants are being recruited from Amistad Medical Clinic, a private primary health clinic group in Orange County that treats a predominantly Hispanic population. Patients recruited during telehealth visits are surveyed remotely by telephone, and those recruited during in-person clinic visits are surveyed in person. Surveys are conducted by trained members of the study team who are native to the community setting. RESULTS: As of October 12, 2020, we had recruited and enrolled 327 participants. Data collection occurred June 26th to October 30th. Data analysis is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Very few current COVID-19 studies focus on the perspective and experience of minority populations. Because Hispanic communities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, it is important to understand the factors the contribute to this disparity and the next steps that should be taken to reduce the COVID-19 burden in this population. We believe that our study model of partnering with a local clinic system that serves our study population can be expanded to other settings to compare COVID-19 KAP and associated factors within different minority communities.
