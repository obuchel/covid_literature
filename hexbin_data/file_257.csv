1024,Effectiveness of Integrated HIV Prevention Interventions among Chinese Men Who Have Sex with Men: Evaluation of a 16-City Public Health Program,2012-12-31,"To examine the impacts of a multi-city HIV prevention public health program (China Global Fund Round 5 Project) on condom use and HIV infection, we analyzed four yearly cross-sectional surveys from 2006 through 2009 among 20,843 men who have sex with men (MSM) in 16 Chinese cities. Self-reported condom use at last sex with a male partner increased from 58% in 2006 to 81% in 2009 (trend test, P<0.001). HIV prevalence increased from 2.3% in 2006 to 5.3% in 2009 (P<0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that self-reported receipt of interventions was an independent predictor of increased condom use at last sex with a male partner over time (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.63 in 2006 to 2.33 in 2009; P<0.001), and lower HIV prevalence (aOR, 1.08 in 2006 to 0.45 in 2009; P<0.001). HIV prevalence increased from 2006–2009 for participants with no self-reported receipt of interventions (2.1% in 2006 to 10.3% in 2009) and less so for those with interventions (2.4% to 4.7%). This Chinese public health program had positive impacts on both behaviors and disease rate among MSM population. Escalation of the coverage and intensity of effective interventions is needed for further increasing condom use and for reversing the rising trend of HIV epidemic.","Ye, Shaodong; Xiao, Yan; Jin, Canrui; Cassell, Holly; Blevins, Meridith; Sun, Jiangping; Vermund, Sten H.; Qian, Han-Zhu",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3534092/,257
1688,Accuracy of using automated methods for detecting adverse events from electronic health record data: a research protocol,2015-01-08,"BACKGROUND: Adverse events are associated with significant morbidity, mortality and cost in hospitalized patients. Measuring adverse events is necessary for quality improvement, but current detection methods are inaccurate, untimely and expensive. The advent of electronic health records and the development of automated methods for encoding and classifying electronic narrative data, such as natural language processing, offer an opportunity to identify potentially better methods. The objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of using automated methods for detecting three highly prevalent adverse events: a) hospital-acquired pneumonia, b) catheter-associated bloodstream infections, and c) in-hospital falls. METHODS/DESIGN: This validation study will be conducted at two large Canadian academic health centres: the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) and The Ottawa Hospital (TOH). The study population consists of all medical, surgical and intensive care unit patients admitted to these centres between 2008 and 2014. An automated detection algorithm will be developed and validated for each of the three adverse events using electronic data extracted from multiple clinical databases. A random sample of MUHC patients will be used to develop the automated detection algorithms (cohort 1, development set). The accuracy of these algorithms will be assessed using chart review as the reference standard. Then, receiver operating characteristic curves will be used to identify optimal cut points for each of the data sources. Multivariate logistic regression and the areas under curve (AUC) will be used to identify the optimal combination of data sources that maximize the accuracy of adverse event detection. The most accurate algorithms will then be validated on a second random sample of MUHC patients (cohort 1, validation set), and accuracy will be measured using chart review as the reference standard. The most accurate algorithms validated at the MUHC will then be applied to TOH data (cohort 2), and their accuracy will be assessed using a reference standard assessment of the medical chart. DISCUSSION: There is a need for more accurate, timely and efficient measures of adverse events in acute care hospitals. This is a critical requirement for evaluating the effectiveness of preventive interventions and for tracking progress in patient safety through time.","Rochefort, Christian M; Buckeridge, David L; Forster, Alan J",Implement Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296680/,257
4186,Factors that enable effective One Health collaborations - A scoping review of the literature,2019-12-04,"Advocates for a One Health approach recognize that global health challenges require multidisciplinary collaborative efforts. While past publications have looked at interdisciplinary competency training for collaboration, few have identified the factors and conditions that enable operational One Health. Through a scoping review of the literature, a multidisciplinary team of researchers analyzed peer-reviewed publications describing multisectoral collaborations around infectious disease-related health events. The review identified 12 factors that support successful One Health collaborations and a coordinated response to health events across three levels: two individual factors (education & training and prior experience & existing relationships), four organizational factors (organizational structures, culture, human resources and, communication), and six network factors (network structures, relationships, leadership, management, available & accessible resources, political environment). The researchers also identified the stage of collaboration during which these factors were most critical, further organizing into starting condition or process-based factors. The research found that publications on multisectoral collaboration for health events do not uniformly report on successes or challenges of collaboration and rarely identify outputs or outcomes of the collaborative process. This paper proposes a common language and framework to enable more uniform reporting, implementation, and evaluation of future One Health collaborations.","Errecaborde, Kaylee Myhre; Macy, Katelyn Wuebbolt; Pekol, Amy; Perez, Sol; O’Brien, Mary Katherine; Allen, Ian; Contadini, Francesca; Lee, Julia Yeri; Mumford, Elizabeth; Bender, Jeff B.; Pelican, Katharine",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6892547/,257
4346,Evaluating DREAMS HIV prevention interventions targeting adolescent girls and young women in high HIV prevalence districts in South Africa: protocol for a cross-sectional study,2020-01-16,"BACKGROUND: Young women in sub-Saharan Africa remain at the epicentre of the HIV epidemic, with surveillance data indicating persistent high levels of HIV incidence. In South Africa, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) account for a quarter of all new HIV infections. Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe (DREAMS) is a strategy introduced by the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) aimed at reducing HIV incidence among AGYW in 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa by 25% in the programme’s first year, and by 40% in the second year. This study will assess the change in HIV incidence and reduction in risk associated behaviours that can be attributed to the DREAMS initiative in South Africa, using a population-based cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data will be collected from a household-based representative sample of AGYW (between the ages 12–24 years) in four high prevalence districts (more than 10% of the population have HIV in these districts) in South Africa in which DREAMS has been implemented. A stratified cluster-based sampling approach will be used to select eligible participants for a cross-sectional survey with 18,500, to be conducted over 2017/2018. A questionnaire will be administered containing questions on sexual risk behaviour, selected academic and developmental milestones, prevalence of gender based violence, whilst examining exposure to DREAMS programmes. Biological samples, including two micro-containers of blood and self-collected vulvovaginal swab samples, are collected in each survey to test for HIV infection, HIV incidence, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy. This study will measure trends in population level HIV incidence using the Limiting antigen (LAg) Avidity Enzyme Immuno-Assay (EIA) and monitor changes in HIV incidence. DISCUSSION: Ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic by 2030 requires the continual monitoring and evaluation of prevention programmes, with the aim of optimising efforts and ensuring the achievement of epidemic control. This study will determine the impact DREAMS interventions have had on HIV incidence among AGYW in a ‘real world, non-trial setting’.","George, Gavin; Cawood, Cherie; Puren, Adrian; Khanyile, David; Gerritsen, Annette; Govender, Kaymarlin; Beckett, Sean; Glenshaw, Mary; Diallo, Karidia; Ayalew, Kassahun; Gibbs, Andrew; Reddy, Tarylee; Madurai, Lorna; Kufa-Chakezha, Tendesayi; Kharsany, Ayesha B.

11139,Loneliness in Old Age: An Unaddressed Health Problem,2020-01-16,"The donation of organs and tissues from neonates (birth to 28 days) for transplantation has been a relatively infrequent occurrence. Less common has been the use of neonatal organs and tissues for research. Specific ethical and legal questions beg for rational and transparent guidelines with which to evaluate referrals of potential donors. Donation of organs and tissues from a neonate can play a key role in the care and support provided to families by health care professionals around the time of a neonate’s death. We report on the recovery of neonatal organs and tissues for research. A working group made up of bioethicists, neonatologists, lawyers, obstetric practioners as well as organ procurement and tissue banking professionals evaluated legal, ethical and medical issues. Neonatal donor family members were also consulted. Our primary goals were (a) to ensure that referrals were made in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, regulations and institutional protocols, and (b) to follow acceptable ethical standards. Algorithms and policies designed to assist in the evaluation of potential neonatal donors were developed. Neonatal donation is proving increasingly valuable for research into areas including diabetes, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and neurological development, rheumatoid arthritis, autism, childhood psychiatric and neurologic disorders, treatment of MRSA infection and pediatric emergency resuscitation. The development of policies and procedures will assist medical professionals who wish to offer the option of donation to family members anticipating the death of a neonate.","Anderson, Martha; Youngner, Stuart; Smith, Regina Dunne; Nandyal, Raja R.; Orlowski, Jeffrey P.; Jessie Hill, B.; Barsman, Sarah Gutin",Cell Tissue Bank,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223177/,257
13712,Correction: Population genomic screening of all young adults in a health-care system: a cost-effectiveness analysis,2019-04-04,"Lakes receive large amounts of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (tDOM). However, little is known about how aquatic microbial communities interact with tDOM in lakes. Here, by performing microcosm experiments we investigated how microbial community responded to tDOM influx in six Tibetan lakes of different salinities (ranging from 1 to 358 g/l). In response to tDOM addition, microbial biomass increased while dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased. The amount of DOC decrease did not show any significant correlation with salinity. However, salinity influenced tDOM transformation, i.e., microbial communities from higher salinity lakes exhibited a stronger ability to utilize tDOM of high carbon numbers than those from lower salinity. Abundant taxa and copiotrophs were actively involved in tDOM transformation, suggesting their vital roles in lacustrine carbon cycle. Network analysis indicated that 66 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidia, Bacilli, Gammaproteobacteria, Halobacteria, Planctomycetacia, Rhodothermia, and Verrucomicrobiae) were associated with degradation of CHO compounds, while four bacterial OTUs (affiliated with Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Gammaproteobacteria) were highly associated with the degradation of CHOS compounds. Network analysis further revealed that tDOM transformation may be a synergestic process, involving cooperation among multiple species. In summary, our study provides new insights into a microbial role in transforming tDOM in saline lakes and has important implications for understanding the carbon cycle in aquatic environments.","Yang, Jian; Jiang, Hongchen; Liu, Wen; Huang, Liuqin; Huang, Jianrong; Wang, Beichen; Dong, Hailiang; Chu, Rosalie K.; Tolic, Nikola",ISME J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608266/,257

The Fc domain engages a wide spectrum of receptors on discrete cells of the immune system to trigger the clearance of viruses and subsequent killing of infected cells(1–4). Here we report that Fc engineering of anti-influenza IgG monoclonal antibodies for selective binding to the activating Fcγ receptor FcγRIIa results in enhanced ability to prevent or treat lethal viral respiratory infection in mice, with increased maturation of dendritic cells and the induction of protective CD8(+) T cell responses. These findings highlight the capacity for IgG antibodies to induce protective adaptive immunity to viral infection when they selectively activate a dendritic cell and T cell pathway, with important implications for the development of therapeutic antibodies with improved antiviral efficacy against viral respiratory pathogens.","Bournazos, Stylianos; Corti, Davide; Virgin, Herbert W.; Ravetch, Jeffrey V.",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7672690/,257

We analyzed clinical manifestations, laboratory data, diagnosis, and treatment strategies in three cases of C. perfringens sepsis in patients with acute leukemia. We also reviewed and analyzed the relevant literature, incorporating our findings into the discussion. All three patients developed septic shock with neutropenia following chemotherapy. Analysis of blood samples confirmed the presence of C. perfringens, and two patients had fulminant intravascular hemolysis and developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Two patients survived and one died despite timely and full-dose antibacterial treatments, blood purification, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Overall, our findings showed that C. perfringens sepsis is rare in patients with acute leukemia but progresses rapidly. A high mortality rate was observed, and patients often experienced refractory shock and intravascular hemolysis. This demonstrates the importance of early detection and diagnosis. Multimodal treatments, including fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, organ support, and blood purification, are essential for success.","Liu, Fuhong; Xue, Song; Zhang, Yongping; Yang, Jingxian; Hu, Jiajun; Li, Di; Ma, Xiaojun; Wang, Jingbo",Int J Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7776304/,257

Both approaches are in late stage development and provide motivation and rationale to invest into a global TB vaccine pipeline. This pipeline needs to be diverse to address TB-specific challenges including variation in target populations, uncertainties in animal model predictivity and lack of immune correlates of protection. It requires that individual vaccine candidates must be advanced rationally and that the global pipeline must be managed in the most nimble and resource-efficient way, especially in the current constrained funding environment. The TB Vaccine Development Pathway is a webtool which has been developed as an offer to the field to provide a source of information and guidance covering vaccine development from discovery to implementation. It is underpinned by generic and TB vaccine-specific guidelines, regulatory frameworks and best practice, and was compiled by a multi-disciplinary team of scientific and technical experts with the input of the TB vaccine community.

In the current study, we analyzed publicly available transcriptome data from 360 TNBC and 88 normal breast tissues, which revealed activation of nucleosome and cell cycle as the hallmarks of TNBC. Mechanistic network analysis identified activation of FOXM1 and ERBB2, and suppression of TP53 and NURP1 networks in TNBC. Employing Iterative Clustering and Guide-gene Selection (ICGS), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and dimensionality reduction analyses, we classified TNBC into seven molecular subtypes, each exhibiting a unique molecular signature, including immune infiltration (CD19, CD8, and macrophages) and mesenchymal signature, which correlated with variable disease outcomes in a larger cohort (1,070) of BC. Mechanistically, depletion of TTK, TPX2, UBE2C, CDCA7, MELK, NFE2L3, DDX39A, and LRP8 led to substantial inhibition of colony formation of TNBC models, which was further enhanced in the presence of paclitaxel. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular heterogeneity of TNBC and identified TTK, TPX2, UBE2C, and LRP8 as main drivers of TNBC tumorigenesis.","Elango, Ramesh; Vishnubalaji, Radhakrishnan; Shaath, Hibah; Alajez, Nehad M.",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7899947/,257

However, whether theaflavins, one type of the characteristic phytochemicals in black tea extracts, are involved in regulating aging and lifespan in consumers remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that theaflavins play a beneficial role in preventing age-onset intestinal leakage and dysbiosis, thus delaying aging in Drosophila. Mechanistically, theaflavins regulate the condensate assembly of Imd to negatively govern the overactivation of Imd signals in fruit fly intestines. In addition, theaflavins prevent DSS-induced colitis in mice, suggesting theaflavins play a role in modulating intestinal integrity.

17355,Abortion hotlines around the world: a mixed-methods systematic and descriptive review,2021-04-29,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by a high heterogeneity in patients’ disease course. Patients with bulbar onset of symptoms (b-ALS) have a poorer prognosis than patients with limb onset (l-ALS). However, neuroimaging correlates of the assumed biological difference between b-ALS and l-ALS may have been obfuscated by patients’ diversity in the disease course. We conducted Voxel-Based-Morphometry (VBM) and Tract-Based-Spatial-Statistics (TBSS) in a group of 76 ALS patients without clinically relevant cognitive deficits. The subgroups of 26 b-ALS and 52 l-ALS patients did not differ in terms of disease Phase or disease aggressiveness according to the D50 progression model. VBM analyses showed widespread ALS-related changes in grey and white matter, that were more pronounced for b-ALS. TBSS analyses revealed that b-ALS was predominantly characterized by frontal fractional anisotropy decreases. This demonstrates a higher degree of neurodegenerative burden for the group of b-ALS patients in comparison to l-ALS. Correspondingly, higher bulbar symptom burden was associated with right-temporal and inferior-frontal grey matter density decreases as well as fractional anisotropy decreases in inter-hemispheric and long association tracts. Contrasts between patients in Phase I and Phase II further revealed that b-ALS was characterized by an early cortical pathology and showed a spread only outside primary motor regions to frontal and temporal areas. In contrast, l-ALS showed ongoing structural integrity loss within primary motor-regions until Phase II. We therefore provide a strong rationale to treat both onset types of disease separately in ALS studies.","Steinbach, Robert; Prell, Tino; Gaur, Nayana; Roediger, Annekathrin; Gaser, Christian; Mayer, Thomas E.; Witte, Otto W.; Grosskreutz, Julian",Neuroimage Clin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8099783/,257

We sought to pilot the project, assessing the feasibility and acceptability by gathering preliminary data. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was piloted at 12 tertiary neurosurgical units in the United Kingdom. Feedback regarding project positives and challenges were qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 187 cases were included: 159 TSA (85%) and 28 EEA (15%). The most common diseases included pituitary adenomas (n = 142/187), craniopharyngiomas (n = 13/187). and skull base meningiomas (n = 4/187). The most common skull base repair techniques used were tissue glues (n = 132/187, most commonly Tisseel), grafts (n = 94/187, most commonly fat autograft or Spongostan) and vascularized flaps (n = 51/187, most commonly nasoseptal). These repairs were most frequently supported by nasal packs (n = 125/187) and lumbar drains (n = 20/187). Biochemically confirmed CSF rhinorrhea occurred in 6/159 patients undergoing TSA (3.8%) and 2/28 patients undergoing EEA (7.1%). Four patients undergoing TSA (2.5%) and 2 patients undergoing EEA (7.1%) required operative management for CSF rhinorrhea (CSF diversion or direct repair). Qualitative feedback was largely positive (themes included user-friendly and efficient data collection and strong support from senior team members), demonstrating acceptability.

Moreover, data are limited on the long-term stability of proteins and nucleic acids in lyophilized samples. Here, we offer lyophilization protocols for various rat and mouse tissues (kidney, heart, liver, lung, aorta, and skin) coupled with technical hints for optimal sample preparation. We demonstrate that lyophilized samples stored at 4 °C for 20 months can yield protein and RNA of similar quantity and quality to −80 °C storage, while phosphorylated proteins are preserved as well. Freeze-dried and subsequently pulverized samples can provide more consistent, more reliable data especially when investigating focal injuries, such as fibrosis. We developed a protocol for the concentration of biological solutions and achieved 20-times concentration in human peritoneal dialysis effluent solution which enables the previously unattainable detection of proteins in these samples. We established a method for water removal as well as accurate water content measurement of fecal samples, which can be valuable for gut metabolome analysis. Taken together, lyophilization is a valuable tool for the preservation of biological samples with many advantages.

However, few reports focus on pediatric TBI-associated coagulopathy. METHODS: We retrospectively identified children with Glasgow Coma Scale13 in a tertiary pediatric hospital from April 2012 to December 2019 to evaluate the impact of admission coagulopathy on their prognosis. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis using coagulation parameters was performed to stratify the death risk among patients. The importance of these parameters was examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 281 children with moderate to severe TBI were enrolled. A receiver operating characteristic curve showed that activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen were effective predictors of in-hospital mortality. According to the CART analysis, APTT of 39.2s was identified as the best discriminator, while 120mg/dL fibrinogen was the second split in the subgroup of APTT39.2s. Patients were stratified into three groups, in which mortality was as follows: 4.5% (APTT39.2s, fibrinogen>120mg/dL), 20.5% (APTT39.2s and fibrinogen120mg/dL) and 60.8% (APTT>39.2s). Furthermore, length-of-stay in the ICU and duration of mechanical ventilation were significantly prolonged in patients with deteriorated APTT or fibrinogen values. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that APTT>39.2s and fibrinogen120mg/dL was independently associated with mortality in children with moderate to severe TBI. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that admission APTT>39.2s and fibrinogen120mg/dL were independently associated with mortality in children with moderate to severe TBI.

19261,HPA-axis activity and the moderating effect of self-esteem in the context of intimate partner violence in Cameroon,2021-07-13,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV) is often applied in critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) to protect the airway from aspiration, and supplement more oxygen. MV may result in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in ICU patients. This study was to estimate the 90-day and 180-day mortalities of ICU patients with VAP, and to explore the influence of VAP on the outcomes of ICU patients. METHODS: Totally, 8182 patients who aged ≥18 years and received mechanical ventilation (MV) in ICU from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database were involved in this study. All subjects were divided into the VAP group (n = 537) and the non-VAP group (n = 7626) based on the occurrence of VAP. Clinical data of all participants were collected. The effect of VAP on the prognosis of ICU patients was explored by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The results delineated that the 90-day mortality of VAP patients in ICU was 33.33% and 180-day mortality was 37.62%. The 90-day and 180-day mortality rates were higher in the VAP group than in the non-VAP group. After adjusting the confounders including age, ethnicity, heart failure, septicemia, simplified acute physiology score II (SAPSII) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, serum lactate, white blood cell (WBC), length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, length of ventilation, antibiotic treatment, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), other pathogens, the risk of 90-day and 180-day mortalities in VAP patients were 1.465 times (OR = 1.465, 95%CI: 1.188–1.807, P < 0.001) and 1.635 times (OR = 1.635, 95%CI: 1.333–2.005, P < 0.001) higher than those in non-VAP patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that ICU patients with VAP had poorer prognosis than those without VAP.

The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the nutritional and respiratory counseling on postoperative quality of life. METHODS: At hospital discharge, patients were randomized into four groups receiving respectively: nutritional and respiratory counseling, nutritional counseling alone, respiratory counseling alone, or standard care. The main endpoint was the impairment in quality of life in the first month after surgery. Linear mixed effect models were estimated to assess mean score differences (MDs) in quality of life scores. RESULTS: Patients receiving nutritional counseling reported less appetite loss (MD − 17.7, 95% CI − 32.2 to −3.3) than those not receiving nutritional counseling at 1 month after surgery. Dyspnea was similar between patients receiving vs. those not receiving respiratory counseling (MD − 3.1, 95% CI − 10.8 to 4.6). Global quality of life was clinically similar between patients receiving vs. those not receiving nutritional counseling over time (MD 0.9, 95% CI − 5.5 to 7.3), as well as in patients receiving vs. those not receiving respiratory counseling over time (MD 0.7, 95% CI − 5.9 to 7.2). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive postoperative care does not affect global quality of life even if nutritional counseling reduced appetite loss.

Intratumoral hypoxia represents a major driving force in cancer progression, recurrence, metastasis, and decreased survival. Though multiple gene signatures reflect the complex cellular response to hypoxia have been established in several cancer types such as head and neck, breast, and lung cancers, the hypoxic panorama in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly understood. METHODS: A hypoxic signature constituted by a total of 356 genes, including canonical hypoxia-responsive ADM, ANGPTL4, CA9, and VEGFA, was established based on systemic literature search. A total of 1,730 CRC samples across four independent cohorts were used for nonnegative matrix factorization clustering and subtyping. Prognosis, molecular signatures, pathways, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were compared between the subtypes. RESULTS: CRCs mainly fell into two subgroups, one indicated as hypoxia and the other one designated as normoxia. Hypoxia was correlated with poor outcomes in CRC and will increase the risk of a subset of stage II patients to the level of normoxic stage III. Additionally, hypoxia was closely associated with activation of RAS signaling pathway independent of KRAS mutation. More M2 macrophage infiltration was another hypoxic marker indicated that subsets of patients with high M2 macrophages may benefit from macrophage-targeting therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings will facilitate the development of a hypoxia-oriented therapy strategy to enhance the treatment effect in the near future.","Qi, Lina; Chen, Jiani; Yang, Yanmei; Hu, Wangxiong",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7714992/,257

Heparin is a highly sulfated linear glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and is composed of alternating D-glucosamine and L-iduronic acid or D-glucuronic acid sugar residues. The interactions of heparin with various proteins in a domain-specific or charged-dependent manner provide key roles on many physiological and pathological processes. While GAG-PrP interactions had been previously reported, the specific glycan structures that facilitate interactions with different regions of PrP and their binding kinetics have not been systematically investigated. In this study, we performed direct binding surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay to characterize the kinetics of heparin binding to four recombinant murine PrP constructs including full length (M23–230), a deletion mutant lacking the four histidine-containing octapeptide repeats (M23–230 Δ59–90), the isolated N-terminal domain (M23–109), and the isolated C-terminal domain (M90–230). Additionally, we found the specific structural determinants required for GAG binding to the four PrP constructs with chemically defined derivatives of heparin and other GAGs by an SPR competition assay. Our findings may be instrumental in developing designer GAGs for specific targets within the PrP to fine-tune biological and pathophysiological activities of PrP.","Kim, So Young; Zhang, Fuming; Harris, David A.; Linhardt, Robert J.",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7726446/,257

The median mortality rate varies from 4 to 11%, but it is higher in patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). The objective of this study is to identify predictors of ICU admission in patients with LP. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective, observational study conducted in an academic tertiary-care hospital in Pisa, Italy. Adult patients with LP consecutively admitted to study center from October 2012 to October 2019. RESULTS: During the study period, 116 cases of LP were observed. The rate of ICU admission was 20.7% and the overall 30-day mortality rate was 12.1%. Mortality was 4.3% in patients hospitalized in medical wards versus 41.7% in patients transferred to ICU (p < 0.001). The majority of patients (74.1%) received levofloxacin as definitive therapy, followed by macrolides (16.4%), and combination of levofloxacin plus a macrolide (9.5%). In the multivariate analysis, diabetes (OR 8.28, CI 95% 2.11–35.52, p = 0.002), bilateral pneumonia (OR 10.1, CI 95% 2.74–37.27, p = 0.001), and cardiovascular events (OR 10.91, CI 95% 2.83–42.01, p = 0.001), were independently associated with ICU admission, while the receipt of macrolides/levofloxacin therapy within 24 h from admission was protective (OR 0.20, CI 95% 0.05–0.73, p = 0.01). Patients who received a late anti-Legionella antibiotic (> 24 h from admission) underwent urinary antigen test later compared to those who received early active antibiotic therapy (2 [2–4] vs. 1 [1–2] days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Admission to ICU carries significantly increased mortality in patients with diagnosis of LP. Initial therapy with an antibiotic active against Legionella (levofloxacin or macrolides) reduces the probability to be transferred to ICU and should be provided in all cases until Legionella etiology is excluded.","Falcone, Marco; Russo, Alessandro; Tiseo, Giusy; Cesaretti, Mario; Guarracino, Fabio; Menichetti, Francesco",Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734452/,257

45079,Factors associated with mental health of graduate nursing students in China,2021-01-22,"BACKGROUND: Early rehabilitation can reduce ventilation duration and improve functional outcomes in critically ill patients. Upper limb strength is associated with ventilator weaning. Passive muscle loading may preserve muscle fibre function, help recover peripheral muscle strength and improve longer term, post-hospital discharge function capacity. The physiological effects of initiating rehabilitation soon after physiological stabilisation of these patients can be concerning for clinicians. This study investigated the feasibility of measuring metabolic demand and the safety and feasibility of early upper limb passive ergometry. An additional comparison of results, achieved from simultaneous application of the methods, is reported. METHODS: This was an observational feasibility study undertaken in an acute teaching hospital’s General Intensive Care Unit in the United Kingdom. Twelve haemodynamically stable, mechanically ventilated patients underwent 30 minutes of arm ergometry. Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were monitored. A Friedman test identified changes in physiological parameters. A metabolic cart was attached to the ventilator to measure oxygen uptake. Oxygen uptake was concurrently calculated by the reverse Fick method, utilising cardiac output from the LiDCO™ and paired mixed venous and arterial samples. A comparison of the two methods was made. Data collection began 10 minutes before ergometry and continued to recovery. Paired mixed venous and arterial samples were taken every 10 minutes. RESULTS: Twelve patients were studied; 9 male, median age 55 years, range (27–82), median APACHE score 18.5, range (7–31), median fraction inspired oxygen 42.5%, range (28–60). Eight patients were receiving noradrenaline. Mean dose was 0.07 mcg/kg/min, range (0.01–0.15). Early ergometry was well tolerated. There were no clinically significant changes in respiratory, haemodynamic or metabolic variables pre ergometry to end recovery. There was no significant difference between the two methods of calculating VO(2) (p = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: We report the feasibility of using the reverse Fick method and indirect calorimetry to measure metabolic demand during early physical rehabilitation of critically ill patients. More research is needed to ascertain the most reliable method. Minimal change in metabolic demand supports the safety and feasibility of upper limb ergometry. These results will inform future study designs for further research into exercise response in critically ill patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov No. NCT04383171.

Latin America is a region that conserve a large number of indigenous communities relatively isolated that practice a traditional medicine without consumption of drugs. We hypothesized that rates of antibiotic resistance are lower in these communities. Recent progress in whole-genome sequencing has allowed the study of drug susceptibility by searching for the known mutations associated with antibiotic resistance. The aim of this work was to study trends of antibiotic resistance over a 20-year period in Mexican H. pylori strains and to compare susceptibility between strains from Mexican mestizos and from indigenous population; we also aimed to learn the prevalence of mutational patterns in genes gyrA, gyrB, rdxA, frxA, rpsU, omp11, dppA, and 23S rRNA and its association with phenotypic tests. Resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, amoxicillin and levofloxacin was determined in167 H. pylori isolates by E-test, and the occurrence of mutational patterns in specific genes was determined by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The trend of resistance over 20 years in mestizo isolates showed significant resistant increase for clarithromycin and levofloxacin to frequencies that banned its clinical use. Resistance in H. pylori isolates of native communities was lower for all antibiotics tested. Phenotypic resistance showed good to moderate correlation with genotypic tests. Genetic methods for characterizing antibiotic resistance require further validation in each population.","Camorlinga-Ponce, Margarita; Gómez-Delgado, Alejandro; Aguilar-Zamora, Emmanuel; Torres, Roberto C.; Giono-Cerezo, Silvia; Escobar-Ogaz, Antonio; Torres, Javier",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7905308/,257
46808,The importance of compassion and respectful care for the health workforce: a mixed-methods study,2021-03-11,"Financial cycles have sizeable economic effects, as witnessed during the 2008 financial crisis. However, despite the topic’s research importance, there is limited literature on how financial cycles and financial crises affect individual family firms. To the best of our knowledge, our study is among the first to measure the impact of financial cycles and crises on family firms. To study the impact of financial cycles on family firms, we use the Amadeus database on European companies. We identify family firms following the Global Family Business Index methodology 2019 (EY and the Center for Family Business of the University of St. Gallen). To measure the impact of financial cycles, we use the credit-to-GDP gap indicator from the Bank for International Settlements. Using the credit-to-GDP gap as a proxy for financial cycles, we use panel structural vector autoregression (Abrigo and Love 2016), Wald tests of Granger causality (Granger 1969), and impulse response functions (Lütkepohl 2010; Lütkepohl et al. 2015). We prove that family firms are less vulnerable than non-family firms to financial cycles during both financial booms and busts. Family firms perform better when financial cycle shocks have a less pronounced impact on firms’ performance. Non-family firms are highly vulnerable to financial cycles, performing worse during both booms and busts. The adoption of family firm management and governance policies should improve non-family firms’ performance and help the economy recover rapidly in times of crisis (exogenous shocks). Our study is the first to explore the impact of financial cycles on the micro level with a focus on family firms. The results could help managers and practitioners better form their business policy by looking at family firms’ experiences. Targeting economic policy more towards family firms in good and bad times will allow policymakers to prepare for future economic crises.","Škare, Marinko; Porada-Rochoń, Małgorzata",Int Entrep Manag J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7940449/,257

The recommended tool for diagnosing paediatric pneumonia is the interpretation of chest X-ray images, which is difficult to standardise and requires trained clinicians/radiologists. Current automated computational tools have primarily focused on assessing adult pneumonia and were trained on images evaluated by a single specialist. We aim to provide a computational tool using a deep-learning approach to diagnose paediatric pneumonia using X-ray images assessed by multiple specialists trained by the WHO expert X-ray image reading panel. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Approximately 10 000 paediatric chest X-ray images are currently being collected from an ongoing WHO-supported surveillance study in Bangladesh. Each image will be read by two trained clinicians/radiologists for the presence or absence of primary endpoint pneumonia (PEP) in each lung, as defined by the WHO. Images whose PEP labels are discordant in either lung will be reviewed by a third specialist and the final assignment will be made using a majority vote. Convolutional neural networks will be used for lung segmentation to align and scale the images to a reference, and for interpretation of the images for the presence of PEP. The model will be evaluated against an independently collected and labelled set of images from the WHO. The study outcome will be an automated method for the interpretation of chest radiographs for diagnosing paediatric pneumonia. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All study protocols were approved by the Ethical Review Committees of the Bangladesh Institute of Child Health, Bangladesh. The study sponsor deemed it unnecessary to attain ethical approval from the Academic and Clinical Central Office for Research and Development of University of Edinburgh, UK. The study uses existing X-ray images from an ongoing WHO-coordinated surveillance. All findings will be published in an open-access journal. All X-ray labels and statistical code will be made openly available.

Although there are many studies in the literature comparing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) values in patients who underwent IMV (invasive mechanical ventilation), there are no studies showing their interchangeable applicability in patients who received NIMV (non-IMV). We aimed to evaluate whether the use of ETCO2 in the treatment process can replace pCO2 use in patients scheduled for NIMV treatment in the emergency department. Patients who applied to the emergency department with respiratory distress between March 2019 and January 2020, who were diagnosed with acute cardiogenic edema or acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, and who needed NIMV were included in the study. General characteristics of the patients and the pCO2 and ETCO2 values were measured in the blood gas 1 h after the NIMV application was started. 64.2% (99 patients) of the patients included in the study were male, and 35.8% (55 patients) were female.

This paper empirically estimates an adjustment to conventional VSL measures to account for altruistic sentiments and concludes that conventional VSL measures are underestimated by a factor of two to three, suggesting we are greatly undervaluing life in regulatory reviews. This conclusion is attained by estimating the VSL multiplier suggested by Jones-Lee (Econ J 102(410):80–90, 1992), which hinges on assessing whether individuals are more health altruistic than wealth altruistic. The estimated VSL multiplier is greatest for policies that affect children’s mortality, as health altruism is dominant regarding children.

59811,[Mental Health Care Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic].,2020-05-01,"Neutrophils are vital for antimicrobial defense; however, their role during viral infection is less clear. Furthermore, the molecular regulation of neutrophil fate and function at the viral infected sites is largely elusive. Here we report that BCL6 deficiency in myeloid cells exhibited drastically enhanced host resistance to severe influenza A virus (IAV) infection. In contrast to the notion that BCL6 functions to suppress innate inflammation, we find that myeloid BCL6 deficiency diminished lung inflammation without affecting viral loads. Using a series of Cre-transgenic, reporter, and knockout mouse lines, we demonstrate that BCL6 deficiency in neutrophils, but not in monocytes or lung macrophages, attenuated host inflammation and morbidity following IAV infection. Mechanistically, BCL6 bound to the neutrophil gene loci involved in cellular apoptosis in cells specifically at the site of infection. As such, BCL6 disruption resulted in increased expression of apoptotic genes in neutrophils in the respiratory tract, but not in the circulation or bone marrow. Consequently, BCL6 deficiency promoted tissue neutrophil apoptosis. Partial neutrophil depletion led to diminished pulmonary inflammation and decreased host morbidity. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of BCL6 in modulating neutrophil apoptosis at the site of infection for the regulation of host disease development following viral infection. Furthermore, our studies indicate that tissue-specific regulation of neutrophil survival modulates host inflammation and tissue immunopathology during acute respiratory viral infection.","Zhu, Bibo; Zhang, Ruixuan; Li, Chaofan; Jiang, Li; Xiang, Min; Ye, Zhenqing; Kita, Hirohito; Melnick, Ari M; Dent, Alexander L; Sun, Jie",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1902310116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31138703/,257

OBJECTIVE To assess the diagnostic performance and potential clinical utility of an AI algorithm in a real-life telemedicine setting. METHODS Prospective, diagnostic accuracy study including consecutive patients who submitted images for teledermatology evaluation. The treating dermatologist chose a single image to upload to a web application during teleconsultation. A follow-up reader study including nine healthcare providers (3 dermatologists, 3 dermatology residents, 3 general practitioners) was performed. RESULTS A total of 340 cases from 281 patients met study inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) age of patients was 33.7 (17.5) years; 63% (n=177) were female. Exposure to the AI algorithm results was considered useful in 12% of visits (n=40) and the teledermatologist correctly modified the real-time diagnosis in 0.6% (n=2) of cases. The overall top-1 accuracy of the algorithm (41.2%) was lower than that of the dermatologists (60.1%), residents (57.8%) and general practitioners (49.3%) (all comparisons p<0.05, in the reader study). When the analysis was limited to the diagnoses on which the algorithm had been explicitly trained, the balanced top-1 accuracy of the algorithm (47.6%) was comparable to the dermatologists (49.7%) and residents (47.7%) but superior to the general practitioners (39.7%; p=0.049).

For example, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has been purported to increase false negative rates. This has significant implications given the extent of PPI prescriptions. AIM To evaluate FIT performance for the detection of colorectal neoplasm and the impact of PPI therapy on their diagnostic accuracy. METHODS Symptomatic patients referred on suspected cancer pathway and those on polyp surveillance between 2015 and 2019 were approached to participate. Accuracy estimates of FIT at different cut-off levels in diagnosing colorectal neoplasm were evaluated. Logistic regression was used to assess the effect of PPIs on FIT. RESULTS A total of 667 participants were eligible for final analysis. At cut-off of 10 μg/g faeces, the overall sensitivity and specificity of FIT for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) was 0.85 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.71 to 0.94) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.84), respectively. For the detection of advanced neoplasia, the sensitivity was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.79) and the specificity was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.86). At higher thresholds, the sensitivity steadily declines whilst specificity increases. PPI therapy did not have a significant effect in the performance of FIT. CONCLUSIONS FIT is a good rule-out test for the detection of CRC and advanced neoplasia at lower thresholds. PPI therapy does not appear to have an effect on its diagnostic performance.","Chandrapalan, Subashini; Hee, Siew Wan; Widlak, Monika M; Farrugia, Alexia; Alam, Mohammed T; Smith, Steve; Arasaradnam, Ramesh P",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33991166/,257

METHODS Systematic review of all existing studies comparing arm and leg BP measurements. A search strategy was designed in MEDLINE and adapted to be run across six further databases. Articles were deemed eligible for inclusion if they measured and reported arm and leg BP taken in the supine position and/or the difference between the two. Mean values for arm-leg BP difference and measures of precision [95% confidence intervals (CIs) or SD] were extracted and entered into a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS A total of 887 articles were screened and 44 were included in the descriptive analyses, including 9771 patients. In the general population, ankle SBP was 17.0 mmHg (95% CI 15.4-21.3 mmHg) higher than arm BP in the supine position. For DBP, there was no difference between arm and ankle BP (-0.3 mmHg, 95% CI -1.5-1.0 mmHg). In patients with vascular disease, SBP was -33.3 mmHg (95% CI -59.1 to -7.6 mmHg) lower in the ankle compared with the arm. CONCLUSION This is the first review to provide empirical data defining the difference between BP in the arm and leg in the general population. Findings suggest a diagnostic threshold of 155/90 mmHg could be used for diagnosing hypertension when only ankle measurements are available in routine practice.","Sheppard, James P; Albasri, Ali; Franssen, Marloes; Fletcher, Ben; Pealing, Louise; Roberts, Nia; Obeid, Amira; Pucci, Mark; McManus, Richard J; Martin, Una",Journal of hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000001958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30817444/,257

However, the risk of postradiosurgical radiation-related injury is higher in patients with large AVMs. Multistaged volumetric management of large AVMs was undertaken to limit the radiation exposure to the surrounding normal brain. This strategy offers a promising method for obtaining high AVM obliteration rates with minimal normal tissue damage. The use of embolization as an adjunctive method in the treatment of large AVMs remains controversial. Unfortunately, staged-volume radiosurgery (SVR) has a number of potential pitfalls that affect the outcome. The aim of this article is to highlight the role of SVR in the treatment of large AVMs, to discuss the outcome comparing it to other treatment modalities, and to discuss the potential improvement that could be introduced to this method of treatment.","AlKhalili, Kenan; Chalouhi, Nohra; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula; Rosenwasser, Robert; Jabbour, Pascal",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.6.focus14217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25175440/,257

Throat swab specimens from 242 adults admitted to hospital with CAP were tested. In total, 1 or more aetiological agents were identified by real-time PCR in 55 (23%) patients. The most frequently detected pathogens were coronavirus (17%), parainfluenza virus (6%) and influenza virus (4%). Overall, viral pathogens were identified by conventional techniques in 7 (2%) patients, and real-time PCR in 50 (21%) patients (p<0.0001). The diagnostic yield increased from 137 cases (57% of patients using conventional microbiological assays) to 158 cases (65% of patients using real-time PCR assays and conventional microbiological assays; p=0.06). A significantly higher percentage of mortality was present in patients with a mixed bacterial and viral infection. L. pneumophila PCR was positive in only 3 out of 11 cases (27%) of Legionnaires' disease (LD). This study demonstrates that real-time PCR can increase the number of microbiological detections of respiratory pathogens, mainly as a result of detection of respiratory viruses.","Diederen, Bram M W; Van Der Eerden, Menno M; Vlaspolder, Fer; Boersma, Wim G; Kluytmans, Jan A J W; Peeters, Marcel F",Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/00365540802448799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18821175/,257

Amino acid-based supramolecular polymer hydrogels, which boast intrinsic antibacterial activity, are an important solution due to their good biocompatibility, cost effectiveness, and tunable structural properties. Herein, we reported three types of transparent supramolecular hydrogel with intrinsic antibacterial activity from self-assembly of commercially available Fmoc-tryptophan (Fmoc-W), Fmoc-methionine (Fmoc-M), and Fmoc-tyrosine (Fmoc-Y). The resulting hydrogels selectively inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, the order of antibacterial activity was Fmoc-W hydrogel > Fmoc-M hydrogel > Fmoc-Y hydrogel. The critical aggregation concentration (CAC) values were found at concentrations of approximately 0.0293, 0.1172, and 0.4688 mM for Fmoc-W, Fmoc-M, and Fmoc-Y, respectively. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images revealed rigid and aligned nanofibers for Fmoc-W hydrogel, while flexible nanofibers for Fmoc-M hydrogel and Fmoc-Y hydrogel. The results indicated that stronger aggregation capability of the gelator and the synergistic nanostructural morphology with more rigid and aligned nanofibers can lead to higher antibacterial activity of its corresponding hydrogel. In addition, the molecular arrangements of Fmoc-amino acids in the hydrogels may also contribute to their antibacterial activity. These results can guide the rational design, fabrication, and future application of other self-assembled amino acid-based hydrogels with excellent antibacterial activity.","Xie, Yan-Yan; Zhang, Yan-Wen; Qin, Xiao-Tong; Liu, Ling-Pu; Wahid, Fazli; Zhong, Cheng; Jia, Shi-Ru","Colloids and surfaces.

The aim of this study was to define the indications for MILS and the learning curve in a high-volume hepatobiliary surgery Unit. Between 2009 and 2014, 993 liver resections were performed in our unit, and MILS was performed in 81 of these (8.2%). The proportion of MILS significantly increased over the study period of time and was significantly higher during the last 2 years than during the first 2 years (10.8 vs. 6.4%; p = 0.042).

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of hand-sewn end-to-side esophago-gastrostomy and side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis after esophagectomy for the aforementioned patients. METHODS This retrospective cohort study involved examining the medical records of 433 patients who underwent transhiatal esophagectomy for esophageal cancer from March 2010 to March 2016. All the patients were operated using end-to-side hand-sewn esophago-gastrostomy and side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. 409 of the patients received a year's worth of follow-up evaluations. All the cases were revisited in 2 weeks as well as in four, eight, and 12 months after surgery. The patients were assessed in terms of postoperative outcomes, including reflux symptoms, anastomotic leakage and stricture, and the need for anastomotic dilatation. RESULTS Hand-sewn anastomosis was carried out in 271 (62.5%) patients, whereas stapled anastomosis was performed in 162 (37.4%) patients. The mean operative times were 214.46 ± 84.33 min and 250.55 ± 43.31 min for the stapled and hand-sewn anastomosis groups, respectively (P = 0.028). The two groups showed no significant differences with respect to stays in intensive care units and hospitals. Postoperatively, 38 (14.67%) cases of anastomotic leakage were detected in the hand-sewn anastomosis group, with incidence being significantly higher than that in the stapled anastomosis group (8 cases or 5.33%; P = 0.002). Anastomotic stricture occurred less frequently in the patients who underwent stapled anastomosis (P = 0.004). Within the one-year follow-up period, the patients treated via hand-sewn anastomosis more frequently required anastomotic dilatation (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION Side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis may reduce operation times and decrease the rates of anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stricture, and anastomotic dilatation in patients with lower thoracic esophageal cancer undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy.","Rasihashemi, Seyed Ziaeddin; Ramouz, Ali; Beheshtirouy, Samad; Amini, Hassan",BMC gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12876-020-01393-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736599/,257

A cross-sectional study based on a web survey was conducted. The survey was sent to 123 physicians working at secondary care centres of Portugal and Spain, that participate in the INSPIRERS project. A total of 65 physicians completed the survey (53% response rate). They had a mean of 18 (11) years of clinical practice and 14% were residents. More than half were allergists (58%), 22% pulmonologists and 20% paediatricians. Most were working in Portugal (89%) and in public hospitals (88%). All were conducting consultations: 71% presential (median [p 25 ,75] duration 30 [20, 30] min), 91% telephonic (15 [10, 20] min) and 20% video consultations (20[10, 28]min).

From the physicians conducting video consultations, 92% were allergists and only 54% considered that their institution provided adequate conditions. The physicians of the INSPIRERS group used telephonic consultations as the main alternative to presential ones and 1/5 used video consultations. These results suggest the need to rethink clinical follow-up services for outpatients in the near future increasing the use of telemedicine, especially video consultations.","Jácome, C; Pereira, A M; Amaral, R; Alves-Correia, M; Almeida, R; Mendes, S; Almeida Fonseca, J; Inspirers, G",European annals of allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.23822/eurannaci.1764-1489.184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33354962/,257

Identifying patients who could benefit from evaluation and intervention can be challenging for referring providers and otolaryngologists alike. We aimed to develop and validate an accessible diagnostic tool to estimate the probability of AIFS. METHODS Retrospective chart review from 1999 to 2017 identified all patients evaluated for possible AIFS at a tertiary care center. AIFS was diagnosed by pathologic confirmation of fungal tissue angioinvasion. Stepwise selection and univariate logistic regression were used to screen risk factors for a multivariable predictive model. Model performance was assessed using Tukey's goodness-of-fit test and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Model coefficients were internally validated using bootstrapping with 1000 iterations. RESULTS A total of 283 patients (244 negative controls, 39 with AIFS) were included. Risk factors in our final diagnostic model included: fever ≥38°C (log-odds ratio [LOR] 1.72; 95% CI, 0.53 to 2.90), unilateral facial swelling, pain, or erythema (LOR 2.84; 95% CI, 1.46 to 4.23), involvement of the orbit or pterygopalatine fossa on imaging (LOR 3.02; 95% CI, 1.78 to 4.26), and mucosal necrosis seen on endoscopy (LOR 5.52; 95% CI, 3.81 to 7.24), with p < 0.01 for all factors. The model had adequate goodness of fit (p > 0.05) and discrimination (AUC = 0.96). CONCLUSION We present an internally validated diagnostic tool to stratify the risk for AIFS. The estimated risk may help determine which patients can be observed with serial nasal endoscopy, which ones could be biopsied, and which ones would benefit from immediate surgical intervention.","Yin, Linda X; Spillinger, Aviv; Lees, Katherine A; Bailey, Kent R; Choby, Garret; O'Brien, Erin K; Stokken, Janalee K",International forum of allergy & rhinology,https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.22635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668099/,257

Urine drug screens have been the most common method for analysis because of ease of sampling. The simplicity of use and access to rapid results have increased demand for and use of immunoassays; however, these assays are not perfect. False-positive results of immunoassays can lead to serious medical or social consequences if results are not confirmed by secondary analysis, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The Department of Health and Human Services' guidelines for the workplace require testing for the following 5 substances: amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine. This article discusses potential false-positive results and false-negative results that occur with immunoassays of these substances and with alcohol, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants.

Their grip strength has not, to our knowledge, been compared. This article compares a needle-free suture technique to a standard whip stitch by testing grip strength in vitro. METHODS Twelve uniform ovine flexor tendons were prepared; six tendons with a standard, non-locking whip stitch and six tendons with a grasping suture. All the samples were tested to failure in uniaxial tension in a materials testing machine. Load/displacement curves were generated, and qualitatively assessed and peak loads were compared. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the groups in tendon length or diameter. Modes of failure between the groups, as characterised by the load/displacement curves, were quite distinct. Peak load to failure was lower in the utility suture group (mean peak load at failure 121.28 N) than the whip stitch group (mean peak load to failure 188.82 N). All failures in the utility suture group occurred when the suture snapped. CONCLUSIONS The grasping suture described here is weaker than a standard whip stitch but may be sufficiently strong to harvest and handle tendon autograft. A standard whip stitch remains the choice for definitive graft fixation.","da Assunção, Ruy E; Haddad, Roger; Bruce, Warwick J M; Walker, Peter; Walsh, William R",European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00590-011-0931-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412415/,257

The purpose of this review is to provide the current known clinical characteristics of and management for COVID-19 as it relates to otolaryngology. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 is a highly transmissible respiratory disease with common presenting symptoms of fever, cough, and fatigue. In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral therapies, symptomatic and respiratory support is the current standard of therapy. Measures to prevent further transmission have been enacted globally including social distancing and cancellation of public events. Given elevated viral load in the upper aerodigestive tract, extra precautions in patients with otolaryngology needs have been recommended for protection of both healthcare workers and patients. SUMMARY Otolaryngologists face unique risk from COVID-19. Maintaining appropriate preventive health measures and remaining updated on institutional clinical guidelines is paramount for both caretaker safety and patient care.","Miller, Lauren E; Shaye, David A; Lee, Linda N",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/moo.0000000000000632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32628416/,257

The impact of menopausal age on UIAs and treatment outcomes with endovascular therapy has not been well studied. We hypothesized that premenopausal age may have a protective effect on presentation size and treatment outcomes. Objective To evaluate the association of menopause with UIA size and outcome with endovascular therapy. Methods Retrospective analysis of consecutive female patients with UIAs treated with endovascular therapy at our academic tertiary care center. UIA characteristics, complications, and outcomes were recorded and compared. Results 117 patients were included: 23 patients in the premenopausal age (PRM) group and 94 in the postmenopausal age (POM) group. 93.6% of all aneurysms in the PRM group were in the internal carotid artery (ICA) segments (p < 0.05). Hence only ICA segment aneurysms were further studied. A total of 21 patients in the PRM group and 60 in the POM group were found to have ICA segment aneurysms. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. The mean size of the aneurysms in the PRM group was 8.6 ± 3.9 versus 10.8 ± 5.6 mm in the POM group (p = 0.055). There was a trend to higher aneurysm neck size seen in the POM group (4.7 ± 2.5 vs. 3.7 ± 1.7 mm; p = 0.07). The number of aneurysm lobes was higher in the PRM group (1.23 ± 0.54 vs. 1.07 ± 0.31; p = 0.18). In multivariate analysis, the PRM group had a significantly higher number of UIA lobes. Complications and endovascular therapy outcomes were similar between the 2 groups. Conclusions A trend to increased UIA maximal diameter and neck size was seen in the POM group compared to the PRM group. The PRM group had a significantly higher number of UIA lobes. Larger prospective trials are needed to confirm these findings.","Dharmadhikari, Sushrut; Atchaneeyasakul, Kunakorn; Ambekar, Sudheer; Saini, Vasu; Haussen, Diogo C; Yavagal, Dileep",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000496701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32508892/,257

DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING Neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS Stable preterm infants transitioned from nCPAP to HFNC using a 1:1 pressure to flow ratio. INTERVENTIONS The electrical activity of the diaphragm was measured by transcutaneous electromyography (dEMG) from 30 min before until 3 hours after the transition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES At eight time points after the transition to HFNC, diaphragmatic activity was compared with the baseline on nCPAP. Percentage change in amplitudedEMG, peakdEMG and tonicdEMG were calculated. Furthermore, changes in respiratory rate, heart rate and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) were analysed. RESULTS Thirty-two preterm infants (mean gestational age: 28.1±2.2 weeks, mean birth weight: 1118±368 g) were included. Compared with nCPAP, the electrical activity of the diaphragm did not change during the first 3 hours on HFNC (median (IQR) change in amplitudedEMG at t=180 min: 2.81% (-21.51-14.10)). The respiratory rate, heart rate and FiO2 remained stable during the 3-hour measurement. CONCLUSIONS Neural respiratory drive and breathing effort assessed by electrical activity of the diaphragm is similar in the first 3 hours after transitioning stable preterm infants from nCPAP to HFNC with a 1:1 pressure-to-flow ratio.","de Waal, C G; Hutten, G J; Kraaijenga, J V; de Jongh, F H; van Kaam, A H",Archives of disease in childhood.

A scoping review of the literature in Atlantic Canada.,2021,"BACKGROUND Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a well-studied transdiagnostic risk construct that is believed to amplify responses to many forms of stress. The COVID-19 pandemic is a broad stressor with significant physical and social threats. In the current study, we were interested in ascertaining the degree to which AS would relate to distress and disability in the context of COVID-19. We hypothesized that AS would be associated with increased distress and disability. Moreover, we hypothesized that AS would be uniquely predictive while controlling for other relevant risk factors such as age, race, and perceived local COVID-19 infection rates. METHOD Participants (N = 249) were U.S. adults assessed using online data resourcing and re-assessed one month later. RESULTS At the first time point, during the beginning phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, AS was significantly related to COVID-19 distress and disability with a moderate effect size. AS was longitudinally associated with higher COVID-19 worry and depression. LIMITATIONS Our findings are limited by the use of a relatively small online sample. Additionally, assessment of pre-pandemic and post-pandemic symptoms and functioning would be beneficial for future research. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, the current study provided evidence consistent with AS as a causal risk factor for the development of distress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schmidt, Norman B; Morabito, Danielle M; Mathes, Brittany M; Martin, Alex",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153837/,257

Because of its strong contagiousness, rapid spread and great harm, it has already given countries around the world serious effects. So far there is no clear specific drug. Scientifically grasping the development law of epidemics is extremely important for preventing and controlling epidemics. Since the latent of this epidemic are also highly contagious, traditional infectious disease models cannot accurately describe the regularity of this epidemic transmission. Based on the traditional infectious disease model, an infectious disease model with a time delay is proposed. The time difference is used to characterize the cycle of viral infection and treatment time. Using the epidemic data released in real time, firstly, through the numerical simulation parameter inversion, the minimum error is obtained; then we simulate the development trend of the epidemic according to the dynamics system; finally, we compare and analyze the effectiveness of isolation measures. This article has simulated COVID-19 and analyzed the development of the epidemic in Beijing and Wuhan. By comparing the severity of the epidemic in the two regions, early detection and isolation are still the top priority of epidemic prevention and control.","Yang, Cong; Yang, Yali; Li, Zhiwei; Zhang, Lisheng",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2021008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525085/,257

The model of collective symbolic coping (CSC) describes four stages by which representations of a threatening event are elaborated in the mass media: awareness, divergence, convergence, and normalization. We used the CSC model to predict when symbolic in-group protection (othering) would occur in the case of the avian influenza (AI) outbreak. Two studies documented CSC stages and showed that othering occurred during the divergence stage, characterized by an uncertain symbolic environment. Study 1 analysed media coverage of AI over time, documenting CSC stages of awareness and divergence. In Study 2, a two-wave repeated cross-sectional survey was conducted just after the divergence stage and a year later. Othering was measured by the number of foreign countries erroneously ticked by participants as having human victims. Individual differences in germ aversion and social dominance orientation interacted to predict othering during the divergence stage but not a year later. Implications for research on CSC and symbolic in-group protection strategies resulting from disease threat are discussed.","Gilles, Ingrid; Bangerter, Adrian; Clémence, Alain; Green, Eva G T; Krings, Franciska; Mouton, Audrey; Rigaud, David; Staerklé, Christian; Wagner-Egger, Pascal",The British journal of social psychology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02048.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21883298/,257

We recruited 1034 adolescents (mean age 15.76 ± 1.20 years) from China. The results showed that loneliness was positively associated with escape motivation and adolescent problematic mobile phone use. Furthermore, when controlling for gender, escape motivation mediated the relationship between loneliness and problematic mobile phone use, and self-control moderated the relationship between escape motivation and problematic mobile phone use. Specifically, as self-control increased, escape motivation was less likely to induce problematic mobile phone use. Thus, loneliness and escape motivation may be factors that increase the risk of problematic mobile phone use, and self-control should be considered in prevention and intervention strategies aimed at attenuating adolescent problematic mobile phone use.","Li, Jiayu; Zhan, Danni; Zhou, Yuhong; Gao, Xuemei",Addictive behaviors,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33676160/,257

We found a strong gradient between neighbourhood income and physical distancing. Individuals in high-income neighbourhoods increased their days at home substantially more than individuals in low-income neighbourhoods did. Residents of low-income neighbourhoods were more likely to work outside the home, compared to residents in higher-income neighbourhoods, but were not more likely to visit locations such as supermarkets, parks and hospitals. Finally, we found that state orders were only associated with small increases in staying home in low-income neighbourhoods. Our findings indicate that people in lower-income neighbourhoods have faced barriers to physical distancing, particularly needing to work outside the home, and that state physical distancing policies have not mitigated these disparities.","Jay, Jonathan; Bor, Jacob; Nsoesie, Elaine O; Lipson, Sarah K; Jones, David K; Galea, Sandro; Raifman, Julia",Nature human behaviour,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-00998-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33144713/,257

We determined the prospective association of brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) with incident AF among older adults. Methods We included 2027 Cardiovascular Health Study participants (mean age=78.3 years, male=39%, Black=17%) who underwent brachial FMD measurement at the 1997 to 1998 clinic visit. Incident AF was ascertained by study electrocardiograms, hospital discharge diagnosis coding and Medicare claims data. Cox regression models were used to examine the association between FMD and incident AF. Results We identified 754 incident of AF cases (37%) over a median follow-up of 11.0 years. After adjusting for age, sex, race, height, weight, cardiovascular disease, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, kidney function, c-reactive protein, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and statins, the risk of AF did not differ according to brachial FMD response (4th vs 1st quartile hazard ratio (HR)=1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 1.26; per FMD unit increment HR=1.01, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.05). Conclusion We found no relationship between brachial FMD and the risk of developing AF in this elderly cohort. Our findings suggest that the utility of brachial FMD as a risk marker for AF in older individuals is minimal.","Garg, Parveen K; Bartz, Traci M; Burke, Gregory; Gottdiener, John S; Herrington, David; Heckbert, Susan R; Kizer, Jorge R; Sotoodehnia, Nona; Mukamal, Kenneth J",Vascular health and risk management,https://doi.org/10.2147/vhrm.s297720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737810/,257

Historically, this has been treated with an open surgical approach (with high morbidity) and with angioplasty in more recent years. Herein we describe technical aspects of stenting of the IVC in patients with recalcitrant chronic occlusive disease and evaluate its outcomes. METHODS We reviewed all the patients treated in an endovascular fashion for venous disease at our institution from 2005 to 2014 to identify and to include those with IVC stent placement in this study. Clinical characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes data were collected from medical records. Primary end points were technical success, symptom resolution, freedom from reintervention, and patency rate at follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (15 men) with a mean age of 48 ± 2.7 years underwent IVC stent placement for 16 occlusions (4 congenital) and 12 high-grade stenoses. Hypercoagulable state was noted in 14 patients, 7 of whom had malignant disease. A previously placed IVC filter was present in 13 patients. Median time from onset of symptoms to presentation was 81 months (3-480 months). Lytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (Alteplase) was performed in 12 patients for a median of 2 days (range, 1-3 days). Self-expanding stents (Wallstent; Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass) were used most commonly in the IVC (n = 22) with or without adjunctive use of balloon-expandable stents (Palmaz stent; Cordis, New Brunswick, NJ). Technical success was 100%. At median follow-up of 10 months (range, 0-56 months), thrombotic complications requiring reintervention occurred in four patients at 1, 4, 8, and 37 months. One patient died at 2 weeks secondary to underlying malignant disease. Freedom from reintervention, patency rate, and symptom-free survival rate at 2 years were 84%, 90%, and 80%. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular stenting for chronic occlusive disease of the IVC is safe and effective in the midterm follow-up, with minimal morbidity. Reintervention rate is low, with excellent functional outcomes.","Fatima, Javairiah; AlGaby, AbdulAziz; Bena, James; Abbasi, Mohammad N; Clair, Daniel G",Journal of vascular surgery.

The recent COVID-19 lockdowns may impact the transition towards clean cooking fuels. The nationwide lockdown is likely to affect key factors such as energy access, income, transportation, etc., that play a role in decisions influencing household fuel use. The rural population already bears the burden of poverty and may not be able to afford and access clean cooking fuels during the lockdown. They are thus vulnerable to reversion to their traditional cooking methods using solid biomass fuels. The household air pollution caused due to the use of polluting fuels increases their susceptibility to non-communicable diseases, and thus may intensify the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection. Hence, there is an urgent need to expand sustainable energy solutions worldwide. The present study applies the DPSIR modeling framework to establish a set of comprehensive indicators for addressing the transition towards clean cooking fuels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also provides insights on various strategies adopted in India in response to the COVID-19 pandemic for maintaining continuity of delivering benefits under a clean cookstove program.

With this retrospective study, we wanted to identify the most common electrophysiological abnormalities seen on neurophysiological examination of GBS patients and its variants in the early phases. METHODS We reviewed the clinical records of patients admitted to our Neurology Unit with a confirmed diagnosis of GBS. The study sample was divided in two subgroups according to whether the neurophysiological exam was performed: within 7 days (very early group) or within 7-15 days (early group). H reflex, F waves, motor and sensory conduction parameters were judged abnormal if outside the normal range for at least two nerves. We evaluated neurophysiological findings in Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) apart. RESULTS The study sample was 36 patients. In GBS, the most frequent abnormal neurophysiological parameter was the bilateral absence of the H reflex, followed by F wave abnormalities. Motor conduction parameters were altered in less than 50% of patients and even less common were sensory nerve action potentials reduction and the 'sural-sparing pattern'. In MFS, H reflex was absent bilaterally in 100% of patients, followed by a predominant peripheral sensory involvement, while motor conduction parameters were frequently normal. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral absence of the H reflex is the most sensitive parameter in early diagnosis of GBS and its variants.","Rasera, Andrea; Romito, Silvia; Segatti, Alessia; Concon, Elisa; Alessandrini, Luca; Basaldella, Federica; Badari, Andrea; Bonetti, Bruno; Squintani, Giovanna",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.15011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34233056/,257

Areas covered: The authors searched MEDLINE, PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify eligible full-text English language papers. Herein, the authors discuss AT2-receptor agonists and ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas-receptor axis modulators, direct renin inhibitors, brain aminopeptidase A inhibitors, biased AT1R blockers, chymase inhibitors, multitargeted drugs, vaccines and aldosterone receptor antagonists as well as aldosterone synthase inhibitors. Expert opinion: Preclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of the protective axis of the RAAS represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiovascular and renal diseases, but there are no clinical trials supporting our expectations. Non-steroidal MRAs might become the third-generation of MRAs for the treatment of heart failure, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. The main challenge for these new drugs is that conventional RAASIs are safe, effective and cheap generics.

83884,Need for payer-provider partnerships in addressing social determinants of health.,2021-06-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a major cause of death, morbidity and costs in ICUs. Several evidence-based clinical interventions have been increasingly described for its prevention. However, continuous control of tracheal cuff pressure (Pcuff) is rarely mentioned in the latest clinical guidelines. This review focuses on the available data about the management of Pcuff in the ICU, including discontinuous and continuous control, and its impact on the prevention of VAP. RECENT FINDINGS Current discontinuous monitoring and adjustment of Pcuff, even well performed, is inaccurate in maintaining Pcuff in the target range. Underinflation (Pcuff<20 cmH2O) of tracheal cuff is an independent risk factor for VAP through microaspiration of contaminated subglottic secretions into the lower respiratory tract. Two main types of devices, electronic and pneumatic, have been developed for the continuous control of Pcuff. Both have shown effectiveness in maintaining Pcuff in recommended range in ICU patients, but only the pneumatic device has provided a reduction in microaspiration and VAP incidence. SUMMARY Continuous controllers of Pcuff represent effective, easy to use and timesaving devices in today's busy ICU environment. However, further studies are required to determine the impact of continuous control of Pcuff on VAP incidence, patient outcomes, antimicrobial consumption and to compare pneumatic and electronic devices, before generalizing their use in routine practice.","Rouzé, Anahita; Nseir, Saad",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0b013e3283636b71; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23856895/,257
84135,Integration of mental health comorbidity in medical specialty programs in 20 countries.,2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND Chronic abdominal pain can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and can remain unexplained despite extensive investigation. Bile can pool in the gastric remnant and create a bile reflux gastropathy. The aim of this study was to assess gastric remnant findings in patients with RYGB and chronic abdominal pain of unclear etiology, and to determine the effectiveness of ursodiol therapy for patients with confirmed remnant gastropathy. METHODS All consecutive patients with RYGB and a diagnosis of chronic abdominal pain, and a negative diagnostic workup (including physical examination, routine laboratory work, cross-sectional imaging, and standard upper endoscopy), who underwent device-assisted enteroscopy for evaluation of the gastric remnant, were included. Pathology reports, treatments, and clinical follow-up were recorded. RESULTS 28 post-RYGB patients (all female) with chronic abdominal pain and negative evaluation were included. Pooling of bile with gastric erythema was noted in 22/28 patients. All 22 patients with endoscopic erythema had pathology consistent with bile reflux chemical gastropathy. Of these patients, 12 were started on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) alone, and 10 were started on ursodiol. Of the ursodiol group, 8/10 (80%) patients reported substantial improvement or resolution of abdominal pain at clinical follow-up. All three ursodiol patients with repeat endoscopic examination of the gastric remnant had endoscopic and histologic resolution of gastropathy. Of the PPI patients, 1/12 reported improvement in abdominal pain at clinical follow-up (p = 0.002), and both patients with repeat endoscopic examination of the gastric remnant had persistent remnant gastropathy. CONCLUSIONS Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients with unexplained chronic pain, and biopsy-confirmed chemical gastropathy, had a significantly higher rate of abdominal pain resolution with ursodiol treatment compared to PPI. Remnant gastropathy due to bile reflux is a treatable cause of chronic abdominal pain in RYGB patients, and ursodiol should be considered for empiric treatment in RYGB patients with unexplained chronic abdominal pain.","Kumar, Nitin; Thompson, Christopher C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5621-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28799115/,257

Successful skin grafting of these sites is difficult, as the bed is constantly bathed by enteric contents. A method to graft these sites successfully would provide an important advance in their treatment. METHODS The medical records of patients undergoing skin grafting of a site around an enterocutaneous fistula were reviewed. The amount of fistula output at the time of grafting was recorded. The method of grafting, as well as the means of protecting the graft from enteric exposure, were noted. Skin grafts were evaluated for the extent of ""take."" RESULTS Seven patients met the inclusion criteria. After 1-2 weeks, the graft take was 90% in three patients, 80% in two patients, and 50% in two patients. After 1 month, there was complete epithelialization in 85% of patients, and the remaining patient had most of the site epithelialized. This healing allowed placement of an ostomy appliance in all patients. The fistula output was >400 mL per day in 70% of the patients. Multiple techniques were used to divert enteric flow away from the graft, but the most common was placement of a negative pressure dressing that concomitantly secured the graft and allowed enteric diversion. CONCLUSION The presence of a high-output enterocutaneous fistula does not preclude successful skin grafting. Such grafting can accelerate wound healing as well as improve skin and site hygiene by allowing the placement of an ostomy device.","Byrnes, Matthew C; Riggle, Andrew; Beilman, Greg; Chipman, Jeffrey",Surgical infections,https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2010.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20849289/,257

PATIENTS Individuals younger than 18 years, alive, and continuously enrolled in UnitedHealthcare between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007, in 5 large US health care markets. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Number and type of diagnostic imaging procedures using ionizing radiation in children. RESULTS A total of 355 088 children were identified; 436 711 imaging procedures using ionizing radiation were performed in 150 930 patients (42.5%). The highest rates of use were in children older than 10 years, with frequent use in infants younger than 2 years as well. Plain radiography accounted for 84.7% of imaging procedures performed. Computed tomographic scans-associated with substantially higher doses of radiation-were commonly used, accounting for 11.9% of all procedures during the study period. Overall, 7.9% of children received at least 1 computed tomographic scan and 3.5% received 2 or more, with computed tomographic scans of the head being the most frequent. CONCLUSIONS Exposure to ionizing radiation from medical diagnostic imaging procedures may occur frequently among children. Efforts to optimize and ensure appropriate use of these procedures in the pediatric population should be encouraged.","Dorfman, Adam L; Fazel, Reza; Einstein, Andrew J; Applegate, Kimberly E; Krumholz, Harlan M; Wang, Yongfei; Christodoulou, Emmanuel; Chen, Jersey; Sanchez, Ramon; Nallamothu, Brahmajee K",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21199972/,257
89669,"COVID-19 severity, self-efficacy, knowledge, preventive behaviors, and mental health in Turkey.",2020-07-16,"PURPOSE Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is one of the major complications in patients who undergo distal pancreatectomy (DP). Recently, dividing the pancreas by stapler is a commonly performed technique, however, POPF still occurs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors for POPF after DP using a triple-row stapler. METHODS A total of 75 patients underwent DP using a triple-row stapler (Endo GIA™ Reloads with Tri-Staple™ Technology 60 mm; COVIDIEN, North Haven, CT, USA) at Yamanashi University from December 2012 to December 2016. The clinical risk factors for POPF after DP using a triple-row stapler were identified based on univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS Clinical POPF (ISGPF Grade B and C) was seen in 7 of 75 patients (9.3%). The body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in the patients with POPF (26.8 ± 0.5 kg/m2) compared with the patients without POPF (21.4 ± 0.4 kg/m2; a cut-off value; 25.7 kg/m2). In addition, the patients with POPF were significantly younger than the patients without POPF (56.4 ± 5.6 vs 67.0 ± 1.5; a cut-off value was 57.0 years old). CONCLUSIONS BMI and age were found to be significant risk factors for POPF after DP using a triple-row stapler.","Kawaida, Hiromichi; Kono, Hiroshi; Watanabe, Mitsuaki; Hosomura, Naohiro; Amemiya, Hidetake; Fujii, Hideki",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-017-1554-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28600634/,257

90519,Extend an Embrace: The Availability of Hugs Is an Associate of Higher Self-Rated Health in Later Life.,2020-09-14,"BACKGROUND Lower eyelid rejuvenation can, unfortunately, induce scleral show even if the lower eyelid procedure is limited. This study was designed to assess the effectiveness and reliability of the concentric malar lift technique in two scenarios: the first, in rejuvenation of the mid-face and, the second, in reconstructive surgery for correction of congenital or acquired eyelids malposition. METHODS The concentric malar lift technique was first published by Le Louarn (Aesthet Plast Surg 28(6):359-372, 2004). This retrospective study was carried out by analyzing data on patients operated on between January 2010 and January 2016. Patients operated on before 2010 were excluded because barbed thread sutures were not used in the first version of the technique. Patients after January 2016 were excluded to ensure adequate follow-up, and so 342 patients are included in the study. A total of 256 cases (75%) were for aesthetic mid-face lifting, and 86 cases (25%) were reconstructive surgeries for lower eyelid retraction. A spacer graft was used in 30 of these reconstructive cases (35%). The mean follow-up time was 13.6 months. All the concentric malar lifting procedures included strengthening the lateral canthus, which is a key element of the procedure. RESULTS None of the patients developed secondary eyelid malposition, and all the cases of lower eyelid retraction displayed marked improvement both functionally and aesthetically. Two patients experienced loss of sensitivity of part in the infra-orbital nerve distribution for 4 months after the procedure. CONCLUSION The concentric malar lift procedure enables the recruitment of a significant amount of skin into the lower eyelid: between 10 and 30 mm. It ensures better rejuvenation of the mid-face with minimal risk of lower eyelid malposition. In reconstruction of the lower eyelid lid, the concentric malar lift is able to reduce the need for skin grafting and a skin flap reducing the risks of visible scarring.

92215,Telemedicine for endocrinological care of transgender subjects during COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-10-08,"BACKGROUND Minimally invasive sphincter-saving rectal resection represents a challenging procedure. Robotic surgery for rectal cancer has several advantages over conventional surgery in performing precise dissection and was proved to be safe and effective in previous studies. However, comparison between laparoscopic and robotic rectal resection has drawn contradictory results. The aim of the present study was to compare robotic and laparoscopic sphincter-saving rectal resections for short-term and pathological outcomes. METHODS Between January 2013 and May 2016, we performed a total of 258 robotic surgeries, including 146 colorectal resections (56%). For this study, we included the first 65 sphincter-saving robotic resections and compared them to the last 65 consecutive laparoscopic resections. The laparoscopic group was constituted by the last 65 consecutively operated patients who matched the inclusion criteria. RESULTS Patients' baseline characteristics were similar in both the groups. Conversion rate was greater in the laparoscopic group (17 vs. 5%, p=0.044). Reoperation rate, overall and severe morbidity, and median hospital stay were similar in both the groups. Quality of mesorectal excision specimen was considered complete or near complete in 97 and 96% in the laparoscopic and robotic groups, respectively. There was no difference in the rates of negative circumferential radial margin, distal margin, and surgical success measured by composite criteria. CONCLUSION The main finding of this study was that robotic proctectomy for sphincter-saving procedures offers similar quality of TME with a statistically significant lower rate of conversion when compared to laparoscopic proctectomy.","Valverde, Alain; Goasguen, Nicolas; Oberlin, Olivier; Svrcek, Magali; Fléjou, Jean-François; Sezeur, Alain; Mosnier, Henri; Houdart, Rémi; Lupinacci, Renato M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5455-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28271268/,257

No criterion standard exists for management of these wounds, but secondary-intention healing, partial- and full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs), and various flaps are possible options to manage these wounds. Few data exist on the efficacy of FTSG repairs for lower extremity wounds. OBJECTIVES Assess the efficacy and complications rates of FTSG repairs for lower extremity wounds after MMS. METHODS This was a retrospective review of 80 FTSG repairs performed after MMS. Data were derived from 45 cases at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and 35 cases at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Medical Center. RESULTS Seventy-two of 80 cases (90%) had full graft survival, six (7.5%) had partial failure, and two (2.5%) had complete failure. In the cases where grafts had failed, wounds healed by secondary intention without further complications. Other complications included infections in nine (11%) cases and hematoma formation in two (2.5%).

Functional rehabilitation of infectious COVID-19 patients has been implemented in the acute care wards and in appropriate, ad-hoc, multidisciplinary COVID-19 rehabilitation units. However, because COVID-19 rehabilitation units are a clinical novelty, clinical and organizational benchmarks are not yet available. The aim of this study is to describe the organizational needs and operational costs of such a unit, by comparing its activity, organization, and costs with 2 other functional rehabilitation units, in San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy. METHODS The 2-month activity of the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit at San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy, which was created in response to the emergency need for rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients, was compared with the previous year's activity of the Cardiac Rehabilitation and Motor Rehabilitation Units of the same institute. Results The COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit had the same number of care beds as the other units, but required twice the amount of staff and instrumental equipment, leading to a deficit in costs. DISCUSSION The COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit was twice as expensive as the 2 other units studied. World health systems are organizing to respond to the pandemic by implementing acute intensive care and sub-intensive care units. This study shows that COVID-19 rehabilitation units must be organized following specific clinical and organizational needs.","Iannaccone, Sandro; Alemanno, Federica; Houdayer, Elise; Brugliera, Luigia; Castellazzi, Paola; Cianflone, Domenico; Meloni, Carlo; Ambrosio, Alberto; Mortini, Pietro; Spina, Alfio; Filippi, Massimo",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.2340/16501977-2704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32516421/,257
94351,Art Applied to Face the Covid 19 Pandemic: An Origami Based Do It Yourself Face Shield.,2021,"Epidemics are among the greatest threats to humanity, and the International Health Regulations are the world's key legal instrument for addressing this threat. Since their revision in 2005, the IHR have faced two big tests: the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Both exposed major shortcomings of the IHR, and both offered profound lessons for the future. The objective of this Article is twofold. First, we seek to compare the lessons learned from H1N1 and Ebola for reforming the IHR in order to test the hypothesis that they are similar. Second, we seek to examine the barriers to implementing these lessons and to identify strategies for overcoming those barriers. We find that the lessons from H1N1 and Ebola are indeed similar, and that opportunities to act on lessons from H1N1 were woefully missed. We identify many political barriers to global collective action and implementation of lessons for the IHR. On that basis, we describe strategies to overcome these barriers, which will hopefully be deployed now to reform the IHR before the policy window following Ebola closes, and before the inevitable next epidemic comes. The emerging threat of the Zika virus underscores that we have no time to waste.","Ottersen, Trygve; Hoffman, Steven J; Groux, Gaëlle",American journal of law & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0098858816658273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29086649/,257
95240,Mental health in biological disasters: From SARS to COVID-19.,2020-07-29,"INTRODUCTION There are significant differences in the active cases and fatality rates of Covid-19 for different European countries. METHODOLOGY The present study employs Monte Carlo based transmission growth simulations for Italy, Germany and Turkey. The probabilities of transmission at home, work and social networks and the number of initial cases have been calibrated to match the basic reproduction number and the reported fatality curves. Parametric studies were conducted to observe the effect of social distancing, work closure, testing and quarantine of the family and colleagues of positively tested individuals. RESULTS It is observed that estimates of the number of initial cases in Italy compared to Turkey and Germany are higher. Turkey will probably experience about 30% less number of fatalities than Germany due its smaller elderly population. If social distancing and work contacts are limited to 25% of daily routines, Germany and Turkey may limit the number of fatalities to a few thousands as the reproduction number decreases to about 1.3 from 2.8. Random testing may reduce the number of fatalities by 10% upon testing least 5/1000 of the population. Quarantining of family and workmates of positively tested individuals may reduce the total number of fatalities by about 50%. CONCLUSIONS The fatality rate of Covid-19 is estimated to be about 1.5% based on the simulation results. This may further be reduced by limiting the number of non-family contacts to two, conducting tests more than 0.5% of the population and immediate quarantine of the contacts for positively tested individuals.","Gul, Serdar; Tuncay, Kagan; Binici, Baris; Aydin, Beyazit Bestami",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32794459/,257

Neutralizing antibodies are a potential treatment for COVID-19. Objective To determine the effect of bamlanivimab monotherapy and combination therapy with bamlanivimab and etesevimab on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in mild to moderate COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants The BLAZE-1 study is a randomized phase 2/3 trial at 49 US centers including ambulatory patients (N = 613) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and had 1 or more mild to moderate symptoms. Patients who received bamlanivimab monotherapy or placebo were enrolled first (June 17-August 21, 2020) followed by patients who received bamlanivimab and etesevimab or placebo (August 22-September 3). These are the final analyses and represent findings through October 6, 2020. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive a single infusion of bamlanivimab (700 mg [n = 101], 2800 mg [n = 107], or 7000 mg [n = 101]), the combination treatment (2800 mg of bamlanivimab and 2800 mg of etesevimab [n = 112]), or placebo (n = 156). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was change in SARS-CoV-2 log viral load at day 11 (±4 days). Nine prespecified secondary outcome measures were evaluated with comparisons between each treatment group and placebo, and included 3 other measures of viral load, 5 on symptoms, and 1 measure of clinical outcome (the proportion of patients with a COVID-19-related hospitalization, an emergency department [ED] visit, or death at day 29). Results Among the 577 patients who were randomized and received an infusion (mean age, 44.7 [SD, 15.7] years; 315 [54.6%] women), 533 (92.4%) completed the efficacy evaluation period (day 29). The change in log viral load from baseline at day 11 was -3.72 for 700 mg, -4.08 for 2800 mg, -3.49 for 7000 mg, -4.37 for combination treatment, and -3.80 for placebo. Compared with placebo, the differences in the change in log viral load at day 11 were 0.09 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.52; P = .69) for 700 mg, -0.27 (95% CI, -0.71 to 0.16; P = .21) for 2800 mg, 0.31 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.76; P = .16) for 7000 mg, and -0.57 (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.14; P = .01) for combination treatment. Among the secondary outcome measures, differences between each treatment group vs the placebo group were statistically significant for 10 of 84 end points. The proportion of patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations or ED visits was 5.8% (9 events) for placebo, 1.0% (1 event) for 700 mg, 1.9% (2 events) for 2800 mg, 2.0% (2 events) for 7000 mg, and 0.9% (1 event) for combination treatment. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 9 patients (6 bamlanivimab, 2 combination treatment, and 1 placebo). No deaths occurred during the study treatment. Conclusions and Relevance Among nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness, treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab, compared with placebo, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load at day 11; no significant difference in viral load reduction was observed for bamlanivimab monotherapy. Further ongoing clinical trials will focus on assessing the clinical benefit of antispike neutralizing antibodies in patients with COVID-19 as a primary end point.

The ability of the pathogens to withstand the dry conditions and to develop resistance to heat is regarded as the major concern for the food industry dealing with low-moisture foods. In this regard, the present review is aimed to discuss the importance and the use of novel thermal and nonthermal technologies such as radiofrequency, steam pasteurization, plasma, and gaseous technologies for decontamination of foodborne pathogens in low-moisture foods and their microbial inactivation mechanisms. The review also summarizes the various sources of contamination and the factors influencing the survival and thermal resistance of pathogenic microorganisms in low-moisture foods. The literature survey indicated that the nonthermal techniques such as CO2 , high-pressure processing, and so on, may not offer effective microbial inactivation in low-moisture foods due to their insufficient moisture content. On the other hand, gases can penetrate deep inside the commodities and pores due to their higher diffusion properties and are regarded to have an advantage over thermal and other nonthermal processes. Further research is required to evaluate newer intervention strategies and combination treatments to enhance the microbial inactivation in low-moisture foods without significantly altering their organoleptic and nutritional quality.","Wason, Surabhi; Verma, Tushar; Subbiah, Jeyamkondan",Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,https://doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323364/,257

This study aims to prove the feasibility and validity of IPOM Plus repair, among other concepts, as a well-justified treatment of incisional or ventral hernias, rendering a good long-term outcome result. METHODS A single institution's systematic retrospective review of 1326 LIVHR was conducted between the years 2000 and 2014. A standardized technique of routine closure of the defect prior to the intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) reinforcement was performed in all patients. The standardized technique of ""defect closure"" by laparoscopy approximating the linea alba under physiological tension was assigned by either the transparietal U reverse interrupted stitches or the extracorporeal closure in larger defects. All patients benefited from the implant Parietex composite mesh through an Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh placement with transfacial suturing. RESULTS LIVHR was performed on 1326 patients, 52.57% female and 47.43% male. The majority of our patients were young (mean age 52.19 years) and obese (average BMI 32.57 kg/m2). The mean operating time was 70 min and hospital stay 2 days, with a mean follow-up of 78 months. On the overall early complications of 5.78%, we achieved over time the elimination of the dead space by routine closure of the defect, thus reducing seroma formation to 2.56%, with a low risk of infection <1%. Post-op sepsis occurred in only nine cases. Three secondary serosal breakdowns and two late perforations were re-operated, and three diabetic patients had infected hematomas, necessitating mesh removal. Through technical improvement in the suturing concept and our growing experience, we managed to reduce the incidence of transient pain to a low acceptable rate of 3.24% (VAS 5-7) that decreased to 2.56% on a chronic pain stage, which is comparable to the literature. On the overall rate of late complications of 10.74%, we noticed also that by reducing the dead space, the chronic pain, skin bulging, and rate of recurrence were reduced to, respectively, 2.56, 1.50, and 4.72%. One case of mortality was due to a tracheal stenosis, responsible for an acute respiratory syndrome. On a second-look follow-up of 126 patients (9.5%), 45.23% were adhesion free, 42.06% had minor adhesions classified as Müller I, and 12.69% had serosal adhesions classified as Müller II. CONCLUSION Our long series confirms the unexpected high rate of feasibility in the suturing concept or augmentation technique, and confers additional benefits to the conventional advantages of LIVHR in terms of reducing the overall morbidity, with a low rate of recurrences. Based on our experience and study, the current best indications for a successful LIVHR procedure should be tailored upon the limitations of the defect's width and proper patient selection, to restore adequately the optimal functionality of the abdominal muscles and provide better functional and cosmetic outcomes.","Chelala, E; Baraké, H; Estievenart, J; Dessily, M; Charara, F; Allé, J L",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-015-1397-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26093891/,257

We performed a systematic review of all risk factors associated with sleep disruption in the ICU setting. DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. STUDY SELECTION English-language studies of any design published between 1990 and April 2018 that evaluated sleep in greater than or equal to 10 critically ill adults (> 18 yr old) and investigated greater than or equal to 1 potential risk factor for sleep disruption during ICU stay. We assessed study quality using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. DATA EXTRACTION We abstracted all data independently and in duplicate. Potential ICU sleep disruption risk factors were categorized into three categories based on how data were reported: 1) patient-reported reasons for sleep disruption, 2) patient-reported ratings of potential factors affecting sleep quality, and 3) studies reporting a statistical or temporal association between potential risk factors and disrupted sleep. DATA SYNTHESIS Of 5,148 citations, we included 62 studies. Pain, discomfort, anxiety/fear, noise, light, and ICU care-related activities are the most common and widely studied patient-reported factors causing sleep disruption. Patients rated noise and light as the most sleep-disruptive factors. Higher number of comorbidities, poor home sleep quality, home sleep aid use, and delirium were factors associated with sleep disruption identified in available studies. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review summarizes all premorbid, illness-related, and ICU-related factors associated with sleep disruption in the ICU.

To monitor and address the health needs of pilgrims in field clinics near the pilgrimage route, a syndromic surveillance system was designed and implemented by Global Health Development/Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network in collaboration with Iraq Ministry of Health. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of the surveillance system and the data it gathered in evaluating the burden of common acute and infectious conditions, chronic conditions, and trauma and injuries during the Arba'een pilgrimage in 2018. Data were collected at 152 field clinics located across 11 governorates in Iraq at strategic points along the Arba'een pilgrimage route from all governorates to Karbala between October 8 and November 3, 2018. A team of 24 surveillance supervisors trained, oversaw, and provided technical support for 304 data collectors. The data collectors recorded data from 338,399 patients (42.5% female and 57.5% male) in the span of 26 days. The vast majority of patients were from Iraq (n = 294,260, 87.6%) and Iran (n = 34,691, 10.3%). Of the 338,399 patients whose data were recorded by the surveillance system, 246,469 (72.8%) reported acute and infectious conditions, 202,032 (59.70%) reported chronic conditions, and 6,737 (2.0%) reported traumas and injuries. Many patients reported several conditions in multiple categories. The most prevalent acute condition treated was influenza-like illness, identified through patients exhibiting a combination of fever and cough symptoms. Findings from this study will help inform future planning efforts so healthcare workers can be better prepared for treating such cases at mass gatherings. With the latest challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, preparations for a possible future outbreak of the novel coronavirus are also discussed. The information from this study serves as a foundation to inform and optimize future planning of wide-scale surveillance efforts and address challenges in health service delivery and health security.","Lami, Faris; Amiri, Mirwais; Majeed, Yasir; Barr, Kira M; Nsour, Mohannad Al; Khader, Yousef S",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33945332/,257
98746,Role of information technology in disaster medical response.,2008,"INTRODUCTION The government issued a country-wide lockdown in Nepal as a measure to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in various difficult experiences which includes financial loss, separation from loved ones, grief, uncertainty over disease status and loss of freedom. During these stressful situations, interpersonal violence is likely to be aggravated. To avoid the occurrence of adverse events such as impulsive acts, homicide, or suicide, it is important to identify high-risk individuals. METHODS This is a descriptive cross-sectional, questionnaire-based, online survey by convenience sampling. The prevalence of different types of interpersonal violence with socio-demographic factors, substance use, and overall mental wellbeing was assessed by using descriptive statistical tests. RESULTS Out of total 556 participants included in the analysis, 50.9% (283) were male and 48.7% (271) were female. There were 100 (18.0%) participants who reported being a victim of interpersonal violence and 101 (18.2%) participants who reported being a perpetrator during the lockdown. The victims of violence were more likely to be living with their spouse alone. The victims and perpetrators were also more likely to have increased alcohol and tobacco use. More number of victims and perpetrators had lower mental wellbeing scores on the WHO wellbeing index. CONCLUSIONS There was prevalence of interpersonal violence during the COVID-19 lockdown. In addition to the fear regarding pandemic, victims have to face domestic violence placing them at a double injustice. Identification of vulnerable groups and proper management of survivors must be prioritized given the unanimous consensus on the rise of interpersonal violence during periods of heightened stress.","Ghimire, Calvin; Acharya, Sajan; Shrestha, Carmina; Kc, Prabhat; Singh, Swarndeep; Sharma, Pawan",JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.31729/jnma.5499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34504358/,257
98887,Patient generated health data and electronic health record integration in oncologic surgery: A call for artificial intelligence and machine learning.,2020-09-24,"BACKGROUND Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common infection in intubated critically ill patients. Microaspiration of the contaminated gastric and oropharyngeal secretions is the main mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of VAP. Tracheal cuff plays an important role in stopping the progression of contaminated secretions into the lower respiratory tract. Previous in vitro studies suggested that conical cuff shape might be helpful in improving tracheal sealing. However, clinical studies found conflicting results. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of conical tracheal cuff shape on the microaspiration of gastric contents in critically ill patients. METHODS/DESIGN This prospective cluster randomized controlled crossover open-label trial is currently being conducted in ten French intensive care units (ICUs). Patients are allocated to intubation with a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) standard (barrel)-shaped or a PVC conical-shaped tracheal tube. The primary objective is to determine the impact of the conical shaped tracheal cuff on abundant microaspiration of gastric contents. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of microaspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, tracheobronchial colonization, VAP and ventilator-associated events. Abundant microaspiration is defined as the presence of pepsin at significant level (>200 ng/ml) in at least 30 % of the tracheal aspirates. Pepsin and amylase are quantitatively measured in all tracheal aspirates during the 48 h following inclusion. Quantitative tracheal aspirate culture is performed at inclusion and twice weekly. We plan to recruit 312 patients in the participating ICUs. DISCUSSION BEST Cuff is the first randomized controlled study evaluating the impact of PVC tracheal-cuff shape on gastric microaspirations in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. Enrollment began in June 2014 and is expected to end in October 2015.

Various laboratory assays have been employed in the diagnosis of COVID-19, including: nucleic acid-based tests; antigen tests; and serum testing for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. The disease can also be diagnosed based on suggestive clinical features and radiological findings. Until now, remdesivir is the only medication approved for the treatment of COVID-19 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, it is anticipated that several anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies will gain soon approval. Other methods of treatment include supportive care directed toward treating the symptoms. Nevertheless, many studies have recently emerged, showing controversial preliminary results with the off-label medication hydroxychloroquine. Given that all results are still preliminary, including those seen by remdesivir, additional evidence and research are required to identify effective medications that are broadly effective and well tolerated. Importantly, two RNA-based vaccines have recently gained approval from Pfizer and Moderna, with many others still in clinical trials. This article reviews various aspects of COVID-19, including its epidemiology; its evolution and mutational spectrum; and its clinical dynamics, symptoms and complications, diagnosis, and treatment.","Younis, Nour K; Zareef, Rana O; Maktabi, Mohammad Ali N; Mahfouz, Rami",Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,https://doi.org/10.1089/gtmb.2020.0227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33596144/,257

Thus, minimal invasive surgery techniques have been advocated to overcome this hurdle. The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience on minimally invasive LDN. During the last decade we have gradually expanded the use of minimally invasive LDN with various techniques; strictly laparoscopic versus hand-assisted, and laparoscopic versus retroperitoneoscopic. This study is based on 305 consecutive minimally invasive LDN's, from 1998 to 2009. By multiple regression analysis, minimally invasive hand-assisted technique was shown to be associated with a significantly lower risk of major complications and intraoperative incidents, as well as reduced warm ischemia and operative time. In our opinion, the introduction of hand-assisted technique is probably the most significant single factor for improved results, although accumulated experience and developments in equipment will contribute. Our experience indicates that learning curves are facilitated by the use of hand-assisted technique. Improvements in surgical outcomes following donor nephrectomy may enhance living donor programmes.","Mjøen, Geir; Holdaas, Hallvard; Pfeffer, Per; Line, Pål-Dag; Øyen, Ole",Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1432-2277.2010.01087.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20412538/,257

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary efficacy assessment was mean change in pain intensity based on patient diary Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores from baseline to final visit of the 12-week double-blind phase. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to each visit in patient diary NRS scores; and office NRS scores; time to treatment failure; Patient Global Assessment; rescue medication use; and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire total scores. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00549042. RESULTS For the primary outcome measure, hydromorphone ER significantly reduced pain intensity compared to placebo (p < 0.001). Median diary NRS score change from baseline to endpoint was significantly lower for OROS [corrected] hydromorphone ER (0.2 units) compared to placebo (1.6 units). [corrected] A significantly higher proportion of hydromorphone ER (60.6%) vs. placebo (42.9%) patients had at least a 30% reduction in diary NRS pain score from screening to endpoint (p < 0.01). Hydromorphone ER was well-tolerated, although 60 (13%) discontinued during the enrichment phase for adverse events and more active (9, 6.7%) than placebo (4, 3.0%) patients discontinued treatment for adverse events during the randomized phase. CONCLUSIONS These results provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of hydromorphone ER in opioid-tolerant patients with chronic moderate-to-severe LBP. Potential limitations include the shortened dose-conversion/titration phase, limiting the daily allowable dose of hydromorphone ER to 64 mg, and the allowance of limited rescue medication throughout the entire double-blind phase. Other trial design elements such as the use of an enrichment phase and the inclusion of only opioid tolerant patients may limit the generalizability of these results.","Hale, M; Khan, A; Kutch, M; Li, S",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1185/03007995.2010.484723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20429852/,257

There are clear advantages of ultrasound-guided arterial cannulation, which have shown to be more effective in reducing complications, time to successful cannulation, number of attempts, and overall first-time success rates. Evidence suggests that using palpation alone has a first-time success rate of less than 70% yet is still a widely performed technique. A systematic evaluation may be required to reduce variations in arterial catheterization practices. DESIGN The arterial insertion method is a systematic evaluation to aid in arterial catheter insertion with ultrasound guidance, intended to improve the procedural approach. The process of arterial insertion method ensures appropriate choice of zone selection to optimize catheter longevity and performance in patients requiring arterial access. Moving the insertion site proximally 4 cm from the red zone into the green zone may reduce mechanical complications and preserve catheter performance and dwell time. CONCLUSION The standardization of ultrasound guidance in arterial catheterization promotes vessel health and patient safety through device and site optimization. The arterial insertion method systematic evaluation may be utilized to reduce variation in practice and promote the use of ultrasound as a standard for the insertion of radial arterial catheters.","Bardin-Spencer, Amy J; Spencer, Timothy R",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/1129729820944104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985342/,257
103136,Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health and Distress of Community-Dwelling Older Adults.,2021-06-21,"The recently discovered Nora virus from Drosophila melanogaster is a single-stranded RNA virus. Its published genomic sequence encodes a typical picorna-like cassette of replicative enzymes, but no capsid proteins similar to those in other picorna-like viruses. We have now done additional sequencing at the termini of the viral genome, extending it by 455 nucleotides at the 5' end, but no more coding sequence was found. The completeness of the final 12,333-nucleotide sequence was verified by the production of infectious virus from the cloned genome. To identify the capsid proteins, we purified Nora virus particles and analyzed their proteins by mass spectrometry. Our results show that the capsid is built from three major proteins, VP4A, B and C, encoded in the fourth open reading frame of the viral genome. The viral particles also contain traces of a protein from the third open reading frame, VP3. VP4A and B are not closely related to other picorna-like virus capsid proteins in sequence, but may form similar jelly roll folds. VP4C differs from the others and is predicted to have an essentially α-helical conformation. In a related virus, identified from EST database sequences from Nasonia parasitoid wasps, VP4C is encoded in a separate open reading frame, separated from VP4A and B by a frame-shift. This opens a possibility that VP4C is produced in non-equimolar quantities. Altogether, our results suggest that the Nora virus capsid has a different protein organization compared to the order Picornavirales.","Ekström, Jens-Ola; Habayeb, Mazen S; Srivastava, Vaibhav; Kieselbach, Thomas; Wingsle, Gunnar; Hultmark, Dan",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21605604/,257
103332,Disruptions in preventive care: Mammograms during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-11-04,"BACKGROUND Morbid obesity in both adolescents and adults has risen in an alarming rate. Bariatric surgery is playing an increasing role in pediatric surgery. However, current evidence is limited regarding its safety and outcome. METHODS Since 2005, data from obese patients that undergo bariatric procedures in Germany are prospectively registered. For the current analysis, all adolescent and adult subjects that had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) from 2005 to 2014 were considered. RESULTS LSG represents the most common bariatric procedure in Germany with a proportion of 48.1% in adolescent and 48.7% in adult obese in 2014. LSG was performed in 362 adolescent and 15,428 adult subjects. Pre-operative BMI was comparable between the two populations. However, adult obese had more frequently coexisting comorbidities (p < 0.01). Complication rates and mortality (0 vs. 0.2%) did not differ significantly. Adolescents achieved a BMI reduction of 16.8 and 18.0 kg/m2 at 12 and 24 months compared with 15.4 and 16.6 kg/m2 in the adult group. There was a significantly higher BMI reduction in late adolescents (19-21 years) compared with patients ≤18 years at 24 months (19.8 vs. 13.6 kg/m2). Resolution rate of hypertension was significantly higher in adolescents. CONCLUSION LSG is a safe therapeutic option that can be performed in adolescents without mortality. Late adolescents experienced the highest weight loss; resolution rate of comorbidities was lower in adults. All future efforts should now be focused on the evaluation of the long-term outcomes of LSG in the pediatric population.","Benedix, Frank; Krause, Thomas; Adolf, Daniela; Wolff, Stefanie; Lippert, Hans; Manger, Thomas; Stroh, Christine",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-017-2640-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28293902/,257
103818,Mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-09-01,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of the disease with lack of recognized molecular targets for therapy. TNBC cells are known to secrete high levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, which promote angiogenesis and favor the growth and spread of the disease. In the present study, we have shown that the humanized anti-IL-6 receptor tocilizumab (Actemra) is also a potent inhibitor of IL-8 in TNBC cells. Similar effect was also obtained by specific IL-6 inhibition either by small interfering RNA or by neutralizing antibody. Likewise, neutralizing IL-8 with specific antibody downregulated IL-8 and inhibited the IL-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and nuclear factor-κB pathways. Interestingly, simultaneous co-inhibition of IL-6 and IL-8 did not increase the effects of the single inhibitors. Additionally, we present clear evidence that tocilizumab has potent antiangiogenic effect. Indeed, tocilizumab abolished the ability of TNBC cells to induce the differentiation of endothelial cells into network-like tubular structures in vitro and impaired neovascularization in humanized breast orthotopic tumor xenografts. This was associated with tocilizumab-dependent downregulation of the main proangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor A and its coactivator hypoxia-inducible factor 1 both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, tocilizumab could be of great therapeutic value for TNBC patients through targeting angiogenesis.","Alraouji, Noura N; Aboussekhra, Abdelilah",Molecular carcinogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1002/mc.23270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264466/,257

METHODS PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Lilacs databases were used to identify articles published before June 2019 that met specific inclusion criteria. The search strategy was developed using both controlled and uncontrolled vocabulary related to the following domains: ""drug interactions,"" ""clinically relevant,"" and ""hospital."" In this review, we discuss original observational studies that detected DDIs in the hospital setting, studies that provided enough data to allow us to calculate the prevalence of clinically manifested DDIs, and studies that described the drugs prescribed or provided DDI adverse reaction reports, published in either English, Portuguese, or Spanish. RESULTS From the initial 5,999 articles identified, 10 met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of clinically manifested DDIs was 9.2% (CI 95% 4.0-19.7). The mean number of medications per patient reported in six studies ranged from 4.0 to 9.0, with an overall average of 5.47 ± 1.77 drugs per patient. The quality of the included studies was moderate. The main methods used to identify clinically manifested DDIs were evaluating medical records and ward visits (n = 7). Micromedex® (27.7%) and Lexi-Comp® (27.7%) online reference databases were commonly used to detect DDIs and none of the studies evaluated used more than one database for this purpose. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review showed that, despite the significant prevalence of potential DDIs reported in the literature, less than one in ten patients were exposed to a clinically manifested drug interaction. The use of causality tools to identify clinically manifested DDIs as well as clinical adoption of DDI lists based on actual adverse outcomes that can be identified through the implementation of real DDI notification systems is recommended to reduce the incidence of alert fatigue, enhance decision-making for DDI prevention or resolution, and, consequently, contribute to patient safety.","Gonzaga de Andrade Santos, Tâmara Natasha; Mendonça da Cruz Macieira, Givalda; Cardoso Sodré Alves, Bárbara Manuella; Onozato, Thelma; Cunha Cardoso, Geovanna; Ferreira Nascimento, Mônica Thaís; Saquete Martins-Filho, Paulo Ricardo; Pereira de Lyra, Divaldo; Oliveira Filho, Alfredo Dias de",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609783/,257

107643,Informing Human Trafficking Clinical Care Through Two Systematic Reviews on Sexual Assault and Intimate Partner Violence.,2018,"BACKGROUND Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic cancer in women, and the incidence of EC has increased by about 1% per year in the U. S over the last 10 years. Although 5-year survival rates for early-stage EC are around 80%, certain subtypes of EC that lose nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) expression are associated with poor survival rates. For example, estrogen receptor (ER)-negative EC typically harbors a worse prognosis compared to ER-positive EC. The molecular basis for the loss of NHR expression in endometrial tumors and its contribution to poor survival is largely unknown. Furthermore, there are no tools to systematically identify tumors that lose NHR mRNA expression relative to normal tissue. The development of such an approach could identify sets of NHR-based biomarkers for classifying patients into subgroups with poor survival outcomes. METHODS Here, a new computational method, termed receptLoss, was developed for identifying NHR expression loss in endometrial cancer relative to adjacent normal tissue. When applied to gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), receptLoss identified 6 NHRs that were highly expressed in normal tissue and exhibited expression loss in a subset of endometrial tumors. RESULTS Three of the six identified NHRs - estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors - that are known to lose expression in ECs were correctly identified by receptLoss. Additionally, a novel association was found between thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) expression loss, increased expression of miRNA-146a, and increased rates of 5-year survival in the EC TCGA patient cohort. THRB expression loss occurs independently of estrogen and progesterone expression loss, suggesting the discovery of a distinct, clinically-relevant molecular subgroup. CONCLUSION ReceptLoss is a novel, open-source software tool to systematically identify NHR expression loss in cancer. The application of receptLoss to endometrial cancer gene expression data identified THRB, a previously undescribed biomarker of survival in endometrial cancer. Applying receptLoss to expression data from additional cancer types could lead to the development of biomarkers of disease progression for patients with any other tumor type. ReceptLoss can be applied to expression data from additional cancer types with the goal of identifying biomarkers of differential survival.","Piqué, Daniel G; Greally, John M; Mar, Jessica C",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-07325-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894083/,257
107735,Mental health burden for the public affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in China: Who will be the high-risk group?,2020-04-14,"Cleavage of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) by host cell proteases is essential for virus infectivity and spread. We previously demonstrated in vitro that the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 cleaves influenza A and B virus (IAV/IBV) HA possessing a monobasic cleavage site. Subsequent studies revealed that TMPRSS2 is crucial for activation and pathogenesis of H1N1pdm and H7N9 IAV in mice. In contrast, activation of H3N2 IAV and IBV was found to be independent of TMPRSS2 expression and supported by as-yet undetermined protease(s).Here, we investigated the role of TMPRSS2 in proteolytic activation of IAV and IBV in three human airway cell culture systems: primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), primary type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) and Calu-3 cells. Knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression was performed using a previously described antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, T-ex5, that interferes with splicing of TMPRSS2 pre-mRNA, resulting in the expression of enzymatically inactive TMPRSS2. T-ex5 treatment produced efficient knockdown of active TMPRSS2 in all three airway cell culture models and prevented proteolytic activation and multiplication of H7N9 IAV in Calu-3 cells and H1N1pdm, H7N9 and H3N2 IAV in HBEC and AECII. T-ex5 treatment also inhibited activation and spread of IBV in AECII, but did not affect IBV activation in HBEC and Calu-3 cells.This study identifies TMPRSS2 as the major HA-activating protease of IAV in human airway cells and IBV in type II pneumocytes and as a potential target for the development of novel drugs to treat influenza infections.ImportanceInfluenza A and B viruses (IAV/IBV) cause significant morbidity and mortality during seasonal outbreaks. Cleavage of the viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) by host proteases is a prerequisite for membrane fusion and essential for virus infectivity. Inhibition of relevant proteases provides a promising therapeutic approach that may avoid the development of drug resistance. HA of most influenza viruses is cleaved at a monobasic cleavage site and a number of proteases have been shown to cleave HA in vitro This study demonstrates that the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 is the major HA-activating protease of IAV in primary human bronchial cells and of both IAV and IBV in primary human type II pneumocytes. It further reveals that human and murine airway cells can differ in their HA-cleaving protease repertoire. Our data will help drive the development of potent and selective protease inhibitors as novel drugs for influenza treatment.","Limburg, Hannah; Harbig, Anne; Bestle, Dorothea; Stein, David A; Moulton, Hong M; Jaeger, Julia; Janga, Harshavardhan; Hardes, Kornelia; Koepke, Janine; Schulte, Leon; Koczulla, Andreas Rembert; Schmeck, Bernd; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00649-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391268/,257
108246,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on US College Students' Physical Activity and Mental Health.,2021-02-18,"Background: Increasing evidence has linked repetitive negative thinking (RNT) to postnatal depression and anxiety, yet the factors moderating this relationship have been minimally investigated. During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, social restrictions imposed to reduce viral transmission limited access to social support, which is critical to postnatal psychological wellbeing - potentially intensifying RNT. Objective: We examined whether perceived social support (from friends, family, and a significant other) played a moderating role in the relationship between RNT and maternal postnatal anxiety and depressive symptoms. Methods: A sample of women (N = 251) who had given birth in the preceding 12 months completed an online battery of standardised measures during the COVID-19 'lockdown' of May 2020. Results: As predicted, social support moderated the relationship between RNT and depression such that the association between RNT and depression was stronger for women who reported lower levels of social support. Interestingly, this finding emerged for social support from friends only; for support from family and significant other, social support did not play a moderating role. Further, and unexpectedly, overall social support did not moderate the relationship between RNT and postnatal anxiety, however, social support from friends was a significant moderator. Conclusions: High levels of perceived social support from friends (but not family or significant others) buffered the effects of RNT on depression and anxiety during the postpartum period. Strategies to bolster peer social support may be a valuable inclusion in interventions to prevent and treat postnatal depression and anxiety.","Harrison, Virginia; Moulds, Michelle L; Jones, Katie",Journal of reproductive and infant psychology,https://doi.org/10.1080/02646838.2021.1886260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33586544/,257
108437,Psychological Aid to COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mental Health Response to Crises Management.,2020,"Background: The face mask has been used to protect against airborne diseases throughout history. We conducted a historical review of the literature on the origin of the face mask, the scientific evidence of its benefits, and its implications for domestic and international politics. Material and Methods: We performed a comprehensive search for peer- and nonpeer- reviewed literature published between 1905 and 2020. Results: Face mask wearing in hospital settings to prevent disease transmission from health care workers to their patients originates with the first use of the mask in surgery in 1897 by German surgeon Johann von Mikulicz. During the first half of the 20th century, various scientific investigators focused on determining the most effective type of medical mask. The role of the face mask in the general population as a preventive intervention during public health emergencies is supported by historical reports spanning from the European Bubonic Plague in 1619, to the Great Manchurian Plague of 1910-1911, the influenza pandemic of 1918, and the current coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although the face mask has helped against airborne disease transmission, its benefits during pandemics have been filtered through the prism of political leanings and geopolitical interests. Conclusions: Our review suggests that while face mask alone cannot stop pandemics, in conjunction with other nonpharmacologic interventions it can be useful in mitigating them. When cooperation rather than division becomes the norm in the global response to pandemics, the face mask can then unite rather than divide us.","Kristo, Gentian; He, Katherine; Whang, Edward; Fisichella, Piero M",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

We evaluated the risk factors, clinical courses and outcomes of severe HMPV disease relative to severe RSV in children admitted to the PICU. METHODS Retrospective chart review of children ≤18 years old admitted to a tertiary PICU between October 2008 through July 2010 with acute respiratory tract infection and positive direct antigen stain or polymerase chain reaction for RSV or HMPV. RESULTS One hundred thirty-three patients met inclusion criteria: 107 (80.5%) with RSV and 26 (19.5%) with HMPV. HMPV-infected patients were older than RSV children (3.4 vs. 1.5 years, P = 0.002) and more likely to have congenital heart disease (34.6% vs. 10.3%, P = 0.002). Although HMPV children required longer duration of mechanical ventilation (11 vs. 7 days, P = 0.01), there were no other differences in hospital course. HMPV patients were more likely to be discharged receiving inhaled steroids (53.8% vs. 30.8%, P = 0.03), but there were no differences in other outcome assessments. CONCLUSIONS Children admitted to the PICU with HMPV are significantly older and more likely to have congenital heart disease than those with RSV. The course of illness was similar between the 2 groups, but HMPV-infected children were more likely to be discharged with inhaled steroid therapy.","Eggleston, Heath A; Gunville, Cameron F; Miller, Joshua I; Sontag, Marci K; Mourani, Peter M",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3182a2261b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23811741/,257

We conducted a systematic search of databases between December 2019 and 28th June 2020. Studies were included if they reported or allowed estimation of an odds ratio (OR) for unfavourable outcome in obese compared to non-obese patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Twenty cohort studies of 28 355 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 infection were included. Meta-analysis estimated a pooled OR of 2.02 (1.41-2.89, p<0.001) for an unfavourable outcome in obese versus non-obese patients when adjusted for age, sex and co-morbidities. When unadjusted for confounders, the OR for unfavourable outcomes was 1.25 (CI 1.07-1.45, p=0.005). An increased adjusted OR was also seen for death (OR 1.51; CI 1.13-2.21, p=0.006) and severe illness (OR 2.26; CI 1.47-3.48, p<0.001). Compared to a normal BMI, the risk of an unfavourable outcome was increased even in overweight patients, with severe obesity having an escalated risk.Obesity is independently associated with an unfavourable outcome of COVID-19 illness, with obese patients having twice the risk of a composite outcome of severe disease or mortality, and a 50% increased risk of death.","Hoong, Caroline Wei Shan; Hussain, Ikram; Aravamudan, Veeraraghavan Meyyur; Phyu, Ei Ei; Lin, Jaime Hui Xian; Koh, Huilin",Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1326-2125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33395706/,257

Empowering patients and their care-partners, including family members or friends involved in their care, may help minimize the burden and consequences of CKD-related symptoms to enable life participation. There is a need to broaden the focus on living well with kidney disease and re-engagement in life, including an emphasis on patients being in control. The World Kidney Day (WKD) Joint Steering Committee has declared 2021 the year of ""Living Well with Kidney Disease"" in an effort to increase education and awareness on the important goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This calls for the development and implementation of validated patient-reported outcome measures to assess and address areas of life participation in routine care. It could be supported by regulatory agencies as a metric for quality care or to support labelling claims for medicines and devices. Funding agencies could establish targeted calls for research that address the priorities of patients. Patients with kidney disease and their care-partners should feel supported to live well through concerted efforts by kidney care communities, including during pandemics. In the overall wellness program for kidney disease patients, the need for prevention should be reiterated. Early detection with a prolonged course of wellness despite kidney disease, after effective secondary and tertiary prevention programs, should be promoted.

We orally inoculated a neonatal Microminipig with an intestinal homogenate of a PEDV-infected pig and housed it in a small cage originally designed for rats in an animal biosafety level 2 facility. The infected Microminipig showed the typical signs of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), such as watery diarrhea, loss of appetite and weight loss. We also recognized a high amount of excreted PEDV in its rectal swabs and villus atrophy of the small intestine.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detecting feline coronavirus (FCoV) RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum in comparison with the same real-time RT-PCR in cell-free body cavity effusion. Methods This prospective case-control study included 92 cats. Forty-three cats had a definitive diagnosis of FIP, established either by histopathological examination (n = 28) or by positive immunofluorescence staining of FCoV antigen in macrophages of effusions (n = 11), or by both methods (n = 4). Forty-nine control cats had other diseases but similar clinical signs. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on PBMCs of 37 cats (21 cats with FIP, 16 controls), on serum of 51 cats (26 cats with FIP, 25 controls) and on cell-free body cavity effusion of 69 cats (36 cats with FIP, 33 controls). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, including 95% confidence intervals (CI), were calculated. Results Real-time RT-PCR of PBMCs, serum and cell-free body cavity effusion showed a specificity of 100% (95% CI 79.4-100% in PBMCs, 86.3-100% in serum, 89.4-100% in cell-free body cavity effusion) and a sensitivity of 28.6% (95% CI 11.3-52.2%) in PBMCs, 15.4% (95% CI 4.4-34.9%) in serum and 88.9% (95% CI 73.9-96.9%) in cell-free body cavity effusion to diagnose FIP. Conclusions and relevance Although it is known that RT-PCR can often provide false-positive results in healthy cats, this real-time RT-PCR was shown to be a specific tool for the diagnosis of FIP when applied in a clinical setting. Sensitivity in cell-free body cavity effusion was high but low in PBMCs and serum. PBMC samples showed a higher sensitivity than serum samples, and are therefore a better choice if no effusion is present.","Doenges, Stephanie J; Weber, Karin; Dorsch, Roswitha; Fux, Robert; Hartmann, Katrin",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x15625354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26787293/,257

METHODS The study team completed cognitive interviews with veterans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to examine how they answered the Diabetes Distress Scale (DD Scale), a tool that assesses DD. The DD Scale was used because of its strong associations with self-management challenges, physician-related distress, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS The veterans sample (n= 15) was 73% male, mean age of 61 (SD = 8.6), 53% Black, 53% with glycosylated hemoglobin level <9%, and 67% with prescribed insulin. The DD Scale is readily understood by veterans and interpreted. Thematic analysis indicated additional domains affecting DD and T2DM self-management, including access to care, comorbidities, disruptions in routine, fluctuations in emotions and behaviors, interactions with providers, lifelong nature of diabetes, mental health concerns, military as culture, personal characteristics, physical limitations, physical pain, sources of information and support, spirituality, and stigma. CONCLUSIONS This study describes how a veteran's military experience may contribute to DD in the context of T2DM self-management. Findings indicate clinicians and researchers should account for additional domains when developing self-management interventions and discussing self-management behaviors with individuals with T2DM.","Lewinski, Allison A; Shapiro, Abigail; Bosworth, Hayden B; Crowley, Matthew J; McCant, Felicia; Howard, Teresa; Jeffreys, Amy S; McConnell, Eleanor; Tanabe, Paula; Barcinas, Susan; Coffman, Cynthia J; King, Heather A",The science of diabetes self-management and care,https://doi.org/10.1177/26350106211043487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34559032/,257

The number of studies examining the symptoms of the otolaryngology system and organs in COVID-19 patients is limited. The purpose of this study is to show whether COVID-19 infections cause any changes in nasal physiology in adult patients by measuring the mucociliary clearance (MCC) time with the saccharin test. METHODS One hundred one patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection (group 1, n = 42 smokers and group 2, n = 59 nonsmokers) and 87 individuals without COVID-19 infection as the control group (group 3, n = 33 smokers and group 4, n = 54 nonsmokers) were included in the study. A saccharin test was used to evaluate the nasal MCC time. RESULTS Mucociliary clearance test averages of the groups were determined as 473.571 ± 263.684, 442.966 ± 228.463, 468.333 ± 267.367, 412.629 ± 192.179 seconds, respectively. When the test durations were examined, the group with the most prolonged MCC duration was determined as the smoking COVID (+) patient group (473.571 ± 263.684 seconds). The second group, with the most prolonged MCC duration, was determined as the smoking control group (468.333 ± 267.367 seconds). No statistically significant difference was found in intergroup mucociliary clearance time (P = 0.760). CONCLUSION Although the authors found that smoking and viral infections prolong the MCC duration in our study, they did not find a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of MCC duration.","Çeçen, Ayse; Bayraktar, Cem; Özgür, Abdulkadir; Akgül, Gökhan; Günal, Özgür",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000007699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935140/,257

We aimed to predict poor prognosis among severe patients to lead early intervention. METHODS The data of 534 hospitalized patients were assessed retrospectively. Risk factors and laboratory tests that might enable the prediction of prognosis defined as being transferred to the intensive care unit and/or exitus have been investigated. RESULTS At the admission, 398 of 534 patients (74.5%) were mild-moderate ill. It was determined that the male gender, advanced age, comorbidity were risk factors for severity. In order to estimate the severity of the disease, ROC analysis revealed that the areas under the curve (AUC) which were determined based on the optimal cut off values that were calculated for the variables of values of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR>3.69), C-reactive protein (CRP >46 mg/L), troponin I (>5.3 ng/L), lactate dehydrogenase LDH (>325 U/L), ferritin (>303 ug/L), D-dimer (>574 ug/L), neutrophil NE (> 4.99 x10 ^ 9/L), lymphocyte (LE <1.04 x10^9/L), SO2 (<%92) were 0.762, 0.757,0.742, 0.705, 0.698, 0.694,0.688, 0.678, 0.66, respectively. To predict mortality, AUC of values for optimal cut off troponin I (>7.4 ng/L), age (>62), SO2 (<%89), urea (>40 mg/dL), procalcitonin (>0.21 ug/L), CKMB (>2.6 ng/L) were 0.715, 0.685, 0.644, 0.632, 0.627, 0.617, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The clinical progress could be severe if the baseline values of NLR, CRP, troponin I, LDH, are above, LE is below the specified cut-off point. We found that the troponin I, elder age and SO2 values could predict mortality. This article is protected by copyright.

Increasing employment of physicians, changing practice models, new regulatory requirements, and market dynamics all affect medical practice; some changes may also place greater emphasis on the business of medicine. Fundamental ethical principles and professional values about the patient-physician relationship, the primacy of patient welfare over self-interest, and the role of medicine as a moral community and learned profession need to be applied to the changing environment, and physicians must consider the effect the practice environment has on their ethical and professional responsibilities. Recognizing that all health care delivery arrangements come with advantages, disadvantages, and salient questions for ethics and professionalism, this American College of Physicians policy paper examines the ethical implications of issues that are particularly relevant today, including incentives in the shift to value-based care, physician contract clauses that affect care, private equity ownership, clinical priority setting, and physician leadership.

Multiple biomarkers have been used to assess the ecotoxicity of arsenic, however, the mechanisms of toxicity remain unclear. This paper describes the exposure of the earthworm (Eisenia fetida) to natural soil with different As-V concentrations for 28 days, then biomarkers from oxidative stress and burrowing behavior were quantified to evaluate As-V stress. Dynamic changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (MDA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and antioxidant enzymes activity (Gpx, SOD, CAT) implied two stages of intensified stress responses and physiological adaptability. The transcriptional expression and regulation of antioxidant enzymes showed different responses. The mRNA expression of sod1 was up-regulated, while that of cat showed no significant change. The related regulators, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), showed dose-dependent activation, suggesting antioxidant defense induced by Nrf2 signaling. The burrowing behavior after 14-day exposure indicated that As-V inhibited burrowing activity, especially the burrow length and maximum burrow depth. These multiple biomarkers were integrated using a biomarker response index (BRI) model, which showed significant dose-effect relationship especially on day 28, and suggested that ATP was a sensitive and representative biomarker. This study provided evidence that burrowing activity, Nrf2 and HO-1 were useful biomarkers warranting inclusion into the BRI model. Arsenic toxicity was comprehensively understood through redox homeostasis regulation, biochemical and behavioral changes, and these results suggested new strategies for soil pollutants diagnosis.","Deng, Songge; Wu, Yizhao; Duan, Hanqi; Cavanagh, Jo-Anne E; Wang, Xiuhong; Qiu, Jiangping; Li, Yinsheng",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399332/,257
126065,Assessing health disparities in foods and beverages served in early care and education programs across Georgia.,2021-03-17,"We developed a two-layer, four-channel polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-capillary electrophoresis microdevice that integrates nucleic acid amplification, sample cleanup and concentration, capillary electrophoretic separation, and detection for multiplex analysis of four human respiratory viral pathogens, influenza A, influenza B, coronavirus OC43, and human metapneumovirus. Biotinylated and fluorescently labeled double-stranded (ds) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) amplification products are generated in a 100 nL PCR reactor incorporating an integrated heater and a temperature sensor. After amplification, the products are captured and concentrated in a cross-linked acrylamide gel capture matrix copolymerized with acrydite-functionalized streptavidin-capture agents. Thermal dehybridization releases the fluorescently labeled DNA strand for capillary electrophoresis injection, separation, and detection. Using plasmid standards containing the viral genes of interest, each target can be detected starting from as few as 10 copies/reactor. When a two-step reverse transcription PCR amplification is employed, the device can detect ribonucleic acid (RNA) analogues of all four viral targets with detection limits in the range of 25-100 copies/reactor. The utility of the microdevice for analyzing samples from nasopharyngeal swabs is demonstrated. When size-based separation is combined with four-color detection, this platform provides excellent product discrimination, making it readily extendable to higher-order multiplex assays. This portable microsystem is also suitable for performing automated assays in point-of-care diagnostic applications.","Thaitrong, Numrin; Liu, Peng; Briese, Thomas; Lipkin, W Ian; Chiesl, Thomas N; Higa, Yukiko; Mathies, Richard A",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/ac1020744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21114282/,257

Furthermore, patients with high-risk molecular features, such as TP53 mutations, show dismal outcome, with a median OS of 1.8 years, regardless of therapy used. Further studies have led to the development of six novel drugs approved for the treatment of relapse/refractory (R/R) MCL, leading to improved survival even in refractory or high-risk patients. AREAS COVERED This review covers clinical biological and molecular features that impact MCL outcome with current standards. Beyond the recognition of separate subentities, we review how high-risk molecular features have paved the way towards a new paradigm away from chemoimmunotherapy. EXPERT OPINION Progress in novel therapies and in routine diagnostics, particularly next-generation sequencing (NGS), support the development of new treatment strategies, not based on the dose intensity/age dichotomy, which may prevent the need for chemotherapy and improve outcome across MCL including in high-risk subsets.","Goy, Andre",Expert review of hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474086.2021.1950529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253131/,257

Berwick, MD, MPP.",2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The clinical benefit of endovascular stroke therapy has been demonstrated in several prospective randomized trials. However, in a relevant percentage of patients, mechanical thrombectomy bears the risk of causing new infarction in initially unaffected vascular territories through thrombus fragmentation and migration of clot debris. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of the balloon guide catheter (BGC) to effectively achieve flow arrest and thrombus aspiration during the intervention to avoid distal embolization. METHODS A retrospective study was performed in 139 patients between October 2010 and May 2016 to analyze occlusions in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) or internal carotid artery (ICA) by using a stent retriever with a BGC (n = 73) or a non-BGC (n = 66). The following data were collected: patient age and gender, along with history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia, and previous ischemic stroke. Data on procedure time, number of passes, and angiographic findings were also collected. The final reperfusion score was rated based on the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grading scale. Successful recanalization was defined as TICI 3 or 2b. RESULTS A total of 139 patients underwent mechanical thrombectomy with the stent retriever. Of the 139 patients, 73 (52.5%) underwent placement of a BGC. The mean age was 65.8 ± 13.5 years, and the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 11. The average initial NIHSS score was lower in the BGC group compared with the non-BGC group (mean, 11.2 ± 5.6 vs. 13.2 ± 5.6; P = 0.03). Patients with BGC had fewer incidences of previous ischemic stroke (12.3% vs. 28.8%; P = 0.01). The numbers of passes were similar between the two groups. The procedure time (99 ± 49.4 min vs. 124 ± 72.2 min; P = 0.02) and the time from onset of symptoms to procedure end (302 ± 102 min vs. 357.2 ± 136.1 min; P = 0.009) were shorter in the BGC group. TICI 3 or 2b recanalization scores were higher in the BGC group compared to the non-BGC group [63/73, 86.3% vs. 48/66, 72.7%; odds ratio (OR), 0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.2-1.4; P = 0.04]. Importantly, distal embolization was less frequent in the BGC group (5/73, 6.8% vs. 21/66, 31.8%; OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 2.2-18.0; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The risk of distal embolization was significantly decreased with the use of a BGC.","Lee, Dong Hoon; Sung, Jae Hoon; Kim, Sang Uk; Yi, Ho Jun; Hong, Jae Taek; Lee, Sang Won",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-017-3256-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28691137/,257

We sought to identify the incidence and risk factors for NOF after orbital exenteration. Study Design Retrospective chart review, systematic review, meta-analysis. Setting Tertiary care center. Participants Patients undergoing free flap reconstruction following orbital exenteration. Records were reviewed for clinicopathologic data, operative details, and outcomes. Main Outcome Measures Univariate analysis was used to assess risk factors for incidence of postoperative NOF. PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched for published reports on NOF after orbital exenteration. Rates of fistula and odds ratios for predictive factors were compared in a meta-analysis. Results Total 7 of 77 patients (9.1%) developed NOF; fistula formation was associated with ethmoid sinus involvement ( p < 0.05) and minor wound break down ( p < 0.05). On meta-analysis, pooled rates of fistula formation were 5.8% for free flap patients and 12.5% for patients receiving no reconstruction. Conclusion Immediate postoperative wound complications and medial orbital wall resection increased the risk for NOF. On review and meta-analysis, reconstruction of orbital exenteration defects decreased the risk for fistula formation, but published series did not demonstrate a significant decrease in risk with free flaps compared with other methods of reconstruction.","Tassone, Patrick; Gill, Kurren S; Hsu, David; Nyquist, Gurston; Krein, Howard; Bilyk, Jurij R; Murchison, Anna P; Evans, James J; Heffelfinger, Ryan N; Curry, Joseph M","Journal of neurological surgery.

Its counterpart over time, the effective reproduction number, is of value in assessing in real time whether interventions have brought an outbreak under control. In this paper, we use theoretical arguments and simulation to understand the relationship between estimation of the reproduction number based on a full continuous time epidemic model and 2 other recently developed estimators. All these methods make use of ""epidemic curve"" data and require assumptions about the generation time distribution. The 2 simplest estimators do not require information about the-often difficult to obtain-population size. The simplest estimator is shown to require further assumptions that are rarely valid in practical settings and to produce severely biased estimates compared to the others. Furthermore, we show that in general the parameters of the generation time distribution and the reproduction number are non-identified in the early stages of an incomplete outbreak. On the basis of these results, we recommend that, wherever possible, estimation of the basic and effective reproduction numbers should be based on a well-defined epidemic model; moreover, if external information is available then it should be incorporated in a Bayesian analysis.","Griffin, Jamie T; Garske, Tini; Ghani, Azra C; Clarke, Paul S",Biostatistics,https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20858771/,257

Early thyroidectomy and the efficacy of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors modified the natural history of MTC, with possibilities of cure or long-term control. The second main compound, pheochromocytoma, is reported with a variable penetrance, from 10 to 80% cases, depending on the mutation of RET. Pheochromocytoma constitutes the main disease to screen in patients with RET mutations. Pheochromocytoma clinical and biochemical diagnosis, as well as the way to treat it are thus crucial. This review will thus focus on the epidemiological specificities of MEN2-related pheochromocytoma, the genotype/phenotype relationship, the modern imaging modalities necessary to confirm the diagnosis in this hereditary context, as well as the optimal management and the possibilities of adrenal sparing surgery.

132764,COVID-19 Pandemic: A Serious Threat for Public Mental Health Globally.,2020,"BACKGROUND Intra-arterial thrombectomy is the gold standard treatment for large artery occlusive stroke. However, the evidence of its benefits is almost entirely based on trials delivered by experienced neurointerventionists working in established teams in neuroscience centres. Those responsible for the design and prospective reconfiguration of services need access to a comprehensive and complementary array of information on which to base their decisions. This will help to ensure the demonstrated effects from trials may be realised in practice and account for regional/local variations in resources and skill-sets. One approach to elucidate the implementation preferences and considerations of key experts is a Delphi survey. In order to support commissioning decisions, we aimed using an electronic Delphi survey to establish consensus on the options for future organisation of thrombectomy services among physicians with clinical experience in managing large artery occlusive stroke. METHODS A Delphi survey was developed with 12 options for future organisation of thrombectomy services in England. A purposive sampling strategy established an expert panel of stroke physicians from the British Association of Stroke Physicians (BASP) Clinical Standards and/or Executive Membership that deliver 24/7 intravenous thrombolysis. Options with aggregate scores falling within the lowest quartile were removed from the subsequent Delphi round. Options reaching consensus following the two Delphi rounds were then ranked in a final exercise by both the wider BASP membership and the British Society of Neuroradiologists (BSNR). RESULTS Eleven stroke physicians from BASP completed the initial two Delphi rounds. Three options achieved consensus, with subsequently wider BASP (97%, n = 43) and BSNR members (86%, n = 21) assigning the highest approval rankings in the final exercise for transferring large artery occlusive stroke patients to nearest neuroscience centre for thrombectomy based on local CT/CT Angiography. CONCLUSIONS The initial Delphi rounds ensured optimal reduction of options by an expert panel of stroke physicians, while subsequent ranking exercises allowed remaining options to be ranked by a wider group of experts within stroke to reach consensus. The preferred implementation option for thrombectomy is investigating suspected acute stroke patients by CT/CT Angiography and secondary transfer of large artery occlusive stroke patients to the nearest neuroscience (thrombectomy) centre.","Halvorsrud, Kristoffer; Flynn, Darren; Ford, Gary A; McMeekin, Peter; Bhalla, Ajay; Balami, Joyce; Craig, Dawn; White, Phil",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-018-2922-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29471828/,257

There are three mediators of angioedema, histamine, leukotriene, or bradykinin, each requiring different management. This article provides clinicians essential information for differentiating between these types of angioedema, including an overview of the underlying pathogenies of angioedema, and the subjective and objective findings that are useful in differentiating between angioedema types.

In humans, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome which presents edema, hemorrhage, intra-alveolar fibrin deposition, and vascular changes characterized by thrombus formation, micro-angiopathy and thrombosis. These clinical signs are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. In recent studies it has been noted that COVID-19 pandemic can affect patients of all ages, including children (even if less severely) who were initially thought to be immune. Kawasaki disease is an autoimmune acute febrile inflammatory condition, which primarily affects young children. The disease can present immunodeficiency with the inability of the immune system to fight inflammatory pathogens and leads to fever, rash, alterations of the mucous membranes, conjunctiva infection, pharyngeal erythema, adenopathy, and inflammation. In the COVID-19 period, virus infection aggravates the condition of Kawasaki disease, but it has also been noted that children affected by SARS-V-2 may develop a disease similar to Kawasaki's illness. However, it is uncertain whether the virus alone can give Kawasaki disease-like forms. As in COVID-19, Kawasaki disease and its similar forms are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by innate immunity cells such as macrophages and mast cells (MCs). In light of the above, it is therefore pertinent to think that by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines with new anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-37 and IL-38, it is possible to alleviate the symptoms of the disease and have a new available therapeutic tool. However, since Kawasaki and Kawasaki-like diseases present immunodeficiency, treatment with anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant molecules must be applied very carefully.","Ronconi, G; Teté, G; Kritas, S K; Gallenga, C E; Caraffa, Al; Ross, R; Conti, P",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/editorial-ronconi-e-59; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32476380/,257

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a systematic literature search in four databases [MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (via Ovid), Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library] and included studies focused on sexual dysfunction in men of all age groups undergoing transrectal (TRUS) or transperineal (TPBx) prostate biopsy for suspicion of prostate cancer. We included studies with the International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF-5) scores pre-biopsy and post-biopsy at 1, 3, or 6 months. We performed an effect size meta-analysis comparing patients' baseline IIEF-5 with post-biopsy IIEF-5. RESULTS We identified nine studies that met our inclusion criteria, of which 6 examined TRUS, 2 examined TPBx, and 1 examined both. At 1-month after biopsy, the mean IIEF-5 decreased by approximately 2.2 points as determined by the effect size (-0.43, p=0.002). However, at 3 and 6-months post-biopsy, there was no difference compared to baseline (effect size=-0.08 with p=0.52 and effect size=-0.11 with p=0.18, respectively). An exploratory subgroup analysis examining TRUS at 3-months showed a statistically significantly lower mean IIEF-5 score compared to baseline (p=0.047), corresponding to an approximately 1.25-point decrease in IIEF-5. CONCLUSIONS Prostate biopsy does cause a mild, transient decrease in average IIEF-5 scores at 1-month post-biopsy. However, this resolves at 3-months on average, and average IIEF-5 remains at baseline at 6-months post-biopsy.","Fainberg, J; Gaffney, C D; Pierce, H; Aboukhshaba, A; Chughtai, Bilal; Christos, P; Kashanian, J A",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ju.0000000000001398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026920/,257

As CHBs can fluctuate on a daily basis, this study examined how daily CHBs are associated with daily intention to quit smoking and daily number of cigarettes smoked before and after a quit date at the between- and within-person level. The study comprised a prospective longitudinal design and investigated 83 women and 83 men for 32 consecutive days during an ongoing joint self-set quit attempt. Daily CHBs varied from day to day and between individuals. At the between-person level, higher women's mean CHBs were associated with lower intention (b = -0.23, p = 0.04) and at the 10% level with more cigarettes smoked after the quit date (rate ratio (RR) = 1.92, p = 0.07). At the within-person level, women's higher than usual CHBs were unrelated to intention to quit, but were related to less smoking before (RR = 0.96, p = 0.03) and at the 10% level after the quit date (RR = 0.91, p = 0.09). A marginally positive association between daily CHBs and smoking at the within-person level emerged for men. The negative effect of daily CHBs at the between-person level on smoking seems to unfold after the quit attempt and for women only.","Amrein, Melanie A; Lüscher, Janina; Berli, Corina; Radtke, Theda; Scholz, Urte",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899272/,257

OBJECTIVES We examined vape shop non-compliance with state-ordered business closures during COVID-19, changes in their marketing and experiences among consumers. METHODS As part of a longitudinal study of vape retail in six metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs; Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, San Diego and Seattle), we conducted: (1) legal research to determine whether statewide COVID-19 orders required vape shops to close; (2) phone-based and web-based surveillance to assess vape shop activity in March-June 2020 during shelter-in-place periods; and (3) a concurrent online survey of e-cigarette users about their experiences with vape retail. RESULTS Non-essential business closure varied in timing/duration across states and applied to vape shops in California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma (for a brief period) and Washington (Georgia's orders were ambiguous). Surveillance analysis focused on the five MSAs in these states. Of 156 vape shops, 53.2% were open as usual, 11.5% permanently closed and 3.8% temporarily closed; 31.4% offered pick-up/delivery services. Among survey respondents (n=354, M age =23.9±4.6; 46.9% male, 71.8% white, 13.0% Hispanic), 27.4% worried their vape shop would close/go out of business during COVID-19; 7.3% said their vape shop did so. Few noticed increases in vape product delivery options (7.3%), discounts/price promotions (9.9%) and/or prices (9.3%). While 20.3% stockpiled vape products, 20.3% tried to reduce use and 15.8% tried to quit. CONCLUSIONS Many vape shops were non-compliant with state COVID-19 orders. E-cigarette users were as likely to stockpile vape products as to attempt to reduce or quit using e-cigarettes.","Berg, Carla J; Callanan, Rachel; Johnson, Trent O; Schliecher, Nina C; Sussman, Steve; Wagener, Theodore L; Meaney, Mark; Henriksen, Lisa",Tobacco control,https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-056171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077506/,257
139750,How COVID-19 Patient Narratives Concerning Reinfection Mirror Their Mental Health: A Case Series.,2021,"BACKGROUND The failure of sutures to maintain tissue in apposition is well characterized in hernia repairs. A mesh suture designed to facilitate tissue integration into and around the filaments may improve tissue hold and decrease suture pull-through. METHODS In vitro, the sutures were compared for resistance to pull-through in ballistics gel. In vivo, closure of midline laparotomy incisions was done with both sutures in 11 female pigs. Tissue segments were subsequently subjected to mechanical and histological testing. RESULTS The mesh suture had tensile characteristics nearly identical to those of 0-polypropylene suture. Mesh suture demonstrated greater resistance to pull-through than standard suture (mean(s.d.) 4.27(0.42) versus 2.23(0.48) N; P < 0.001) in vitro. In pigs, the ultimate tensile strength for repaired linea alba at 8 days was higher with mesh suture (320(57) versus 160(56) N; P < 0.001), as was the work to failure (24.6(14.2) versus 7.3(3.7) J; P < 0.001) and elasticity (128(9) versus 72(7) N/cm; P < 0.001) in comparison with 0-polypropylene suture. Histological examination at 8 and 90 days showed complete tissue integration of the mesh suture. CONCLUSION The novel mesh suture structure increased the strength of early wound healing in an experimental model. Surgical relevance Traditional sutures have the significant drawback of cutting and pulling through tissues in high-tension closures. A new mesh suture design with a flexible macroporous outer wall and a hollow core allows the tissues to grow into the suture, improving early wound strength and decreasing suture pull-through. This technology may dramatically increase the reliability of high-tension closures, thereby preventing incisional hernia after laparotomy. As suture pull-through is a problem relevant to all surgical disciplines, numerous additional indications are envisioned with mesh suture formulations of different physical properties and materials.","Dumanian, G A; Tulaimat, A; Dumanian, Z P",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26154703/,257
139800,Patient-generated health data and electronic health record integration: a scoping review.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Carotid artery stent placement is widely performed for treatment of carotid stenosis. The purpose of this study is to present our observations on cerebral vasoconstriction in ipsilateral anterior circulation during immediate poststenting angiography in patients with near-total occlusion of the proximal ICA. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patient data from December 2008 to December 2018. There were 28 patients with carotid near-total occlusion. Two neuroradiologists reviewed the final cerebral angiographic finding of carotid artery stent placement to evaluate the presence of vasoconstriction or vasodilation. RESULTS A total of 28 patients with near-total occlusion (mean ± standard deviation age, 69.0 ± 6.5 years; 92.9% male) were analyzed. Ten patients showed vasoconstriction in the treated territory, and 18 patients did not show vasoconstriction after carotid artery stenting. There were no statistically significant differences in comorbidity, frequency of symptomatic lesions, antiplatelet medication, mean procedure time, and initial NIHSS and baseline modified Rankin scale scores between the 2 groups. However, vasoconstriction is more likely to happen in patients with isolated territory from the contralateral anterior and posterior circulation (66.7% in the isolated territory group and 12.5% in the not-isolated territory group; P < .05). No headache or neurologic deficit was noted in all 10 patients with cerebral vasoconstriction. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral vasoconstriction may occur after carotid artery stenting more frequently than expected. It occurs more frequently in patients with near-total occlusion and with isolation of the cerebral circulation. A large-scale study is necessary to assess the clinical implications of cerebral vasoconstriction after carotid artery stenting.","Kang, C H; Roh, J; Yeom, J A; Ahn, S H; Park, M G; Park, K P; Baik, S K",AJNR.

This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of a new radiological score: the Basilar Artery on Computed Tomography Angiography (BATMAN) score. METHODS A retrospective analysis of consecutive stroke patients with basilar artery occlusion diagnosed on computed tomographic angiography was performed. BATMAN score is a 10-point computed tomographic angiography-based grading system which incorporates thrombus burden and the presence of collaterals. Reliability was assessed with intraclass coefficient correlation. Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of ≤3 at 3 months and successful reperfusion as thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b-3. BATMAN score was externally validated and compared with the Posterior Circulation Collateral score. RESULTS The derivation cohort included 83 patients with 41 in the validation cohort. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, BATMAN score had an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-0.9) in derivation cohort and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.6-0.9) in validation cohort. In logistic regression adjusted for age and clinical severity, BATMAN score of <7 was associated with poor outcome in derivation cohort (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.4-21; P=0.01), in validation cohort (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.4-33; P=0.01), and in endovascular patients, after adjustment for recanalization and time to treatment (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.2-18; P=0.01). BATMAN score of <7 was not associated with recanalization. Interrater agreement was substantial (intraclass coefficient correlation, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9). BATMAN score had greater accuracy compared with Posterior Circulation Collateral score (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS The addition of collateral quality to clot burden in BATMAN score seems to improve prognostic accuracy in basilar artery occlusion patients.","Alemseged, Fana; Shah, Darshan G; Diomedi, Marina; Sallustio, Fabrizio; Bivard, Andrew; Sharma, Gagan; Mitchell, Peter J; Dowling, Richard J; Bush, Steven; Yan, Bernard; Caltagirone, Carlo; Floris, Roberto; Parsons, Mark W; Levi, Christopher R; Davis, Stephen M; Campbell, Bruce C V",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.116.015492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228577/,257
140340,COVID 19 uncertainty.,2020-03-01,"Background Informed consent (IC) is linked to the ethical principle of respecting patient autonomy, respect for human rights and ethical practice, while in many countries it is a standard procedure. Anecdotally, it should be noted that in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in many instances ICs are not obtained systematically. To date, no research appears to have been conducted on this matter. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practice of obtaining IC from patients among health care providers (HCP) in the DRC. Methods This was a cross-sectional study, with a convenient sampling of 422 participants. Data from the questions were collected on an imported Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for review at INSTAT.TM The authors set IC's accurate knowledge and practice at 80% or higher. The Fisher Exact test was used to compare categorical association results, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Results showed that giving information in detail to patients on their medical condition was associated with formal training on medical ethics and IC (p: 0.0028; OR: 1.894; CI: 1.246 to 2.881), which was also associated with answering the patient's questions in detail (p: 0.0035; OR: 1.852; CI: 1.236 to 2.774). About 127(30.09 %) of participants scored 80% or higher. Extracurricular training was associated with withholding information from patients, up to 27 times more than other factors (p< 0.0001; OR: 27.042; CI: 13.628 to 53.657). when it comes to get IC, HCP with many years of practice scored better than others, in one of the question the odd ratio was closer to 7 (p< 0.0001; OR: 6.713; CI: 4.352 to 10.356). Only 47(11.14%) of the participants scored 80% or more of the questions about practice of IC. Conclusion For a variety of reasons, knowledge and practice of IC among HCPs was very low. A common programme for the country as part of formal training might lead to an improvement. In addition, patients' education on IC should be displayed in waiting areas at all medical centres.","Nzaumvila, Doudou; Ntotolo, Patrick; Govender, Indiran; Lukanu, Philip; Niati, Jd Landu; Sanduku, Didier; Bongongo, Tombo",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.58; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394330/,257

The removal of specimens excised during surgery has been a challenge that has been answered by the use of power morcellation. With this study we sought to assess the feasibility of power morcellation within a specimen bag. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study including patients from a private practice in suburban Chicago, Illinois, who underwent contained electromechanical power morcellation during a laparoscopic or robot-assisted hysterectomy or myomectomy from May 2014 through December 2015. Contained power morcellation was performed with the Espiner EcoSac 230 (Espiner Medical Ltd., North Somerset, United Kingdom) specimen bag. Descriptive statistics were performed for both categorical and continuous data. RESULTS Of the 187 procedures performed, 73.8% were myomectomies, and 26.2% were hysterectomies. The patients' mean age was 40 (range, 25-54) years and mean body mass index was 28.7 (range, 17.3-57.6). The average specimen weight was 300 g, with the largest weighing 2134 g. Estimated blood loss averaged 98.4 mL. The postoperative admission rate was 12.3%, most of which were due to nausea and urinary retention. Seventeen patients (9.1%) had postoperative complications, most of which were minor, and 4 (2.1%) were readmitted. There were no bag failures or complications that were due to the use of the specimen bag or to power morcellation. CONCLUSIONS Performing electromechanical power morcellation within the Espiner EcoSac 230 specimen bag was successfully performed in 187 patients with no bag-related complications. This method of contained power morcellation is feasible, reliable, and reproducible, even for a large specimen.","Steller, Courtney; Cholkeri-Singh, Aarathi; Sasaki, Kirsten; Miller, Charles E",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2016.00095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28352146/,257

145732,Using Community Feedback to Guide the COVID-19 Response in Sub-Saharan Africa: Red Cross and Red Crescent Approach and Lessons Learned from Ebola.,2021-01-27,"To characterize human emotions, researchers have increasingly utilized Automatic Facial Expression Analysis (AFEA), which automates the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and translates the facial muscular positioning into the basic universal emotions. There is broad interest in the application of FACS for assessing consumer expressions as an indication of emotions to consumer product-stimuli. However, the translation of FACS to characterization of emotions is elusive in the literature. The aim of this systematic review is to give an overview of how FACS has been used to investigate human emotional behavior to consumer product-based stimuli. The search was limited to studies published in English after 1978, conducted on humans, using FACS or its action units to investigate affect, where emotional response is elicited by consumer product-based stimuli evoking at least one of the five senses. The search resulted in an initial total of 1,935 records, of which 55 studies were extracted and categorized based on the outcomes of interest including (i) method of FACS implementation; (ii) purpose of study; (iii) consumer product-based stimuli used; and (iv) measures of affect validation. Most studies implemented FACS manually (73%) to develop products and/or software (20%) and used consumer product-based stimuli that had known and/or defined capacity to evoke a particular affective response, such as films and/or movie clips (20%); minimal attention was paid to consumer products with low levels of emotional competence or with unknown affective impact. The vast majority of studies (53%) did not validate FACS-determined affect and, of the validation measures that were used, most tended to be discontinuous in nature and only captured affect as it holistically related to an experience. This review illuminated some inconsistencies in how FACS is carried out as well as how emotional response is inferred from facial muscle activation. This may prompt researchers to consider measuring the total consumer experience by employing a variety of methodologies in addition to FACS and its emotion-based interpretation guide. Such strategies may better conceptualize consumers' experience with products of low, unknown, and/or undefined capacity to evoke an affective response such as product prototypes, line extensions, etc.","Clark, Elizabeth A; Kessinger, J'Nai; Duncan, Susan E; Bell, Martha Ann; Lahne, Jacob; Gallagher, Daniel L; O'Keefe, Sean F",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528361/,257

Despite the improvement of information and communications technology (ICT), Italian medical doctors' (MDs) education system seems inadequate in this area. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, societies are waking up to their limitations. The aim of this paper is to analyze the Italian status quo in DH. METHODS The Italian Young Medical Doctors Association (Segretariato Italiano Giovani Medici - SIGM) proposed a web-based survey to assess DH awareness and previous knowledge among young doctors. Investigated areas were: big data, -omics technology and predictive models, artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things, telemedicine, social media, blockchain and clinical-data storage. RESULTS A total of 362 participants answered to the survey. Only 13% had experience in big data during clinical or research activities, 13% in -omics technology and predictive models, 13% in AI, 6% had experience in internet of things, 22% experienced at least one telemedicine tool and 23% of the participants declared that during their clinical activities data collection was paper-driven.

148508,Workplace Mental Health: Application of a Population Health Approach of Proactive Screening to Identify Risk and Engage in Care.,2020-01-04,"Diffusion studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were conducted on two model surfactant solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide/sodium salicylate (CTAB/NaSal) and cetylpyridinium chloride/sodium salicylate (CPCl/NaSal). By increasing the salt-to-surfactant concentration ratio, these systems display two peaks in the zero-shear viscosity and relaxation time, which are indicative of transitions from linear to branched micellar networks. The goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of NMR diffusometry to different types of micellar microstructures and identify the mechanism(s) of surfactant self-diffusion in micellar solutions. At low salt-to-surfactant concentration ratios, for which wormlike micelles are linear, the surfactant self-diffusion is best described by a mean squared displacement, Z2, that varies as Z2 ∝ Tdiff0.5, where Tdiff is the diffusion time. As the salt concentration increases to establish branched micelles, Z2 ∝ Tdiff, indicating a Brownian-like self-diffusion of surfactant molecules in branched micelles. This result indicates that NMR diffusometry is capable of differentiating various types of micellar microstructures. In addition, the self-diffusion coefficient of the surfactant molecules in linear and branched micelles are determined, for the first time, by comparing the existing restricted diffusion models and are shown to be much slower than the diffusion of proton molecules in the bulk. Moreover, in linear and moderately branched wormlike micelles, the dominant mechanism of surfactant self-diffusion is through the curvilinear diffusion of the surfactant molecules along the contour length of the micelles, whereas in the branched micelles, before the second viscosity maxima, the surfactant self-diffusion could arise from a combination of micellar breakage, exchange between micelles and/or the bulk.","Holder, Samuel W; Grant, Samuel C; Mohammadigoushki, Hadi",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c03486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730853/,257

Instillation of 0.8-1.5 cc of N-butyl cyanoacrylate into ureter proximal to the Amplatzer plug was performed. This was followed by another set of 8-12-mm type-I or type-II Amplatzer vascular plugs in a technique referred to as the ""sandwich technique."" RESULTS Five ureters in three patients were occluded utilizing the above-described technique during the 4-year study period. Mean maximum size Amplatzer used per ureter was 10.8 mm (range, 8-12). One ureter required three Amplatzer plugs and the rest required two. Two patients (3 ureters) were clinically successful with complete resolution of symptoms in 36-48 h. The third patient (2 ureters) was partly successful and required a second Amplatzer-N-butyl cyanoacrylate sandwich technique embolization. The mean clinical follow-up was 11.3 months (range, 1.7-29.2). CONCLUSIONS The Amplatzer-N-butyl cyanoacrylate-Amplatzer sandwich technique for occluding the distal ureter is safe and effective with a quick (probably due to the N-butyl cyanoacrylate) and durable (probably due to the Amplatzer plugs) clinical response.","Saad, Wael E A; Kalagher, S; Turba, U C; Sabri, S S; Park, A-W; Stone, J; Angle, J F; Matsumoto, A H",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-012-0510-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23152040/,257
149313,Using social robot PLEO to enhance the well-being of hospitalised children.,2020-08-25,"BACKGROUND Few studies have focused on pharmacologic diabetes therapy adjustments at hospital discharge. This randomized clinical trial compared a GLP-1 receptor analog with basal insulin at hospital discharge in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. METHODS A total of 273 patients with HbA1c 7-10% were randomised to liraglutide (n = 136) or glargine (n = 137) at hospital discharge. The primary endpoint was difference in HbA1c at 12 and 26 weeks. Secondary endpoints included hypoglycaemia, changes in body weight, and achievement of HbA1c <7% without hypoglycaemia or weight gain. RESULTS Between-group HbA1c difference at 12 weeks and 26 weeks was -0.28%, 95%CI: (-0.64, 0.09), and 26 weeks was -0.55%, 95%CI (-1.01, -0.09) in favour of liraglutide. Liraglutide treatment resulted in lower frequency of hypoglycaemia <3.9 mmol/L (13% vs 23% p = 0.04), but there was no difference in the rate of clinically significant hypoglycaemia <3.0 mmol/L. Compared to glargine, liraglutide treatment was associated with greater weight loss at 26 weeks (-4.7 ± 7.7 Kg vs. -0.6 ± 11.5 kg, p < 0.001) and in the proportion of patients with HbA1c <7% without hypoglycaemia was 48% vs 33% (p = 0.05) at 12 weeks and 45% vs 33% (p = 0.14) at 26 weeks in liraglutide vs glargine insulin. The proportion of patients with HbA1c <7% without hypoglycaemia and no weight gain were higher with liraglutide at 12 (41% vs 24%, p = 0.005) and 26 weeks (39% vs 22%, p = 0.014). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher with liraglutide than with glargine (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Compared to insulin glargine, treatment with liraglutide at hospital discharge resulted in better glycaemic control and greater weight loss, but increased gastrointestinal adverse events.

150258,The psychological impact of preexisting mental and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-01-14,"Myocardial infarction (MI) in rats is accompanied by apoptosis in the limbic system and a behavioural syndrome similar to models of depression. We have already shown that probiotics can reduce post-MI apoptosis and designed the present study to determine if probiotics can also prevent post-MI depressive behaviour. We also tested the hypothesis that probiotics achieve their central effects through changes in the intestinal barrier. MI was induced in anaesthetised rats via 40-min transient occlusion of the left anterior coronary artery. Sham rats underwent the same surgical procedure without actual coronary occlusion. For 7 d before MI and between the seventh post-MI day and euthanasia, half the MI and sham rats were given one billion live bacterial cells of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 per d dissolved in water, while the remaining animals received only the vehicle (maltodextrin). Depressive behaviour was evaluated 2 weeks post-MI in social interaction, forced swimming and passive avoidance step-down tests. Intestinal permeability was evaluated by oral administration with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, 4 h before euthanasia. MI rats displayed less social interaction and impaired performance in the forced swimming and passive avoidance step-down tests compared to the sham controls (P < 0·05). Probiotics reversed the behavioural effects of MI (P < 0·05), but did not alter the behaviour of sham rats. Intestinal permeability was increased in MI rats and reversed by probiotics. In conclusion, L. helveticus R0052 and B. longum R0175 combination interferes with the development of post-MI depressive behaviour and restores intestinal barrier integrity in MI rats.","Arseneault-Bréard, Jessica; Rondeau, Isabelle; Gilbert, Kim; Girard, Stéphanie-Anne; Tompkins, Thomas A; Godbout, Roger; Rousseau, Guy",The British journal of nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007114511005137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21933458/,257

An intensive care doctor answers some common questions.,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND The lymph node (LN) ratio (LNR) has been proposed as a sensitive prognosticator in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), especially when the number of LNs harvested is insufficient. We investigated the association between the LNR and survival in patients with locally advanced ESCC who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and explored whether the LNR is a prognosticator in these patients when stratified by their response to NAC. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 199 locally advanced ESCC patients who received curative resection after NAC between January 2011 and December 2019. The predictive accuracy of the adjusted X-tile cut-off values for LNR of 0 and 0.13 was compared with that in the Union for International Cancer Control pathological N (UICC pN) categories. The association between survival rate and clinicopathological features was examined. RESULTS Multivariate analysis identified that the LNR was an independent risk factor for recurrence-free survival [RFS; hazard ratio (HR) 6.917, p < 0.001] and overall survival (OS) (HR 4.998, p < 0.001). Moreover, even when stratified by response to NAC, the LNR was a significant independent risk factor for RFS and OS (p < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curves identified that the prognostic accuracy of the LNR tended to be better than that of the UICC pN factor in all cases and responders. CONCLUSION The LNR had a significant prognostic value in patients with locally advanced ESCC, including in those who received NAC.","Kano, Kazuki; Yamada, Takanobu; Komori, Keisuke; Watanabe, Hayato; Takahashi, Kosuke; Fujikawa, Hirohito; Numata, Masakatsu; Aoyama, Toru; Tamagawa, Hiroshi; Yukawa, Norio; Rino, Yasushi; Masuda, Munetaka; Ogata, Takashi; Oshima, Takashi",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-021-10240-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114182/,257

The nature and extent of critical issues raised by this ongoing crisis, including challenging ethical dilemmas for the health care profession, is likely to have an indelible impact on the professional identity formation (PIF) of learners and practitioners across the trajectory of the professional lifecycle. The lifelong process of PIF for health care practitioners, from learner through independent practice, is supported in medical education by intentional reflection, relationships within community of practice include guidance from mentoring, as well as resilience, both emotional and moral. We consider how grappling with ethical dilemmas related to the COVID-19 pandemic can challenge, inform, and even potentially transform the PIF process, thereby supporting development of a morally resilient, humanistic professional identity in health care trainees and health care professionals.","Wald, Hedy S; Ruddy, Meaghan",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,https://doi.org/10.1097/ceh.0000000000000346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851809/,257

METHODS A comprehensive literature search was undertaken in the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid CENTRAL), and Scopus electronic databases. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that assessed adverse events (AEs) with opioids in patients with OA were eligible for inclusion. Two authors appraised titles, abstracts and full-text papers for suitability and then assessed the studies for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data and selective outcomes reporting. The primary outcomes of interest were gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, nervous system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, as well as overall severe and serious AEs and drug-related AEs. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to AEs (i.e. the number of participants who stopped the treatment due to an AE) and total number of AEs (i.e. the number of patients who experienced any AE at least once). RESULTS Database searches identified 2189 records, from which, after exclusions, 17 papers were included in the meta-analysis. More disorders of the lower GI tract (constipation, fecaloma) were reported with both immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) formulations of opioids versus placebo: IR opioids (relative risk [RR] 5.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.42-7.89); ER opioids (RR 4.22, 95% CI 3.44-5.17). The risk of upper GI AEs increased fourfold with ER opioids compared with placebo (RR 4.03, 95% CI 0.87-18.62), and the risk of nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite increased four- to fivefold with both formulations: IR opioids (RR 3.39, 95% CI 2.22-5.18); ER opioids (RR 4.03, 95% CI 3.37-4.83). An increased risk of dermatologic AEs (rash and pruritis; IR opioids: RR 3.60, 95% CI 1.74-7.43; ER opioids: RR 7.87, 95% CI 5.20-11.89) and central nervous system disorders (dizziness, headache, fatigue, somnolence, insomnia; IR opioids: RR 2.76, 95% CI 1.90-4.02; ER opioids: RR 2.76, 95% CI 2.19-3.47) was found with all opioid formulations versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm that there are considerable safety and tolerability issues surrounding the use of opioids in OA, and support the recommendation of international and national guidelines to use opioids in OA after other analgesic options, and for short time periods.","Fuggle, Nicholas; Curtis, Elizabeth; Shaw, Sarah; Spooner, Laura; Bruyère, Olivier; Ntani, Georgia; Parsons, Camille; Conaghan, Philip G; Corp, Nadia; Honvo, Germain; Uebelhart, Daniel; Baird, Janis; Dennison, Elaine; Reginster, Jean-Yves; Cooper, Cyrus",Drugs & aging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40266-019-00666-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31073926/,257

Based on a positive PCR assay for scrub typhus, she was treated with intravenous doxycycline and azithromycin. Despite reduction in fever, her oxygenation further declined. Following a risk-benefits assessment, we decided to ventilate her in prone position for 8 hours a day for three consecutive days using a checklist-based protocol. Her oxygenation indices and lung compliance markedly improved over this period, and she was extubated a day later.

Based on a study of 1,051,032 23andMe research participants, we report genetic and nongenetic associations with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, respiratory symptoms and hospitalization. Using trans-ancestry genome-wide association studies, we identified a strong association between blood type and COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as a gene-rich locus on chromosome 3p21.31 that is more strongly associated with outcome severity. Hospitalization risk factors include advancing age, male sex, obesity, lower socioeconomic status, non-European ancestry and preexisting cardiometabolic conditions. While non-European ancestry was a significant risk factor for hospitalization after adjusting for sociodemographics and preexisting health conditions, we did not find evidence that these two primary genetic associations explain risk differences between populations for severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Shelton, Janie F; Shastri, Anjali J; Ye, Chelsea; Weldon, Catherine H; Filshtein-Sonmez, Teresa; Coker, Daniella; Symons, Antony; Esparza-Gordillo, Jorge; Aslibekyan, Stella; Auton, Adam",Nature genetics,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00854-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33888907/,257
152358,Patterns of Mental Health Care Before Initiation of Telemental Health Services.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Decision-making in initiating life-sustaining health technology is complex and often conducted at time-critical junctures in clinical care. Many of these decisions have profound, often irreversible, consequences for the child and family, as well as potential benefits for functioning, health and quality of life. Yet little is known about what influences these decisions. A systematic review of reasoning identified the range of reasons clinicians give in the literature when initiating technology dependence in a child, and as a result helps determine the range of influences on these decisions. METHODS Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Web of Science, ASSIA and Global Health Library databases were searched to identify all reasons given for the initiation of technology dependence in a child. Each reason was coded as a broad and narrow reason type, and whether it supported or rejected technology dependence. RESULTS 53 relevant papers were retained from 1604 publications, containing 116 broad reason types and 383 narrow reason types. These were grouped into broad thematic categories: clinical factors, quality of life factors, moral imperatives and duty and personal values; and whether they supported, rejected or described the initiation of technology dependence. The majority were conceptual or discussion papers, less than a third were empirical studies. Most discussed neonates and focused on end-of-life care. CONCLUSIONS There is a lack of empirical studies on this topic, scant knowledge about the experience of older children and their families in particular; and little written on choices made outside 'end-of-life' care. This review provides a sound basis for empirical research into the important influences on a child's potential technology dependence.","Alexander, Denise; Quirke, Mary Brigid; Berry, Jay; Eustace-Cook, Jessica; Leroy, Piet; Masterson, Kate; Healy, Martina; Brenner, Maria",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-107099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282042/,257

A Multi-Source Qualitative Study.",2021-10-07,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a considerable threat to the swine industry and implementing biosecurity measures is essential for the control of its transmission. The aims of this study were: (1) to describe biosecurity practices in production sites located in a moderate density (MD) and a high density (HD) pig area according to production type; (2) to group sites in different patterns according to their biosecurity practices; and (3) to determine the geographical distribution of sites according to biosecurity patterns. Biosecurity practices were selected based on PRRS epidemiology. A questionnaire was completed on 125 breeding sites (MD=54; HD=71) and 120 growing (HD) sites, between 2005 and 2008. Depending on area and production type, the frequency of biosecurity practices used ranged from 0 to 2% for barrier at site entrance, 0 to 19% for use of shower, 25 to 35% for washing truck between loads of pigs, 51 to 57% for absence of rendering or rendering without access to the site, and 26 to 51% for absence of gilt purchase or purchase with quarantine. Better practices pertaining to entrance protocol (i.e. ""no-entry"" sign, shower, ≥24 h downtime) were reported more frequently on breeding sites in the MD than the HD area (P<0.05). In the HD area, growing sites had in general a lower level of biosecurity than breeding sites. Using a two-step clustering procedure performed separately for breeding and growing sites, two different patterns were obtained for each production type, which corresponded to a high and low level of biosecurity. For breeding sites, a higher biosecurity level was observed at sites located away from other pig sites, set at more than 300 m from the public road, having higher sow inventory, or being part of an integrated production (P<0.05). Spatial clusters of sites for each biosecurity pattern were detected. This study identified some shortcomings regarding biosecurity that should be addressed before implementing any PRRSV regional control. Vicinity of sites with different biosecurity levels also suggests difficulties in planning priorities of intervention based on geographical distribution of sites.","Lambert, Marie-Ève; Poljak, Zvonimir; Arsenault, Julie; D'Allaire, Sylvie",Preventive veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.12.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22243985/,257

However, limited research has examined the influence of depressive symptoms on PNF efficacy. This study examined symptoms of depression as a moderator of college student response to a computerized PNF intervention for alcohol use. METHODS College students (N = 212, 59% female) who reported drinking in a typical week completed baseline and one-month assessments as part of a previously published intervention trial. We randomized participants to alcohol PNF (n = 153) or assessment only (n = 59). We used regression models to examine the interaction between PNF and symptoms of depression on alcohol outcomes at one-month follow-up. RESULTS One in four participants screened positive for clinically significant symptoms of depression. Depressive symptoms did not moderate intervention effects on drinking quantity. However, PNF was only associated with reduced frequency of heavy episodic drinking and lower probability of any alcohol-related consequence in the context of mild to moderate (not minimal) symptoms of depression. CONCLUSIONS PNF is more effective than assessment alone in reducing drinking quantity, regardless of symptoms of depression. However, it may only be more effective in decreasing frequency of heavy episodic drinking and the probability of alcohol-related consequences among those experiencing mild to moderate (as opposed to minimal) symptoms of depression. Alcohol intervention trials should assess symptoms of depression and consider them in data analysis.","Miller, Mary Beth; Hall, Nicole; DiBello, Angelo M; Park, Chan Jeong; Freeman, Lindsey; Meier, Ellen; Leavens, Eleanor L S; Leffingwell, Thad R",Journal of substance abuse treatment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600626/,257

EC5026 acts on the cytochrome P450 branch of the arachidonate cascade to stabilize epoxides of polyunsaturated fatty acids (EpFA), which are natural mediators that reduce pain, resolve inflammation, and maintain normal blood pressure. EC5026 is a slow-tight binding transition-state mimic that inhibits the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) at picomolar concentrations. The sEH rapidly degrades EpFA; thus, inhibiting sEH increases EpFA in vivo and confers beneficial effects. This mechanism addresses disease states by shifting endoplasmic reticulum stress from promoting cellular senescence and inflammation toward cell survival and homeostasis. We describe the synthesis and optimization of EC5026 and its development through human Phase 1a trials with no drug-related adverse events. Additionally, we outline fundamental work leading to discovery of the analgesic and inflammation-resolving CYP450 branch of the arachidonate cascade.","Hammock, Bruce D; McReynolds, Cindy B; Wagner, Karen; Buckpitt, Alan; Cortes-Puch, Irene; Croston, Glenn; Lee, Kin Sing Stephen; Yang, Jun; Schmidt, William K; Hwang, Sung Hee",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550801/,257

We aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone fundoscopy with traditional direct ophthalmoscopy for optic disc interpretation, with e-learning support. METHODS We conducted a randomised, cross-over study of 102 medical students. Students were offered e-learning for optic disc interpretation. A fundoscopy objective structured clinical examination was conducted after an introductory lecture and ten-minute practical training session on smartphone fundoscopy and traditional ophthalmoscopy. Participants examined patients and simulator slides with a randomised crossover between smartphone (D-eye [Padova, Italy] or iExaminer [Welch Allyn, Macquarie Park, Australia]) and traditional ophthalmoscopy (Welch Allyn). Optic discs were graded independently by three masked ophthalmologists. The primary outcome was the ability to interpret an optic disc as normal or abnormal. Secondary outcomes included other optic disc aspects; student preferences; and e-learning performance. RESULTS Students' agreement with the gold standard for an abnormal or normal disc was significantly greater using a smartphone (74.4%) than with direct ophthalmoscopy (68.1%, p=0.032). More students preferred smartphone (74%) over direct ophthalmoscopy (26%, p<0.001). E-learning led to an improvement in optic disc interpretation scores (mean improvement = 4.5%, 95%CI = 3.7-5.2, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Medical students are more accurate at recognising an abnormal optic disc using smartphone fundoscopy than traditional direct ophthalmoscopy, and have a strong preference for smartphone fundoscopy. E-learning may improve the interpretation of optic disc abnormalities. Smartphone fundoscopy may mitigate some technical challenges of fundoscopy and reinvigorate use of this valuable clinical examination. This article is protected by copyright.

156561,The relationship between fear of COVID-19 and mental health problems: A meta-analysis.,2021-02-27,"BACKGROUND International travel poses a risk of destination-specific illness and may contribute to the global spread of infectious diseases. Despite this, little is known about the health characteristics and pretravel healthcare of US international travelers, particularly those at higher risk of travel-associated illness. METHODS We formed a national consortium (Global TravEpiNet) of 18 US clinics registered to administer yellow fever vaccination. We collected data regarding demographic and health characteristics, destinations, purpose of travel, and pretravel healthcare from 13235 international travelers who sought pretravel consultation at these sites from January 2009 through January 2011. RESULTS The destinations and itineraries of Global TravEpiNet travelers differed from those of the overall population of US international travelers. The majority of Global TravEpiNet travelers were visiting low- or lower-middle-income countries, and Africa was the most frequently visited region. Seventy-five percent of travelers were visiting malaria-endemic countries, and 38% were visiting countries endemic for yellow fever. Fifty-nine percent of travelers reported ≥1 medical condition. Atovaquone/proguanil was the most commonly prescribed antimalarial drug, and most travelers received an antibiotic for self-treatment of travelers' diarrhea. Hepatitis A and typhoid were the most frequently administered vaccines. CONCLUSIONS Data from Global TravEpiNet provide insight into the characteristics and pretravel healthcare of US international travelers who are at increased risk of travel-associated illness due to itinerary, purpose of travel, or existing medical conditions.

A narrative review.,2021-05-30,"OBJECTIVE To test if three-dimensional (3D) cine spatial frequency-temporal frequency Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique (k-t BLAST) is suitable for rapid evaluation of global and regional left ventricular (LV) functional parameters and to evaluate the influence of gadolinium administration. MATERIALS AND METHODS Parameters describing global and regional LV function were evaluated in 50 subjects using a two-dimensional (2D) steady-state free precession (SSFP) and pre- and postcontrast 3D k-t BLAST techniques. Data analyses included contrast-to-noise ratio analyses, and statistical evaluations included Bland-Altman, Cohen's kappa and analysis of variance techniques. RESULTS Bland-Altman analyses revealed that the ejection fraction computed using the 3D k-t BLAST sequences before (bias+/-2S.D., 2.2+/-8.8) and after contrast administration (bias+/-2S.D., 2.7+/-7.6 mol) was comparable to the 2D SSFP technique. Similar agreement was noted for other global LV parameters. The myocardium-to-blood contrast in the apical slices was better in the 3D k-t BLAST sequence after contrast administration than before. Cohen's kappa values demonstrated good agreement between the sequences for evaluating regional wall motion. CONCLUSIONS 3D k-t BLAST can yield global and regional LV functional parameters comparable to those of the 2D SSFP technique in substantially shorter scan times. In 3D k-t BLAST images, myocardium-to-blood contrast in the apical slices is better after contrast administration.","Huber, Steffen; Muthupillai, Raja; Mojibian, Hamid; Cheong, Benjamin; Kouwenhoven, Marc; Flamm, Scott D",Magnetic resonance imaging,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2008.01.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486390/,257
159421,Increased risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infection in fully vaccinated patients with substance use disorders in the United States between December 2020 and August 2021.,2021-10-05,"INTRODUCTION Bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in early childhood worldwide. The presence of more than one pathogen may influence the natural history of acute bronchiolitis in infants. OBJECTIVE To investigate the relevance of dual viral infection in infants with severe bronchiolitis hospitalized in a short-term unit compared with those in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). STUDY DESIGN One hundred eighty infants <1 year old hospitalized with bronchiolitis in a short-term unit (n = 92) or admitted to the PICU (n = 88) during 2 consecutive winter seasons 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 were evaluated. Molecular biology and standard methods were used to diagnose human respiratory viruses in nasal/throat swabs and nasal aspirates. Clinical data related to host factors and viral prevalence were compared among infants requiring or not PICU support. RESULTS A viral agent was identified in 96.1% of infants with bronchiolitis. Respiratory syncytial virus (70.6% and 73.6%, respectively in the short-term unit and PICU) and rhinovirus (18.5% and 25.3%, respectively in the short-term unit and PICU) were the main detected respiratory viruses in infants hospitalized in both units. No significant difference in viral prevalence was observed between the populations studied. From multivariate analysis, infants with coinfections were 2.7 times (95% CI: 1.2-6.2) more at risk for PICU admission than those with a single infection. Respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus were the viruses most frequently identified in mixed infections in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis. CONCLUSIONS Dual viral infection is a relevant risk factor for the admission of infants with severe bronchiolitis to the PICU.","Richard, Nathalie; Komurian-Pradel, Florence; Javouhey, Etienne; Perret, Magali; Rajoharison, Alain; Bagnaud, Audrey; Billaud, Geneviève; Vernet, Guy; Lina, Bruno; Floret, Daniel; Paranhos-Baccalà, Gláucia",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31815b4935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18277932/,257

These techniques can train the weights of networks on large datasets as well as fine tuning the weights of pre-trained networks on small datasets. Due to the small COVID-19 dataset available, the pre-trained neural networks can be used for diagnosis of coronavirus. However, these techniques applied on chest CT image is very limited till now. Hence, the main aim of this paper to use the pre-trained deep learning architectures as an automated tool to detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 in chest CT. A DenseNet201 based deep transfer learning (DTL) is proposed to classify the patients as COVID infected or not i.e. COVID-19 (+) or COVID (-). The proposed model is utilized to extract features by using its own learned weights on the ImageNet dataset along with a convolutional neural structure. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the propose DTL model on COVID-19 chest CT scan images. Comparative analyses reveal that the proposed DTL based COVID-19 classification model outperforms the competitive approaches.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

One of the main challenges for clinicians is accurate identification of COVID-19 infected patients and then isolating them to prevent the community spreading. Therefore, detection of COVID cases is of great importance. In this paper, we proposed an ensemble deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases from the chest computed tomography (CT) images. Three deep CNN models are designed, trained and validated with CT images by tuning the various hyperparameters of the models. Combining the prediction values of these models to enhance the prediction accuracy reducing the overall false prediction rate, ensemble hard voting rules is applied to classify the COVID and Non-COVID cases. Experimental results achieved the overall accuracy of 96% and sensitivity of 97%. The proposed model can make predictions from the CT images within seconds with higher precision which can be a faster option comparing to the usual reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) technique. © 2021 IEEE.","Foysal, M.; Aowlad Hossain, A.

The measures taken during this period affect dietary patterns. Since people were requested to stay at home, the frequency of people eating with their family increased during this stage. To examine the characteristics and changes in the eating lifestyle of people who increased family meals during the state of emergency. A cross-sectional study involving 6,000 individuals aged 20–65 years was conducted via an internet survey developed by a Japanese research company. We compared the characteristics and changes of the eating lifestyle of participants before and during the state of emergency. Chi-squared tests were used to compare 3 groups: people who increased, not changed, and decreased family meals during the state of emergency. A total of 1,293 (21.6%) participants ate more with their families during the state of emergency. Compared to people who decreased or not the changed frequency of family meals, people who increased the frequency of family meals had a higher level of education, were female, were living with someone, and/or had a higher household income in 2019 (all P &lt; 0.001). They also ate a more nutritionally balanced diet, vegetables, and fruits, and felt that they changed to a healthier eating lifestyle during the state of emergency (all P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, they were more likely to cook more and spend more at dinner and were less likely to eat out with their friends (all P &lt; 0.001). Although the state of emergency was difficult for the entire population, people who ate more with their families during this period had healthier eating habits.

In the current work, reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and RT-LAMP assays were performed on extracted RNA of 7 wastewater samples. RT□LAMP assay was also performed on wastewater samples without RNA extraction. Current detection of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly by RT-qPCR of ORF (ORF1ab) and N genes so we targeted both to find the best surrogate marker for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We also performed RT-LAMP with/without RNA extraction inside microfluidic device to target both genes. Positivity rates of RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP performed on extracted RNA were 100.0% (7/7) and 85.7% (6/7), respectively. RT-qPCR results revealed that all 7 wastewater samples were positive for N gene (Ct range 37-39), and negative for ORF1ab, suggesting that N gene could be used as a surrogate marker for detection of SARS-CoV-2. RT-LAMP of N and ORF (ORF1a) genes performed on wastewater samples without RNA extraction indicated that all 7 samples remains pink (negative). The color remains pink in all microchannels except the one which subjected to RT-LAMP for targeting N region after RNA extraction (yellowish/orange color). This study shows for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 was successfully detected from wastewater samples using RT-LAMP in microfluidic chips.","Donia, Ahmed; Shahid, Muhammad Furqan; Hassan, Sammer-ul; Ahmad, Aftab; Javed, Aneela; Nawaz, Muhammad; Yaqub, Tahir; Bokhari, Habib",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.18.456880,257

We report on the discovery of a fully human multi-antibody cocktail (TATX-03) targeting diversified non-overlapping epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that suppressed replication-competent viral titers to undetectable levels in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 challenged hamsters upon both prophylactic and therapeutic administration. While monotherapy with two of the individual cocktail components also showed clear in vivo protection, neither recapitulated the efficacy of TATX-03. This synergistic effect was further supported by examining in vivo efficacy of these individual antibodies and corresponding combination therapy at a lower dose. Furthermore, in vitro screenings using VSV-particles pseudo-typed with spike proteins representing the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern Alpha, Beta, and Delta showed that TATX-03 maintained its neutralization potency. These results merit further development of TATX-03 as a potential therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection with resistance to mutagenic escape.","Roodink, Ilse; van Erp, Maartje; Li, Andra; Potter, Sheila; van Duijnhoven, Sander M J; Kuipers, Arthur J; Kazemier, Bert; van Geffen, Ellen; Hemrika, Wieger; Berkeveld, Bob; Sonnemans, Glenn; de Vries, Britte S; Boers, Bianca; Smits, Milou; Meurs, Sanne; de Pooter, Maaike; Thom, Alexandra; Duplantis, Barry N; Romijn, Roland A; Houser, Jeremy; Bath, Jennifer; Abdiche, Yasmina N",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.20.452858,257

166818,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal mental health,2021,"A novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, China and has been causing an unprecedented outbreak in China. The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence. Here, we have developed a mathematical framework incorporating city-to-city connections to calculate the number of imported cases of the novel virus from an outbreak source, and the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases. We used this number to estimate the arrival time of outbreak emergence using air travel frequency data from Wuhan to other cities, collected from the International Air Transport Association database. In addition, a meta-population compartmental model was built based on a classical SIR approach to simulate outbreaks at different cities. We consider the scenarios under three basic reproductive number (R0) settings using the best knowledge of the current findings, from high (2.92), mild (1.68), to a much lower numbers (1.4). The mean arrival time of outbreak spreading has been determined. Under the high R0, the critical time is 17.9 days after December 31, 2019 for outbreak spreading. Under the low R0, the critical time is between day 26.2 to day 35 after December 31, 2019. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low R0 (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the connections between the source and target cities. Under the higher R0 (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is generally low until the border control measure was enhanced to reduce more than 95% of the connections.","Yuan, Hsiang-Yu; Hossain, M.

WHO officially declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Both government and non-government parties work together to educate people and provide information about COVID-19 through various ways. Advertisement is considered as one of the effective ways to provide education and understanding about COVID-19. This study aims to discover the hidden messages in COVID-19 advertisements by analyzing the verbal and non-verbal signs used in the advertisement entitled “Stay Home Save Live”. The data were collected by using observation method and note-taking technique. The data were analyzed by descriptive qualitative method using semiotic theory proposed by Saussure (1983) and the theory of meanings proposed by Barthes (1977). The analysis was presented by informal method. The finding shows that both verbal and visual signs in the advertisement “Stay Home Save Lives” have hidden message.

In our health-system located in New York City, the provision of care in the ambulatory care setting moved to a remote model virtually overnight. We describe interventions made during the pandemic to transform ambulatory care pharmacy through expansion of telehealth services. &lt;bold&gt;Summary:&lt;/bold&gt; In March of 2020, the closure of primary care clinics and provider appointment cancellations due to inpatient redeployment created a void. Collaboration with other health care providers and development of standardized telehealth workflows served as a conduit for creating new roles and opportunities for pharmacy team members. Three main interventions where the pharmacy team filled gaps include;(1) Expansion of pharmacist telemedicine visits for high-risk patients to improve access to primary care visits, (2) Partnership with nursing to create a centralized refill call center workflow, (3) Integration of pharmacy extenders into the prior authorization process to prevent medication access issues. Existing collaborative practice agreements for chronic disease management were utilized. A virtual pharmacist model for patient care contributed to an increase in telehealth visits from 51 in 2019 to 2997 total visits in 2020. In addition, the health-system refill call center expanded its services through collaboration with our pharmacy team. Pharmacists and pharmacy interns partnered with nurse practitioners to improve the call center workflow and address the significant increase in refill requests during the outbreak. Furthermore, a prior authorization process was created across multiple ambulatory care clinics to expedite medication access and prevent delays in therapy. &lt;bold&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/bold&gt; Our ambulatory care pharmacy team leveraged technology, innovative workflows, and collaborative teamwork to catalyze a shift in pharmacists’ and pharmacy extenders’ roles in healthcare delivery to expeditiously meet patients’ needs during a pandemic.

Methods: In this paper, the authors compare the performance of Year 1 and 2 classes of medical students who took the same courses either online (2019-2020) or face-to-face (2018-2019), and compare their evaluation of these courses. The authors also present results of three survey questions delivered to current Year 1 medical students on the perceived advantages and disadvantages of online learning and suggestions for improvement. Results: Performance and evaluation scores of Year 1 and 2 classes was similar irrespective of the mode of delivery of the course in question. 30 current (2019-2020) Year 1 students responded to the survey questions with a response rate of 25.4%. Some of the cited disadvantages had to do with technical, infrastructural and faculty know-how and support. But the more challenging limitations had to do with the process of learning and what facilitates it, the students' ability to self-regulate and to motivate themselves, the negative impact of isolation, loss of socialisation and interaction with peers and faculty, and the almost total lack of hands-on experiences. Conclusion: Rapid transition to online learning did not affect student knowledge acquisition negatively. As such, the sudden shift to online education might not be a totally negative development and can be harnessed to drive a more progressive medical education agenda. These results are particularly important considering the several disadvantages that the students cited in relation to the online delivery of the courses.

As a result, precautionary and preventive measures are being implemented to curtail the spread of the virus. However, knowledge and compliance measures are essential for adequate preparedness to reopen the universities amidst the pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) along with factors influencing Health Science undergraduate students toward the COVID-19 infection pandemic in Ghana. A total of 606 students provided information regarding KAP of COVID-19 infection using an online questionnaire designed via Google forms. Results: Majority of the students 'mostly' obtained information on COVID-19 infection from social media (69.4%) followed by Television/radio/newspaper (60.4%). Majority of the students' population had adequate knowledge (92.7%), showed a good attitude (90.9%) and positive cues (90.8%) towards COVID-19 infection. Students that more often obtained information about COVID-19 infection from the news media were 2.86 and 4.01 increased odds of having a positive attitude and good practices towards COVID-19 infection, respectively. Those who obtained information from social media were significantly more likely to have adequate knowledge [OR=2.32 (1.10-7.19] but non-significantly less likely to have good practices [OR=0.57 (0.22-1.51)]. Male students had 0.53 decreased odds of having adequate knowledge of COVID-19 infection compared with female students.

169044,Experiences of occupational therapists using telehealth to continue to treat patients with low vision during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Pre-COVID-19 pandemic, restaurant workers comprised one of the largest workforces in the United States, contributing hundreds of billions of dollars to the national economy. Yet, restaurant workers routinely face customer abuse, meager wages, lack of benefits, sexual harassment, and one of the highest rates of turnover across industries. Given these conditions, this qualitative study investigates how restaurant workers make sense of a contested occupation and manage the stigma associated with their occupation. Specifically, this study examines how food and beverage service workers identify with and navigate a demanding industry while managing the sociocultural assumptions of service work. Using a multi-level discourse analytic framework, we analyze how service workers craft and enact occupational identities. Through an analysis of in-depth interviews with 19 restaurant employees, we demonstrate how people foreground the positive attributes of restaurant work while resisting social Discourses that position the work as dirty, demeaning, emotional, and meaningless. We analyze how workers frame the values of working in restaurants and the communicative strategies they use to navigate stigmatized social interactions, including emphasizing flexibility, empathy, emotion management, and teamwork. Theoretical and practical implications offer suggestions to improve workforce sustainability and working conditions for employees.","Hanners, Kyle A.; Redden, Shawna Malvini",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158587,257
169158,The mental health of brazilian university hospital's workers in times of COVID-19,2021,"Background Covid-19 vaccines may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), thrombocytopenia (TCP), and VTE associated with TCP. We aimed at estimating this risk by age and sex, after the first dose of both adenovirus vector-based and mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines, and after the second dose of m-RNA vaccines. Methods In this population-based retrospective cohort study, we examined three groups: 1 662 719 people 10 years of age and over vaccinated with the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, 622 778 with the second dose, and 190 616 diagnosed of Covid-19 in the same period (between1 January 2021 and 18 April 2021). The rates of various clinical presentations of VTE and TCP were compared with those in the reference population (7 013 040 people served by the health care system in 2919). The two primary outcomes were the observed 21 day rate of a composite variable of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, mesenteric thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, or any venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with thrombocytopenia (TCP), and the rate of any VTE associated with TCP (VTE+TCP). Analyses were standardised by age and sex. Findings The 21 day rate per 100 000 of the primary composite variable was 2.15 in the reference population, 5.65 following the first vaccine dose (standardised difference, 2.53 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.04-4.00), and 7.23 following the second dose (standardised difference, 4.07 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.43-6.70). The event rates of VTE+TCP and of all the secondary variables showed the same patterns. Excess event rates were higher in men than in women, and they were not especially increased in any particular age group. All Covid-19 vaccines were associated with increased rates of the outcome variables. Excess event rates were many-fold higher in the Covid-19 cohort. Interpretation We observed small increases of rates of venous thromboembolism in usual and unusual anatomical sites and of thrombocytopenia in recipients of both adenovirus vector and mRNA vaccines against Covid-19. Excess rates were higher in men than in women and they were not particularly elevated in any specific age group.","Laporte, J.-R.; Coma, E.; Fina, F.; Garcia-Eroles, L.; Vidal, X.; Medina, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.21261036v1?rss=1,257

This greatly inhibits the potential for cross-disciplinary research. A traditional introduction into an area may come in the form of a review paper. However, not all areas and sub-areas have a current review. In this paper, we present a method for the automatic generation of a review paper corresponding to a user-defined query. This method consists of two main parts. The first part identifies key papers in the area by their bibliometric parameters, such as a graph of co-citations. The second stage uses a BERT based architecture that we train on existing reviews for extractive summarization of these key papers. We describe the general pipeline of our method and some implementation details and present both automatic and expert evaluations on the PubMed dataset.","Nikiforovskaya, Anna; Kapralov, Nikolai; Vlasova, Anna; Shpynov, Oleg; Shpilman, Aleksei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04147v1.pdf,257

Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Noble hospital and Research Centre (NHRC), Pune, Western India between 1st April 2020 and 1st August 2021 to identify patients admitted with CAM. The primary endpoint was incidence of all cause mortality due to CAM. Secondary outcomes studied were need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit(ICU) admission. Baseline and time dependent risk factors significantly associated with death due to CAM were identified by Relative risk estimation. Results: 59 patients were diagnosed with Mucormycosis at NHRC (58 ROCM, 1 Renal (disseminated) mucormycosis). Median age of the cohort was 52(IQR: 41,61) years and it included 20.3% females. Median duration from first positive COVID-19 RT PCR test to diagnosis of Mucormycosis was 17(IQR: 12,22) days. 90% patients were diabetic with 30% being newly diagnosed at the time of COVID-19 admission and 89% having uncontrolled sugar level (HbA1c > 7%). All patients were prescribed steroids during treatment for COVID-19. 56% patients were prescribed steroids for non-hypoxemic, mild COVID (irrational steroid therapy) while in 9%, steroids were indicated but were prescribed in inappropriately high dose. Majority of the patients were treated with a combination of surgical debridement(94%), intravenous Amphotericin B(91%) and concomitant oral Posoconazole therapy(95.4%). 74.6% patients were discharged after clinical and radiologic recovery while 25.4% (15 patients) died. On Relative risk analysis, CT severity score during COVID-19 admission [≥]18 (p=0.017), presence of orbital symptoms(p=0.002), presence of diabetic ketoacidosis(p=0.011) and cerebral involvement by Mucor(p=0.0004) were associated with increased risk of death. Duration of Amphotericin B therapy of [≥] 21 days was associated with statistically significant reduction in mortality(p=0.002). Conclusions: CAM is an uncommon, rapidly progressive, angioinvasive, opportunistic fungal infection which is fatal if left untreated. Combination of surgical debridement and antifungal therapy leads to clinical and radiologic improvement in majority of cases.","Dravid, A.; Kashiva, R.; Khan, Z.; Bande, B.; Memon, D.; Kodre, A.; Potdar, P.; Mane, M.; Tamboli, A.; Pawar, V.; Patil, D.; Banerjee, D.; Bhoite, K.; Shinde, A.; Pharande, R.; Kalyani, S.; Raut, P.; Bapte, M.; Saldanha, C.; Chandak, D.; Ajani, F.; Mehta, A.; Reddy, M.

171960,COVID-19-positive health-care workers in an oncology setup: Considerations for return to work,2021,"Identifying chemical regulators of biological pathways is currently a time-consuming bottleneck in developing therapeutics and small-molecule research tools. Typically, thousands to millions of candidate small molecules are tested in target-based biochemical screens or phenotypic cell-based screens, both expensive experiments customized to a disease of interest. Here, we instead use a broad, virtual screening approach that matches compounds to pathways based on phenotypic information in public data. Our computational strategy efficiently uncovered small molecule regulators of three pathways, containing p38ɑ (MAPK14), YAP1, or PPARGC1A (PGC-1α). We first selected genes whose overexpression yielded distinct image-based profiles in the Cell Painting assay, a microscopy assay involving six stains that label eight cellular organelles/components. To identify small molecule regulators of pathways involving those genes, we used publicly available Cell Painting profiles of 30,616 small molecules to identify compounds that yield morphological effects either positively or negatively correlated with image-based profiles for specific genes. Subsequent assays validated compounds that impacted the predicted pathway activities. This image profile-based drug discovery approach could transform both basic research and drug discovery by identifying useful compounds that modify pathways of biological and therapeutic interest, thus using a computational query to replace certain customized labor- and resource-intensive screens.","Rohban, Mohammad H.; Fuller, Ashley M.; Tan, Ceryl; Goldstein, Jonathan T.; Syangtan, Deepsing; Gutnick, Amos; Nijsure, Madhura P.; Rigby, Megan; Sacher, Joshua R; Corsello, Steven M.; Peppler, Grace B.; Bogaczynska, Marta; Ciotti, Gabrielle E.; DeVine, Ann; Doan, Minh; Gale, Jennifer P.; Derynck, Rik; Turbyville, Thomas; Boerckel, Joel D.; Singh, Shantanu; Kiessling, Laura L.; Schwarz, Thomas L.; Varelas, Xaralabos; Wagner, Florence F.; Kafri, Ran; Eisinger-Mathason, T.S.

172321,US Health Care Relies on Filipinxs While Ignoring Their Health Needs Disguised Disparities and the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background: The consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak are unprecedented and have been felt by everyone around the world, including people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). With the development of vaccines, the future is becoming brighter. Vaccines are a key pillar of public health and have been proven to prevent many serious diseases. However, vaccination also raises questions, especially for patients with inflammatory RMDs and/or treated with drugs that influence their immune system. Objectives: Our aim was to collect safety data among RMD patients receiving COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: The EULAR COVID-19 Vaccination (COVAX) Registry is an observational registry launched on 5 February 2021. Data are entered voluntarily by clinicians or associated healthcare staff;patients are eligible for inclusion if they have an RMD and have been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Descriptive statistics are presented. Results: As of 27 April 2021, 1519 patients were reported to the registry. The majority were female (68%) and above the age of 60 (57%). Mean age was 63 years (SD 16), ranging from 15 to 97 years. A total of 28 countries contributed to the registry, with France (60%) and Italy (13%) as the highest contributors. The majority (91%) had inflammatory RMDs. Inflammatory joint diseases accounted for 51% of cases, connective tissue diseases 19%, vasculitis 16%, other immune mediated inflammatory diseases 4%, and non-inflammatory/mechanical RMDs 9%. The most frequent individual diagnoses were rheumatoid arthritis (30%), axial spondyloarthritis (8%), psoriatic arthritis (8%), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, 7%) and polymyalgia rheumatica (6%). At the time of vaccination, 45% were taking conventional synthetic DMARDs, 36% biological DMARDs, 31% systemic glucocorticoids, 6% other immunosuppressants (azathioprine;mycophenolate;cyclosporine;cyclophosphamide;tacrolimus), and 3% targeted synthetic DMARDs. The most frequent individual DMARDs were methotrexate (29%), TNF-inhibitors (18%), antimalarials (10%) and rituximab (6%). The vaccines administered were: 78% Pfizer, 16% AstraZeneca, 5% Moderna and 1% other/unknown;66% of cases received two doses and 34% one dose. Mean time from 1st and 2nd dose to case report was 41 days (SD 26) and 26 days (SD 23), respectively. COVID-19 diagnosis after vaccination was reported in 1% (18/1519) of cases. Mean time from first vaccination until COVID-19 diagnosis was 24 days (SD 17). Disease flares were reported by 5% (73/1375) of patients with inflammatory RMDs, with 1.2% (17/1375) classified as severe flares. Mean time from closest vaccination date to inflammatory RMD flare was 5 days (SD 5). The most common flare types were arthritis (35/1375=2.5%), arthralgia (29/1375=2.1%), cutaneous flare (11/1375=0.8%) and increase in fatigue (11/1375=0.8%). Potential vaccine side effects were reported by 31% of patients (467/1519). The majority were typical early adverse events within 7 days of vaccination, namely pain at the site of injection (281/1519=19%), fatigue (171/1519=11%) and headache (103/1519=7%). Organ/system adverse events were reported by 2% (33/1519) but only 0.1% (2/1519) reported severe adverse events, namely a case of hemiparesis in a patient with systemic sclerosis/ SLE overlap syndrome (ongoing at the time of reporting), and a case of giant cell arteritis in a patient with osteoarthritis (recovered/resolved without sequelae). Conclusion: The safety profiles for COVID-19 vaccines in RMD patients was reassuring. Most adverse events were the same as in the general population, they were non-serious and involved short term local and systemic symptoms. The overwhelming majority of patients tolerated their vaccination well with rare reports of inflammatory RMD flare (5%;1.2% severe) and very rare reports of severe adverse events (0.1%). These initial findings should provide reassurance to rheumatologists and vaccine recipients, and promote confidence in COVID-19 vaccine safety in RMD patients, namely those with inflammatory RMDs and/or taking treatments that influence their immune system.","Machado, P.

Mean age was 35.05 (SD = 12.10). Participants responded online to the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI), and questions about use of enhancement drugs.Results4.3% of the participants scored above the cut-off point of the EAI, with higher values registered in the UK and Spain. Exercise addiction was higher among men. Appearance anxiety and body satisfaction problems were found in participants of all participating countries, with 15.2% scoring over the cut-off point for BDD. Higher numbers of those at risk of BDD were found in Italy, Japan, and Portugal. About 29% reported the use of fitness supplements to make them look better, with 6.4% starting a new use during the lockdown. Change in supplements use and exercise are predicted by EAI scores.

Further, for the black hole spacetime, near horizon symmetry has been observed to play possible role in understanding the underlying degrees of freedom for thermodynamic behaviour of horizon. Following the similar idea, in this paper, we analyzed the symmetry and associated algebra near a timelike surface which is situated at any arbitrary radial position and is embedded in black hole spacetime. In this paper we considered both Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole spacetimes. The families of hypersurfaces with constant radial coordinate (outside the horizon) in these spacetimes is timelike in nature and divide the space into two distinct regions. The symmetry algebra turned out to be reminiscent of Bondi-Metzner-Sach (BMS) symmetry, found in the asymptotic null infinity.","Maitra, Mousumi; Maity, Debaprasad; Majhi, Bibhas Ranjan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05626v2.pdf,257
174400,Child mental health in England before and during the COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency requiring urgent development of efficacious vaccines. While concentrated research efforts are underway to develop antibody-based vaccines that would neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and several first-generation vaccine candidates are currently in Phase III clinical trials or have received emergency use authorization, it is forecasted that COVID-19 will become an endemic disease requiring second-generation vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike (S) glycoprotein represents a prime target for vaccine development because antibodies that block viral attachment and entry, i.e. neutralizing antibodies, bind almost exclusively to the receptor binding domain (RBD). Here, we develop computational models for a large subset of S proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, implemented through coarse-grained elastic network models and normal mode analysis. We then analyze local protein domain dynamics of the S protein systems and their thermal stability to characterize structural and dynamical variability among them. These results are compared against existing experimental data, and used to elucidate the impact and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutations and their associated antibody binding behavior. We construct a SARS-CoV-2 antigenic map and offer predictions about the neutralization capabilities of antibody and S mutant combinations based on protein dynamic signatures. We then compare SARS-CoV-2 S protein dynamics to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins to investigate differing antibody binding and cellular fusion mechanisms that may explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks associated with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 over the last two decades suggest that the threat presented by coronaviruses is ever-changing and long-term. Our results provide insights into the dynamics-driven mechanisms of immunogenicity associated with coronavirus S proteins, and present a new approach to characterize and screen potential mutant candidates for immunogen design, as well as to characterize emerging natural variants that may escape vaccine-induced antibody responses. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE We present novel dynamic mechanisms of coronavirus S proteins that encode antibody binding and cellular fusion properties. These mechanisms may offer an explanation for the widespread nature of SARS-CoV-2 and more limited spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. A comprehensive computational characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S protein structures and dynamics provides insights into structural and thermal stability associated with a variety of S protein mutants. These findings allow us to make recommendations about the future mutant design of SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants that are optimized to elicit neutralizing antibodies, resist structural rearrangements that aid cellular fusion, and are thermally stabilized. The integrated computational approach can be applied to optimize vaccine immunogen design and predict escape of vaccine-induced antibody responses by SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Kunkel, G.; Madani, M.; White, S.

175669,COVID-19 pandemic’s burden on healthcare professionals’ mental health,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has had a huge impact on health care services worldwide. Previous studies projected delays in cancer diagnoses and excess mortality for cancer patients as a result of the pandemic. Little is known, however, on the impact of the pandemic on the functioning of cancer services. We aimed to fill this gap by using a region-wide, population-based administrative health care data repository. Methods: We obtained data for patients initiating a targeted molecular therapy during 2017-2020 (January-September, by quarter) in Veneto. Eligible treatments were those with lapatinib, pertuzumab, TDM-1 and trastuzumab for breast cancer;with afatinib, alectinib, crizotinib, erlotinib, gefitinib and osimertinib for lung cancer;with cobimetinib, dabrafenib, trametinib and vemurafenib for melanoma;and with niraparib, olaparib and rucaparib for ovarian cancer. Patients starting more than one targeted molecular therapy in a given calendar year were included only once. We estimated the normalised difference between the number of patients for a given quarter in 2020 and the mean number of patients for the corresponding quarter during 2017-2019. Statistical significance was calculated assuming a type I error probability of 5%. Results: The study included 3,180 patients. In 2020, patients starting a targeted molecular therapy were 361 in the first quarter, 260 in the second quarter and 268 in the third quarter. The normalised difference between the number of treatments in 2020 and the mean number of treatments during 2017-2019 for all cancer types combined was statistically significant only for the first quarter, with more therapies in 2020 than in 2017-2019. In a breakdown by cancer type, differences were unremarkable for breast, lung or ovarian cancer, while there were significantly more treatments for melanoma for all the three quarters in 2020 compared to 2017- 2019. Conclusions: We chose to use the rate of initiation of targeted molecular therapies as a proxy for the effectiveness of oncology services in managing cancer patients, because these therapies require that at least pathology and diagnostic facilities are fully operational. The study covered a population of nearly five million people, in a region where universal health coverage is available and where cancer care has been prioritised, by law, over non-cancer related health care services during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings suggest that provision of oncology care has not been substantially impacted by the pandemic in Veneto. Of note, label indications were unchanged for these drugs in 2020. The findings are also in line with the priority-based, adapted European Society for Medical Oncology recommendations. Further research is needed to assess whether delays at earlier stages of the route to cancer diagnosis (e.g. GP referrals for specialist care) may have occurred.","Girardi, F.; Tognazzo, S.; Bortolami, A.; Coppola, M.; Guarneri, V.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.e18734,257

At this point of time, IoT along with artificial intelligence (AI) provides a solution for a remote IoT based healthcare system. IoT based wearable devices collect data and send them to the cloud via IoT Gateway. Further, the data are analyzed by AI to raise alerts at times of emergencies like a sudden drop-in pulse rate etc. AI needs a large database for training and processing. This threatens the patient’s data security and privacy. To overcome this threat, an encryption algorithm can be used. When it comes to remote healthcare, monitoring of cardio vascular muscles is the most important of all. This can be done by an electrocardiogram (ECG). These ECG signals are transmitted in case of emergency and are stored in remote servers. The ECG signals are unique in nature and they can be used in biometric devices which attract hackers. To avoid the intruders, the data is encrypted and transmitted. In this paper, we provide a lightweight cellular automaton (CA) based encryption algorithm to suit limited power and low memory devices. For ECG based evaluation, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is considered. © 2021 Totem Publisher, Inc.

It is a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To estimate the prevalence of MetS in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2018. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 22370 eligible participants aged [≥]20 years from the NHANES 2011-2018. Main Outcome and Measure: MetS was defined as the presence of at least three of these components: central obesity, reduced high-density lipoprotein, elevated triglycerides, elevated blood pressure and elevated fasting blood glucose. The prevalence of MetS was estimated taking into account the complex sampling. The time trend was evaluated using logistic regression. Annual percentage changes (APC) were used to measure the trends in MetS prevalence. Results: The prevalence of MetS was 36.2% (95% CI, 32.3-40.3), 34.8% (95% CI, 32.3-37.4), 39.9% (95% CI, 36.6-43.2) and 38.3% (95% CI, 35.3-41.3) in 2011-2, 2013-4, 2015-6, 2017-8, respectively (P for trend =.08). Among the MetS components, the prevalence of elevated glucose increased from 48.7% (95% CI, 45.9-51.5) in 2011-2 to 64.3% (95% CI, 61.0-67.4) in 2017-8 [P for trend <.001; APC=11.7, (95% CI, 3.5-21.0)].

In doing so, two types of policies including behavioral measures and lockdown measures are embedded in the model. Compared with existing models, the model successfully reproduces similar multiple observed outputs such as infected and recovered patients in Italy by July 2020. This study concludes that the first policy is important once the number of infected cases is relatively low. However, once the number of infected cases is too high, so the society cannot identify infected and disinfected people, the second policy must be applied soon. It is thus this study suggests that relaxed lockdowns lead to the second wave of the COVID-19 around the world. It is hoped that the model can enhance our understanding of the roles of behavioral measures, lockdowns, and undocumented cases, so-called asymptomatic cases, on the COVID-19 flow.","Khairulbahri, M.",SciMedicine Journal,https://doi.org/10.28991/scimedj-2021-0303-8,257

Since COVID-19 is a highly transmissible disease; there is always a probability for its out ward spread towards general public and community from the hospitals and healthcare facilities where they come to seek treatment. Methodology: A prospective cohort study design was used, considering the limited available resources and time __ A total of 200 healthcare workers (Including Doctors, Nurses, Para-Medical staff, Janitorial staff, Reception staff & Pharmacists) working in the OPDs of the two major Public sector hospitals of Quetta were made part of this study. The study participants were selected using simple random sampling technique. The study participants from Hospital-A were first of all educated and trained on various COVID-19 IPC measures later on various COVID-19-IEC materials; written in simple Urdu language, were displayed clearly everywhere in the OPD .Similarly hand washing station along with Hand sanitizers/Soaps and surgical face masks were also made available free of cost for all the study participants of Hospital-A. More over the importance and effectiveness of COVID-19 IPC measures were continuously announced in the OPD gallery of Hospital-A, these announcements used Simple wording in local languages (i.e. Urdu, Pashto, Balochi & Brahvi). On the other hand in the OPD of Hospital-B no such interventions were made. The study participants of both the hospitals were followed for one month and observations like- which group showed more on-job non compliance towards various COVID-19 IPC measures were recorded. The data was recorded on daily bases (From 1st May-to-31st May 2021) after observing the study participants and checklist was used for recording various findings. Lastly all the data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2007 version. Results: The major findings of this study are almost in line with the set objectives, the study results are clearly showing the Risk ratio (R.R) as 0.27, indicating that the intervention group participants were only 27% as likely to develop On-job non-compliance for various COVID-19 IPC measures compare to the non-intervention group. Conclusion: The best suggestion and intervention for the developing countries that could at least address the spread of COVID-19 in a cost effective manner at health facility levels remains to be adoption of various Standard and Transmission based non-pharmacological measures of Infection prevention and Control (IPC) 5.

However, the stability of genetic variation influencing BMI from midlife and beyond is unknown. By analyzing BMI data collected from 165,717 men and 193,073 women from the UKBiobank, we performed BMI GWAS on six independent five-year age intervals between 40 and 73 years. We then applied genomic structural equation modeling (gSEM) to test competing hypotheses regarding the stability of genetic effects for BMI. LDSR genetic correlations between BMI assessed between ages 40 to 73 were all very high and ranged 0.89 to 1.00. Genomic structural equation modeling revealed that genetic variance in BMI at each age interval could not be explained by the accumulation of any age-specific genetic influences or autoregressive processes. Instead, a common set of stable genetic influences appears to underpin variation in BMI from middle to early old age in men and women alike.","Gillespie, Nathan A; Gentry, Amanda Elswick; Kirkpatrick, Robert M; Maes, Hermine H; Reynolds, Chandra A; Mathur, Ravi; Kendler, Kenneth S; Peterson, Roseann E.; Webb, Bradley T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454172,257

To improve health literacy, countries need to address health inequalities by examining different social demographic factors across the population. This assessment is crucial to identify and evaluate strengths and limitations of a country in addressing health issues. By addressing these health inequalities, a country would be better informed to take necessary steps to improve the nation's health literacy. This study examines health literacy levels in Malaysia and analyses socio-demographic factors that are associated with health literacy.

As a result, immunization rates are often suboptimal. There is a need to understand what works, particularly in low- and middle-income countries and other settings where resources are scarce. Methods: We plan to conduct a scoping review of interventions designed to increase vaccination uptake We will include systematic reviews and meta-analyses of interventional studies that address the question of vaccine uptake. We will search the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, Google Scholar, LILACs and TRIP database (which covers guidelines and the grey literature) until 01 July 2021 and hand-search the reference lists of included articles. We will include systematic reviews that comprise studies of all ages if they report quantitative data on the impact on vaccine uptake. To assess the quality, we will use a modified AMSTAR score and ate the quality of the evidence in included reviews using the ""Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation"" (GRADE).

182916,Ophthalmic nurses: vital team members in the push for better eye health,2020-12-31,"Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is associated with a range of clinical signs in felid species. The primary hosts of FeLV are domestic cats of the Felis genus that also harbor endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) elements stably integrated in their genomes. EnFeLV elements display 86% nucleotide identity to exogenous, horizontally transmitted FeLV (FeLV-A). Variation between enFeLV and FeLV-A is primarily in the long terminal repeat (LTR) and env regions, which potentiates generation of FeLV-B recombinant subtypes during natural infection with enhanced virulence. The aim of this study was to examine exogenous FeLV (exFeLV) and enFeLV recombination events in a natural FeLV epizootic. We previously described that of 32 individuals in a closed colony with productive FeLV-A infection, 22 had detectable circulating FeLV-B. We cloned and sequenced the env gene of FeLV-B, FeLV-A, and enFeLV spanning known recombination breakpoints, examining between 1-13 clones per individual to assess sequence diversity and recombination sites. We documented multiple recombination breakpoints resulting in the production of unique FeLV-B genotypes. At least half of the cats harbored more than one FeLV-B variant, and almost all animals had variants similar to those recovered from at least one other individual in the colony. This analysis reveals that FeLV-B is predominantly generated de novo within each host, though horizontal transmission may be inferred based upon FeLV-B sequence identities between individuals. This work represents a comprehensive analysis of endogenous-exogenous retroviral interactions with important insights into host-viral interactions that underlie disease pathogenesis in a natural setting. Importance Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a felid retrovirus associated with a variety of disease outcomes. Exogenous FeLV-A is the most common horizontally transmitted virus subgroup. Domestic cats (Felis catus) harbor endogenous copies of FeLV (enFeLV) in their genomes. Recombination between FeLV-A and enFeLV may result in emergence of largely replication-defective, but highly virulent recombinant strains. FeLV-B, the most common recombinant form, results when enFeLV env recombines with FeLV-A during FeLV replication. This study evaluated endogenous-exogenous recombination outcomes in a naturally-infected closed colony of domestic cats to determine recombination sites and FeLV-B genotypic heterogeneity associated with enhanced disease virulence. While FeLV-A and enFeLV genotypes were highly conserved, a large number of unique FeLV-B variants were identified in association with predicted recombination hotspots. The findings provide insight into recombination events between viral and host genomes that result in new, and potentially more pathogenic, viral strains.","Erbeck, Katelyn; Gagne, Roderick B.; Kraberger, Simona; Chiu, Elliott S.; Roelke Parker, Melody; VandeWoude, Sue",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.433497,257

We propose to briefly present an ergonomic intervention aiming at resuming classes in a physiotherapy school in the Parisian suburbs in this crisis context. The intervention was a confrontation of Covid's recommendations (evolving regularly) with the functioning of the lessons. The main problems questioned were: the school being closed during the intervention there was no activity, how to intervene without observing the activity? How to take into account that the privet’s practices of the students' school have an influence on the health situation inside? Therefore, we imagined with the trainers a phase of perceptive simulation activity (PS) on the ""residual"" activity in order to have a representation of the organization of the lessons. In a second time, a transparent relationship with the students was established with the main idea ""what you do outside has an influence inside (the school)"". Intervening in pandemic was new conditions. It was therefore necessary to adapt the methods of intervention to the situation and ergonomics allows this adaptability to situations. In the idea of empowering interventions, the system and the individuals (teachers and students) have adapted, evolved over the course of the recommendations and the appearance of Covid 19 cases. Both groups have probably developed their theoretical, practical and organizational knowledge of infectiology, which is an asset for caregivers or future caregivers.

Aside from the commonly used six minutes walking test (6MWT), four meter gait speed (4MGS) are widely used for its practicality. This study aimed to assess the agreement between 4 MGS and the 6MWT in Indonesian healthy adults. Methods This agreement analysis study had recruited 61 healthy and sedentary Indonesians aged 18 until 50 years old, and they were instructed to perform three tests, namely 6MWT and 4MGS with six meters and eight meters track. These gait speed were then compared to assess validity. Results Mean gait speed results for males in 6MWT is 1.602 m/s, whereas 4MGS in six meter track is 2.114 m/s and similarly 2.108 m/s in the eight meter track. Females on the other hand, achieved 1.462 m/s for 6MWT, 1.908 m/s and 1.986 m/s for 4MGS in six and eight meter simultaneously. Bland Altman Agreement test between the 6MWT and 4MGS shows scatter dots with close limit of agreement, thus showing a good agreement between the 6MWT and 4 MGS with both tracks. Discussion Both track length of 4 MGS were in a good agreement with 6MWT for functional capacity assessment. Conclusions In response to the COVID-19 pandemic era, shorter track of 4MGS (six meters) can be feasibly utilized. It is evident that shorter duration and track will boost the tests practicality in assessing functional capacity for both inpatient and outpatient settings.","Nusdwinuringtyas, Nury; Fransiska, Tresia; Sunarjo, Peggy; Triangto, Kevin; Dahlan, Sopiyudin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.20.391193,257

The findings suggest that BRSV may be an important causative agent in calf respiratory disease in Denmark, even in very young calves.","Uttenthal, A; Jensen, N P; Blom, J Y",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8856889/,257
191097,"Mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: stress vulnerability, resilience and mood disturbances in fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis.",2021,"Context SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19. Studies have shown that the expression of ACE2 was found in the smaller salivary glands was higher than that in the lungs, suggesting that salivary glands may be a potential target of the virus. This may indicate that one of the main gateways to coronavirus infection is the oral cavity. Objective This review intended to evaluate the comorbidities of the oral cavity and their relationships to COVID-19 and to show the benefits of homeopathic therapies as adjuvant treatments to increase oral and general health and mitigate the devastating effects of the coronavirus. Design The authors conducted a narrative review of articles published in indexed journals and websites of dental institutions and the WHO. They were selected oral pathological manifestations, sleep disorders, mood, orofacial pain and bruxism, associated with the oral-facial manifestations of Covid-19 and articles of evidence of homeopathy in dentistry. Setting Study done in Brazil with research professors in Homeopathy and Periodontics in universities. Results Some studies report that patients who are more susceptible to anxiety and stress during the pandemic, due to social confinement, may have disorders in the stomatognathic system such as: neuralgic pain in the face and teeth, fractures of teeth and dental prostheses, nibbled mucosa, stomatitis, ulcers, pain in the Temporal Mandibular Joint, otalgias, dental tightening, bruxism, xerostomia, peeling of the mucous membranes and skin, facial paralysis. Conclusions The researchers concluded that homeopathy is a safe and viable therapy for the control of COVID-19 symptoms, as scientific evidence has proven its benefits through clinical trials and use in previous epidemics. In dentistry, this therapy allows the dentist to act fully in the promotion of oral health and in the prevention of oral and systemic diseases.","Padre, Andrea; Mourão, Leila C",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245703/,257
191345,"COVID-19, Mentally Ill and Mental Health Workers.",2020,"Ventricular and atrial myocytes cultured from chick embryos 14 days in ovo were used as model systems to study cardiac adenosine receptors. In membranes of ventricular cultures, blocking of the A1-adenosine receptor pathway by the A1-selective antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) or by pertussis toxin treatment of the myocyte resulted in a significant adenosine agonist-mediated stimulation of the adenylate cyclase activity. The maximal increases in adenylate cyclase activity caused by the equipotent or the A2-adenosine receptor-selective agonists (from 52.1 +/- 3% to 63 +/- 10% [mean +/- SEM]) were significantly greater than those caused by the A1-selective agonists (from 11 +/- 5% to 34.6 +/- 7%) (p less than 0.01, by t test, n = 4-8). However, in membranes of atrial myocytes, when A1-subtype had been blocked, the various adenosine agonists had no effect on the adenylate cyclase activity. Whether the stimulatory adenylate cyclase-coupled adenosine receptor is also capable of stimulating contractility in the intact ventricular myocyte was next investigated. In ventricular but not in atrial cells, the various adenosine agonists caused an increase in the contractile amplitude in the presence of DPCPX or in myocytes preexposed to pertussis toxin. The increase in contraction amplitude caused by each agonist was expressed as percent of maximum (maximum is the increase in contractility caused by 2.4 mM calcium). In the pertussis toxin-treated myocyte, the maximal increases caused by the equipotent or A2-agonists (NECA, MECA, CV-1808, and CGS21680, from 49.6 +/- 3% to 52.5 +/- 6%, n = 8-12) were significantly greater than those elicited by the A1-agonists (2-CADO, S-PIA, R-PIA, and DCCA, from 12 +/- 4% to 37 +/- 3%, n = 8) (p less than 0.05, by t test). These data demonstrated that a stimulatory adenosine receptor, likely the A2-adenosine receptor, was present on the ventricular but not the atrial myocytes and was linked directly to a stimulation of the cardiac contractility. The functional effects mediated by the A1-subtype became manifested in the presence of isoproterenol, as evidence by an inhibition of the isoproterenol-stimulated increases in adenylate cyclase activity and in cardiac contractility by adenosine agonists. Thus, both subtypes of adenosine receptors, each mediating opposing responses, were present on the ventricular myocytes, whereas only the A1-subtype was found in the atria. The presence of a stimulatory functional A2-adenosine receptor may help explain the absence of a direct negative inotropic response to adenosine in the ventricle.","Xu, D; Kong, H Y; Liang, B T",Circulation research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1727688/,257

191580,Addressing hospital nurses' fear of abandonment in a bioterrorism emergency.,2007,"The N-terminal hydrophilic ectodomain of the G(L) envelope glycoprotein of equine arteritis virus (EAV) contains neutralization determinants of the virus. We developed a panel of 17 neutralizing murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to further characterize the neutralization determinants of EAV. Included were 6 MAbs previously raised against a laboratory strain (EAVUCD) of the original Bucyrus strain of EAV, as well as 11 additional MAbs that were raised against a neutralization-resistant variant [escape mutant (EM)] virus (EM6D10) that was derived from EAVUCD. All MAbs raised against EAVUCD and 4 of the MAbs raised against EM6D10 (2B3, 5F8, 8D4, and 10B4) reacted with the corresponding G(L) envelope glycoprotein in a Western immunoblotting assay, whereas the remaining 7 MAbs raised against EM6D10 did not react with any viral protein in the immunoblotting assay but competitively inhibited the binding of MAbs 2B3, 5F8, 8D4, and 10B4, indicating that they also recognize epitopes on the G(L) protein. A panel of 18 EM viruses raised to the MAb panel, 19 field isolates of EAV from North America and Europe, the modified-live virus vaccine (ARVAC), and 3 other laboratory strains of EAV were characterized by microneutralization assay with the panel of neutralizing MAbs and polyclonal rabbit and horse antisera. Comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences of ORF5 and the deduced amino acid sequences of the G(L) protein of individual EM viruses and field isolates of EAV identified four distinct neutralization sites. These sites include amino acids 49 (site A), 61 (site B), 67 through 90 (site C), and 99 through 106 (site D). With the notable exception of site A, the sites were all located in the V1 variable region (amino acids 61-121) within the second half of the N-terminal hydrophilic ectodomain of the G(L) protein. Site D includes several overlapping linear epitopes which appear to interact with amino acids in the other three sites to form conformationally dependent epitopes. Amino acid substitutions within any of these four sites can alter the neutralization phenotype of individual strains of EAV.","Balasuriya, U B; Patton, J F; Rossitto, P V; Timoney, P J; McCollum, W H; MacLachlan, N J",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9185595/,257

OBJECTIVE To assess community emergency preparedness linkages among hospitals, public health officials, and first responders and to investigate the influence of community hazards, previous preparation for an event requiring national security oversight, and experience responding to actual disasters. DESIGN With expert advice from an advisory panel, a mailed questionnaire was used to assess linkage issues related to training and drills, equipment, surveillance, laboratory testing, surge capacity, incident management, and communication. SETTING A simple random sample of 1750 U.S. medical-surgical hospitals. PARTICIPANTS Of 678 hospital representatives that agreed to participate, 575 (33%) completed the questionnaire in early 2004. Respondents were hospital personnel responsible for environmental safety, emergency management, infection control, administration, emergency services, and security. MEASUREMENTS Prevalence and breadth of participation in community-wide planning; examination of 17 basic elements in a weighted analysis. RESULTS In a weighted analysis, most hospitals (88.2% [95% CI, 84.1% to 92.3%]) engaged in community-wide drills and exercises, and most (82.2% [CI, 77.8% to 86.5%]) conducted a collaborative threat and vulnerability analysis with community responders. Of all respondents, 57.3% (CI, 52.1% to 62.5%) reported that their community plans addressed the hospital's need for additional supplies and equipment, and 73.0% (CI, 68.1% to 77.9%) reported that decontamination capacity needs were addressed. Fewer reported a direct link to the Health Alert Network (54.4% [CI, 49.3% to 59.5%]) and around-the-clock access to a live voice from a public health department (40.0% [CI, 35.0% to 45.0%]). Performance on many of 17 basic elements was better in large and urban hospitals and was associated with a high number of perceived hazards, previous national security event preparation, and experience in actual response. LIMITATIONS Responses reflect hospitals' self-perception of linkages. The quality of linkages and the extent of possible biases favoring positive responses were not assessed. CONCLUSIONS In this baseline assessment, most hospitals reported substantial integration. However, results suggest that relationships between hospitals, public health departments, and other critical response entities are not adequately robust. Suggestions for enhancing linkages are discussed.","Braun, Barbara I; Wineman, Nicole V; Finn, Nicole L; Barbera, Joseph A; Schmaltz, Stephen P; Loeb, Jerod M",Annals of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16754922/,257

However, during the infection time, few viral particles can be observed intracellularly. Analyzing the dynamics of the A-MLV infection process by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that the majority of viruses are extracellular and bound to the fibronectin matrix. Moreover, the amounts of bound virus and of fibronectin correlated. Using confocal microscopy, nanoparticles targeted to fibronectin by a III1C-fibronectin fragment or anti-fibronectin antibody were detected intracellularly in NIH 3T3 cells; unconjugated nanoparticles neither bound to cells nor were detectable intracellularly. Furthermore, A-MLV colocalized intracellularly with the fibronectin-targeted nanoparticles, suggesting that they were taken up by the same cellular pathway. Both A-MLV entry and fibronectin turnover depend on caveolar endocytosis, and we found that inhibiting viral binding to the extracellular NIH 3T3 fibronectin-matrix dramatically reduced A-MLV infection, indeed, showing an active role of fibronectin in infection. We suggest that binding to the cellular fibronectin matrix provides a new mechanism by which viruses can enter cells.","Beer, Christiane; Pedersen, Lene",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17522212/,257

The tasks carried out can be arranged in three stages, frequently overlapping: detection of needs and problems; contact with key stakeholders to assess what to do and how to do it; adaptation of the interventions to the ""new normal"" and generation of new responses. The emerging problems included: not being able to do the confinement (due to homelessness, material conditions, living in a situation of violence); digital gap (lack of knowledge, devices, access to Wifi); greater exposure to COVID-19 in the essential but precarious, feminized and racialized jobs (care, cleaning, food shops) that are the most frequent in the neighborhoods in where we work; language and cultural barriers that preclude to follow recommendations; to lose employment; insufficient income to cover basic needs; social isolation; and the deterioration of emotional health caused by the situation. During the process, some interventions were adapted to be delivered on-line. Solidarity networks and local resources were key to meet basic needs, but also other needs related to lack of digital knowledge or device.

A total of 628 subjects were included in the study. A significant reduction of the antibody titers over time was found: Ab Titer 1: 8.1 Arbitrary Units (AU)/mL (IQR: 4.8-29.3); Ab Titer 2: 6.2 AU/mL (IQR: 0-28.5); p<0.0001.

An online infection control module was developed to provide ready access to training. Controversy exists about whether successfully completing such a course should be mandatory or strongly encouraged for all health care professionals. The objective of the present study was to compare the perception of safety culture and intention to comply with infection control guidelines in professionals who were required by their supervisors to take the course, and those who did so voluntarily. METHODS Survey responses on learning environment, safety climate and intention to comply with infection control guidelines in health care professionals who were required to take the course (supervisor-required group [n=143]) and those who took the same course voluntarily (voluntary group [n=105]) were compared. Because randomization was thought to be too difficult to implement in the policy context in which the study was conducted, significant differences between the two groups were taken into account in the analysis. RESULTS Those required to take the course had a significantly better perception of the institutional safety climate (P<0.001), and had a higher reported intention to comply with infection control guidelines (P=0.040) than those who took the course voluntarily. DISCUSSION Requiring that staff complete a 30 min interactive online infection control module increased their intention to comply with infection control guidelines compared with those who voluntarily accessed this material based on promotional material.

There are compelling public health reasons for this development, since the database has the potential to assist with policy formulation and with contact tracing. While potentially demonstrating the rapid facilitation through technology of an important public service, the Tracing Database does, however, infringe immediately upon constitutional rights to privacy and heightens the implications of ethical choices facing medical professionals. The medical community should be aware of this surveillance innovation and the risks and rewards it raises. To deal with some of these risks, including the potential for temporary rights- infringing measures to become permanent, there are significant safeguards designed into the Tracing Database, including a strict duration requirement and reporting to a designated judge.

INTRODUCTION There are currently no universally accepted diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of DCS. The SANDHOG criteria were developed to address the need for a case definition of DCS. METHODS A point scale and entrance criteria were developed for the diagnosis of DCS. Once the entrance criterion had been met, points were awarded based upon the diver's symptoms and their time of onset. The point system and time limits (SANDHOG criteria) were determined based upon US Navy and Royal Canadian diving reports. The SANDHOG criteria were then applied on a post hoc basis to the Duke Hyperbaric database of diving injuries. Sensitivity and specificity were then calculated using three points as the cut off. The ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis was performed to determine the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS The three point SANDHOG criteria had a specificity of 90.3% and a sensitivity of 52.7%. ROC analysis of the original SANDHOG criteria gave an AUC of 0.72. Using different point values for the diagnosis of DCS will subsequently affect the sensitivity and specificity of the SANDHOG criteria. CONCLUSIONS The specificity of the SANDHOG criteria is good, and demonstrates that the SANDHOG criteria are a useful tool for the diagnosis of DCS.","Grover, I; Reed, W; Neuman, T","Undersea & hyperbaric medicine : journal of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17672176/,257

A total of 106 veterinarians, selected at random from the membership lists of two professional societies, were interviewed by telephone, using a structured questionnaire concerning their background, training and continuing education activities, and current type of practice; their diagnostic, treatment, and prophylactic practices for mastitis, calf scours and respiratory disease; and their perception of the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance. The median age of the interviewees was 42.5 (range 28 to 75) years; 62 per cent treated only dairy cattle, 10 per cent treated only beef cattle and 28 per cent treated both. Laboratory support was requested 'frequently' or 'always' by 67 per cent of the veterinarians when treating mastitis, by 37 per cent when treating calf scours and by 17 per cent when treating respiratory diseases. Twenty per cent reported using prophylactic antibiotics 'often' or 'sometimes' for calf scours, 28 per cent for respiratory diseases, and 62 per cent reported their use 'always' or 'often' for mastitis. Fluoroquinolones, phenicols or third/fourth-generation cephalosporins were prescribed as first-choice drugs by 54 per cent for calf scours, by 12 per cent for bacterial respiratory diseases and by 6 per cent for mastitis. Therapeutic failure was reported 'often' (21 per cent) or 'sometimes' (64 per cent) and was the main predictor in a multivariate model of the use of newer antibiotics. The level of awareness of the problem of antibiotic resistance was high, although more than half of the interviewees were confident that new antimicrobial drugs were already available to replace those of lower effectiveness.","Busani, L; Graziani, C; Franco, A; Di Egidio, A; Binkin, N; Battisti, A",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15623086/,257

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Using novel balloon catheters, DMR was conducted on varying lengths of duodenum in anesthetized patients at a single medical center. RESULTS A total of 39 patients with type 2 diabetes (screening HbA1c 9.5% [80 mmol/mol]; BMI 31 kg/m2) were treated and included in the interim efficacy analysis: 28 had a long duodenal segment ablated (LS; ∼9.3 cm treated) and 11 had a short segment ablated (SS; ∼3.4 cm treated). Overall, DMR was well tolerated with minimal gastrointestinal symptoms postprocedure. Three patients experienced duodenal stenosis treated successfully by balloon dilation. HbA1c was reduced by 1.2% at 6 months in the full cohort (P < 0.001). More potent glycemic effects were observed among the LS cohort, who experienced a 2.5% reduction in mean HbA1c at 3 months postprocedure vs. 1.2% in the SS group (P < 0.05) and a 1.4% reduction at 6 months vs. 0.7% in the SS group (P = 0.3). This occurred despite net medication reductions in the LS cohort between 0 and 6 months. Among LS patients with a screening HbA1c of 7.5-10% (58-86 mmol/mol) and on stable antidiabetic medications postprocedure, HbA1c was reduced by 1.8% at 6 months (P < 0.01).

METHODS Twenty-three patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were inoculated with human rhinovirus 16 (HRV 16) outside the pollen season. Sequential diluent and allergen (10(3) SQ-U) challenges, each followed by nasal lavage, were carried out about 3 months before and 4 days after virus inoculation. RESULTS Seventeen patients developed common cold and were further analyzed. Lavage fluid levels of eotaxin were increased at the height of active common cold (day 4 after inoculation) both at baseline (after diluent challenge) (P<0.01) and acutely after allergen challenge (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Common cold symptoms after nasal HRV 16 inoculation are associated with increased nasal mucosal output of eotaxin, suggesting that this chemokine is partly responsible for recruitment/activation of airway mucosal eosinophils in common cold infections.","Greiff, L; Andersson, M; Andersson, E; Linden, M; Myint, S; Svensson, C; Persson, C G",Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10604558/,257

SARS-CoV-infected macaques developed a disease comparable to SARS in humans; the virus was re-isolated from these animals and they developed SARS-CoV-specific antibodies. This completed the fulfilment of Koch's postulates, as modified by Rivers for viral diseases, for SARS-CoV as the aetiological agent of SARS. Besides the macaque model, a ferret and a cat model for SARS-CoV were also developed. These animal models allow comparative pathogenesis studies for SARS-CoV infections and testing of different intervention strategies. The first of these studies has shown that pegylated interferon-alpha, a drug approved for human use, limits SARS-CoV replication and lung damage in experimentally infected macaques.

The authors studied the predictive power of computed tomographic angiography in osteocutaneous fibula flap planning and execution. METHODS The authors studied a prospective cohort of 40 consecutive patients who underwent preoperative computed tomographic angiography mapping of the peroneal artery and its perforators and subsequent free fibula flap reconstruction of mandibular or maxillary defects. The authors compared their analysis of perforator anatomy, peroneal artery origin, and fibula length with intraoperative clinical findings. RESULTS Overall, computed tomographic angiography identified 94.9 percent of the cutaneous perforators found intraoperatively. Clinically, perforators were located an average of 8.7 mm from their predicted locations. The peroneal artery origin from the tibioperoneal trunk averaged 6.0 mm from its predicted location. The average length of the fibula differed from the predicted length by 8.0 mm. Computed tomographic angiography accurately predicted perforators as either septocutaneous or musculocutaneous 93.0 percent of the time. Perforator size was accurately predicted 66.7 percent of the time. Skin islands and osteotomies were modified in 25.0 percent of the cases on the basis of computed tomographic angiography findings. Two patients had hypoplastic posterior tibial arteries, prompting selection of the contralateral leg. There were no total flap or skin paddle losses. CONCLUSIONS Computed tomographic angiography accurately predicted the course and location of the peroneal artery and perforators; perforator size was less accurately estimated. Computed tomographic angiography provides valuable information to facilitate osteocutaneous fibula flap harvest.","Garvey, Patrick B; Chang, Edward I; Selber, Jesse C; Skoracki, Roman J; Madewell, John E; Liu, Jun; Yu, Peirong; Hanasono, Matthew M",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23018715/,257

PARTICIPANTS 60 patients aged 17-50 admitted to hospital over a year with acute asthma, matched with two controls: patients with stable asthma recruited from the outpatient department and patients admitted to hospital with non-respiratory conditions (inpatient controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Atopic status (skin testing and total and specific IgE), presence of common respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria (polymerase chain reaction), dust samples from homes, and exposure to allergens (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): Der p 1, Fel d 1, Can f 1, and Bla g 2). RESULTS Viruses were detected in 31 of 177 patients. The difference in the frequency of viruses detected between the groups was significant (admitted with asthma 26%, stable asthma 18%, inpatient controls 9%; P=0.04). A significantly higher proportion of patients admitted with asthma (66%) were sensitised and exposed to either mite, cat, or dog allergen than patients with stable asthma (37%) and inpatient controls (15%; P<0.001). Being sensitised and exposed to allergens was an independent associate of the group admitted to hospital (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 5.4; P=0.05), whereas the combination of sensitisation, high exposure to one or more allergens, and viral detection considerably increased the risk of being admitted with asthma (8.4, 2.1 to 32.8; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS Allergens and viruses may act together to exacerbate asthma.","Green, Rosalind M; Custovic, Adnan; Sanderson, Gwen; Hunter, Jenny; Johnston, Sebastian L; Woodcock, Ashley",BMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11923159/,257
201544,"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs Regarding the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Women in Kansas",2021,"Computational alignment of a biopolymer sequence (e.g., an RNA or a protein) to a structure is an effective approach to predict and search for the structure of new sequences. To identify the structure of remote homologs, the structure-sequence alignment has to consider not only sequence similarity, but also spatially conserved conformations caused by residue interactions and, consequently, is computationally intractable. It is difficult to cope with the inefficiency without compromising alignment accuracy, especially for structure search in genomes or large databases. This paper introduces a novel method and a parameterized algorithm for structure-sequence alignment. Both the structure and the sequence are represented as graphs, where, in general, the graph for a biopolymer structure has a naturally small tree width. The algorithm constructs an optimal alignment by finding in the sequence graph the maximum valued subgraph isomorphic to the structure graph. It has the computational time complexity O[k(t)N(2)] for the structure of N residues and its tree decomposition of width t. Parameter k, small in nature, is determined by a statistical cutoff for the correspondence between the structure and the sequence. This paper demonstrates a successful application of the algorithm to RNA structure search used for noncoding RNA identification. An application to protein threading is also discussed.","Song, Yinglei; Liu, Chunmei; Huang, Xiuzhen; Malmberg, Russell L; Xu, Ying; Cai, Liming",IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17085850/,257

It is possible that enhancing and innovating how microbiology is taught in medical school could increase the interest in ID. We need to improve teaching of preclinical medical microbiology and immunology by incorporating advancements in education and learning technologies to reignite the interest in the field. The shortage of ID specialists has important implications in our fight against ID threats such as the current COVID-19 global pandemic. In order to address this problem, we need to perform extensive research to identify the issues that medical learners and trainees are facing as they progress through their medical education towards the ID specialty.","Cervantes, Jorge",Med Sci Educ,,257
202871,Struggling to breathe: a qualitative study of children's wellbeing during lockdown in Spain,2020,"BACKGROUND: Further understanding of the distribution and changing characteristics of dental diseases is of great significance for all dental emergency centers for strengthening the medical staff's treatment knowledge abilities and effective use of emergency resources in the face of public health emergencies involving highly infectious respiratory diseases. METHODS: The medical records of 4158 dental emergency patients in 2019 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed and divided into pre-SARS-COV-2 group and SARS-COV-2 group according to time. The demographic data, date and time, diagnosis, and treatment methods of the two groups were statistically described, and the chi-squared test was used to analyze the differences. The medical records of 4158 dental emergency patients during the same period of two years in 2019 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed and divided into SARS-COV-2 pre-group and SARS-COV-2 group according to time. The demographic data, date and time, diagnosis and treatment methods of the two groups were statistically described, and the chi-square test was used to determine the differences. RESULTS: During the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, the number of dental emergency visits increased by 29.7%. During the pandemic, males (n = 286, 58.1%) were more likely to visit dental emergency centers for trauma than females (n = 206, 41.9%) (P < 0.05); females (n = 242, 60.8%) were more likely to visit dental emergency centers for acute gingivitis and acute pericoronitis than males (n = 156, 39.2%) (P < 0.05). A major change in diagnosis was related to acute pulpitis (K04.0) and acute apical periodontitis (K04.4), which increased by 9.2%; acute gingivitis (K05.0) and acute pericoronitis (K05.2) increased by 3.5%; open wound of the lip and oral cavity (S01.5) decreased by 17.9%; other conditions (non-emergency diseases) increased by 6.8%, compared with the pre-SARS-COV-2 period. Among the treatment modalities, during the pre-SARS-COV-2 period, 304 patients (17.7%) received a prescription for antibiotics and analgesics, and 1485 (86.5%) received a prescription for local treatment. During the SARS-COV-2 period, 958 (39.2%) received a prescription for antibiotics and analgesics, and 1636 (67.0%) received a prescription for local treatment. CONCLUSION: SARS-COV-2 pandemic led to changes in the characteristics of dental emergency patients. Trauma, acute pulpitis, and acute periodontitis are the leading reasons patients refer to dental emergency centers. Dental emergency centers should optimize treatment procedures, optimize the staff, and reasonably allocate materials according to the changes to improve the on-site treatment capacity and provide adequate dental emergency care.","Wu, Kan; Li, Chunjie; Yang, Zheng; Yang, Shangchun; Yang, Wenbing; Hua, Chengge",BMC Oral Health,,257

It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 5 July 2020, more than 11.1 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 528,000 deaths. More than 6.03 million people have recovered. The entire world population currently faces enormous challenges (i.e., social, environmental, health, and economic) due to the impact of COVID-19. In this regard, the affected countries are now trying to slow down the virus's transmission through social-distancing, lockdowns, increasing the number of tests and treatment facilities. There have been four lockdowns (25 March 2020-31 May 2020), and two unlock periods (1 June-31 July 2020) in India. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has been analyzed using MODIS satellite data during various phases of lockdowns over India. With the implementation of lockdown steps, AOD values dropped significantly over various regions. A significant reduction in AOD over the North-Central regions (up to -50%) compared to the regions in the South or Northeast India. The AOD over these regions was significantly affected by the lock/unlock phases. It was also observed that there was a considerable buildup of AOD during the pre-lockdown period in the year 2020 as compared to the past two years.","Soni, Pramod",Environ Dev Sustain,,257
203825,Nurse Leaders Advocate for Nurses Across a Health Care System: COVID-19,2020,"The coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains an extant threat against public health on a global scale. Cell infection begins when the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with the human cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we address the role of tetracycline as an inhibitor for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Targeted molecular investigation show that tetracycline binds more favorably to the RBD (-9.40 kcal/mol) compared to doxycycline (-8.08 kcal/mol), chloroquine (-6.31 kcal/mol), or gentamicin (-4.83 kcal/mol) while inhibiting attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98 kcal/(mol nm2 ) for tetracycline-RBD, 5.16 kcal/(mol nm2 ) for doxycycline-RBD, 5.59 kcal/(mol nm2 ) for chloroquine-RBD, and 7.02 kcal/(mol nm2 ) for gentamicin-RBD. Stronger inhibition by tetracycline is verified with nonequilibrium PMF calculations, for which the tetracycline-RBD complex exhibits the lowest free energy profile along the dissociation pathway from ACE2. Tetracycline binds to tyrosine and glycine residues on the viral contact interface that are known to modulate molecular recognition and bonding affinity. These RBD residues also engage in significant hydrogen bonding with the human receptor ACE2. The ability to preclude cell infection complements the anti-inflammatory and cytokine suppressing capability of tetracycline; this may reduce the duration of ICU stays and mechanical ventilation induced by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","Zhao, Tom Y; Patankar, Neelesh A",J. cell. biochem,,257

206144,"COVID-19 Pandemic: A Compressive Review on Gender, Herd Immunity, and Physiological Mechanisms",2020,"Introduction: Several comprehensive stroke centers (CSC) have reported increased delays to reperfusion in acute stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is unknown whether the pandemic is associated with worse functional outcomes in EVT-treated patients. Methods: We performed an observational cohort study of consecutive adult patients evaluated for suspected stroke at our CSC (located in Montreal, a Canadian pandemic epicenter) between March 30 and May 15 2020 (prospective pandemic cohort) and 2019 (retrospective non-pandemic cohort). We excluded in-hospital strokes. We compared short-term (in-house door-to-puncture and door-torecanalization delays, TICI 2b/3, complications during EVT) and long-term (90-day mRS ≤2 and death) outcomes with univariate analyses. We assessed the effect of the pandemic on 90-day mRS while controlling for clinical confounders. Results: Overall, 111 and 106 patients were included in the pandemic and non-pandemic cohorts, respectively. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the pandemic cohort was 3% (3/104). Among ischemic stroke patients, 31/77 (40%) and 41/71 (58%) underwent EVT in each respective cohort (p=0.03). Among EVT-treated patients, baseline characteristics and NIHSS scores were similar (median [interquartile range]: 20 [12-25] vs 18 [14-20], p=0.18), but pre-stroke mRS was lower in the exposed cohort (0 [0-1] vs 1 [0-2], p=0.04). Door-to-puncture (87 [65-102] vs 56 [47-74] min, p=0.07) metrics were similar, but door-to-recanalization (122 [99-126] vs 89 [67-97] min, p&lt;0.01) metrics were longer during the pandemic. The proportions of patients with TICI 2b/3 (94 vs 85%, p=0.27)and with complications during EVT (23 vs 22%, p=0.95) were similar, as were those for 90-day mRS≤2 (42 vs 37%, p=0.64) and death (19 vs 20%, p=0.99). The logistic multivariate regression did notdisclose an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and 90-day mRS ≤2 (aOR 0.70, 95% CI0.06-7.95). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic does not appear to have a negative impact on 90-dayfunctional status among EVT-treated patients despite increased delays to recanalization. However, patient selection may have been stricter during the pandemic, as a smaller proportion of evaluatedpatients underwent EVT and those treated had lower pre-stroke mRS.","Briard, J.

Current ASO designs strictly follow the rule of Watson-Crick base pairing along target sequences. However, RNAs often fold into structures that interfere with ASO hybridization. Here we developed a structure-based ASO design method and applied it to target severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Our method makes sure that ASO binding is compatible with target structures in three-dimensional (3D) space by employing structural design templates. These 3D-ASOs recognize the shapes and hydrogen bonding patterns of targets via tertiary interactions, achieving enhanced affinity and specificity. We designed 3D-ASOs that bind to the frameshift stimulation element and transcription regulatory sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and identified lead ASOs that strongly inhibit viral replication in human cells. We further optimized the lead sequences and characterized structure-activity relationship. The 3D-ASO technology helps fight coronavirus disease-2019 and is broadly applicable to ASO drug development.","Li, Yan; Garcia, Gustavo; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja; Guo, Feng",,,257
206513,Robot-assisted rehabilitation: it is the time for utilisation in in-patient health care facilities to maintain the activity of the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"We report on a search for compact binary coalescences where at least one binary component has a mass between 0.2 $M_\odot$ and 1.0 $M_\odot$ in Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data collected between 1 April 2019 1500 UTC and 1 October 2019 1500 UTC. We extend previous analyses in two main ways: we include data from the Virgo detector and we allow for more unequal mass systems, with mass ratio $q \geq 0.1$. We do not report any gravitational-wave candidates. The most significant trigger has a false alarm rate of 0.14 $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This implies an upper limit on the merger rate of subsolar binaries in the range $[220-24200] \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, depending on the chirp mass of the binary. We use this upper limit to derive astrophysical constraints on two phenomenological models that could produce subsolar-mass compact objects. One is an isotropic distribution of equal-mass primordial black holes. Using this model, we find that the fraction of dark matter in primordial black holes is $f_\mathrm{PBH} \equiv \Omega_\mathrm{PBH} / \Omega_\mathrm{DM} \lesssim 6\%$. The other is a dissipative dark matter model, in which fermionic dark matter can collapse and form black holes. The upper limit on the fraction of dark matter black holes depends on the minimum mass of the black holes that can be formed: the most constraining result is obtained at $M_\mathrm{min}=1 M_\odot$, where $f_\mathrm{DBH} \equiv \Omega_\mathrm{PBH} / \Omega_\mathrm{DM} \lesssim 0.003\%$. These are the tightest limits on spinning subsolar-mass binaries to date.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Collaboration, the Virgo; Abbott, the KAGRA Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

209893,Vitamin D and Calcium in Children 0-36 Months: A Scoping Review of Health Outcomes,2020,"Introduction En 2020, la France connaît avec la COVID-19 une épidémie sans précédent Dès le 5 mars, la SFR publie des recommandations pour les professionnels et les patients souffrant de rhumatisme inflammatoire chronique (RIC) stipulant, entre autres, qu’en l’absence de signe d’infection COVID-19, il faut poursuivre le traitement du RIC Ces recommandations, affinées le 17, puis le 22 mars ont été relayées par les associations de patients Les patients ont-ils eu connaissance et suivi ces recommandations ? Comment leur RIC a évolué durant cette période ? Patients et méthodes Six rhumatologues de l’ouest parisien ont inclus leurs patients avec RIC, polyarthrite rhumatoïde (PR), spondylarthrite (SA), rhumatisme psoriasique (RPso) qu’ils suivaient avant l’épidémie et qu’ils ont revus ou recontactés après le pic de l’épidémie, entre le 20 avril et le 30 juin Le patient remplissait un autoquestionnaire et le rhumatologue une fiche avec comorbidités, traitements, évaluation de la maladie par rapport à avant l’épidémie Résultats Au total, 207 patients (135 femmes, 65,2 %), d’âge moyen 54,6±14 ans, dont 112 (54,1 %) professionnellement actifs ont été inclus, 61,8 % avec PR, 23,7 % SA, 14,5 % RPso Quarante-sept (23,0 %) avaient plus de 65 ans, 95 (45,9 %) un IMC&gt;25kg/m2, 117 (56,5 %) au moins une comorbidité (HTA, diabète, surpoids…) Cent vingt-neuf (62,9 %) avaient au moins un facteur de risque de forme grave de COVID-19 (âge&gt;65 ans, HTA, diabète, IMC&gt;25) Trente-neuf (18,8 %) avaient une corticothérapie, 63 (30,4 %) prenaient des AINS régulièrement, 144 (69,6 %) un traitement de fond (MTX dans 91,0 % des cas), 96 (46,4 %) une thérapie ciblée (anti-TNF et anti-Il6 dans 66,3 % et 15,8 % des cas) Cent quatre-vingt-cinq (89,8 %) sont restés confinés chez eux (télétravail, retraite, arrêt) Neuf (4,3 %) ont été atteints par le COVID-19, dont 2 avec hospitalisation (aucun décès) Soixante-quinze (36,2 %) ont été informés des recommandations de la SFR Trente-quatre (16,4 %) ont arrêté tout ou partie de leur traitement, l’arrêt concernant les AINS dans 55,9 % des cas Dans 71,9 % des cas, l’arrêt était à l’initiative du patient Davantage de patients ont arrêté un traitement parmi ceux qui ont eu connaissance des recommandations (25,3 %), que parmi les autres (11,4 %, p=0,009) Le RIC était considéré par le rhumatologue stable chez 67,0 % des patients, moins actif chez 17,5 %, plus actif chez 15,5 % Quarante-quatre (21,3 %) ont ressenti davantage de douleur, 57 (27,7 %) davantage de fatigue, ces taux étant plus élevés (44,1 % pour la douleur et 61,8 % pour la fatigue) chez les 34 ayant interrompu une partie du traitement (p&lt;0,001) Parmi les 44 qui ont eu davantage de douleur, 16 (36,4 %) avaient une maladie stable voire moins active Parmi les 57 qui ont eu davantage de fatigue, 33 (57,9 %) avaient une maladie stable voire moins active Conclusion Sur 207 patients, seuls 75 (36,2 %) ont eu connaissance des recommandations Paradoxalement, plus de patients ont arrêté un traitement parmi ceux qui en ont eu connaissance Un quart de l’ensemble des patients et la moitié de ceux ayant arrêté une partie du traitement ont eu davantage de douleur ou de fatigue Pourtant 84,5 % des patients avaient une maladie stable voire moins active qu’avant Ce travail souligne la difficulté de faire passer des messages clairs et les conséquences indirectes en termes de douleur et de fatigue de cette épidémie, chez ces patients dont 62,9 % avaient au moins, indépendamment du RIC, un facteur de risque de forme grave","Grasland, A.; Collange, C.; Goupy, F.; Laffite, A.; Le Devic, P.; Marchand, C.; Wirth, J.

209974,COVID-19 Risk Factors Among Health Workers: A Rapid Review,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic with a high growth rate of confirmed cases. Therefore, therapeutic options are desperately urgent to fight with this damning virus. As it may take years to develop a specific therapy of COVID-19, it is urgent to emphasize the repurposing of drugs used for other conditions. This study reviewed the most common drugs for COVID-19 based on available online literature representing the latest in vitro clinical trial database, rational of use, adverse effects, potential toxicities, and US National Institute of Health (NIH) recommendation to use for COVID-19. Based on the preliminary data from clinical trials and considering the NIH and FDA recommendation, remdesivir and convalescent blood products are the most promising potential for COVID-19 treatment. The use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, ivermectin, and colchicine might also be effective. However, furthermore, in vivo investigations are needed in detail individually and in combination for possible benefits in humans. Besides, tocilizumab might be deemed as adjunctive therapy for patients with cytokine release syndrome. However, lopinavir-ritonavir, anakinra, and sarilumab had not proven their clinical efficacy. Eventually, sarilumab has been withdrawn from sponsored clinical trials based on the preliminary data. Baricitinib and ruxolitinib have the additive immunosuppressive effect. Consequently, all of these drugs are being evaluated with further studies. In addition, drug-drug interaction and safety concerns must be taken into account before the administration of the recommended drugs.","Hossen, Md Shafiul; Barek, Md Abdul; Jahan, Nusrat; Safiqul Islam, Mohammad",SN Compr Clin Med,,257

It also discusses some of the fundamental aspects of end of life care in the community and explores how nursing interventions can be adapted to ensure that high standards of care are maintained. The pandemic may provide opportunities for transforming community end of life care and there is a need for further research into how health and social care services have adapted, which would inform future care planning and service provision.","Boole, Louise; Watson, Sharan",Nurs Stand,,257
211019,COVID-19 and mental health of older adults in the Philippines: a perspective from a developing country,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has taken its toll on citizens in all 50 states of the United States. The United States (U.S.) leads the world with 30,291,863 confirmed reported cases and 549,664 deaths as of March 29, 2021 compared to globally confirmed cases at 127,442,926 and 2,787,915 deaths as of March 29, 2021. The U.S. federal government primarily left the response to the virus to individual states, and each implemented varying measures designed to protect health of citizens and the state's economic well-being. Unintended consequences of the virus and measures to stop its spread may include decreased physical activity and exercise, shifting access and consumption of food, and lower quality-of-life. Therefore, our primary goal was to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on health and well-being by measuring changes in physical activity, mental health-quality of life, food security and nutrition in adults ages 40 and older. We believed shifts in health behaviors would be more prevalent in minorities, less educated, lower socio-economic status, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions, so a secondary goal was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on these sub-populations. METHODS: We conducted an online survey with 9969 adults 40 years and older between 9 August and 15 September 2020 in urban areas across the four U.S. census regions. The survey included questions about demographic variables, pre-existing health conditions, physical activity, access to food, quality-of-life, and nutritional food status and asked participants to respond with information from pre-pandemic and pandemic conditions. We used paired-sample t-tests to detect changes in variables after the start of the pandemic and Cohen's d to determine effect sizes. RESULTS: Our main findings showed a decrease in physical activity since the onset of COVID-19 for minorities and non-minorities. Food security also slightly increased for minorities during the pandemic, but we found no other changes in food security, quality-of-life indicators, or nutritional status of those who responded to this survey. CONCLUSIONS: It is concerning that physical activity declined. Such activity helps maintain physical and mental health, and it is also an important time to socialize for many older adults. In many ways, our data indicate that the older adult population in U.S. cities may be more resilient than expected during the pandemic. However, the pandemic could have negative impacts that we did not detect, either due to the survey instrument or the timing of our survey, so the health and well-being of older adults should continue to be monitored in order to mitigate potential negative impacts.","Harrison, Elgloria; Monroe-Lord, Lillie; Carson, Andrew D; Jean-Baptiste, Anne Marie; Phoenix, Janet; Jackson, Phronie; Harris, B Michelle; Asongwed, Elmira; Richardson, Matthew L",BMC Public Health,,257

Nineteen scientists from a broad array of background and nationalities came together with the understanding that food security globally is at risk, especially in the post-2050 timeframe. Current concepts, strategies, measures, and scientific efforts carried out by governments, NGOs, businesses, and societies do not deliver satisfying solutions for how to sustainably produce enough healthy and affordable food to support the global population. With the economic and social impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, it became even more evident that food security is a challenge. This workshop took an innovative approach to addressing the challenges of future agriculture by considering sustainable, circular agricultural systems. Participants presented research results on algae-based food, edible insects, mushrooms, novel concepts for nutrient management, bioreactor-based farming, sustainable food culture, as well as sensor- and remote-controlled automatic food production.

213161,Characteristics of Women Enrolled in a Patient Portal Intervention for Menopause,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection is heterogeneous in clinical presentation and disease evolution. To investigate whether immune response to the virus can be influenced by genetic factors, we compared HLA and AB0 frequencies in organ transplant recipients and waitlisted patients according to presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on an Italian cohort composed by transplanted and waitlisted patients in a January 2002-March 2020 time frame. Data from this cohort were merged with the Italian registry of COVID subjects, evaluating infection status of transplanted and waitlisted patients. A total of 56304 cases were studied with the aim of comparing HLA and AB0 frequencies according to the presence (n=265, COVID) or absence (n=56 039, COVID) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 was 0.112% in the Italian population and 0.462% in waitlisted/transplanted patients (OR=4.2, 95%CI [3.7-4.7], P<0.0001). HLA-DRB1*08 was more frequent in COVID (9.7% and 5.2%: OR=1.9, 95%CI [1.2-3.1]; P=0.003; Pc=0.036). In COVID patients, HLA-DRB1*08 was correlated to mortality (6.9% in living vs 17.5% in deceased: OR=2.9, 95%CI [1.15-7.21]; P=0.023). Peptide binding prediction analyses showed that these DRB1*08 alleles were unable to bind any of the viral peptides with high affinity. Lastly, blood group A was more frequent in COVID (45.5%) than COVID patients (39.0%; OR=1.3, 95%CI [1.02-1.66]; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Even though preliminary, these results suggest that HLA antigens may influence SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical evolution of COVID-19 and confirm that blood group A individuals are at greater risk of infection, providing clues on the spread of the disease and indications about infection prognosis and vaccination strategies.","Amoroso, Antonio; Magistroni, Paola; Vespasiano, Francesca; Bella, Antonino; Bellino, Stefania; Puoti, Francesca; Alizzi, Silvia; Vaisitti, Tiziana; Boros, Stefano; Grossi, Paolo Antonio; Trapani, Silvia; Lombardini, Letizia; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Deaglio, Silvia; Brusaferro, Silvio; Cardillo, Massimo",Transplantation,,257
213758,The mental health impact of COVID-19 and lockdown related stressors among adults in the UK,2020,"A key parameter in epidemiological modeling which characterizes the spread of an infectious disease is the generation time, or more generally the distribution of infectiousness as a function of time since infection. There is increasing evidence supporting a prolonged viral shedding window for COVID-19, but the transmissibility in this phase is unclear. Based on this, we develop a generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model including an additional compartment of chronically infected individuals who can stay infectious for a longer duration than the reported generation time, but with infectivity reduced to varying degrees. Using the incidence and fatality data from different countries, we first show that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed prior to the easing of the lockdown measures (relaxation). We then test the predictive power of this model for different durations and levels of prolonged infectiousness using the incidence data after the introduction of relaxation in Switzerland, and compare it with a model without the chronically infected population to represent the models conventionally used. We show that in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures, the predictions of the model including the chronically infected population vary considerably from those obtained under a model in which prolonged infectiousness is not taken into account. Although the existence of a chronically infected population still remains largely hypothetical, we believe that our results provide tentative evidence to consider a chronically infected population as an alternative modeling approach to better interpret the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.","Tepekule, Burcu; Hauser, Anthony; Kachalov, Viacheslav N; Andresen, Sara; Scheier, Thomas; Schreiber, Peter W; Günthard, Huldrych F; Kouyos, Roger D",PLoS Comput Biol,,257

216122,COVID-19 in the paediatric population of Kazakhstan,2020,"RNA viruses have gained plenty of attention during recent outbreaks of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Ebola virus. ZIKV is a vector borne Flavivirus that is spread by mosquitoes and it mainly infects neuronal progenitor cells. One hallmark of congenital ZIKV disease is a reduced brain size in fetuses, leading to severe neurological defects. The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging the development of new antiviral treatments against ZIKV, as there are no efficient countermeasures against ZIKV disease. Previously, we presented a new class of host-targeting antivirals active against a number of pathogenic RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show the transfer of the image-based phenotypic antiviral assay to ZIKV-infected brain cells, followed by mechanism-of-action studies and a proof-of-concept study in a three-dimensional (3D) organoid model. The novel antiviral compounds showed a therapeutic window against ZIKV in several cell models and rescued ZIKV-induced neurotoxicity in brain organoids. The compound's mechanism-of-action was pinpointed to late steps in the virus life cycle, impairing the formation of new virus particles. Collectively, in this study, we expand the antiviral activity of new small molecule inhibitors to a new virus class of Flaviviruses, but also uncover compounds' mechanism of action, which are important for the further development of antivirals.","Pettke, Aleksandra; Tampere, Marianna; Pronk, Robin; Wallner, Olov; Falk, Anna; Warpman Berglund, Ulrika; Helleday, Thomas; Mirazimi, Ali; Puumalainen, Marjo-Riitta",Viruses,,257

We reviewed the risk stratification of patients with rheumatological disorders, the safety of various anti-rheumatological drugs, and the role of multiple drugs used by the rheumatologists in managing COVID-19. The score-based risk stratification is helpful in therapeutic decision-making such as self-isolation, continuation, or initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Most of the immunosuppressive therapies need not be discontinued unless there is an overwhelming infection. The treatment interruption should not be made in fear, and there should be shared decision-making in consultation with the patient. The proposed role of different anti-rheumatic drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19 based on some initial uncontrolled trials and case reports will become clearer when the results of various ongoing well-planned studies become available.","Chattopadhyay, Arghya; Mishra, Debashish; Sharma, Vikas; K Naidu, G.; Sharma, Aman",Indian J.

216616,"Art, science and the mental health we need in a pandemic",2020,"SARS-CoV-2 virus has triggered a global pandemic with devastating consequences. The understanding of fundamental aspects of this virus is of extreme importance. In this work, we studied the viral ribonuclease nsp14, one of the most interferon antagonists from SARS-CoV-2. Nsp14 is a multifunctional protein with two distinct activities, an N-terminal 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), both critical for coronaviruses life cycle, indicating nsp14 as a prominent target for the development of antiviral drugs. In coronaviruses, nsp14 ExoN activity is stimulated through the interaction with the nsp10 protein. We have performed a biochemical characterization of nsp14-nsp10 complex from SARS-CoV-2. We confirm the 3'-5' exoribonuclease and MTase activities of nsp14 and the critical role of nsp10 in upregulating the nsp14 ExoN activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 N7-MTase activity is functionally independent of the ExoN activity and nsp10. A model from SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex allowed mapping key nsp10 residues involved in this interaction. Our results show that a stable interaction between nsp10 and nsp14 is required for the nsp14-mediated ExoN activity of SARS-CoV-2. We studied the role of conserved DEDD catalytic residues of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN. Our results show that motif I of ExoN domain is essential for the nsp14 function, contrasting to the functionality of these residues in other coronaviruses, which can have important implications regarding the specific pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. This work unraveled a basis for discovering inhibitors targeting specific amino acids in order to disrupt the assembly of this complex and interfere with coronaviruses replication.","Saramago, Margarida; Bárria, Cátia; Costa, Vanessa G; Souza, Caio S; Viegas, Sandra C; Domingues, Susana; Lousa, Diana; Soares, Cláudio M; Arraiano, Cecília M; Matos, Rute G",FEBS j,,257

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the symptoms on admission, treatment, and outcome of a total of 300 patients with mild (peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) &#8805; 96%), moderate I (93% < SpO2 < 96%), moderate II (SpO2 &#8804; 93%) and severe (requiring admission to the ICU or mechanical ventilation) COVID-19. RESULTS: Median age was 53 (interquartile range [IQR] 33-72) years and 57% was male. The number of patients with mild, moderate I, II and severe condition was 85, 138, 61 and 16, respectively. Common presenting symptoms were cough (n = 71), loss of taste (42), loss of smell (39), fever &#8805; 37.5 °C (36). Dyspnea was observed only 21 cases; 57 reported no symptoms on admission.

217938,The impact of COVID-19 on mental health,2020,"BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to myocardial injury and shock in children, likely the result of a severe inflammatory state, and can mimic Kawasaki disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of shock and myocardial injury in children with confirmed or suspeted COVID-19 during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Spain, including clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment, disease course, and outcome. An extensive literature review is provided. METHODS: Retrospective case series including all children (age 1 month-18 years) admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in Madrid, Spain, between March 15 and April 30, 2020 with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and shock. RESULTS: Twelve previously healthy patients with shock, age 5 to 14 years, were included. All required volume resuscitation and 75% required vasoactive/inotropic support. Distributive shock was present on admission in 67% (n = 8), and 4 patients (33%) showed features of cardiogenic shock. Myocardial injury was diagnosed in 67% (n = 8) and ventricular dysfunction in 33% (n = 4). The most common symptoms on presentation were fever (100%), anorexia (100%), diarrhea (75%), and vomiting (75%). Five patients showed signs of Kawasaki disease but none met the criteria for the classic form. Laboratory findings revealed lymphopenia (83%), thrombocytopenia (83%), and increased inflammatory markers (100%). Respiratory status was not significantly impacted. Chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates in 7 (58%) and bilateral pneumonia in 3 (25%). COVID-19 was confirmed in 11 cases (92%). All received empirical therapy against COVID-19, thromboprophylaxis and immunomodulation. Median stay in the PICU and inpatient ward was 4.5 and 10 days, respectively. No patients died. CONCLUSION: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with COVID-19 can mimic Kawasaki disease and lead to a combination of distributive and cardiogenic shock, probably secondary to a hyperinflammatory state that remains to be precisely defined. Treatment strategies include hemodynamic support, empirical therapies against COVID-19, thromboprophylaxis, and immunomodulation.","Caro-Patón, Gema de Lama; de Azagra-Garde, Amelia Martínez; García-Salido, Alberto; Cabrero-Hernández, Marta; Tamariz, Amalia; Nieto-Moro, Montserrat",J Intensive Care Med,,257
218645,Telepsychiatry coming into its own with COVID-19,2020,"The spread of bacterial strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics urges the development of novel antibacterial compounds. Ideally, these novel antimicrobials should be less prone to the development of resistance. Peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes are a promising class of compounds with a fundamentally different mode of action compared to traditionally used antibiotics. The difference in the mechanism of action implies differences both in the mechanisms of resistance and the chances of its emergence. To critically assess the potential of resistance development to peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes, we review the available evidence for the development of resistance to these enzymes in vitro, along with the known mechanisms of resistance to lysozyme, bacteriocins, autolysins, and phage endolysins. We conclude that genetic determinants of resistance to peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes are unlikely to readily emerge de novo. However, resistance to these enzymes would probably spread by the horizontal transfer between intrinsically resistant and susceptible species. Finally, we speculate that the higher cost of the therapeutics based on peptidoglycan degrading enzymes compared to classical antibiotics might result in less misuse, which in turn would lead to lower selective pressure, making these antibacterials less prone to resistance development.","Grishin, Alexander V; Karyagina, Anna S; Vasina, Daria V; Vasina, Irina V; Gushchin, Vladimir A; Lunin, Vladimir G",Crit Rev Microbiol,,257

219680,A population mental health perspective on the impact of COVID-19,2020,"As a consequence of missing data on tests for infection and imperfect accuracy of tests, reported rates of cumulative population infection by the SARS CoV-2 virus are lower than actual rates of infection. Hence, reported rates of severe illness conditional on infection are higher than actual rates. Understanding the time path of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the absence of bounds on infection rates that are credible and informative. This paper explains the logical problem of bounding these rates and reports illustrative findings, using data from Illinois, New York, and Italy. We combine the data with assumptions on the infection rate in the untested population and on the accuracy of the tests that appear credible in the current context. We find that the infection rate might be substantially higher than reported. We also find that the infection fatality rate in Illinois, New York, and Italy is substantially lower than reported.","Manski, Charles F; Molinari, Francesca",Journal of econometrics,,257

220806,Socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 in low-income countries,2021,"The aim of this study is to examine the cognitive flexibility before and during the COVID-19 pandemic through a different performance measurement suitable for online application. In the study, three different data collected in 2019 (T19), 2020 (T20) and 2021 (T21) were compared with both within- and between-subject designs. One-hundred-and-twenty-three university students were included in the study for within-subjects, 239 for between-subject. According to the findings of the study, the cognitive flexibility of the students who continue formal education in T19 is higher than the students who continue distance education in T20 according to both within-subject and between-subject design. Besides, in both designs, fewer total words were produced in T19 than in T20. The sentences created by the students who continue their distance education in pandemic stay around less categories and contain more words. According to the within-subject findings obtained at T20 and T21, the cognitive flexibility and total words produced at T20 were greater. In other words, the scores of the students decreased over time during the pandemic period. In T21, cognitive flexibility is not related to vulnerability, perceived risk, and fear of COVID-19. However, according to the regression results, vulnerability at T21 was predicted by the total word and total emotional word in T20. Accordingly, producing more total words in T20 reduced vulnerability in T21;however, using more emotional words in T20 increased vulnerability in T21. In addition, the number of siblings was negatively associated with vulnerability. Lastly, cognitive flexibility test was found to be reliable.","Cambaz, H.

In addition, the effects of the weight ratio of different PANI to BF@Hal on the microwave absorption properties of the materials were studied. The results show that when the weight ratio of PANI is 40%, the material has the best microwave absorption performance. The frequency bandwidth below -5 dB reached 9.60 GHz and the minimum absorption peak at 11.92 GHz was -14.77 dB. The combination of the PANI and BF@Hal nanosheets take advantage of the interfacial polarization, natural resonance, dielectric polarization and trapping of EM waves by internal reflection in PANI/BaFe12O19@Hal. Taking advantage of the unique microscopic morphology and interface characteristics, halloysite was introduced to improve the microwave absorption performance and enrich the absorbing mechanism of the composite materials. This work may provide a reliable candidate for the synthesis of electromagnetic attenuation materials with fairly good performances.","Chen, Zihao; Mu, Dawei; Liu, Tianhao; He, Zilong; Zhang, Yi; Yang, Huaming; Ouyang, Jing",J Colloid Interface Sci,,257

In trying to prepare for the future, with or without COVID-19 implications, dental providers and clinics are facing opportunities to add value, consider alternative payment models, and to incorporate risk stratification and population health management along with medical systems. However, as alternative payment models emerge in dentistry, stand-alone dental clinics may face unique challenges in trying to prepare for the future while still providing patient care in the fee for service environment. This article focuses on a 6-months pilot project of how implementing a comprehensive caries disease management care model, evaluating caries risk, and implementing risk stratification strategies can prepare dental offices for future payment models and inclusion in the greater health system. There are two overall goals for this pilot. First, applying a caries disease management protocol to every patient visit, regardless of reimbursement. Second, applying quality improvement (QI) principles to change how a dental office approaches care delivery.

To explore the issue of possible DPP-4 inhibitor cardiac heterogeneity, we perfused different DPP-4 inhibitors to beating mouse hearts ex vivo, at concentrations equivalent to peak plasma levels achieved in humans with standard dosing. We studied male and female mice, young non-diabetic mice, and aged diabetic high fat diet-fed mice and observed that linagliptin enhanced recovery after ischemia-reperfusion, whereas sitagliptin, alogliptin, and saxagliptin did not. DPP-4 transcripts were not detected in adult mouse cardiomyocytes by RNA sequencing and the addition of linagliptin caused &#8804;0.2% of cardiomyocyte genes to be differentially expressed. In contrast, incubation of C166 endothelial cells with linagliptin induced cell signaling characterized by phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, whereas the nitric oxide (NO) donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased serine 16 phosphorylation of the calcium regulatory protein, phospholamban in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, linagliptin increased cardiomyocyte cGMP when cells were co-cultured with C166 endothelial cells, but not when cardiomyocytes were cultured alone. Thus, at a concentration comparable to that achieved in patients, linagliptin has direct effects on mouse hearts. The effects of linagliptin on cardiomyocytes are likely to be either off-target or indirect, mediated through NO generation by the adjacent cardiac endothelium.","Batchu, Sri Nagarjun; Yerra, Veera Ganesh; Liu, Youan; Advani, Suzanne L; Klein, Thomas; Advani, Andrew",,,257

Such systems generate huge amounts of spatio-temporal data, and system designers are often interested in analyzing and discovering structure within the data. There has been considerable interest in learning causal and logical properties of temporal data using logics such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL); however, there is limited work on discovering such relations on spatio-temporal data. We propose the first set of algorithms for unsupervised learning for spatio-temporal data. Our method does automatic feature extraction from the spatio-temporal data by projecting it onto the parameter space of a parametric spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (PSTREL). We propose an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique that guarantees that each cluster satisfies a distinct STREL formula. We show that our method generates STREL formulas of bounded description complexity using a novel decision-tree approach which generalizes previous unsupervised learning techniques for Signal Temporal Logic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on case studies from diverse domains such as urban transportation, epidemiology, green infrastructure, and air quality monitoring.","Mohammadinejad, Sara; Deshmukh, Jyotirmy V.; Nenzi, Laura",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08548v1.pdf,257

Diet has been identified as an environmental determinant of mental health. In this regard, it has been suggested that the consumption of palatable foods represents a strategy to mitigate negative emotions, such as anxiety. This study aimed to evaluate the association between symptoms of anxiety and/or anhedonia to food consumption patterns during the period of COVID-19 quarantine in Chile. We conducted a cross-sectional study with non-randomized sampling via an online survey. A total of 1725 responses were collected. Each person self-answered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale for anhedonia, the Food Intake Questionnaire, and questions regarding type and duration of lockdown, as well as body weight and food serving variation. Significant correlations were observed between fried food consumption and self-reported body weight. The subjects who consumed fried food three times a week, had higher weight (63.5%) (&#967;2 = 48.5 and p < 0.001). Those who ate one and two or more pastries on a week had 1.41 and 1.49, respectively higher odds of reporting increased body weight. We found a relationship anxiety level and sugar-sweetened beverages level (&#967;2 = 25.5; p 0.013), fast food intake (&#967;2 = 63.4; p < 0.001), and pastry consumption (&#967;2 = 37.7; p < 0.001).

Semi-structured interviews were conducted in English and Spanish with 10 key leaders. Using a social ecological model, qualitative theoretical analysis was used to analyze the results. Participants identified barriers at the individual (e.g., low education level, HIV, and financial stress), interpersonal (e.g., language barriers, low social support), organizational (e.g., lack of smoking cessation resources and targeted interventions), community (e.g., HIV and mental health stigma), and policy (e.g., paperwork for insurance) level. Participants identified facilitators at the individual (e.g., high participation in trials, good medication adherence), interpersonal (e.g., no smoking in social circles), organizational (e.g., bilingual staff, culturally competent care), community (e.g., providing transportation, the coronavirus disease 2019 as an opportunity for smoking cessation), and policy level (e.g., existence of funding, comprehensive insurance programs). These results provide operational strategies to address smoking disparities among Latino smokers living with HIV.

The classic rate law central to the SIR compartmental models assumes that the rate of transmission is first order regarding the infectious agent. The current study demonstrates that this assumption does not always hold and provides a theoretical rationale for a more general rate law, inspired by mixed-order chemical reaction kinetics, leading to a modified mathematical model for non-first-order kinetics. Using observed data from 127 countries during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated that the modified epidemic model is more realistic than the classic, first-order-kinetics based model. We discuss two coefficients associated with the modified epidemic model: transmission rate constant k and transmission reaction order n. While k finds utility in evaluating the effectiveness of control measures due to its responsiveness to external factors, n is more closely related to the intrinsic properties of the epidemic agent, including reproductive ability. The rate law for the modified compartmental SIR model is generally applicable to mixed-kinetics disease transmission with heterogeneous transmission mechanisms. By analyzing early-stage epidemic data, this modified epidemic model may be instrumental in providing timely insight into a new epidemic and developing control measures at the beginning of an outbreak.","Mun, Eun-Young; Geng, Feng",PLoS One,,257

For attendance lessons and events with patient contact alternatives had to be arranged at short notice between mid-March and the beginning of the semester in mid-April. OBJECTIVE: Description of the concept and implementation in the student teaching at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Medical Center Mainz in complete digital form in spring 2020. PRESENTATION OF CONCEPT: Lectures, examination course and practical training in ophthalmology take place in the 5th and 6th semester of the study of human medicine. The basis of the new concept were the former course curricula. Implemented concepts included a complete revision and implementation of lectures as video podcasts, examination videos, online examination conferences, interactive patient cases, narrated videos of surgery, anamnesis videos of patients and the design of the virtual patient room, a live online practice with presentation and examination of patients including transmission of the slit-lamp image to reproduce anterior and posterior segment examination. An evaluation showed a very positive reception of the new concept by students. DISCUSSION: Within a tight timeframe of 4 weeks a complete revision of the ophthalmology course was achieved. The implementation was time-consuming, with the largest share in the media production of examination videos, interactive patient cases and video podcasts of the lectures. We consider a reduction of classroom teaching for parts of the learning objectives that can be represented by such videos to be possibly useful. An independent digital appropriation of such content may enable a more productive learning environment in face-to-face teaching.","Müller, Andreas; Wagner, Felix M; Matlach, Juliane; Zimmermann, Marion; Troeber, Heike; Ponto, Katharina A; Brill, Anita; Schmidt, Franziska; Pfeiffer, Norbert; Schuster, Alexander K; Prokosch-Willing, Verena",Ophthalmologe,,257

The participants completed a 29-item online questionnaire assessing different aspects of the rumors and recommendations pertaining to PM linked with the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: In total, 523 participants took part in the survey. The mean fear score was 65.2/100. Approximately 99% of the study population had heard at least one of the rumors/recommendations of PM related to COVID-19. The average scores of disagreement with the rumors and recommendations linked to PM were 16.4/50 and 18.4/35, respectively. The fear score and the level of disagreement with the rumors were significantly related (p = 0.024). Conclusions: The use of PM might be beneficial in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic provided that a revolution occurs in data sharing. Various approaches should be considered in the management of traditional medicine modalities such as PM during disease outbreaks to help overcome the current dilemma.","Molavi Vardanjani, Hossein; Heydari, Seyed Taghi; Dowran, Behzad; Pasalar, Mehdi",Integr Med Res,,257
242188,Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and perceived strain among caregivers tending children with special needs,2020,"On 30 January 2020, WHO declared coronavirus (COVID-19) a global public health emergency. As of 12 March 2020, 125 048 confirmed COVID-19 cases in 118 countries had been reported. On 12 March 2020, the first case in the Pacific islands was reported in French Polynesia; no other Pacific island country or territory has reported cases. The purpose of our analysis is to show how travellers may introduce COVID-19 into the Pacific islands and discuss the role robust health systems play in protecting health and reducing transmission risk. We analyse travel and Global Health Security Index data using a scoring tool to produce quantitative estimates of COVID-19 importation risk, by departing and arriving country. Our analysis indicates that, as of 12 March 2020, the highest risk air routes by which COVID-19 may be imported into the Pacific islands are from east Asian countries (specifically, China, Korea and Japan) to north Pacific airports (likely Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or, to a less extent, Palau); or from China, Japan, Singapore, the United States of America or France to south Pacific ports (likely, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, French Polynesia or New Caledonia). Other importation routes include from other east Asian countries to Guam, and from Australia, New Zealand and other European countries to the south Pacific. The tool provides a useful method for assessing COVID-19 importation risk and may be useful in other settings.","Craig, A T; Heywood, A E; Hall, J",Epidemiol Infect,,257

Herein, we identified potent phytocompounds from two antiviral plants Momordica charantia L. and Azadirachta indica used locally for the treatment of viral and parasitic infections. Structure-based virtual screening and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation have been employed to study their inhibitory potential against the main protease (Mpro) SARS-CoV-2. A total of 86 compounds from M. charantia L. and A. indica were identified. The top six phytocompounds; momordicine, deacetylnimninene, margolonone, momordiciode F2, nimbandiol, 17-hydroxyazadiradione were examined and when compared with three FDA reference drugs (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and ribavirin). The top six ranked compounds and FDA drugs were then subjected to MD simulation and pharmacokinetic studies. These phytocompounds showed strong and stable interactions with the active site amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro similar to the reference compound. Results obtained from this study showed that momordicine and momordiciode F2 exhibited good inhibition potential (best MMGBA-binding energies; -41.1 and -43.4 kcal/mol) against the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 when compared with FDA reference anti-viral drugs (Ribavirin, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine). Per-residue analysis, root mean square deviation and solvent-accessible surface area revealed that compounds interacted with key amino acid residues at the active site of the enzyme and showed good system stability. The results obtained in this study show that these phytocompounds could emerge as promising therapeutic inhibitors for the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. However, urgent trials should be conducted to validate this outcome. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Within 2.5 months (by March 18, 2020) over 191,127 COVID-19 patients have been identified in 161 countries. By then, over 700 pediatric patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 in China, with only about 58 diagnosed elsewhere. By now, there are thousands of children and adolescents infected. Chinese pediatricians would like to share their experience on how these patients were managed in China and the key recommendations that had guided them in meeting the evolving challenges. A group of experts were summoned by the Chinese Pediatric Society and Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Pediatrics to extract informative data from a survey on confirmed COVID-19 pediatric patients in China. Consensus on diagnosis, management, and prevention of pediatric COVID-19 were drawn up based on the analysis of such data plus insights gained from the past SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks.

A random forest (RF) model was applied to determine the respective contributions of meteorology and anthropogenic emissions to the changes in air quality. The result suggested that the strict lockdown measures significantly decreased primary components such as Cr (-67 %) and Fe (-61 %) inPM2.5 (p&lt;0.01), whereas the higher relative humidity (RH) andNH3 level and the lower air temperature (T) remarkably enhanced the production of secondary aerosol, including SO42- (29 %), NO3- (29 %), and NH4+ (21 %) (p&lt;0.05). The positive matrix factorization (PMF) result suggested that the contribution ratios of secondary formation (SF), industrial process (IP), biomass burning (BB), coal combustion (CC), and road dust (RD) changed from 36 %, 27 %, 21 %, 12 %, and 4 % before the COVID-19 outbreak to 44 %, 20 %, 20 %, 9 %, and 7 %, respectively. The rapid increase in the contribution ratio derived from SF to PM2.5 implied that the intermittent haze events during the COVID-19 period were characterized by secondary aerosol pollution, which was mainly contributed by the unfavorable meteorological conditions and highNH3 level.","Li, Rui Zhao Yilong Fu Hongbo Chen Jianmin Meng Peng Wang Chunying",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,,257

As convalescent plasma is already used as antibody therapy, this study aimed to compare the binding capacity of antibodies specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 between human milk and serum from COVID-19-recovered women. Materials and Methods: The areas under the curve (AUCs) for IgA, IgM, and IgG specific to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in human milk and serum samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Milk samples were collected from 12 COVID-19-recovered women, while serum samples were from 10 COVID-19-recovered women. The antibody concentrations were also determined. Results: Our study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody titers differed between human milk and serum samples from COVID-19-recovered women. When the AUCs were not divided by the antibody concentration, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgM, and IgG levels were higher in the serum sample group than the human milk group (p < 0.001). However, the titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgM (AUC/µg of IgM) and IgG (AUC/µg of IgG) were higher in human milk samples than serum samples (p < 0.05). The titer of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA (AUC/mg of IgA) was higher in the serum sample group than the human milk group (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Human milk antibodies specific to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 must be purified to obtain comparable binding capacity observed with SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific serum antibodies.","Demers-Mathieu, Veronique; DaPra, Ciera; Medo, Elena",Breastfeed Med,,257

Accurate screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes are critical to treatment, and in a pandemic scenario like coronavirus disease 2019 needing a simple test that minimises prolonged hospital stay. We undertook a meta-analysis on the screening and diagnostic accuracy of the haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test in women with and without risk factors for gestational diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: Unlike the oral glucose tolerance test, the HbA1c test is simple, quick and more acceptable. There is a growing body of evidence on the accuracy of HbA1c as a screening and diagnostic test for GDM. We searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library and selected relevant studies. Accuracy data for different thresholds within the final 23 included studies (16â921 women) were pooled using a multiple thresholds model. Summary accuracy indices were estimated by selecting an optimal threshold that optimises either sensitivity or specificity according to different scenarios. SUMMARY: HbA1c is more useful as a specific test at a cut-off of 5.7% (39âmmol/mol) with a false positive rate of 10%, but should be supplemented by a more sensitive test to detect women with GDM.","Amaefule, Chiamaka Esther; Sasitharan, Archana; Kalra, Princee; Iliodromoti, Stamatina; Huda, Mohammed S B; Rogozinska, Ewelina; Zamora, Javier; Thangaratinam, Shakila",Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol,,257
248905,The Potential Health Care Costs And Resource Use Associated With COVID-19 In The United States,2020,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and associated coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has brought farmers and farmworkers the designation of ""essential"", while placing them into heightened vulnerability for the disease. Many factors diminish access to education and prevention technologies emerging to combat COVID-19. For farmers, advanced age and rural location play a part. Farmworkers encounter numerous additional barriers including language and cultural differences, socioeconomic pressures, and immigration status. The unusual persistence and multiple transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 emerging from ongoing scientific study require customization of otherwise standard prevention messaging to farmers and farmworkers to prevent infection and disease exacerbation. AgriSafe Network and Migrant Clinicians Network, both national organizations and major stakeholders in agricultural health, are on the front lines of translating science into practical prevention strategies for those providing health services to farmworkers and farmers.

249206,Implementing an emotional support and mental health response plan for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a global challenge for managing acutely ill patients and complications from viral infection. Systemic inflammation accompanied by a ""cytokine storm,"" hemostasis alterations and severe vasculitis have all been reported to occur with COVID-19, and emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of lipid transport may contribute to some of these complications. Here, we aim to summarize the current understanding of the potential mechanisms related to COVID-19 dyslipidemia and propose possible adjunctive type therapeutic approaches that modulate lipids and lipoproteins. Specifically, we hypothesize that changes in the quantity and composition of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that occurs with COVID-19 can significantly decrease the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative functions of HDL and could contribute to pulmonary inflammation. Furthermore, we propose that lipoproteins with oxidized phospholipids and fatty acids could lead to virus-associated organ damage via overactivation of innate immune scavenger receptors. Restoring lipoprotein function with ApoA-I raising agents or blocking relevant scavenger receptors with neutralizing antibodies could, therefore, be of value in the treatment of COVID-19. Finally, we discuss the role of omega-3 fatty acids transported by lipoproteins in generating specialized proresolving mediators and how together with anti-inflammatory drugs, they could decrease inflammation and thrombotic complications associated with COVID-19.","Sorokin, Alexander V; Karathanasis, Sotirios K; Yang, Zhi-Hong; Freeman, Lita; Kotani, Kazuhiko; Remaley, Alan T",FASEB J,,257

Objective: To describe testing for SARS-CoV-2 and the epidemiology of infected patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic health record data from 135â¯794 patients younger than 25 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from January 1 through September 8, 2020. Data were from PEDSnet, a network of 7 US pediatric health systems, comprising 6.5 million patients primarily from 11 states. Data analysis was performed from September 8 to 24, 2020. Exposure: Testing for SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. Results: A total of 135â¯794 pediatric patients (53% male; mean [SD] age, 8.8 [6.7] years; 3% Asian patients, 15% Black patients, 11% Hispanic patients, and 59% White patients; 290 per 10â¯000 population [range, 155-395 per 10â¯000 population across health systems]) were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 5374 (4%) were infected with the virus (12 per 10â¯000 population [range, 7-16 per 10â¯000 population]). Compared with White patients, those of Black, Hispanic, and Asian race/ethnicity had lower rates of testing (Black: odds ratio [OR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.68-0.72]; Hispanic: OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.63-0.67]; Asian: OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.57-0.63]); however, they were significantly more likely to have positive test results (Black: OR, 2.66 [95% CI, 2.43-2.90]; Hispanic: OR, 3.75 [95% CI, 3.39-4.15]; Asian: OR, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.69-2.48]).

In univariate analyses, nonmalignant chronic disease was associated with lower likelihood of testing, and preexisting respiratory conditions were associated with lower risk of positive test results (standardized ratio [SR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.73-0.84]). However, several other diagnosis groups were associated with a higher risk of positive test results: malignant disorders (SR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.19-1.93]), cardiac disorders (SR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.05-1.32]), endocrinologic disorders (SR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.31-1.75]), gastrointestinal disorders (SR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.04-1.38]), genetic disorders (SR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.00-1.40]), hematologic disorders (SR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.06-1.47]), musculoskeletal disorders (SR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.07-1.30]), mental health disorders (SR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.10-1.30]), and metabolic disorders (SR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.24-1.61]). Among the 5374 patients with positive test results, 359 (7%) were hospitalized for respiratory, hypotensive, or COVID-19-specific illness. Of these, 99 (28%) required intensive care unit services, and 33 (9%) required mechanical ventilation. The case fatality rate was 0.2% (8 of 5374). The number of patients with a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease in early 2020 was 40% lower (259 vs 433 and 430) than in 2018 or 2019. Conclusions and Relevance: In this large cohort study of US pediatric patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were low, and clinical manifestations were typically mild. Black, Hispanic, and Asian race/ethnicity; adolescence and young adulthood; and nonrespiratory chronic medical conditions were associated with identified infection.

Methods: A representative US sample (N = 362) completed an online survey about potential risk/protective factors and health behaviors prior to the pandemic and after implemented/recommended restrictions. We assessed change in perceived health behaviors prior to and following introduction of COVID-19. We conducted hierarchical linear regression to explore and identify risk/protective factors related to physical activity, diet quality, and social isolation. Results: There have been substantial decreases in physical activity and increases in sedentary behavior and social isolation, but no changes in diet quality since COVID-19. We identified modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with each health behavior. Conclusions: Negative effects indicate the need for universal intervention to promote health behaviors. Inequalities in health behaviors among vulnerable populations may be exacerbated since COVID-19, suggesting need for targeted invention. Social support may be a mechanism to promote health behaviors. We suggest scaling out effective health behavior interventions with the same intensity in which physical distancing recommendations were implemented.","Weaver, Raven H; Jackson, Alexandra; Lanigan, Jane; Power, Thomas G; Anderson, Alana; Cox, Anne E; Eddy, Linda; Parker, Louise; Sano, Yoshie; Weybright, Elizabeth",Am J Health Behav,,257

MethodsWe tested a novel commercially available saliva collection kit with a virus inactivating and RNA stabilizing buffer (InActiv Blue(R)) in matched saliva and swab samples from 245 individuals, including 216 children, collected by general practitioners. ResultsBlind RT-qPCR testing of the saliva samples confirmed all 23 positives identified by swab testing (100% concordance), irrespective of age, presence of symptoms, or high-risk status. One childs saliva sample was found low positive while negative on the nasopharyngeal swab, resulting in an overall relative sensitivity of RT-qPCR saliva testing of 104.3%.

There is an urgent need, therefore, to find a proper treatment for the novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent. This paper focuses on identifying inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2 proteases, PLPRO and 3CLPRO, which control the duplication and manages the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. We have carried out detailed in silico Virtual high-throughput screening using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs from the Zinc database, COVID-19 clinical trial compounds from Pubchem database, Natural compounds from Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS) database and Maybridge database against PLPRO and 3CLPRO proteases. After thoroughly analyzing the screening results, we found five compounds, Bemcentinib, Pacritinib, Ergotamine, MFCD00832476, and MFCD02180753 inhibit PLPRO and six compounds, Bemcentinib, Clofazimine, Abivertinib, Dasabuvir, MFCD00832476, Leuconicine F inhibit the 3CLPRO. These compounds are stable within the protease proteins' active sites at 20ns MD simulation. The stability is revealed by hydrogen bond formations, hydrophobic interactions, and salt bridge interactions. Our study results also reveal that the selected five compounds against PLPRO and the six compounds against 3CLPRO bind to their active sites with good binding free energy. These compounds that inhibit the activity of PLPRO and 3CLPRO may, therefore, be used for treating COVID-19 infection.","Jade, Dhananjay; Ayyamperumal, Selvaraj; Tallapaneni, Vyshnavi; Joghee Nanjan, Chandrasekar Moola; Barge, Sagar; Mohan, Surender; Nanjan, Moola Joghee",Eur J Pharmacol,,257

253702,Maintaining mental health in the time of coronavirus,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide. This virus contains a unique polybasic insertion (PRRA) within the spike protein, resulting in a novel furin cleavage site that has been shown to influence viral infectivity and syncytia formation in cell culture. This insertion also generates novel putative sites of O-glycosylation, a protein modification that has been shown in other proteins to influence furin cleavage. Here, we define the specific members of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GALNT) family that are capable of glycosylating the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus spike and examine their presence in human respiratory cells that are targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, we show that O-glycosylation by specific members of the GALNT enzyme family modulates furin cleavage of the spike in vivo. Given the well-established role of O-glycosylation in the regulation of proteolysis, our results suggest that O-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 may play roles in aspects of spike stability/processing, which may influence viral infectivity and tropism.","Zhang, Liping Reynolds Hayley Mann Matthew Syed Zulfeqhar Martin Negin Tian E.; Zeldin, Darryl Tabak Lawrence Samara Nadine Ten Hagen Kelly",The FASEB Journal,,257

How aberrant fibrinolysis influences the clinical progression of COVID-19 presents a clinicopathological dilemma challenging intensivists. Methods: We performed meta-analysis and meta regression to analyze the associations of plasma D-dimer with 106 clinical variables to identify a panoramic view of the derangements of fibrinolysis in 14,862 patients of 42 studies. There were no limitations of age, gender, race, and country. Raw data of each group were extracted separately by two investigators. Individual data of case series, median and interquartile range, and ranges of median or mean were converted to SDM (standard deviation of mean). Findings: The weighted mean difference of D-dimer was 0.97 µg/mL (95% CI 0.65, 1.29) between mild and severe groups, as shown by meta-analysis. Publication bias was significant. Meta-regression identified 58 of 106 clinical variables were associated with plasma D-dimer levels. Of these, 11 readouts were negatively related to the level of plasma D-dimer. Further, age and gender were confounding factors. There were 22 variables independently correlated with the D-dimer level, including respiratory rate, dyspnea plasma K+, glucose, SpO2, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), bilirubin, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), systolic blood pressure, and CK (creatine kinase). Interpretation: These findings support elevated D-dimer as an independent predictor for both mortality and complications. The identified D-dimer-associated clinical variables draw a landscape integrating the aggregate effects of systemically suppressive and pulmonary hyperactive derangements of fibrinolysis, and the D-dimer-associated clinical biomarkers, and conceptually parameters could be combined for risk stratification, potentially for tracking thrombolytic therapy or alternative interventions.","Zhao, Runzhen; Su, Zhenlei; Komissarov, Andrey A; Liu, Shan-Lu; Yi, Guohua; Idell, Steven; Matthay, Michael A; Ji, Hong-Long",Front Immunol,,257

By exploring the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 can be a feasible way to find an effective vaccine. In this study by using in-silico tools, we recommended B-cell and T-cell epitopes of spike protein from a Bangladeshi isolate which can be considered for incorporation into a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2. Homology modelling, energy minimization process, and finally Ramachandran model was used for the prediction of a more stable conformation of the spike protein. The most important peptides were screened through the VaxiJen server followed by the IEDB server and CTLPred Score predicted and analysed the desired epitopes. In the final analysis, the peptide EVRQIAPGQTGKIADY (starting from 91) showed the highest antigenicity score (1.3837) as a B-cell epitope although GSTPCNGVEGFNCYFP, starting at 161, showed highest score (0.91) in an initial analysis. On the contrary, as a T-cell epitope, 71 KLNDLCFTNV-80 was found with the highest antigenicity score (2.6927) which was also found as an epitope in further analysis.

RESULTS: Only 68 (8.6%) patients worried about the outbreak of COVID-19. The prevalence of NPSs among all subjects was nearly 60.0%. Approximately 50.0% of the caregivers reported distress. More than 70.0% of patients remained stable in NPSs. However, anxiety, depression, aberrant motor disorder and delusion were exacerbated (22.9%, 18.6%, 17.1% and 16.8%, respectively). Appetite and eating disorder led alleviation rate by 25.8% while disappearing rate of agitation led by 5.8%. 7.5% of caregivers manifested depressive symptoms while 4.9% expressed anxiety symptoms, and 40.8% showed care burden. The coefficients of RSS and PHQ-9, RSS and GAD-7, RSS and NPI-D, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were 0.7, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.6, respectively (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Changes in NPSs during COVID-19 were observed in some patients with memory disorders and their caregivers, and adherence to medication contributed to the stabilization of NPSs.","Yuan, Shiyun; Zhang, Wenbo; Lü, Wenqi; Yu, Wuhan; Zhong, Fuxin; Xiong, Lei; Wan, Tianchi; Hu, Cheng; Yang, Wenkai; Chen, Chenxi; Luo, Daijing; Tan, Binjie; Huang, Chengcheng; Yu, Weihua; Lü, Yang",Aging Clin Exp Res,,257
263152,"Physical Activity, Sedentariness, Eating Behaviour and Well-Being during a COVID-19 Lockdown Period in Greek Adolescents",2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection can present with a broad clinical differential that includes many other respiratory viruses; therefore, accurate tests are crucial to distinguish true COVID-19 cases from pathogens that do not require urgent public health interventions. Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses is largely unknown during the COVID-19 pandemic but would inform strategies to rapidly and accurately test patients with respiratory symptoms. METHODS: This study retrospectively examined 298,415 respiratory specimens collected from symptomatic patients for SARS-CoV-2 testing in the three months since COVID-19 was initially documented in the province of Alberta, Canada (March-May, 2020). By focusing on 52,285 specimens that were also tested with the Luminex Respiratory Pathogen Panel for 17 other pathogens, this study examines the prevalence of 18 potentially co-circulating pathogens and their relative rates in prior years versus since COVID-19 emerged, including four endemic coronaviruses. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 2.2% of all specimens. Parallel broad multiplex testing detected additional pathogens in only 3.4% of these SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens: significantly less than in SARS-CoV-2-negative specimens (p < 0.0001), suggesting very low rates of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Furthermore, the overall co-infection rate was significantly lower among specimens with SARS-CoV-2 detected (p < 0.0001). Finally, less than 0.005% of all specimens tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and any of the four endemic coronaviruses tested, strongly suggesting neither co-infection nor cross-reactivity between these coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Broad respiratory pathogen testing rarely detected additional pathogens in SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens. While helpful to understand co-circulation of respiratory viruses causing similar symptoms as COVID-19, ultimately these broad tests were resource-intensive and inflexible in a time when clinical laboratories face unprecedented demand for respiratory virus testing, with further increases expected during influenza season. A transition from broad, multiplex tests toward streamlined diagnostic algorithms targeting respiratory pathogens of public health concern could simultaneously reduce the overall burden on clinical laboratories while prioritizing testing of pathogens of public health importance. This is particularly valuable with ongoing strains on testing resources, exacerbated during influenza seasons.","Marshall, Natalie C; Kariyawasam, Ruwandi M; Zelyas, Nathan; Kanji, Jamil N; Diggle, Mathew A",Virol J,,257

264095,"COVID-19: Mass exodus of migrant workers in India, are we staring at a mental health crisis?",2020,"As meatpacking facilities became COVID-19 hotspots, the pandemic renewed the importance of longstanding claims from environmental justice and agrifood scholars. The former asserts the perceived dispensability of marginalized populations sustains environmental injustices, whereas the latter stresses that decades of industrial consolidation created structural instability in the food supply chain. This article asks how industry and government leverage existing socio-ecological inequalities to ensure the continuity of the meatpacking supply chain during COVID-19, and the implications these actions hold for workers. To answer these questions, the authors perform case studies of meatpacking facilities in three Midwestern states. This article uses the critical environmental justice framework to expand research on sacrifice zones to include hazardous worksites such as meatpacking. We find that toxic employment flourishes through firms labor practices that pass socio-ecological risks onto workers in the name of efficiency, and through a complicit state that prioritizes accumulation and consumption over workers health.

264202,The Mental Health Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Sub-Saharan Africa,2020,"Background: Health care services across the world have been enormously affected by the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Services in oncology have been curtailed because medical services have been focused on preventing the spread of the virus and maximizing the number of available hospital beds. The present study was designed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on cancer screening. Methods: Databases such as Medline, Web of Science Core Collection (Indexes = SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A & HCI Timespan) and Scopus were searched comprehensively for articles published until January 2021. The keywords used were COVID-19 and cancer screening, Articles dealing with cancer screening in the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the review. Results: The review comprised 17 publications. The impact of COVID-19 was categorized into four dimensions: a significant decline in cancer screening and pathology samples, the cancer diagnosis rate, an increase in advanced cancers, mortality rate and years of life lost (YLLs). Conclusion: Cancer screening programs have been clearly interrupted since the onset of the COVID-19 disease. The anticipated outcomes include delayed diagnosis and marked increases in the numbers of avoidable cancer deaths. Urgent policy interventions are needed to handle the backlog of routine diagnostic services and minimize the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients.","Alkatout, I.; Biebl, M.; Momenimovahed, Z.; Giovannucci, E.; Hadavandsiri, F.; Salehiniya, H.; Allahqoli, L.",Frontiers in Oncology,,257

264252,Effect of COVID-19 on the mental health care of older people in Canada,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite being one of the wealthiest nations, disparities in adverse birth outcomes persist across racial and ethnic lines in the United States. We studied the association between historical redlining and preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), small-for-gestational age (SGA), and perinatal mortality over a ten-year period (2006-2015) in Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco, California. METHODS: We used birth outcomes data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) Security Maps developed in the 1930s assigned neighborhoods one of four grades that pertained to perceived investment risk of borrowers from that neighborhood: green (grade A) were considered ""Best"", blue (grade B) ""Still Desirable"", yellow (grade C) ""Definitely Declining"", and red (grade D, hence the term ""redlining"") ""Hazardous"". Geocoded residential addresses at the time of birth were superimposed on HOLC Security Maps to assign each birth a HOLC grade. We adjusted for potential confounders present at the time of Security Map creation by assigning HOLC polygons areal-weighted 1940s Census measures. We then employed propensity score matching methods to estimate the association of historical HOLC grades on current birth outcomes. Because tracts graded A had almost no propensity of receiving grade C or D and because grade B tracts had low propensity of receiving grade D, we examined birth outcomes in the three following comparisons: B vs. A, C vs. B, and D vs. C. RESULTS: The prevalence of preterm birth, SGA and mortality tended to be higher in worse HOLC grades, while the prevalence of LBW varied across grades. Overall odds of mortality and preterm birth increased as HOLC grade worsened. Propensity score matching balanced 1940s census measures across contrasting groups. Logistic regression models revealed significantly elevated odds of preterm birth (odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.05), and SGA (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00-1.05) in the C vs. B comparison and significantly reduced odds of preterm birth (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.91-0.95), LBW (OR: 0.94-95% CI: 0.92-0.97), and SGA (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92-0.96) in the D vs. C comparison. Results differed by metropolitan area and maternal race. CONCLUSION: Similar to prior studies on redlining, we found that worsening HOLC grade was associated with adverse birth outcomes, although this relationship was less clear after propensity score matching and stratifying by metropolitan area. Higher odds of preterm birth and SGA in grade C versus grade B neighborhoods may be caused by higher-stress environments, racial segregation, and lack of access to resources, while lower odds of preterm birth, SGA, and LBW in grade D versus grade C neighborhoods may due to population shifts in those neighborhoods related to gentrification.","Nardone, Anthony L; Casey, Joan A; Rudolph, Kara E; Karasek, Deborah; Mujahid, Mahasin; Morello-Frosch, Rachel",PLoS One,,257

However, assessment of public health risks by faecally contaminated water is limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the persistence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in water. In the present study the decay rates of viable infectious SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA were determined in river and seawater at 4 and 20°C. These decay rates were compared to S. typhimurium bacteriophage MS2 and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV). Persistence of viable SARS-CoV-2 was temperature dependent, remaining infectious for significantly longer periods of time in both freshwater and seawater at 4°C than at 20°C. T90 for infectious SARS-CoV-2 in river water was 2.3 days and 3.8 days at 20°C and 4°C, respectively. The T90 values were 1.1 days and 2.2 days in seawater at 20°C and 4°C, respectively. In contrast to the rapid inactivation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in river and sea water, viral RNA was relatively stable. The RNA decay rates were increased in non-sterilised river and seawater, presumably due to the presence of microbiota. The decay rates of infectious MS2, MS2 RNA and PMMoV RNA differed significantly from the decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting that their use as surrogate markers for the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment is limited.","Sala-Comorera, Laura; Reynolds, Liam J; Martin, Niamh A; O039,; Sullivan, John J; Meijer, Wim G; Fletcher, Nicola F",Water Res,,257

265849,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Life-Space Mobility of Older Adults Living in Brazil: REMOBILIZE Study,2021,"In the present in silico viral genetics study, a mathematical method was developed for the comparison of RNA sequences. The mathematical method used was to explore component similarities and patch them together with a modern geometric statistical projection method called multidimensional scaling (MDS). The comparison looked into similarities between ≈300 nucleotides (NT) of 7SL RNA and size ≈300 NT sub-sequences of SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA. RN7SL2 and RN7SL3 were also compared with SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA. In the component comparison, use was made of a He Hamiltonian model for the approximation of the density distribution of the outer two electrons. This was considered a basic ingredient of similarity. Improvements can be implemented later on. With MDS it is possible to blend theoretical with experimentally obtained characteristics of components. Furthermore, complementarity was employed to derive a numerical representation of the formation of RNA knots. With the use of crystallographic and electron microscopic coordinate data sets, we aimed to study a more geometric structure of comparing RNA with RNA and RNA with SRP9/14 protein. We found reason to believe that subsequences of the S2 SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA around position NT = 3620, can possibly behave similar to 7SLRNA. The latter can form “parasitic” Alu DNA. The hypothesis is drawn that under conditions where e.g. broken DNA occurs and RNA dependent DNA polymerase is present these RNA subsequences can, because of similar affinity to SRP9/14, be transformed into transposons and become a DNA parasite.","Geurdes, Han",Gene Reports,,257
266405,The use of combined hormonal contraceptives amid the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Viral pneumonia is caused by a spreading of lung infection caused by respiratory viruses. Some virus infections were found to be highly aggressive, leading to lung inflammation and severe damage in respiratory system with high fatality rate. Currently, there is no effective therapeutic drugs in the clinic. The common clinical symptoms of viral pneumonias include fever, rhinitis, runny nose, nonproductive cough, fatigue, myalgias and headaches after the immune system being tricked by driving cytokines and overactivated immune response induced by cytokine storms. Patients with severe symptoms could get persistent high fever, dysfunctional breathing, consciousness disorders and even respiratory failure, post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis, multi-organ damages, shock and so on. Most clinical treatments are used to inhibit virus replication, relieve symptoms, inhibit excessive inflammatory response, regulate immune balance and protect organs. Both applied and basic research demonstrate that Chinese patent medicine has certain anti-viral effects, effectively inhibiting viral pneumonia transiting from mild to severe, rapid relieving of patient symptoms because of their multi-component and multi-target integrated roles. This review has summarized the reports on the treatment of viral pneumonia. Based on the pathogenic characteristics of viral pneumonia, this paper summarizes the diverse roles of the marketed Chinese patent medicine, such as their effects in inhibiting the progress of viral replication and overactivated inflammatory response, regulating immune balance, attenuating pulmonary fibrosis and so forth. Our paper summarizes the advantages of Chinese patient medicine in the treatment of viral pneumonia, based on which improvements of clinical therapy are expected to be made soon.","Wang, Tao; Han, Li-Feng; Wang, Yue-Fei; Miao, Lin; Yang, Jian; Zhang, Jun-Hua; Gao, Xiu-Mei; Zhang, Bo-Li",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,,257

We analysed data from a large provider of long-term care for older people to investigate infection and mortality during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: cohort study of 179 UK care homes with 9,339 residents and 11,604 staff. We used manager-reported daily tallies to estimate the incidence of suspected and confirmed infection and mortality in staff and residents. Individual-level electronic health records from 8,713 residents were used to model risk factors for confirmed infection, mortality and estimate attributable mortality. RESULTS: 2,075/9,339 residents developed COVID-19 symptoms (22.2% [95% confidence interval: 21.4%; 23.1%]), while 951 residents (10.2% [9.6%; 10.8%]) and 585 staff (5.0% [4.7%; 5.5%]) had laboratory-confirmed infections. The incidence of confirmed infection was 152.6 [143.1; 162.6] and 62.3 [57.3; 67.5] per 100,000 person-days in residents and staff, respectively. Sixty-eight percent (121/179) of care homes had at least one COVID-19 infection or COVID-19-related death. Lower staffing ratios and higher occupancy rates were independent risk factors for infection.Out of 607 residents with confirmed infection, 217 died (case fatality rate: 35.7% [31.9%; 39.7%]). Mortality in residents with no direct evidence of infection was twofold higher in care homes with outbreaks versus those without (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.2 [1.8; 2.6]). CONCLUSIONS: findings suggest many deaths occurred in people who were infected with COVID-19, but not tested. Higher occupancy and lower staffing levels were independently associated with risks of infection. Protecting staff and residents from infection requires regular testing for COVID-19 and fundamental changes to staffing and care home occupancy.","Dutey-Magni, Peter F; Williams, Haydn; Jhass, Arnoupe; Rait, Greta; Lorencatto, Fabiana; Hemingway, Harry; Hayward, Andrew; Shallcross, Laura",Age Ageing,,257

271202,Longitudinal changes in mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study,2020,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly brought about a number of disruptions to when and where work is undertaken for hospitality employees. The rapid spread of COVID-19 forced many hospitality managers to use digital technologies to perform work from home, termed digital work connectivity. Yet little is known about how hospitality employees cope with it. The purpose of this study is to investigate an important yet underspecified issue as to how digital work connectivity can be detrimental for employees' work behavior. Design/methodology/approach: We test our hypotheses using multi-wave and multi-source data collected from 467 middle managerial-level hospitality employees in China. Findings: The findings show that digital work connectivity can lead to self-control depletion, which in turn is associated with disengagement from work. Further, the findings show that relational energy is an important resource that can buffer the detrimental effects of digital work connectivity on hospitality employees. Practical implications: The association of digital work connectivity with employee withdrawal behavior highlights the urgent need for hospitality enterprises to have clear guidelines that regulate technology use at home for work purposes. Social implications: Our research shows that the absence of clear guidelines in relation to the use of digital technology for work at home risks producing unintended consequences for both hospitality employees and their enterprises. Originality/value: Our research draws from recent advances in resource allocation theories of self-control and adopts a more nuanced approach to uncover a counterintuitive reality that while people use digital technology to remain connected with work, doing so can actually contribute to their withdrawal behavior.","Chadee, Doren; Ren, Shuang; Tang, Guiyao",Int J Hosp Manag,,257

METHODS AND RESULTS: All referrals made to a single tertiary referral sarcoma unit from January 2010 to December 2018 were extracted from a prospective database. Only 26.0% events discussed required review directly. 30.3% were discharged back to referrer. 16.5% required further investigations. 22.5% required a biopsy prior to review. There was a reduction in the rate of patients reviewed at the sarcoma clinic, and a higher discharge rate from the MDT in 2018 versus 2010 (p < 0.001). This gives a potential cost saving of 670,700 GBP over the 9 year period. CONCLUSION: An MDT meeting which triages referrals is cost-effective at reducing unnecessary referrals. This can limit unnecessary exposure of patients who may have an underlying diagnosis of cancer to a high-risk environment, and reduces burden on services as it copes with increasing demands during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alanie, Omer Mhf; Mahendra, Ashish; Mackinnon, Mairi; McCleery, Mark; Nicholas, Christopher; Gupta, Sanjay",Scott Med J,,257
272022,"Quarantine, restrictions and mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"OBJECTIVES: Baricitinib is supposed to have a double effect on SARS-CoV2 infection. Firstly, it reduces the inflammatory response through the inhibition of the Januse-Kinase signalling transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Moreover, it reduces the receptor mediated viral endocytosis by AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) inhibition. We propose the use of baricinitib to prevent the progression of the respiratory insufficiency in SARS-CoV2 pneumonia in onco-haematological patients. In this phase Ib/II study, the primary objective in the safety cohort is to describe the incidence of severe adverse events associated with baricitinib administration. The primary objective of the randomized phase (baricitinib cohort versus standard of care cohort) is to evaluate the number of patients who did not require mechanical oxygen support since start of therapy until day +14 or discharge (whichever it comes first). The secondary objectives of the study (only randomized phase of the study) are represented by the comparison between the two arms of the study in terms of mortality and toxicity at day+30. Moreover, a description of the immunological related changes between the two arms of the study will be reported. TRIAL DESIGN: The trial is a phase I/II study with a safety run-in cohort (phase 1) followed by an open label phase II randomized controlled trial with an experimental arm compared to a standard of care arm. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be performed at the Institut Català d'Oncologia, a tertiary level oncological referral center in the Catalonia region (Spain). The eligibility criteria are: patients > 18 years affected by oncological diseases; ECOG performance status < 2 (Karnofsky score > 60%); a laboratory confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 by means of real -time PCR; radiological signs of low respiratory tract disease; absence of organ dysfunction (a total bilirubin within normal institutional limits, AST/ALT&#8804;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal, alkaline phosphatase &#8804;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal, coagulation within normal institutional limits, creatinine clearance >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal); absence of HIV infection; no active or latent HBV or HCV infection. The exclusion criteria are: patients with oncological diseases who are not candidates to receive any active oncological treatment; hemodynamic instability at time of study enrollment; impossibility to receive oral medication; medical history of recent or active pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis or patients at high-risk of suffering them (surgical intervention, immobilization); multi organ failure, rapid worsening of respiratory function with requirement of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) > 50% or high-flow nasal cannula before initiation of study treatment; uncontrolled intercurrent illness (ongoing or severe active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements); allergy to one or more of study treatments; pregnant or breastfeeding women; positive pregnancy test in a pre-dose examination. Patients should have the ability to understand, and the willingness to sign, a written informed consent document; the willingness to accept randomization to any assigned treatment arm; and must agree not to enroll in another study of an investigational agent prior to completion of Day +28 of study. An electronic Case Report Form in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform will be used to collect the data of the trial. Removal from the study will apply in case of unacceptable adverse event(s), development of an intercurrent illness, condition or procedural complication, which could interfere with the patient's continued participation and voluntary patient withdrawal from study treatment (all patients are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any reasons, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Treatment will be administered on an inpatient basis. We will compare the experimental treatment with baricitinib plus the institutional standard of care compared with the standard of care alone. During the phase I, we will define the dose-limiting toxicity of baricitinib and the dose to be used in the phase 2 part of the study. The starting baricitinib dose will be an oral tablet 4 mg-once daily which can be reduced to 2 mg depending on the observed toxicity. The minimum duration of therapy will be 5 days and it can be extended to 7 days. The standard of care will include the following therapies. Antibiotics will be individualized based on clinical suspicion, including the management of febrile neutropenia. Prophylaxis of thromboembolic disease will be administered to all participants. Remdesivir administration will be considered only in patients with severe pneumonia (SatO2 <94%) with less than 7 days of onset of symptoms and with supplemental oxygen requirements but not using high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In the randomized phase, tocilizumab or interferon will not be allowed in the experimental arm. Tocilizumab can be used in patients in the standard of care arm at the discretion of the investigator. If it is prescribed it will be used according to the following criteria: patients who, according to his baseline clinical condition, would be an ICU tributary, interstitial pneumonia with severe respiratory failure, patients who are not on mechanical ventilation or ECMO and who are still progressing with corticoid treatment or if they are not candidates for corticosteroids. Mild ARDS (PAFI <300 mmHg) with radiological or blood gases deterioration that meets at least one of the following criteria: CRP >100mg/L D-Dimer >1,000µg/L LDH >400U/L Ferritin >700ng/ml Interleukin 6 &#8805;40ng/L. The use of tocilizumab is not recommended if there are AST/ALT values greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, neutrophils <500 cells/mm3, sepsis due to other pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, presence of comorbidity that can lead to a poor prognosis, complicated diverticulitis or intestinal perforation, ongoing skin infection. The dose will be that recommended by the Spanish Medicine Agency in patients &#8805;75Kg: 600mg dose whereas in patients <75kg: 400mg dose. Exceptionally, a second infusion can be assessed 12 hours after the first in those patients who experience a worsening of laboratory parameters after a first favourable response. The use of corticosteroids will be recommended in patients who have had symptoms for more than 7 days and who meet all the following criteria: need for oxygen support, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory failure or rapid deterioration of gas exchange, appearance or worsening of bilateral alveolar-interstitial infiltrates at the radiological level. In case of indication, it is recommended: dexamethasone 6mg/d p.o. or iv for 10 days or methylprednisolone 32mg/d orally or 30mg iv for 10 days or prednisone 40mg day p.o. for 10 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: Phase 1 part: to describe the toxicity profile of baricitinib in COVID19 oncological patients during the 5-7 day treatment period and until day +14 or discharge (whichever it comes first). Phase 2 part: to describe the number of patients in the experimental arm that will not require mechanical oxygen support compared to the standard of care arm until day +14 or discharge (whichever it comes first). RANDOMISATION: For the phase 2 of the study, the allocation ratio will be 1:1. Randomization process will be carried out electronically through the REDcap platform ( https://www.project-redcap.org/ ) BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open label study. No blinding will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The first part of the study (safety run-in cohort) will consist in the enrollment of 6 to 12 patients. In this population, we will test the toxicity of the experimental treatment. An incidence of severe adverse events grade 3-4 (graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.5.0) inferior than 33% will be considered sufficient to follow with the next part of the study. The second part of the study we will perform an interim analysis of efficacy at first 64 assessed patients and a definitive one will analyze 128 assessed patients. Interim and definitive tests will be performed considering in both cases an alpha error of 0.05. We consider for the control arm this rate is expected to be 0.60 and for the experimental arm of 0.80. Considering this data, a superiority test to prove a difference of 0.20 with an overall alpha error of 0.10 and a beta error of 0.2 will be performed. Considering a 5% of dropout rate, it is expected that a total of 136 patients, 68 for each study arm, will be required to complete study accrual.

272570,Addressing Justified Vaccine Hesitancy in the Black Community,2021,"In December, 2019 in Wuhan city of China, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has garnered global attention due to its rapid transmission. World Health Organization (WHO) termed the infection as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) after phylogenic studies with SARS-CoV. The virus causes severe respiratory infections with dry cough, high fever, body ache and fatigue. The virus is primarily transmitted among people through respiratory droplets from COVID-19 infected person. WHO declared this COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and since February, 2020 affected countries have locked down their cities, industries and restricted the movement of their citizens to minimize the spread of the virus. In spite of the negative aspects of coronavirus on the globe, the coronavirus crises brought a positive impact on the natural environment. Countries where the movement of citizens was seized to stop the spread of coronavirus infection have experienced a noticeable decline in pollution and greenhouse gases emission. Recent research also indicated that this COVID-19-induced lockdown has reduced the environmental pollution drastically worldwide. In this review, we have discussed some important positive impacts of coronavirus on environmental quality by compiling the recently published data from research articles, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency).","Khan, I; Shah, D; Shah, S S",Int J Environ Sci Technol (Tehran),,257
273551,Domestic violence against women during the Covid-19 pandemic: Turkey sample,2021,"Fuzzy set theory and a series of theories derived from it have been widely used to deal with uncertain phenomena in multi-criterion decision-making problems. However, few methods except the Z-number considered the reliability of information. In this paper, we propose a multi-criterion decision-making method based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory and generalized Z-numbers. To do so, inspired by the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set, we extend the Z-number to a generalized form which is more in line with human expression habits. Afterwards, we make a bridge between the knowledge of Z-numbers and the DS evidence theory to integrate Z-valuations. The identification framework in the DS theory is used to describe the generalized Z-numbers to avoid ambiguity. Then, the knowledge of Z-numbers is used to derive the basic probability assignment of evidence and the synthetic rules in the DS theory are used to integrate evaluations. An illustrative example of medicine selection for the patients with mild symptoms of the COVID-19 is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Ren, Zongyuan; Liao, Huchang; Liu, Yuxi",Comput Ind Eng,,257

274171,The Mental Health of Healthcare Staff Working During the COVID-19 Crisis: Their Working Hours as a Boundary Condition,2021,"BACKGROUND: In hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, outcomes markedly differ between locations, regions and countries. One possible cause for these variations in outcomes could be differences in patient treatment limitations (PTL) in different locations. We thus studied their role as predictor for mortality in a population of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In a region with high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, adult hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were prospectively registered and characterized regarding sex, age, vital signs, symptoms, comorbidities (including Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)), transcutaneous pulse oximetry (SpO2) and laboratory values upon admission, as well as ICU-stay including respiratory support, discharge, transfer to another hospital and death. PTL assessed by routine clinical procedures comprised the acceptance of ICU-therapy, orotracheal intubation and/or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. RESULTS: Among 526 patients included (median [quartiles] age 73 [57; 82] years, 47% female), 226 (43%) had at least one treatment limitation. Each limitation was associated with age, dementia and eGFR (p < 0.05 each), that regarding resuscitation additionally with Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and cardiac disease. Overall mortality was 27% and lower (p < 0.001) in patients without treatment limitation (12%) compared to those with any limitation (47%). In univariate analyses, age and comorbidities (diabetes, cardiac, cerebrovascular, renal, hepatic, malignant disease, dementia), SpO2, hemoglobin, leucocyte numbers, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 and LDH were predictive for death (p < 0.05 each). In multivariate analyses, the presence of any treatment limitation was an independent predictor of death (OR 4.34, 95%-CI 2.10-12.30; p = 0.001), in addition to CCI, eGFR < 55 ml/min, neutrophil number > 5 G/l, CRP > 7 mg/l and SpO2 < 93% (p < 0.05 each). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2, the percentage of patients with treatment limitations was high. PTL were linked to age, comorbidities and eGFR assessed upon admission and strong, independent risk factors for mortality. These findings might be useful for further understanding of COVID-19 mortality and its regional variations.

275156,HIV treatment engagement in the context of COVID-19: an observational global sample of transgender and nonbinary people living with HIV,2021,"Coronaviruses (CoV) have caused a number of major epidemics in humans and animals, including the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has brought a renewed focus on the evolution and interspecies transmission of coronaviruses. Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which was recently identified in piglets in southern China, is an alphacoronavirus that originates from the same genus of horseshoe bats as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and that was reported to be capable of infecting cells from a broad range of species, suggesting a considerable potential for interspecies transmission. Given the importance of the coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein in host range determination and viral entry, we report a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the SADS-CoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation at a 3.55-Å resolution. Our structure reveals that the SADS-CoV S trimer assumes an intrasubunit quaternary packing mode in which the S1 subunit N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and the S1 subunit C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) of the same protomer pack together by facing each other in the lying-down state. SADS-CoV S has several distinctive structural features that may facilitate immune escape, such as a relatively compact architecture of the S trimer and epitope masking by glycan shielding. Comparison of SADS-CoV S with the spike proteins of the other coronavirus genera suggested that the structural features of SADS-CoV S are evolutionarily related to those of the spike proteins of the other genera rather than to the spike protein of a typical alphacoronavirus. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationship between spike glycoproteins of SADS-CoV and those of other coronaviruses and extend our understanding of their structural and functional diversity.IMPORTANCE In this article, we report the atomic-resolution prefusion structure of the spike protein from swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). SADS-CoV is a pathogenic alphacoronavirus that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs and that was reported to be capable of interspecies transmission. We describe the overall structure of the SADS-CoV spike protein and conducted a detailed analysis of its main structural elements. Our results and analyses are consistent with those of previous phylogenetic studies and suggest that the SADS-CoV spike protein is evolutionarily related to the spike proteins of betacoronaviruses, with a strong similarity in S1-NTDs and a marked divergence in S1-CTDs. Moreover, we discuss the possible immune evasion strategies used by the SADS-CoV spike protein. Our study provides insights into the structure and immune evasion strategies of the SADS-CoV spike protein and broadens the understanding of the evolutionary relationships between coronavirus spike proteins of different genera.","Guan, Hongxin; Wang, Youwang; Perculija, Vanja; Saeed, Abdullah F U H; Liu, Yichang; Li, Jinyu; Jan, Syed Sajid; Li, Yu; Zhu, Ping; Ouyang, Songying",J. virol,,257

275573,Prevalence of and factors associated with mental health problems and suicidality among senior high school students in rural China during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by a new coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is spreading around the world. However, a universally effective treatment regimen has not been developed to date. The main protease (Mpro), a key enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, plays a crucial role in the replication and transcription of this virus in cells and has become the ideal target for rational antiviral drug design. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations three times for these complexes of Mpro (monomeric and dimeric) and nine potential drugs that have a certain effect on the treatment of COVID-19 to explore their binding mechanism. In addition, a total of 12 methods for calculating binding free energy were employed to determine the optimal drug. Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Chloroquine consistently showed an outstanding binding ability to monomeric Mpro under various methods. Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Saquinavir presented the best performance when binding to a dimer, which was independent of the protonated state of Hie41 (protonated at NÎµ) and Hid41 (protonated at NÎ´), and these findings suggest that Chloroquine may not effectively inhibit the activity of dimeric Mproin vivo. Furthermore, three common hot-spot residues of Met165, Hie41, and Gln189 of monomeric Mpro systems dominated the binding of Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Chloroquine. In dimeric Mpro, Gln189, Met165, and Met49 contributed significantly to binding with Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Saquinavir; therefore, Gln189 and Met165 might serve as the focus in the discovery and development of anti-COVID-19 drugs. In addition, the van der Waals interaction played a significant role in the binding process, and the benzene ring of the drugs showed an apparent inhibitory effect on the normal function of Mpro. The binding cavity had great flexibility to accommodate these different drugs. The results would be notably helpful for enabling a detailed understanding of the binding mechanisms for these important drug-Mpro interactions and provide valuable guidance for the design of potent inhibitors.","Luo, Song; Huang, Kaifang; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Cong, Yalong; Zhang, John Z H; Duan, Lili",Nanoscale,,257

276987,European Green Deal as Social Vaccine to Overcome COVID-19 Health & Economic Crisis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Physicians treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increasingly believe that the hyperinflammatory acute stage of COVID-19 results in a cytokine storm. The circulating biomarkers seen across the spectrum of COVID-19 have not been characterized compared with healthy controls, but such analyses are likely to yield insights into the pursuit of interventions that adequately reduce the burden of these cytokine storms. OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize the host inflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, we assessed levels of proteins related to immune responses and cardiovascular disease in patients stratified as mild, moderate, and severe versus matched healthy controls. METHODS: Blood samples from adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were analyzed using high-throughput and ultrasensitive proteomic platforms and compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls to provide insights into differential regulation of 185 markers. RESULTS: Results indicate a dominant hyperinflammatory milieu in the circulation and vascular endothelial damage markers within patients with COVID-19, and strong biomarker association with patient response as measured by Ordinal Scale. As patients progress, we observe statistically significant dysregulation of IFN-Î³, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-10, IL-19, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL5, ENRAGE, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1. Furthermore, in a limited series of patients who were sampled frequently, confirming reliability and reproducibility of our assays, we demonstrate that intervention with baricitinib attenuates these circulating biomarkers associated with the cytokine storm. CONCLUSIONS: These wide-ranging circulating biomarkers show an association with increased disease severity and may help stratify patients and selection of therapeutic options. They also provide insights into mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pathogenesis and the host response.","Sims, Jonathan T; Krishnan, Venkatesh; Chang, Ching-Yun; Engle, Sarah M; Casalini, Giacomo; Rodgers, George H; Bivi, Nicoletta; Nickoloff, Brian J; Konrad, Robert J; de Bono, Stephanie; Higgs, Richard E; Benschop, Robert J; Ottaviani, Silvia; Cardoso, Anabela; Nirula, Ajay; Corbellino, Mario; Stebbing, Justin",J. allergy clin. immunol,,257
277067,In Support of Community-based Primary Health Care: Coping with the COVID-19 Crisis,2020,"This article addresses student challenges posed by the need for distance learning in architectural design courses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Shiraz, Iran, in order to ascertain the student perception of a virtual learning experience. It also outlines the methods of managing an affordable education agenda to design online courses in Iran as a part of global efforts. For this purpose, an online survey was conducted in October 2020 based on the exploratory factor analysis. The research sample included architecture and interior architecture undergraduates and postgraduates. Data analysis was performed in SPSS 24. The survey identified six factors as (1) design process and communication skills;(2) self-directed learning;(3) digital sketching, drafting, modeling, and presentation;(4) acquaintances and experiences;(5) technical devices and facilities;and (6) tutorials and assessments. The findings showed some obstacles to the conventional education system in architecture and emphasized the need to redefine the education system based on the new sustainable design pedagogy framework. Therefore, the article proposes a model in which tutors act as consultants and facilitators, whereas students act as self-directed learners. In addition, the e-studio is considered an activity-oriented space to provide an opportunity for interaction, connection, and creativity.

277371,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and People with Hearing Problems,2021,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat. Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We described the clinical features of people infected on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were diagnosed with asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or mild or severe COVID-19, on admission to the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) and at the end of observation. METHODS: This retrospective, single-centre study included participants with laboratory-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital from Feb 11 to Feb 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analysed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until discharge or Feb 26, 2020, whichever came first. We defined asymptomatic infection as SARS-CoV-2 infection with no history of clinical signs and symptoms, severe COVID-19 as clinical symptoms of pneumonia (dyspnoea, tachypnoea, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation <93%, and need for oxygen therapy), and mild COVID-19 as all other symptoms. Clinical features on admission were compared among patients with different disease severity, including asymptomatic infection, at the end of observation. We used univariable analysis to identify factors associated with symptomatic illness among asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and disease progression in patients with COVID-19. FINDINGS: Among the 104 participants included in the final analysis, the median age was 68 years (IQR 47-75) and 54 (52%) were male. On admission, 43 (41%) participants were classified as asymptomatic, 41 (39%) as having mild COVID-10, and 20 (19%) as having severe COVID-19. At the end of observation, 33 (32%) participants were confirmed as being asymptomatic, 43 (41%) as having mild COVID-19, and 28 (27%) as having severe COVID-19. Serum lactate hydrogenase concentrations were significantly higher in the ten participants who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared with the 33 participants who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period (five [50%] vs four [12%] participants; odds ratio 7·25, 95% CI 1·43-36·70; p=0·020). Compared with patients with mild disease at the end of observation, patients with severe COVID-19 were older (median age 73 years [IQR 55-77] vs 60 years [40-71]; p=0·028) and had more frequent consolidation on chest CT (13 [46%] of 28 vs nine [21%] of 43; p=0·035) and lymphopenia (16 [57%] vs ten [23%]; p=0·0055) on admission. INTERPRETATION: Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19 and contribute to improved clinical management.

278663,Consultant psychiatrists's experience of the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on mental health services in Ireland,2021,"The epidemic curve and the final extent of the COVID-19 pandemic are usually predicted from the rate of early exponential raising using the SIR model. These predictions implicitly assume a full social mixing, which is not plausible generally. Here I am showing a counterexample to the these predictions, based on random propagation of an epidemic in Barab\'asi--Albert scale-free network models. The start of the epidemic suggests $R_0=2.6$, but unlike $\Omega\approx 70\%{}$ predicted by the SIR model, they reach a final extent of only $\Omega\approx 4\%{}$ without external mitigation and $\Omega\approx 0.5$--$1.5\%{}$ with mitigation. Daily infection rate at the top is also 1--1.5 orders of magnitude less than in SIR models. Quarantining only the 1.5\%{} most active superspreaders has similar effect on extent and top infection rate as blind quarantining a random 50\%{} of the full community.","Szab'o, Gyula M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00067v1.pdf,257

Our objective was to elaborate a protocol to make ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic a safer procedure for patients and professionals. METHODS: A multidisciplinary workgroup (including mental health, anesthesia, preventive medicine, and occupational risk professionals) was formed in the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, in March 2020. A core group conducted a review of the scientific literature and healthcare organizations' guidelines and wrote a protocol draft. Then, a discussion with the workgroup was made until consensus was reached. The protocol has been continuously updated. Discussions were made by group e-mailing and video conferencing. RESULTS: The protocol includes the following main areas: (1) ECT unit's structural and functional considerations; (2) SARS-CoV-2 screening protocol; (3) ECT clinical practice adaptation (personal protective equipment, airway management, recovery room, and maintenance of the facilities); (4) management of COVID-19 cases; and (5) protocol assessment. LIMITATIONS: The literature review was not systematic; the consensus was not based on a structured methodology. For other ECT units, local advisories may not be valid, and resource shortages (such as anesthetist availability, or the lack of respirators and PCR tests) may impede or prevent their implementation. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT should continue to be advocated as an essential medical procedure. It is recommended that each ECT unit develop its own protocol. This proposal may be used as a reference.","Gil-Badenes, Joaquín; Valero, Ricard; Valentí, Marc; Macau, Elisabet; Bertran, Maria Jesús; Claver, Gerard; Bioque, Miquel; Baeza, Inmaculada; Bastidas Salvadó, Anna; Lombraña Mencia, María; Pacchiarotti, Isabella; Bernardo, Miquel; Vieta, Eduard",J Affect Disord,,257

Women appear more susceptible to cigarette smoke, and often develop more severe lung disease at an earlier age with less smoke exposure. We aimed to analyse whether there are sex differences in DNA methylation in lung tissue and whether these DNA methylation marks interact with smoking. We collected lung tissue samples from former smokers who underwent lung tissue resection. One hundred thirty samples from white subjects were included for this analysis. Regression models for sex as a predictor of methylation were adjusted for age, presence of COPD, smoking variables and technical batch variables revealed 710 associated sites. 294 sites demonstrated robust sex-specific methylation associations in foetal lung tissue. Pathway analysis identified 6 nominally significant pathways including the mitophagy pathway. Three CpG sites demonstrated a suggested interaction between sex and pack-years of smoking: GPR132, ANKRD44 and C19orf60. All of them were nominally significant in both male- and female-specific models, and the effect estimates were in opposite directions for male and female; GPR132 demonstrated significant association between DNA methylation and gene expression in lung tissue (P < 0.05). Sex-specific associations with DNA methylation in lung tissue are wide-spread and may reveal genes and pathways relevant to sex differences for lung damaging effects of cigarette smoking.","Koo, Hyeon-Kyoung; Morrow, Jarrett; Kachroo, Priyadarshini; Tantisira, Kelan; Weiss, Scott T; Hersh, Craig P; Silverman, Edwin K; DeMeo, Dawn L",Epigenetics,,257

According to daily reports from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China from March 31, 2020 to April 7, 2020, the number of new asymptomatic cases reported daily greatly exceeded that of new imported cases. As of 24:00 on April 7, there were a total of 1,095 asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 under medical observation on the Chinese mainland, including 358 imported cases. A growing number of studies have indicated that asymptomatic carriers are infectious to an extent and can potentially transmit COVID-19. At present, China's measures for managing asymptomatic carriers are 14 days of centralized quarantine and observation; in principle, people with two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests (at an interval of at least 24 hours) can be released from quarantine. However, asymptomatic carriers will not be included in confirmed cases unless they develop clinical manifestations while in quarantine. As ""silent spreaders"", asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control. The testing and follow-up of asymptomatic carriers should be expanded to include people in close contact with patients with confirmed COVID-19 and asymptomatic cases, clusters of outbreaks, and key areas and populations with a high risk of infection.","Zhang, Jiao; Wu, Shoucai; Xu, Lingzhong",Biosci Trends,,257

OBJECTIVE: To compare DN and TPMT for reducing pain on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) scores and improving function on the Neck Disability Index (NDI) in patients with neck and upper back MPS. METHODS: PubMed, PEDro, and CINAHL were searched for randomized controlled trials within the last 10 years comparing a group receiving DN and the other receiving TPMT. Studies were assessed using PEDro scale and Cochrane risk-of-bias tool to assess methodological quality. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effect model. Standardized mean differences (Cohen's d) and confidence intervals were calculated to compare DN to TPMT for effects on VAS, PPT, and NDI. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials with 241 participants total were included in this systematic review. The effect size of difference between DN and TPMT was non-significant for VAS [d = 0.41 (-0.18, 0.99)], for PPT [d = 0.64 (-0.19, 1.47)], and for NDI [d = -0.66 (-1.33, 0.02)].

288274,Impact of Social Isolation Due to COVID-19 on Health in Older People: Mental and Physical Effects and Recommendations,2020,"Pyramid schemes are investment scams in which top-level participants in a hierarchical network recruit and profit from an expanding base of defrauded newer participants. Pyramid schemes have existed for over a century, but there have been no in-depth studies of their dynamics and communities because of the opacity of participants' transactions. In this paper, we present an empirical study of Forsage, a pyramid scheme implemented as a smart contract and at its peak one of the largest consumers of resources in Ethereum. As a smart contract, Forsage makes its (byte)code and all of its transactions visible on the blockchain. We take advantage of this unprecedented transparency to gain insight into the mechanics, impact on participants, and evolution of Forsage. We quantify the (multi-million-dollar) gains of top-level participants as well as the losses of the vast majority (around 88%) of users. We analyze Forsage code both manually and using a purpose-built transaction simulator to uncover the complex mechanics of the scheme. Through complementary study of promotional videos and social media, we show how Forsage promoters have leveraged the unique features of smart contracts to lure users with false claims of trustworthiness and profitability, and how Forsage activity is concentrated within a small number of national communities.","Kell, Tyler; Yousaf, Haaroon; Allen, Sarah; Meiklejohn, Sarah; Juels, Ari",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04380v2.pdf,257

During May 2020, n = 355 participants provided demographics, personality, health anxiety scores, attachment styles, political ideology, and attitudes towards the pandemic. In both social media and MTurk subsamples (but not in a subsample from a ListServ of professional psychologists), anxious attachment was a significant predictor of distress above and beyond personality and health anxiety. In addition, political ideology emerged as a consistent predictor of perceptions of the seriousness of COVID-19, even holding the other predictors constant. Understanding an individual's attachment style may be helpful in working with them in their trauma. This research also contributes to early empirical evidence for the impact of political ideology on self-reported attitudes and behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wagerman, Seth A; Bedikian, Alique; Ross, Benjamin S",Pers Individ Dif,,257

Quantitative results revealed significant differences when comparing pre- and post-surveys on questions regarding L2 skills and knowledge while qualitative results indicated that participants had preferences between the technology tools used during the treatment. Although the physical language lab has become almost non-existent, this study suggests that L2 instructors should provide opportunities where L2 learners can expand their language skills outside of the classroom through the creation of an online language laboratory. This laboratory has the ability to transform L2 students' language learning as well as be very valuable in today's classroom given the current COVID-19 global crisis. © 2021 IGI Global.

HHV-6 comprises two recognized species (HHV-6A and HHV-6B). Despite different cell tropism and disease association, HHV-6A/B show high genome homology and harbor the conserved U94 gene, which is limited to HHV-6 and absent in all the other human herpesviruses. U94 has key functions in the virus life cycle and associated diseases, having demonstrated or putative roles in virus replication, integration, and reactivation. During natural infection, U94 elicits an immune response, and the prevalence and extent of the anti-U94 response are associated with specific diseases. Notably, U94 can entirely reproduce some virus effects at the cell level, including inhibition of cell migration, induction of cytokines and HLA-G expression, and angiogenesis inhibition, supporting a direct U94 role in the development of HHV-6-associated diseases. Moreover, specific U94 properties, such as the ability to modulate angiogenesis pathways, have been exploited to counteract cancer development. Here, we review the information available on this key HHV-6 gene, highlighting its potential uses.","Caselli, Elisabetta; D039,; Accolti, Maria; Caccuri, Francesca; Soffritti, Irene; Gentili, Valentina; Bortolotti, Daria; Rotola, Antonella; Cassai, Enzo; Fiorentini, Simona; Zani, Alberto; Caruso, Arnaldo; Rizzo, Roberta; Di Luca, Dario",,,257

300257,[Considering Health and Society COVID-19 Health Disparities Caused by Pandemics],2020,"OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is prevalent in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The acetaminophen absorption test (AAT) has been previously described as a direct method for assessment of GI function. Our study determines whether the AAT can be used to assess GI function in critically ill COVID-19 patients, compared with traditional measures of GI function. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of critically ill patients with COVID-19. SETTING: Three intensive care units at a tertiary care academic medical center. PATIENTS: Twenty critically ill patients with COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: The results of AAT and traditional measures for assessing GI function were collected and compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the study cohort, 55% (11 of 20) of patients had evidence of malabsorption by AAT. Interestingly, all patients with evidence of malabsorption by AAT had clinical evidence of bowel function, as indicated by stool output and low gastric residuals during the prior 24 h. When comparing patients with a detectable acetaminophen level (positive AAT) with those who had undetectable acetaminophen levels (negative AAT), radiologic evidence of ileus was less frequent (20 vs 88%; P = .03), tolerated tube-feed rates were higher (40 vs 10 ml/h; P =.01), and there was a trend toward lower gastric residual volumes (45 vs 830 ml; P =.11). CONCLUSION: Malabsorption can occur in critically ill patients with COVID-19 despite commonly used clinical indicators of tube-feeding tolerance. The AAT provides a simple, rapid, and cost-effective mechanism by which enteral function can be efficiently assessed in COVID-19 patients.","Southren, Daniel L; Nardone, Alexa D; Haastrup, Adeniran A; Roberts, Russel J; Chang, Marvin G; Bittner, Edward A",Nutr Clin Pract,,257

The people of Hubei province perceived courtesy and affiliate stigma due to the geographic linkage to COVID-19. Perceived courtesy stigma refers to the perception of stigma of people who are associated with COVID-19 (e.g., the geographic linkage). Affiliate stigma is the internalization and psychological responses of perceived courtesy stigma among the associates. OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to reveal different patterns of perceived courtesy and affiliate stigma among people who are at high risk of contagion of COVID-19, and to examine the possible risk factors. METHOD: A sample including 2813 adults who located in Hubei Province, China (female: n = 2,184, 77.64%; male: n = 629, 22.36%; mean age = 37.85 years, SD = 6.61 years, range = 18-63 years) were employed in the current study, using latent profile analysis for searching stigma profiles. RESULTS: Three profiles of stigma were found: the ""Denier"" (35.98%), ""Confused moderate"" (48.13%) and ""Perceiver"" (15.89%) displaying the low, moderate and high level of perceived courtesy and affiliate stigma, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that generally people with a high level of education, perceived threats, anxiety symptoms, and familiarity with quarantined cases have a high likelihood to be distributed into the ""Perceiver"". DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the issues of COVID-19-related stigma and provide evidence for launching effective health actions to promote a cohesive society and culture of health. The media can transmit scientific knowledge, promote positive interactions and social cohesion between the stigmatized group and the dominant group, and create spaces for stories that nurture group identification among the implicated people. Future studies should use more representative sample and improve the measures.","Duan, Wenjie; Bu, He; Chen, Zheng",Soc Sci Med,,257

Nurses play a crucial role in care and therefore should keep up with this trend and improve their intercultural sensitivity. OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: This descriptive cross-sectional study investigated the effects of ethnocentrism and moral sensitivity on intercultural sensitivity in nursing students. METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected using a demographic characteristics questionnaire and the Intercultural Sensitivity Scale, Generalized Ethnocentrism Scale, and Moral Sensitivity Scale. The sample consisted of 1343 nursing students. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine correlations between scale scores. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the effects of ethnocentrism, moral sensitivity, and demographic characteristics on intercultural sensitivity. RESULTS: Intercultural sensitivity was found to be negatively correlated with ethnocentrism and positively correlated with moral sensitivity. Ethnocentrism predicted intercultural sensitivity more than moral sensitivity. Ethnocentrism and moral sensitivity explained 16.8% of the total variance of intercultural sensitivity. However, ethnocentrism affected intercultural sensitivity more than moral sensitivity did (beta = -0.406). CONCLUSION: Nursing education should adopt strategies to reduce ethnocentrism by helping students develop cultural competence and intercultural sensitivity. Such education can equip nurses to provide higher quality care to patients of different cultural backgrounds.","Kaya, Yunus; Arslan, Sevda; Erbas, Atiye; Yasar, Beril Nisa; Küçükkelepçe, Gülhan Erkus",Nurse Educ Today,,257
301933,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and perinatal health: a scoping review,2021,"Abstract The outbreak of COVID-19 led to a record-breaking race to develop a vaccine. However, the limited vaccine capacity creates another massive challenge: how to distribute vaccines to mitigate the near-end impact of the pandemic? In the United States in particular, the new Biden administration is launching mass vaccination sites across the country, raising the obvious question of where to locate these clinics to maximize the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign. This paper tackles this question with a novel data-driven approach to optimize COVID-19 vaccine distribution. We first augment a state-of-the-art epidemiological model, called DELPHI, to capture the effects of vaccinations and the variability in mortality rates across age groups. We then integrate this predictive model into a prescriptive model to optimize the location of vaccination sites and subsequent vaccine allocation. The model is formulated as a bilinear, nonconvex optimization model. To solve it, we propose a coordinate descent algorithm that iterates between optimizing vaccine distribution and simulating the dynamics of the pandemic. As compared to benchmarks based on demographic and epidemiological information, the proposed optimization approach increases the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign by an estimated 20%, saving an extra 4000 extra lives in the United States over a 3-month period. The proposed solution achieves critical fairness objectives?by reducing the death toll of the pandemic in several states without hurting others?and is highly robust to uncertainties and forecast errors?by achieving similar benefits under a vast range of perturbations.","Bertsimas, Dimitris Digalakis Jr Vassilis Jacquillat Alexander Li Michael Lingzhi Previero Alessandro",Naval Research Logistics (NRL),,257
302563,COVID-19 Pandemic: A Time for Collaboration and A Unified Global Health Front,2020,"The present study examines the trajectories of unhealthy food and alcohol consumption over time and considers whether perceived impact of COVID-19 and psychological variables are predictors of these trajectories. We ascertained whether these predictors are different in women vs. men and between women living with vs. without children. Data were collected through online surveys administered to 1038 participants from two universities (staff and students) in Chile, across five waves (July to October 2020). Participants provided information about their past-week unhealthy food and alcohol consumption and mental health. Using latent growth curve modeling analysis, we found that higher perceived health and interpersonal COVID-19 impact, younger age and lower depression symptoms were associated with more rapid increases over time in unhealthy food consumption. On the other hand, higher perceived COVID-19 economic impact and older age were associated with more rapid diachronic decreases in alcohol consumption. Gender and living with or without children, for women only, were moderators of these trajectories. This longitudinal study provides strong evidence identifying the multiple repercussions of COVID-19 and mental health factors on unhealthy food and alcohol consumption.

303598,Mental health and psychosocial support strategies in highly contagious emerging disease outbreaks of substantial public concern: a systematic scoping review,2021,"Over the past few years, there is a heated debate and serious public concerns regarding online content moderation, censorship, and the basic principle of free speech on the Web. To ease some of these concerns, mainstream social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook refined their content moderation systems to support soft moderation interventions. Soft moderation interventions refer to warning labels that are attached to potentially questionable or harmful content with the goal of informing other users about the content and its nature, while the content remains accessible, hence alleviating concerns related to censorship and free speech. In this work, we perform one of the first empirical studies on soft moderation interventions on Twitter. Using a mixed-methods approach, we study the users that are sharing tweets with warning labels on Twitter and their political leaning, the engagement that these tweets receive, and how users interact with tweets that have warning labels. Among other things, we find that 72% of the tweets with warning labels are shared by Republicans, while only 11% are shared by Democrats. By analyzing content engagement, we find that tweets with warning labels tend to receive more engagement. Also, we qualitatively analyze how users interact with content that has warning labels finding that the most popular interactions are related to further debunking false claims, mocking the author or content of the disputed tweet, and further reinforcing or resharing false claims. Finally, we describe concrete examples of inconsistencies such as warning labels that are incorrectly added or warning labels that are not added on tweets despite sharing questionable and potentially harmful information.","Zannettou, Savvas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07183v1.pdf,257

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective observational study involving epidemiological information from 403 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 between 1 March and 31 May 2020. Data were collected from 70 centres that participate in the Spanish Registry of COVID-19. METHODS: Patients' information was collected from their medical chart. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The rate of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and development of the infection in neonates within 14 days postpartum. RESULTS: The early cord clamping (ECC) group consisted of 231 infants (57.3%) and the DCC group consisted of 172 infants (42.7%). Five positive newborns (1.7% of total tests performed) were identified with the nasopharyngeal PCR tests performed in the first 12 hours postpartum, two from the ECC group (1.7%) and three from the DCC group (3.6%). No significant differences between groups were found regarding neonatal tests for SARS-CoV-2. No confirmed cases of vertical transmission were detected. The percentage of mothers who made skin-to-skin contact within the first 24 hours after delivery was significantly higher in the DCC group (84.3% versus 45.9%). Breastfeeding in the immediate postpartum period was also significantly higher in the DCC group (77.3% versus 50.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show no differences in perinatal outcomes when performing ECC or DCC, and skin-to-skin contact, or breastfeeding.

Low user rates for these apps can affect contact tracing and, thus, its usefulness in controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the early perceptions of people living in the German-speaking countries and compare them with the frames portrayed in the newspapers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with 159 participants of the SolPan project. Of those, 110 participants discussed contact tracing apps and were included in this study. We analyzed articles regarding contact tracing apps from 12 newspapers in the German-speaking countries. RESULTS: Study participants perceived and newspaper coverage in all German-speaking countries framed contact tracing apps as governmental surveillance tools and embedded them in a broader context of technological surveillance. Participants identified trust in authorities, respect of individual privacy, voluntariness, and temporary use of contact tracing apps as prerequisites for democratic compatibility. Newspapers commonly referenced the use of such apps in Asian countries, emphasizing the differences in privacy regulation among these countries. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of digital contact tracing apps in German-speaking countries may be undermined due to privacy risks that are not compensated by potential benefits and are rooted in a deeper skepticism towards digital tools. When authorities plan to implement new digital tools and practices in the future, they should be very transparent and proactive in communicating their objectives and the role of the technology-and how it differs from other, possibly similar, tools. It is also important to publicly address ethical, legal, and social issues related to such technologies prior to their launch.","Zimmermann, Bettina Maria; Fiske, Amelia; Prainsack, Barbara; Hangel, Nora; McLennan, Stuart; Buyx, Alena",J Med Internet Res,,257

All human populations are susceptible to this disease. Here we present two pediatric COVID-19 cases, both of whom exhibited negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests upon nasopharyngeal swab and were initially diagnosed with influenza A infection. COVID-19 was later confirmed in both patients by serum antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 and nucleic acid test on stool samples. Because children are susceptible to many respiratory pathogens, especially influenza, we concluded that children can be coinfected with multiple pathogens, and more attention should be paid to the exploration of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic of COVID-19. This report shows the possibility of misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis of children with COVID-19. We suggest that highly suspected pediatric COVID-19 cases with negative nucleic acid tests on nasopharyngeal swabs should be further checked by performing a nucleic acid test on stool samples and testing serum for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Zou, Biao; Ma, Di; Li, Yinhu; Qiu, Liru; Chen, Yu; Hao, Yan; Luo, Xiaoping; Shu, Sainan",Front.

310431,An Interprofessional Community-Based Complex Care Course Grounded in Social Determinants of Health,2020,"Most of the information operations involve users who may foster polarization and distrust toward science and mainstream journalism, without these users being conscious of their role. Gab is well known to be an extremist-friendly platform that performs little control on the posted content. Thus it represents an ideal benchmark for studying phenomena potentially related to polarization such as misinformation spreading. The combination of these factors may lead to hate as well as to episodes of harm in the real world. In this work we provide a characterization of the interaction patterns within Gab around the COVID-19 topic. To assess the spreading of different content type, we analyze consumption patterns based on both interaction type and source reliability. Overall we find that there are no strong statistical differences in the social response to questionable and reliable content, both following a power law distribution. However, questionable and reliable sources display structural and topical differences in the use of hashtags. The commenting behaviour of users in terms of both lifetime and sentiment reveals that questionable and reliable posts are perceived in the same manner. We can conclude that despite evident differences between questionable and reliable posts Gab users do not perform such a differentiation thus treating them as a whole.

We found that the ICCRT modified the assumptions made in their model as more data became available in a way that maintained the conclusion that lockdown was most effective. These observations suggest that modeling of non-pharmaceutical interventions during an ongoing pandemic must be interpreted with caution as sources of error can be found both in the technical execution of the modeling and the assumptions made.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to estimate the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with MS. METHODS: Two independent researchers independently searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and google scholar along with gray literature up to April 2021. The search strategy included the MeSH and text words as (((coronavirus OR Wuhan coronavirus OR novel coronavirus OR coronavirus disease OR COVID-19 OR 2019 novel coronavirus infection OR 2019-nCOV OR severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (Multiple Sclerosis OR Sclerosis, Multiple) OR Sclerosis, Disseminated) OR Disseminated Sclerosis) OR MS (Multiple Sclerosis)) OR Multiple Sclerosis, Acute Fulminating). RESULTS: We found 1466 articles by literature search, and after deleting duplicates, 1029 remained. Twelve articles remained for meta-analysis. Totally, 101,462 patients were evaluated and the total number of possible/confirmed cases was 1394. Mean age ranged from 35 to 54 years. Totally, 49 patients died. The pooled prevalence of suspected COVID-19 in MS patients was 4% (95% CI: 3-4%) (I2 = 98.5%, P < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of hospitalization in infected cases was 10% (95% CI: 7-12%) (I2 = 95.6%, P < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of death in hospitalized cases was 4% (95% CI: 1-6%) (I2 = 82.4%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Hospitalization rate is higher among MS patients based on COVID-19 infection while the pooled infection rate is estimated as 4%.","Moghadasi, Abdorreza Naser; Mirmosayyeb, Omid; Barzegar, Mahdi; Sahraian, Mohammad Ali; Ghajarzadeh, Mahsa",Neurol Sci,,257
315088,Bill would make telehealth MAT permanent,2020,"Video conferencing applications (VCAs) have become a critical Internet application, even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic, as users worldwide now rely on them for work, school, and telehealth. It is thus increasingly important to understand the resource requirements of different VCAs and how they perform under different network conditions, including: how much speed (upstream and downstream throughput) a VCA needs to support high quality of experience; how VCAs perform under temporary reductions in available capacity; how they compete with themselves, with each other, and with other applications; and how usage modality (e.g., number of participants) affects utilization. We study three modern VCAs: Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Answers to these questions differ substantially depending on VCA. First, the average utilization on an unconstrained link varies between 0.8 Mbps and 1.9 Mbps. Given temporary reduction of capacity, some VCAs can take as long as 50 seconds to recover to steady state. Differences in proprietary congestion control algorithms also result in unfair bandwidth allocations: in constrained bandwidth settings, one Zoom video conference can consume more than 75% of the available bandwidth when competing with another VCA (e.g., Meet, Teams). For some VCAs, client utilization can decrease as the number of participants increases, due to the reduced video resolution of each participant's video stream given a larger number of participants. Finally, one participant's viewing mode (e.g., pinning a speaker) can affect the upstream utilization of other participants.","MacMillan, Kyle; Mangla, Tarun; Saxon, James; Feamster, Nick",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13478v1.pdf,257

316629,Commentary: Challenges and opportunities in autism assessment - a commentary on Kannes and Bishop (2020),2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: COVID-19-related acute neurological phenotypes are being increasingly recognised, with neurological complications reported in more than 30% of hospitalised patients. However, multicentric studies providing a population-based perspective are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicentric study at five hospitals in Northern Portugal, representing 45.1% of all hospitalised patients in this region, between 1 March and 30 June 2020. RESULTS: Among 1261 hospitalised COVID-19 patients, 457 (36.2%) presented neurological manifestations, corresponding to a rate of 357 per 1000 in the North Region. Patients with neurologic manifestations were younger (68.0 vs. 71.2 years, p = 0.002), and the most frequent neurological symptoms were headache (13.4%), delirium (10.1%), and impairment of consciousness (9.7%). Acute well-defined central nervous system (CNS) involvement was found in 19.1% of patients, corresponding to a rate of 217 per 1000 hospitalised patients in the whole region. Assuming that all patients with severe neurological events were hospitalised, we extrapolated our results to all COVID-19 patients in the region, estimating that 116 will have a severe neurological event, corresponding to a rate of nine per 1000 (95% CI = 7-11). Overall case fatality in patients presenting neurological manifestations was 19.8%, increasing to 32.6% among those with acute well-defined CNS involvement. CONCLUSIONS: We characterised the population of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Northern Portugal and found that neurological symptoms are common and associated with a high degree of disability at discharge. CNS involvement with criteria for in-hospital admission was observed in a significant proportion of patients. This knowledge provides the tools for adequate health planning and for improving COVID-19 multidisciplinary patient care.","Oliveira, Vanessa; Seabra, Mafalda; Rodrigues, Rita; Carvalho, Vanessa; Mendes, Michel; Pereira, Diogo; Caldeiras, Catarina; Martins, Bárbara; Silva, Renata; Azevedo, Ana; Lima, Maria João; Monteiro, Catarina; Varela, Ricardo; Malheiro, Sofia; Abreu, Miguel; Azevedo, Elsa; Leal Loureiro, José; Tedim Cruz, Vítor; Silva, Mário Rui; Magalhães, Rui; Silva, Carolina; Maia, Luís F; Correia, Manuel",Eur. j. neurol,,257

Here, we completely map all of the mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that escape binding by a leading monoclonal antibody, LY-CoV555, and its cocktail combination with LY-CoV016. Individual mutations that escape binding by each antibody are combined in the circulating B.1.351 and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages (E484K escapes LY-CoV555, K417N/T escapes LY-CoV016). In addition, the L452R mutation in the B.1.429 lineage escapes LY-CoV555. Furthermore, we identify single amino acid changes that escape the combined LY-CoV555+LY-CoV016 cocktail. We suggest that future efforts diversify the epitopes targeted by antibodies and antibody cocktails to make them more resilient to the antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2.","Starr, Tyler N; Greaney, Allison J; Dingens, Adam S; Bloom, Jesse D",Cell Rep Med,,257

320134,Mental health in biological disasters: From SARS to COVID-19,2020,"Tourism authorities in Thailand have consistently pursued profit-seeking mass tourism, resulting in the detriment of the natural resources in major tourist destinations. In response, sustainable tourism projects centered on preserving the environment have been established but neglect the financial needs of tour operators. The objective of this study was to investigate the determinants of tourist expenditure per capita in Thailand using a dataset consisting of 31 countries from 2010 to 2017. The analysis was based on an autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) and used a panel estimated generalized least square (ELGS). Generating such knowledge is essential for tourist authorities to develop profitable and sustainable tourism projects in tourist destinations whose natural resources have been affected by profit-seeking tourism. The tourism expenditure per capita is positively affected by word of mouth, income, and the rising prices in other major tourist destinations in Asia. However, it was negatively affected by relative levels of price and corruption. Sustainable tourism projects can be used to develop activities that will help distinguish Thailand from other tourism destinations in Asia. However, in implementing these sustainable tourism initiatives, the mark-up should be minimized to keep tourist prices in Thailand competitive.","Chulaphan, Wanvilai",Sustainability,,257
320477,"Eating in the lockdown during the Covid 19 pandemic; self-reported changes in eating behaviour, and associations with BMI, eating style, coping and health anxiety",2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for provider teams working in intensive care units, including rapidly changing patient care regulations, staffing considerations, and preservation of personal protective equipment. The need for enhanced respiratory precautions for infected patients and patients under investigation has necessitated a new process for interventions and resuscitation. LOCAL PROBLEM: Along with changing regulations and equipment, significant staff anxiety surrounded caring for infected patients and preparing for emergency situations. METHODS: A huddle process was implemented in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit for acutely ill patients who required enhanced respiratory precautions and were at risk of imminent decompensation, or who required a bedside procedure. During a huddle, the multidisciplinary team used process maps displayed in patient rooms; the huddle process created a situational awareness of events among these teams. INTERVENTION: After implementation of huddles, a survey was distributed to cardiac intensive care unit staff in order to understand their satisfaction with the huddle process. RESULTS: A total of 36 staff responded to the survey. They thought the huddles helped them to prepare for resuscitation scenarios, helped limit the number of personnel responding to an emergency, and reduced their anxiety surrounding caring for these patients. Staff suggested generalizing this huddle process to all patients at acute risk for decompensation in the cardiac intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: A novel huddle process created situational awareness among staff caring for patients requiring enhanced respiratory isolation because of COVID-19. Multidisciplinary huddles allowed staff from various disciplines to apply a process map for interventions and resuscitations among critically ill children with heart disease.","Christensen, Kristen; Colman, Nora; Van Voorhis, Kay; Daniels, Katherine; Culpepper, Haley; Hebbar, Kiran; Wolf, Michael",Crit Care Nurse,,257

DESIGN: Meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CNKI and MedRxiv of Systematic Reviews from 1 January 2020 to 15 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies examining the following demographics and outcomes were included: patients' age; sex; incidence of and risk factors for AKI and their impact on prognosis; COVID-19 disease type and incidence of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) administration during COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: A total of 79 research articles, including 49 692 patients with COVID-19, met the systemic evaluation criteria. The mortality rate and incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19 in China were significantly lower than those in patients with COVID-19 outside China. A significantly higher proportion of patients with COVID-19 from North America were aged &#8805;65 years and also developed AKI. European patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher mortality and a higher CRRT rate than patients from other regions. Further analysis of the risk factors for COVID-19 combined with AKI showed that age &#8805;60 years and severe COVID-19 were independent risk factors for AKI, with an OR of 3.53, 95% CI (2.92-4.25) and an OR of 6.07, 95% CI (2.53-14.58), respectively. The CRRT rate in patients with severe COVID-19 was significantly higher than in patients with non-severe COVID-19, with an OR of 6.60, 95% CI (2.83-15.39). The risk of death in patients with COVID-19 and AKI was significantly increased, with an OR of 11.05, 95% CI (9.13-13.36). CONCLUSION: AKI was a common and serious complication of COVID-19. Older age and having severe COVID-19 were independent risk factors for AKI. The risk of in-hospital death was significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 complicated by AKI.","Lin, Lirong; Wang, Xiang; Ren, Jiangwen; Sun, Yan; Yu, Rongjie; Li, Kailong; Zheng, Luquan; Yang, Jurong",BMJ Open,,257

DESIGN: Multi-center retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Twenty-eight hospitals located in eight provinces of China. METHODS: A total of 432 survivors with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection participated in this study. At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton's IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung's self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan). RESULTS: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81% (95% CI: 32.39-41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44% (95% CI: 13.23-20.23) and 28.70% (95% CI: 24.63-33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety. Adjusted risk ratio (RR) of IADL limitations (RR 2.48, 95% CI: 1.80-3.40), ADL dependence (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.15-3.76), and probable clinical anxiety (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.69-3.79) were consistently elevated in survivors with severe Covid-19. Age was an additional independent risk factor for IADL limitations and ADL dependence; and setting (Hubei) for IADL limitations and anxiety. Tibetan ethnicity was a protective factor for anxiety but a risk factor for IADL limitations. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of Covid-19 survivors had disability and anxiety at discharge from hospital.

The clinical characteristics, underlying stroke mechanism, and outcomes in this group of patients are especially salient as empiric therapeutic anticoagulation becomes increasingly common in the treatment and prevention of thrombotic complications of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with hemorrhagic stroke (both nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage and spontaneous non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage) who were hospitalized between 3/1/20-5/15/20 at a NYC hospital system, during the coronavirus pandemic. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with hemorrhagic stroke and COVID-19 to those without COVID-19 admitted to our hospital between 3/1/20-5/15/20 (contemporary controls) and 3/1/19-5/15/19 (historical controls), using Fischer's exact test and nonparametric testing. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. Results: During the study period, 19 out of 4071 (0.5%) patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 had hemorrhagic stroke on imaging. Of all COVID-19 with hemorrhagic stroke, only 3 had non-aneurysmal SAH without intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Among hemorrhagic stroke and COVID-19 patients, coagulopathy was the most common etiology (73.7%);empiric anticoagulation was started in 89.5% vs 4.2% of contemporary and 10.0% of historical controls (both with p = &lt;0.001). Compared to contemporary and historical controls, COVID-19 patients had higher initial NIHSS scores, INR, PTT and fibrinogen levels. These patients also had higher rates of in-hospital mortality [84.6% vs. 4.6%, p =&lt;0.001]. Sensitivity analyses excluding patients with strictly subarachnoid hemorrhage yielded similar results. Conclusion: We observed an overall low rate of imaging-confirmed hemorrhagic stroke among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Most hemorrhages in COVID-19 patients occurred in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation and were associated with increased mortality. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients.","Kvernland, A.; Kumar, A.; Yaghi, S.; Raz, E.; Frontera, J.; Lewis, A.; Czeisler, B.; Kahn, D.

323981,Vitamin D and socioeconomic deprivation mediate COVID-19 ethnic health disparities,2021,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. It rapidly spread due to strong evidence of human-to-human transmission, resulting in a pandemic throughout the world. Almost all countries around the world, including Qatar, have established guidelines and regulations to limit the spread of the virus and to preserve the health of societies. Unfortunately, these procedures were often associated with some negative effects on individuals' psychological and intellectual well-being, including children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to screen the psychological influence of home isolation and social distancing on children and adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic, and the strategies used to cope with it. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that was undertaken using an online questionnaire administered through SMS. All home-isolated children and adolescents registered in Primary Health Care Corporation aged 7-18 years old were invited to participate in the study. Children and adolescents with intellectual disadvantages were excluded. A P value .05 (two tailed) was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Data were collected from 6608 participants through the period of June 23rd to July 18th, 2020. Almost all the participants followed the official regulations during the period of home isolation and social distancing, however 69.1% of parents expressed their children or adolescents were vulnerable to the virus compared to 25% who expressed they were not vulnerable at all. Higher levels of anger, depression and general anxiety were prevalent amongst 1.3%, 3.9% and 1.6% of participants respectively. The mean score of the emotional constructs anger and depression decreased with the increase of following official instructions, with P value of .04 and .11 respectively. The difference in mean score of all psychological and coping strategies used among participants across the three levels of vulnerability to coronavirus, were statistically significant. The mean score trend varied little with the escalation of the level of vulnerability to the virus. This mild variation can make a difference when sample size is large as in case of this study. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for psychological and social disruptions is of importance to develop strategies by schools and healthcare providers to assess and monitor behavioral changes and negative psychologically during reintegration post-COVID-19. Participants experiencing higher levels of anxieties should be given extra attention during reintegration and transitional phases in schools. Although electronic devices and social media platforms may have lowered the level of anxiety in some cases, it is important to address how electronic devices and social media platforms are used and how content is tailored for children and adolescents. It is also important to maintain an active lifestyle for children and young adults, and encourage them not to neglect their physical health, as it promotes better psychological state of mind.","Zainel, Abduljaleel Abdullatif; Qotba, Hamda; Al-Maadeed, Alyaa; Al-Kohji, Sadriya; Al Mujalli, Hanan; Ali, Atif; Al Mannai, Lolwa; Aladab, Aisha; AlSaadi, Hamda; AlKarbi, Khalid Ali; Al-Baghdadi, Tholfakhar",,,257

In this paper we study a setting with multiple senders, but in which the receiver interacts with only one sender of his choice: senders commit to signals and the receiver then chooses, at the interim stage, with which sender to interact. Our main result is that whenever senders are even slightly uncertain about each other's preferences, the receiver receives all the informational surplus in all equilibria of this game.","Gradwohl, Ronen; Hahn, Niklas; Hoefer, Martin; Smorodinsky, Rann",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02048v1.pdf,257

325908,Maternal mental health amidst the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 restrictions may prevent adults from achieving sufficient physical activity (PA) and may affect PA context. This study examined the early effects of COVID-19 on daily PA bouts and contexts during April-June 2020 using a daily diary approach. Adults (N = 390) completed daily diary surveys for 28 days assessing number of PA bouts and social (e.g., alone), locational (i.e., home, neighborhood, recreational space), and technology (e.g., using streaming videos) contexts of PA. Mixed-effects models examined the effects of days since the pandemic started (on 3/13/2020), state residence, and demographics on number of daily PA bouts. Models examined demographic and temporal effects on PA context. Participants were 18-77 years, 15% Hispanic/Latino, and 80% female. PA bouts per day decreased significantly over time among Californians versus Coloradans (bsimple = -0.01, p < .001) and Hispanics/Latinos (vs. non-Hispanic Latinos) did fewer PA bouts per day (b = -0.17, p = .04). Most PA bouts occurred while alone (56.7%), at home (43.4%), or in any neighborhood (40.5%). Older (60+ years) versus younger (<40 years) adults were less likely to do PA with others (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.18-0.90). PA bouts in recreational spaces were more common on weekends versus weekdays (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.32-1.92) and were less common among California versus Colorado residents (OR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.12-0.42). PA bouts decreased from April to June 2020, and these changes disparately affected subgroups. Resources are needed to counteract the negative effects of COVID-19 restrictions intended to slow disease spread on PA.","Courtney, Jimikaye; Nuss, Kayla; Wang, Shirlene; Do, Bridgette; Dunton, Genevieve",Translational behavioral medicine (Internet),,257

This study draws from contemporary theory to specify multiple dimensions of poverty-related adversity and resources, with the aim of better capturing these nuances. Using data from the Family Life Project (N = 1,292), we leveraged moderated nonlinear factor analysis (Bauer, 2017) to establish group- and longitudinally invariant environmental measures from infancy to early adolescence. Results indicated three latent factors-material deprivation, psychosocial threat, and sociocognitive resources-were distinct from each other and from family income. Each was largely invariant across site, racial group, and development and showed convergent and discriminant relations with age-twelve criterion measures.

The module in question is specifically tailored to third-year undergraduates in business pursuing a major in accounting-related topics. As a theoretical backdrop, the paper draws on the didactical relationship model developed by Norwegian education researchers Hiim and Hippe. While it has proved to be of considerable value in planning education and teaching in Norwegian primary and upper secondary schools, this model, to the best of the authors' knowledge, has not previously been applied in the context of accounting education at the university level. Without seeking to wholly generalize our thoughts and views to all higher educational institutions, we refer, in this paper, primarily to our own personal experiences of teaching management accounting gained at the three Norwegian universities, namely, Nord University, University of South-Eastern Norway, and The Arctic University of Norway. It is argued in this paper that the didactical relationship model may be of great help to accounting educators by providing an illustrative account of key conditioning factors (didactic elements) to consider while planning the learning process. Additionally, the paper strives to delve deeper into the use of technology in light of the current COVID-19 situation that we are all locked in.","Timoshenko, K.; Hansen, O. B.; Madsen, D.

Early April 2020, the Delhi Government made it compulsory for people to wear face masks while going outdoors to curb disease spread. Prolonged use of surgical masks during the pandemic has been reported to cause many adverse effects. Intermittent hypoxia has been shown to activate erythropoietin (EPO leading to increased hemoglobin mass. AIM: To analyze whether face mask induced intermittent hypoxia has any effect on the hemoglobin levels of healthy blood donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed donor data from 1st July 2019-31st December 2020 for hemoglobin distribution across hemoglobin ranges and donor deferral on basis of hemoglobin. Study population was divided into two cohorts Group 1- (1st July 2019-31 st March 2020): before implementation of mandatory face masks Group 2- (1st April 2020-31 st December 2020): after implementation of mandatory face masks RESULTS: Mean Hb of blood donors in Group 2 (15.01 ± 1.1 g/dl) was higher than Group1 (14.49 ± 1.15 g/dl), (p < 0.0001). 47.1 % group2 donors had Hb of 16.1-18 g/dl compared to group1 (38.4 %). 52.9 % group 2 donors had Hb between 12.5-15 g/dl compared to 61.6 % Group 1 (p < 0.05). Deferral due to anemia was lesser in group 2 compared to group 1 (p < 0.00001). Group 2 had significantly higher deferral due to high Hb (>18 gm/dl) was than Group 1 (p = 0.0039). CONCLUSION: This study including 19504 blood donors spanning over one and a half year shows that prolonged use of face mask by blood donors may lead to intermittent hypoxia and consequent increase in hemoglobin mass.","Setia, Rasika; Dogra, Mitu; Handoo, Anil; Yadav, Ramesh; Thangavel, Gokhula Prasath; Rahman, Amena Ebadur",Transfus Apher Sci,,257

332438,Palpable Fear: COVID-19's Toll on Physician Morale and Mental Health,2020,"Herein, a sensitive label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor was constructed for C-reactive protein (CRP) analysis based on a novel and efficient poly{4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl) thiophen-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl] thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-4,6-diyl} (PTB7-Th)/H2O2 system with unexpected photoelectric performance. The proposed PTB7-Th/H2O2 system without any sensitizer could surmount defect of the poor photoelectric conversion efficiency of PTB7-Th, leading to the unexpected 10-fold photocurrent enhancement compared to the common PTB7-Th/PBS system. The strong enhancement effect might originate from the special function of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) towards PTB7-Th. On the one hand, H2O2 as electron acceptor could continuously capture photogenerated electrons located at acceptor part of PTB7-Th, which would visibly improve the charge separation efficiency of PTB7-Th and the electron-receiving property of electrolyte solution, thus leading to the obviously enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE). More importantly, H2O2 as oxidant could oxidize PTB7-Th to obtain oxidation product of PTB7-Th (OPP) with carbonyl group and carboxyl group, and the electron cloud density in donor part of the OPP was higher than that of PTB7-Th, therefrom producing the stronger electron-donating property and higher photoelectrochemical (PEC) reaction efficiency. As a proof of concept, the proposed PTB7-Th/H2O2 system was successfully applied in the construction of a label-free PEC aptasensor for sensitive analysis of CRP, which performed a wide detection range from 1 pM to 1000 nM with a low detection limit of 0.33 pM. This study demonstrated a novel approach to the rational design of photoelectric conversion system with high PEC performance and provided an inspired tack for the construction of high-efficiency photoelectric devices.","Li, Meng-Jie; Wang, Hai-Jun; Yuan, Ruo; Chai, Ya-Qin",Biosens Bioelectron,,257

Outside of the medical field there has been a conscious drive to reduce single use plastic and reuse items to reduce the amount of waste we produce. We undertook this investigation to quantify our plastic waste production and generate ideas to reduce this volume. METHODOLOGY: Data was collected from a University Hospital ENT outpatient department via real-time recording methods using standard data collection forms. We measured plastic unit usage pre and post COVID restrictions and compared this to our number of patient encounters. Projections of plastic usage were determined via a hypothetical resumption of patient services model. RESULTS: In total there were 440 patients included. In period one the mean units of plastic used per day was 65.1 (median 67; range 27-84). In the second period, the mean number of plastic units was 23.4 (median 22; range 1-7). Blue nitrile gloves and masks were the most commonly used single use items. The hypothetical projection model predicted a 147.6% increase in single use items following the introduction of COVID precautions. CONCLUSION: We have a duty of care not only to our patients but future generations of patients and the environment which we share. Single use items and excessive plastic wrapping have benefits in terms of convenience and sterility, but these conveniences can be easily extended to reusable types to limit our volume of waste, reduce our waste management costs and protect our environment.","Farrell, Eric; Smyth, David",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,257

Epithelial repair involves the participation of multiple cells and signalling pathways. Lung organoids provide an excellent platform to model injury to and repair of lungs. Here, we review the recent methods of cultivating lung organoids, applications of lung organoids in epithelial repair after injury, and understanding the mechanisms of epithelial repair investigated using lung organoids. By using lung organoids, we can discover the regulatory mechanisms related to the repair of lung epithelia.

OBJECTIVE: To synthesize research on the mental health impact of waiting and patient-centred mitigation strategies that could be applied in the COVID-19 context. METHODS: Using a scoping review approach, we searched 9 databases for studies on waiting lists and mental health and reported study characteristics, impacts and intervention attributes and outcomes. RESULTS: We included 51 studies that focussed on organ transplant (60.8%), surgery (21.6%) or cancer management (13.7%). Most patients and caregivers reported anxiety, depression and poor quality of life, which deteriorated with increasing wait time. The impact of waiting on mental health was greater among women and new immigrants, and those of younger age, lower socio-economic status, or with less-positive coping ability. Six studies evaluated educational strategies to develop coping skills: 2 reduced depression (2 did not), 1 reduced anxiety (2 did not) and 2 improved quality of life (2 did not). In contrast, patients desired acknowledgement of concerns, peer support, and periodic communication about wait-list position, prioritization criteria and anticipated procedure date. CONCLUSIONS: Findings revealed patient-centred strategies to alleviate the mental health impact of waiting for procedures. Ongoing research should explore how to optimize the impact of those strategies for diverse patients and caregivers, particularly in the COVID-19 context.

A network analysis of COVID influences on depression, anxiety and traumatic stress in the UK population",2021,"Anomaly detection in Minimally-Invasive Surgery (MIS) traditionally requires a human expert monitoring the procedure from a console. Data scarcity, on the other hand, hinders what would be a desirable migration towards autonomous robotic-assisted surgical systems. Automated anomaly detection systems in this area typically rely on classical supervised learning. Anomalous events in a surgical setting, however, are rare, making it difficult to capture data to train a detection model in a supervised fashion. In this work we thus propose an unsupervised approach to anomaly detection for robotic-assisted surgery based on deep residual autoencoders. The idea is to make the autoencoder learn the 'normal' distribution of the data and detect abnormal events deviating from this distribution by measuring the reconstruction error. The model is trained and validated upon both the publicly available Cholec80 dataset, provided with extra annotation, and on a set of videos captured on procedures using artificial anatomies ('phantoms') produced as part of the Smart Autonomous Robotic Assistant Surgeon (SARAS) project. The system achieves recall and precision equal to 78.4%, 91.5%, respectively, on Cholec80 and of 95.6%, 88.1% on the SARAS phantom dataset. The end-to-end system was developed and deployed as part of the SARAS demonstration platform for real-time anomaly detection with a processing time of about 25 ms per frame.","Samuel, Dinesh Jackson; Cuzzolin, Fabio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11008v1.pdf,257

When does the population infection rate rise to its peak? What will eventually be the number of infected patients? How to make early diagnosis? What effective antiviral drugs are available? How to effectively treat with existing drugs? Can it successfully improve the survival rate of critically patients? In response to the above questions, we put forward corresponding suggestions and reflections from the perspective of the infectious clinician.","Ma, K; Chen, T; Han, M F; Guo, W; Ning, Q",Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,,257

Validated tools to assist in the early detection of patients at high risk of mortality can help guide medical decisions. OBJECTIVE: We sought to validate externally, as well as in patients from the second pandemic wave in Europe, our previously developed mortality prediction model for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Three validation cohorts were generated: 2 external with 185 and 730 patients from the first wave and 1 internal with 119 patients from the second wave. The probability of death was calculated for all subjects using our prediction model, which includes peripheral blood oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, and age. Discrimination and calibration were evaluated in the validation cohorts. The prediction model was updated by reestimating individual risk factor effects in the overall cohort (N = 1477). RESULTS: The mortality prediction model showed good performance in the external validation cohorts 1 and 2, and in the second wave validation cohort 3 (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.94, 0.86, and 0.86, respectively), with excellent calibration (calibration slope, 0.86, 0.94, and 0.79; intercept, 0.05, 0.03, and 0.10, respectively). The updated model accurately predicted mortality in the overall cohort (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.91), which included patients from both the first and second COVID-19 waves. The updated model was also useful to predict fatal outcome in patients without respiratory distress at the time of evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first COVID-19 mortality prediction model validated in patients from the first and second pandemic waves.

The gold standard for diagnosis is nucleic acid detection by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swabs. However, due to limitations in this technique's sensitivity, thoracic imaging plays a crucial, complementary role in diagnostic evaluation and also allows for detection of atypical findings and potential alternative targets for sampling (eg, pleural effusion). Although less common, pleural involvement has been described in a minority of patients. This report describes the first case of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pleural fluid obtained by means of ultrasound-guided thoracentesis, and its main characteristics are detailed.

346744,Survey shows mental health concerns rising due to COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. This virus primarily spreads through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This virus was named after its shape, which takes the form of a crown with protrusions around it. The World Health Organization has recommended personal protective equipments (PPE) to doctors and health care workers attending COVID-19 patients. PPE generally includes masks, goggles, respirators, gloves, face shields, and isolation gowns. The principle aim of this study is to create awareness among dental students about the preventive measures taken by health care professionals while attending patients affected with COVID-19. MATERIALS & METHODS: A questionnaire comprising 15 questions was created using an online Google forms website and was circulated among 100 dental students. The survey was conducted within a week in the months of April to May 2020. The results and observations were recorded in the form of pie charts. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of the participants have stated that health care professionals must clean their hands often, cover their nose and mouth, and maintain safe distance from everyone in order to prevent the virus from affecting them. Sixty-three percent of the participants are familiar with the term PPE. Majority assume that health care professionals are given enough safety precautions while treating a patient with coronavirus. CONCLUSION: Hence, to conclude, health care professionals play a vital role in improving access and quality health care for the population, and hence, they must be protected as well. Since dental students treat patients, they are vulnerable to infection as well, and must take proper safety measures.","Princeton, Bianca; Santhakumar, Preetha; Prathap, Lavanya",European journal of dentistry,,257

Not enough data on infected solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are available, especially data about the management of immunosuppressants. We report two cases of COVID-19 in two transplant recipients, with different treatments and prognoses. The first patient received liver transplantation due to hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma and was confirmed to have COVID-19 9 days later. Following a treatment regimen consisting of discontinued immunosuppressant use and low-dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, the patient developed acute rejection but eventually recovered. The other patient had undergone a renal transplant from a living-related donor 17 years ago, and was admitted to the hospital because of persistent fever. This patient was also diagnosed with COVID-19. His treatment regimen consisted of reduced immunosuppressant use. No signs of rejection were observed during the regimen. In the end, the patient successfully recovered from COVID-19.

The plethysmographic signal is caused by volume changes in the arterial blood during systole. In this pulsatile flow, oxygen saturation is calculated using an algorithm. Use of the pulse oximeter has increased massively, especially in the COVID-era, and has a central role in managing patients at the emergency department. However, interpretation of the plethysmogram is frequently incorrect which may lead to incorrect conclusions. Moreover, an irregular plethysmographic signal may well 'give' a saturation percentage. We will discuss how pulse oximeters work and discuss some pitfalls. We hope that understanding the mechanism behind pulse oximetry, as well as an awareness of pitfalls, leads to improved management of patients with consequently less unnecessary care, as demonstrated in our case.","Eecen, C.

Previously we reported that in many cancer types, upon ER stress, IRE1&#945; binds to and triggers SRC activation resulting in KDEL receptor dispersion from the Golgi and suppression of retrograde transport. In this study, using a combination of molecular, biochemical, and imaging approaches, we discovered that in colon and lung cancer, upon ER stress, ER chaperones, such as GRP78 bypass the Golgi and unconventionally traffic to the cell surface via endosomal transport mediated by Rab GTPases (Rab4, 11 and 15). Such unconventional transport is driven by membrane fusion between ER-derived vesicles and endosomes requiring the v-SNARE BET1 and t-SNARE Syntaxin 13. Furthermore, GRP78 loading into ER-derived vesicles requires the co-chaperone DNAJC3 that is regulated by ER-stress induced PERK-AKT-mTOR signaling.","Van Krieken, Richard; Tsai, Yuan-Li; Carlos, Anthony J; Ha, Dat P; Lee, Amy S",Cell. mol. life sci,,257

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) is regarded as a gold-standard method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, unexpected contamination of synthesized positive control samples included in COVID-19 test kits have increased the inconclusiveness of disease interpretation. Therefore, it is important to establish new methods for the preparation of reliable positive controls that are not affected by contamination for the accurate for diagnosis of COVID-19, but it still remains a challenge. METHODS: A new approach for producing synthetic positive controls using synthetic positive template (SPT) oligonucleotides was designed. SPT oligonucleotides contain probe binding and virus-irrelevant regions were used as templates for real-time PCR to evaluate the expression level of SARS-CoV-2 genes (RdRP, E, and N). The limit of detection (LOD) for individual SARS-CoV-2 genes by Ct values with different concentrations of SPT templates and genomic RNAs from SARS-CoV-2 infected samples was determined. RESULTS: LODs with SPT templates were >10-15 (atto) M for RdRP, 10-12 (femto) to 10-13 (100 atto) M for E gene, and 10-12 to 10-14 (10 atto) M for N gene, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR assay using serially diluted genomic RNAs prepared from SARS-CoV-2 virus infected cultures showed that picogram quantities of RNAs is resulted in the LOD. The sensitivity of RdRP and E genes based on Ct values was less than that of N gene with this platform. CONCLUSION: This method significantly reduces the risk of false-positive reactions resulting from contamination in the synthesis procedures of positive control materials. Therefore, this approach could be integrated into the currrently available COVID-19 test kits and will provide a general method for preparing positive controls in the diagnosis of emerging RNA virus infections.","Cho, Hyejin; Jung, Young Hwan; Cho, Hong Bum; Kim, Hee-Tae; Kim, Kwang-Sun",Clin Chim Acta,,257

355205,"An analytical study on the awareness, attitude and practice during the COVID-19 pandemic in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",2020,"Disorders involving injury to tissue stem cells that ensure normal tissue homeostasis and repair have potential to show unusually devastating clinical consequences. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is one condition where relatively few cytotoxic immune cells target skin stem cells to produce significant morbidity and mortality. By analogy, SARS-CoV-2 is a vector that initially homes to pulmonary stem cells that preferentially express the ACE2 receptor, thus potentially incurring similarly robust pathological consequences. In older individuals, stem cell number and/or function become depleted due to pathways independent of disease-related injury to these subpopulations. Accordingly, pathologic targeting of stem cells in conditions like aGVHD and COVID-19 infection where these cells are already deficient due to the aging process may have dire consequences in elderly individuals. A hypothesis is herein advanced that, as with aGVHD, lung stem cell targeting is a potential co-factor in explaining age-related severity of COVID-19 infection.","Murphy, George F",Lab. invest,,257

However, power-free and clear visualization of results still remain challenging. In this study, we developed a paper device integrated with power-free DNA detection strategy realized by polydopamine aggregation. In the presence of DNA amplicons, the polymerization of dopamine into aggregated polydopamine was hindered, while in the absence of DNA amplicons, polydopamine aggregation is facilitated. The porosity of the paper enabled the capillary flow of dispersed polydopamine for positive sample, while aggregated polydopamine remained at the bottom of the paper strip due to large size of the aggregates for negative sample. Based on this mechanism, we fabricated a slidable paper device integrating LAMP with dopamine polymerization for the naked-eye detection, operated in a seamless manner. Moreover, the introduced paper device was successfully used to detect DNA extracted from Escherichia coli O157:H7 and SARS-CoV-2 within 25 min, as well as Enterococcus faecium within 35 min. The detection limits of both Escherichia coli O157:H7 and SARS-CoV-2 were 10-4 ng/µL.

Using the desk research method, the authors draw upon secondary data (e.g., published reports, previous studies, social media, and websites) to gain a broad understanding of the dynamics of global leadership that shapes the global accountability processes during the pandemic time. The authors suggest that accountability at the global level (i.e., the accountability relationship between global health institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and different countries) can better be understood as a geopolitical phenomenon that contains many socio-political and demographic factors that relate accountability to leadership and cooperation. This study has implications for researchers, shareholders, and policymakers by enhancing their understanding of the global accountability process during crisis time.","Diab, Ahmed A.; Metwally, Abdelmonem Mohamed Mostafa",Academy of Strategic Management Journal,,257

Health care providers, around the globe, are fighting day and night. Currently, rapid testing is taking place with the help of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum, urine, and blood. All these approaches are invasive or embarrassing to the infected person. It is observed that salivary glands are hosting severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the detection of high viral loads in the saliva and is playing a crucial role in virus transmission, especially from individuals showing absolutely no symptoms. Saliva is proving to be a promising noninvasive sample specimen for the diagnosis of COVID-19, thus helping to monitor the infection and prevent it from further spreading by prompt isolation.","Hamid, Hiba; Khurshid, Zohaib; Adanir, Necdet; Zafar, Muhammad S; Zohaib, Sana",European journal of dentistry,,257

363071,The importance of human connection: Perinatal teletherapy during a global pandemic,2020,"According to anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroresponse in patients with COVID-19 from Croatia, we emphasised the issue of different serological tests and need for combining diagnostic methods for COVID-19 diagnosis. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG ELISA and IgM/IgG immunochromatographic assay (ICA) were used for testing 60 sera from 21 patients (6 with severe, 10 moderate, and 5 with mild disease). The main clinical, demographic, and haemato-biochemical data were analysed. The most common symptoms were cough (95.2%), fever (90.5%), and fatigue and shortness of breath (42.9%). Pulmonary opacities showed 76.2% of patients. Within the first 7 days of illness, seropositivity for ELISA IgA and IgG was 42.9% and 7.1%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 25% and 10.7%, respectively. From day 8 after onset, ELISA IgA and IgG seropositivity was 90.6% and 68.8%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 84.4% and 75%, respectively. In general, sensitivity for ELISA IgA and IgG was 68.3% and 40%, and for ICA IgM and IgG 56.7% and 45.0%, respectively. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody distributions by each method were statistically different (ICA IgM vs. IgG, p = 0.016; ELISA IgG vs. IgA, p < 0.001). Antibody response in COVID-19 varies and depends on the time the serum is taken, on the severity of disease, and on the type of test used. IgM and IgA antibodies as early-stage disease markers are comparable, although they cannot replace each other. Simultaneous IgM/IgG/IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing followed by the confirmation of positive findings with another test in a two-tier testing is recommended.","Rode, Oktavija Dakovic; Kurolt, Ivan-Christian; Puljiz, Ivan; Civljak, Rok; Balent, Natasa Cetinic; Laskaj, Renata; Tiljak, Mirjana Kujundzic; Mikulic, Radojka; Markotic, Alemka",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,257

These measures included remote working from home in both public and private organizations. The objective of this study is to study technostress and challenges of remote virtual work environment among university staff members at Menoufia University, Egypt. A cross-sectional study was conducted over Menoufia University academic staff members in Egypt. The participants were chosen from both practical and theoretical colleges in Menoufia University using a multistage random sample. Tarfadar technostress questionnaire was used. Cortisol blood level was measured for all participants. This study included 142 participants. The mean age of the group was 36.32±6.41 years. 52.1 percent worked in practical colleges, and 60.6% were lecturers or higher. Their mean cortisol level was 15.61±7.07mcg/dl. Participants who were females, reside in rural areas, held a lecturer or higher position, had poor work-environment WiFi, and lacked technical training had significantly higher levels of technostress subscales. Most of the technostress subscales were significantly correlated with age and blood cortisol levels. The predictors of work overload in multivariate regression were female gender and a work environment with poor WiFi. Female gender, theoretical colleges, being lecturer or higher, and poor WiFi were the predictors for invasion. Among university staff members, technostress was found to be evident. High levels of technostress were significantly influenced by age, higher professions, female gender, and a bad workplace environment.","Gabr, Hala Marawan; Soliman, Shaimaa Sherif; Allam, Heba Khodary; Raouf, Shaimaa Yaihya Abdel",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Studies have confirmed asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 have potential infectivity, and most of the transmission occurred before symptoms appear. Asymptomatic infection rates varied widely in different countries and regions. Identifying the asymptomatic infected persons and cutting off the infection source is an effective way to prevent the spread of this disease. However, asymptomatic patients have hidden clinical symptoms, and screening based only on the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 can easily lead to a missed diagnosis. Therefore, determining asymptomatic infection patients by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is the gold standard. A series of prevention and control measures adopted by the Chinese government, especially the ""Four Early"" policy, have achieved outstanding achievements, which are worth learning from by other countries.","Chen, Zheng; Wang, Bili; Mao, Shanshan; Ye, Qing",Int J Biol Sci,,257

Aim: We aimed to evaluate the perceived impact of social media on panic buying behaviors in the Iraqi Kurdistan region. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted from October 10 to November 25, 2020. A self-reported instrument was designed in English and then translated to the Kurdish Language to conduct the study. It was disseminated through social media platforms (Facebook, Viber, and WhatsApp) and e-mail, via a link, and 466 responses were collected from social media users. The statistical computations were performed using SPSS version 21. Results: The majority of respondents were male (62.2%), were <25 years old (43.9%), and had completed their bachelor's degree (53.9%), and most of the respondents (86.3%) used Facebook. Among the respondents, 42.1% were involved in panic buying, 32.8% of the respondents thought that social media platforms had an influence on panic buying, 86.1% of the respondents thought that social media should be sensible while reporting it, 88.4% thought that the reporting should be controlled, and 78.5% thought that photos of empty shelves should be avoided. There was a significant positive statistical correlation (r = 0.84) between social media use and panic buying among consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iraqi Kurdistan (p = <0.001). Conclusion: This research assessed how social media affects buying behavior, particularly in Iraq. Collective measures, such as sensible use and adequate media literacy, are needed to prevent such behaviors at least during public health emergencies.","Arafat, S M Yasir; Ahmad, Araz Ramazan; Murad, Hersh Rasool; Kakashekh, Hardawan Mahmoud",Front Public Health,,257

Methods: A cross-sectional research design was utilized from March to April 2020 from one medical teaching hospital of South Punjab. As it was a single center experience so all the doctors were approached and asked to participate in this research. In total, 284 doctors (out of 300 approx.) completed online survey. The data were collected through online google forms consisting of self-report measures i.e. Brief Resilience Scale, Short General Self Efficacy Scale, Brief Scale for Social Support, Risk Behavior Diagnostic Scale and Brief Self-Control Scale. Results: The results were analyzed by using SmartPLS (3.0), direct effect of psychosocial strengths on perceived severity of COVID-19 and indirect effect of self-control were assessed through path coefficients, t-values and r-square values. The results confirmed that there was significant negative relationship between psychosocial strengths and perceived severity of COVID-19 (β =-0.854, t =14.279) with 72% variance in perceived severity due to psychosocial strengths. Further, the results also suggest that self-control proved significant mediator between psychosocial strengths and perceived severity (β =-0.604, t = 11.004, variance in perceived severity is 74%). Conclusion: In the time of pandemic, medical professionals are working as frontline force and can have several uncertainties regarding the risk associated with outbreak of COVID-19. This study concludes psychosocial strengths can play a significant role in subsiding the risk associated with severity of disease. Whereas, self-control can significantly contribute to buffer the negative influence of COVID-19 among frontline medical professionals. In line with findings of this study, there is a dire need to initiate psychotherapeutic studies for medical professionals to boost up their psychosocial strengths that would make them resilient against COVID-19.","Saleem, Muhammad; Dastgeer, Saima; Durrani, Areeha Khan; Saad, Abubakr Ali; Manzoor, Zubair; Hussain, Hafiz Nauman",Pak.

368933,[the Psychological Impact of Covid-19 on Mental Health - Literature Review],2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic in Wales and the UK has highlighted significant and historic inequalities in health between social groups. To better understand the composition of these inequalities and inform planning after the pandemic, we undertook a decomposition of life expectancy inequalities between the most and least deprived quintiles for men and women by age and cause of death and explored trends between 2002 and 2018. STUDY DESIGN: Statistical decomposition of life expectancy inequalities by age and cause of death using routine population mortality datasets. METHODS: We used routine statistics from the Office for National Statistics for the period 2002-2018 on population and deaths in Wales stratified by age, gender, Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) 2019 quintile and cause of death, categorised by International Classification of Disease, version 10, code into 15 categories of public health relevance. We aggregated data to 3-year rolling figures to account for low numbers of events in some groups annually. Next, we estimated life expectancy at birth by quintile, gender and period using life table methods. Lastly, we performed a decomposition analysis using the Arriaga method to identify the specific disease categories and ages at which excess deaths occur in more disadvantaged areas to highlight potential areas for action. RESULTS: Life expectancy inequalities between the most and least WIMD quintiles rose for both genders between 2002 and 2018: from 4.69 to 6.02 years for women (an increase of 1.33 years) and from 6.34 to 7.42 years for men (an increase of 1.08 years). Exploratory analysis of these trends suggested that the following were most influential for women: respiratory disease (1.50 years), cancers (1.36 years), circulatory disease (1.35 years) and digestive disease (0.51 years). For men, the gap was driven by circulatory disease (2.01 years), cancers (1.39 years), respiratory disease (1.25 years), digestive disease (0.79 years), drug- and alcohol-related conditions (0.54 years) and external causes (0.54 years). Contributions for women from respiratory disease, cancers, dementia and drug- and alcohol-related conditions appeared to be increasing, while among men, there were rising contributions from respiratory, digestive and circulatory disease. CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy inequalities in Wales remain wide and have been increasing, particularly among women, with indications of worsening trends since 2010 following the introduction of fiscal austerity. As agencies recover from the pandemic, these findings should be considered alongside any resumption of services in Wales or future health and public policy.","Currie, J; Boyce, T; Evans, L; Luker, M; Senior, S; Hartt, M; Cottrell, S; Lester, N; Huws, D; Humphreys, C; Little, K; Adekanmbi, V; Paranjothy, S",Public Health,,257

370267,Relational autonomy: lessons from COVID-19 and twentieth-century philosophy,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The outcomes reported in trials in coronavirus disease 2019 are extremely heterogeneous and of uncertain patient relevance, limiting their applicability for clinical decision-making. The aim of this workshop was to establish a core outcomes set for trials in people with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Four international online multistakeholder consensus workshops were convened to discuss proposed core outcomes for trials in people with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019, informed by a survey involving 9,289 respondents from 111 countries. The transcripts were analyzed thematically. The workshop recommendations were used to finalize the core outcomes set. SETTING: International. SUBJECTS: Adults 18 years old and over with confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease 2019, their family members, members of the general public and health professionals (including clinicians, policy makers, regulators, funders, researchers). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: None. MAIN RESULTS: Six themes were identified. ""Responding to the critical and acute health crisis"" reflected the immediate focus on saving lives and preventing life-threatening complications that underpinned the high prioritization of mortality, respiratory failure, and multiple organ failure. ""Capturing different settings of care"" highlighted the need to minimize the burden on hospitals and to acknowledge outcomes in community settings. ""Encompassing the full trajectory and severity of disease"" was addressing longer term impacts and the full spectrum of illness (e.g. shortness of breath and recovery). ""Distinguishing overlap, correlation and collinearity"" meant recognizing that symptoms such as shortness of breath had distinct value and minimizing overlap (e.g. lung function and pneumonia were on the continuum toward respiratory failure). ""Recognizing adverse events"" refers to the potential harms of new and evolving interventions. ""Being cognizant of family and psychosocial wellbeing"" reflected the pervasive impacts of coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, shortness of breath, and recovery are critically important outcomes to be consistently reported in coronavirus disease 2019 trials.","Tong, Allison; Elliott, Julian H; Azevedo, Luciano Cesar; Baumgart, Amanda; Bersten, Andrew; Cervantes, Lilia; Chew, Derek P; Cho, Yeoungjee; Cooper, Tess; Crowe, Sally; Douglas, Ivor S; Evangelidis, Nicole; Flemyng, Ella; Hannan, Elyssa; Horby, Peter; Howell, Martin; Lee, Jaehee; Liu, Emma; Lorca, Eduardo; Lynch, Deena; Marshall, John C; Gonzalez, Andrea Matus; McKenzie, Anne; Manera, Karine E; McLeod, Charlie; Mehta, Sangeeta; Mer, Mervyn; Morris, Andrew Conway; Nseir, Saad; Povoa, Pedro; Reid, Mark; Sakr, Yasser; Shen, Ning; Smyth, Alan R; Snelling, Tom; Strippoli, Giovanni Fm; Teixeira-Pinto, Armando; Torres, Antoni; Turner, Tari; Viecelli, Andrea K; Webb, Steve; Williamson, Paula R; Woc-Colburn, Laila; Zhang, Junhua; Craig, Jonathan C",Crit Care Med,,257

371777,"The effects of COVID-19 stay-at-home order on sleep, health, and working patterns: a survey study of United States health care workers",2020,"At the start of 2020 we were thrilled to have reached 10 years of Beneficial Microbes! Little did we know that soon after Europe and the rest of the world (with Asia already earlier) would be in lock-down due to COVID-19. It has been a strange year. And now, at the start of 2021, the excitement of having a vaccine is tempered by the fact that everywhere mutants of the virus pop up. Although this was likely to occur, as also the influenza virus keeps mutating, it means that at the moment it is unclear as to whether the current situation of lock-downs and social distancing will remain for a longer period than we had anticipated and hoped for at the end of 2020 when it became clear that several vaccines were efficacious. Some studies have shown a role of the gut microbiota composition in disease severity, together with vitamin D, cholesterol and other factors. It was a hype to write a 'review' on gut microbiota and the effect on COVID-19, and also the board of Beneficial Microbes has received several submissions of so-called reviews on the topic.

However, there are some good studies out there that have shown that a proper gut microbiota may indeed influence disease severity, such as recently reviewed by Kim (2021). All in all, this may not be too surprising for the knowledgeable reader, as they would know that the microbiota plays a role in everything that can be wrong with us!","Venema, Koen",Benef Microbes,,257

With this, the government needs to build up public trust to assure a successful vaccination program. A recent study suggested that a more 'localized' public education and role-modeling from public officials and health authorities can help in building public trust. However, this needs a lot of clarification if applied in the current situation where education is fully executed online. The problem now lies in the country's poor internet connectivity which greatly affects the online setup. This study then proposes that a house-to-house massive information campaign by local health care personnel which is led by a medical doctor to ensure a credible explanation of the entire procedure. In the same way, the idea of public officials as role-models seemed to be ineffective since there were already casualties linked to the vaccine. A consistent transparent approach is suggested in lieu of this which can prepare the country for a more defensive strategy to fight the pandemic.","Cordero, Dalmacito A",J. public health (Oxf),,257

374626,Mental health impact of COVID-19: Australian perspective,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The OM-85 (Broncho-Vaxom) consumption has drawn considerable attention in the prevention of recurrent respiratory tract infections. However, it has been reported that the relationship between OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections is variable. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: A systematic literature search up-to May 2020 was performed and 14 studies were detected with 1859 paediatric subjects, of them 890 consumed OM-85. They were reporting relationships between OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Odds ratio (OR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated to evaluate the prognostic role of OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections using the dichotomous or continuous method with a random or fixed-effect model. RESULTS: OM-85 consumption was significantly related to lower frequency of respiratory tract infections (MD, -1.16; 95% CI, -1.66 to -0.65, P < .001); lower total duration of respiratory tract infections (MD, -19.51; 95% CI, -23.00 to -16.01, P < .001); lower incidence of respiratory tract infections (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.77, P = .006); lower number of antibiotic courses (MD, -1.40; 95% CI, -2.63 to 0.17, P = .03); and lower antibiotic use (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.52, P < .001). However, OM-85 consumption was not significantly related to adverse event rate (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.52-2.03, P = .94); or to wheezing attacks frequency (MD, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.59 to 0.08, P = .14). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of OM-85 consumption on recurrent respiratory tract infections may have a great effect as a tool to improve subjects' immunity against recurrent respiratory tract infections, which could be helpful in crucial situations, eg, COVID-19 pandemic. OM-85 non-consumers had an independent risk relationship with recurrent respiratory tract infections. This relationship forces us to recommend OM-85 consumption with those with a high risk of recurrent respiratory tract infections to avoid any possible complications.","Cao, Changqing; Wang, Jinghua; Li, Yuning; Li, Yumei; Ma, Liyan; Abdelrahim, Mohamed E A; Zhu, Yi",Int J Clin Pract,,257
374676,Letter to the Editor: Improving Health Literacy Critical to Optimize Global Telemedicine During COVID-19,2020,"Care-delays can further exacerbate racial and ethnic health disparities in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related complications. The purpose of our study was to describe and evaluate a Patient Engagement Messaging campaign (PEM campaign) promoting health care seeking behaviors among community and rural clinic patients in North Carolina. Text and voice messages were delivered over 3-weeks. Messages encouraged patients to call a regional operation call center (ROC) line for information related to health care appointments and testing. A cross-sectional evaluation was conducted on the total population (n = 48,063) and a sample without recent health care contact (n = 29,214). Among the sample, logistic regression was used to model determinants of calls to the ROC-line and associations between calling the ROC-line and health care seeking behaviors (scheduling any health care appointment or receiving a COVID-19 test). 69.9% of text messages and 89% of voice messages were delivered. Overall, 95.4% of the total population received at least 1 message. Successful delivery was lower among Black patients and higher among patients with moderate health-risk comorbidities. Among the sample, 7.4% called the ROC-line, with higher odds of calling among minority patients (vs. White) and among Medicaid and uninsured (vs. private insurance). Calling the ROC-line was associated with higher odds of scheduling any health care appointment (OR: 4.14; 95% CI 2.93-5.80) and receiving a COVID-19 test (OR: 2.39; 95% CI 1.64-3.39). Messaging campaigns may help disconnected patients access health care resources and reduce disparities, but are likely still limited by existing barriers.","Mayfield, Carlene A; Sparling, Alica; Hardeman, Grady; de Hernandez, Brisa Urquieta; Pasupuleti, Nisha; Carr, Jewell; Coltman, Kinneil; Neuwirth, Zeev",J. community health,,257
376556,COVID-19 impact on high school student's education and mental health: A cohort survey in China,2021,"Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling psychiatric disorder characterized by disturbances of thought, cognition, and behavior. Despite massive research efforts to date, the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia remain largely unknown. The difficulty of brain research is largely a result of complex interactions between contributory factors at different scales: susceptible gene variants (molecular scale), synaptopathies (synaptic, dendritic, and cell scales), and alterations in neuronal circuits (circuit scale), which together result in behavioral manifestations (individual scale). It is likely that each scale affects the others, from the microscale to the mesoscale to the macroscale, and vice versa. Thus, to consider the intricate complexity of schizophrenia across multiple layers, we introduce a multi-scale, hierarchical view of the nature of this disorder, focusing especially on N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). The reason for placing emphasis on NMDAR is its clinical relevance to schizophrenia, as well as its diverse functions in neurons, including the robust supralinear synaptic integration provided by N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate (NMDA) spikes and the Ca2+ permeability of the NMDAR, which facilitates synaptic plasticity via various calcium-dependent proteins. Here, we review recent evidence implicating NMDARs in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia from the multi-scale perspective. We also discuss recent advances from optical techniques, which provide a powerful tool for uncovering the mechanisms of NMDAR synaptic pathology and their relationships, with subsequent behavioral manifestations.","Hyun, Jo Soo; Inoue, Takafumi; Hayashi-Takagi, Akiko",Biomolecules,,257

377957,The Effect of COVID-19 on Youth Mental Health,2020,"AIM: This study aims to verify whether standardized saliva collection is suitable for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection and IgA measurement. METHODS: 43 COVID-19 inpatients and 326 screening subjects underwent naso-pharyngeal (NP)-swab and saliva collection (Salivette). Inpatients also underwent repeated blood collections to evaluate inflammation and organs involvement. In all patients and subjects, SARS-CoV-2 (gene E) rRT-PCR was undertaken in saliva and NP-swabs. Salivary IgA and serum IgA, IgG, IgM were measured on inpatients' samples. RESULTS: NP-swabs and saliva were both SARS-CoV-2 positive in 7 (16%) or both negative in 35 (82%) out of 43 patients successfully included in the study. NP-swabs and saliva results did not perfectly match in one patient (saliva positive, NP-swab negative). Positive molecular results were significantly associated with disease duration (p = 0.0049). 326/326 screening subjects were SARS-CoV-2 negative on both NP-swabs and saliva. Among the 27 saliva samples tested for IgA, 18 were IgA positive. Salivary IgA positivity was associated with pneumonia (p = 0.002) and CRP values (p = 0.0183), not with other clinical and molecular data, or with serum immunoglubulins. CONCLUSIONS: A standardized saliva collection can be adopted to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in alternative to NP-swabs. Preliminary data on salivary IgA support the use of saliva also for patient monitoring.","Aita, Ada; Basso, Daniela; Cattelan, Anna Maria; Fioretto, Paola; Navaglia, Filippo; Barbaro, Francesco; Stoppa, Alice; Coccorullo, Enrico; Farella, Assunta; Socal, Aurora; Vettor, Roberto; Plebani, Mario",Clin Chim Acta,,257
378477,"COVID-19, Mentally Ill and Mental Health Workers",2020,"COVID-19 has devastated the entire global community. Vaccines present an opportunity to mitigate the pandemic; however, the effect of vaccination coupled with the behavioral response of the population is not well understood. We propose a model that incorporates two important dynamically varying population behaviors: level of caution and sense of safety. Level of caution increases with the number of infectious cases, while an increasing sense of safety with increased vaccination lowers precautionary behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that can effectively reproduce the complete time history of COVID-19 infections for various regions of the United States and provides relatable measures of dynamic changes in the population behavior and disease transmission rates. We propose a parameter d_I as a direct measure of a population's caution against an infectious disease, that can be obtained from the ongoing new infectious cases. The model provides a method for quantitative measure of critical infectious disease attributes for a population including highest disease transmission rate, effective disease transmission rate, and disease related precautionary behavior. We predict future COVID-19 pandemic trends in the United States accounting for vaccine rollout and behavioral response. Although a high rate of vaccination is critical to quickly end the pandemic, we find that a return towards pre-pandemic social behavior due to increased sense of safety during vaccine deployment, can cause an alarming surge in infections. Our results indicate that at the current rate of vaccination, the new infection cases for COVID-19 in the United States will approach zero by the end of August 2021. The model can be used for predicting future epidemic and pandemic dynamics before and during vaccination.","Usherwood, Thomas; LaJoie, Zachary; Srivastava, Vikas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00677v1.pdf,257

This study quantifies night-to-night variability of BAI and establishes probability thresholds for inferring underlying brain pathology based on a patient's BAI. Methods 86 patients with multiple nights of consecutive EEG recordings were selected from Epilepsy Monitoring Unit patients whose EEGs reported as being within normal limits. BAI was calculated for each 12-hour segment of patient data using a previously described algorithm, and night-to-night variability in BAI was measured. Results The within-patient night-to-night standard deviation in BAI was 7.5 years. Estimates of BAI derived by averaging over 2, 3, and 4 nights had standard deviations of 4.7, 3.7, and 3.0 years, respectively. Conclusions Averaging BAI over n nights reduces night-to-night variability of BAI by a factor of the square root of n, rendering BAI more suitable as a biomarker of brain health at the individual level. Significance With increasing ease of EEG acquisition including wearable technology, BAI has the potential to track brain health and detect deviations from normal physiologic function. In a clinical setting, BAI could be used to identify patients who should undergo further investigation or monitoring.","Hogan, Jacob; Sun, Haoqi; Paixao, Luis; Westmeijer, Mike; Sikka, Pooja; Jin, Jing; Tesh, Ryan; Cardoso, Madalena; Cash, Sydney S.; Akeju, Oluwaseun; Thomas, Robert; Westover, M.

The input dataset consists of incident cases partitioned into outbreaks, each initiated from a single index case. We split of the input dataset into two successive subsets, to evaluate two successive R values, according to the Bayesian paradigm. We used the Bayes factor between the model with two different R values and that with a single R value to justify that the change in R is statistically significant. We validated our approach using simulated data, generated using known R. In particular, we found that claiming two distinct R values may depend significantly on the number of outbreaks. We then reanalyzed data previously studied by Jansen et al. [Jansen et al. Science 301 (5634), 804], concerning the effective reproduction number for measles in the UK, during 1995-2002. Our analyses showed that the 1995-2002 dataset should be divided into two separate subsets for the periods 1995-1998 and 1999-2002. In contrast, Jansen et al. take this splitting point as input of their analysis. Our estimated effective reproduction numbers R are in good agreement with those found by Jansen et al. In conclusion, our methodology for detecting temporal changes in R using outbreak-size data worked satisfactorily with both simulated and real-world data.

Many observers concern that the pandemic would result in growing protectionist attitudes in trade. This article provides one of the first systematic assessments to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the public's trade preferences. Using original cross-national surveys in six key and highly integrated economies in Asia – Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand – we found that most people support establishing closer trade relationships with foreign countries. However, most people prefer to buy more domestic products than foreign products. We test a behavioural model of trade preferences to understand the psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with prior studies, we found that a greater level of anxiety is negatively associated with support for trade and foreign product preference, after controlling for the effects of ethnocentrism, education and other socioeconomic factors. Job and health insecurities reduced public preference for buying more foreign products, but it stimulated more support for trade with other countries. This study contributes to the behavioural theory of international political economy and sheds light on the future of economic globalization.

389840,COVID 19 pandemic: Mental health challenges of internal migrant workers of India,2020,"BACKGROUND: Innovative models of family engagement and support are needed in the intensive care unit (ICU) during times of restricted visitation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited understanding of the factors affecting the uptake and outcomes of different family support models hinders the implementation of best practices. We aimed to conduct a rapid pre-implementation evaluation of stakeholder-perceived facilitators and barriers to design implementation strategies to support a novel program using medical students to facilitate family-centered care in the ICU. METHODS: We conducted a 2-step process. In step 1, we gathered contextual data via interview-style open-ended questions sent to clinicians and navigator stakeholders via email. We used electronic data collection due to the physical distancing requirements, the need to prioritize brief data collection for respondent burden, and the need for rapid knowledge gain. A codebook based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), an integrated framework from the field of implementation science, was used to analyze the findings. In step 2, a pilot of the intervention was implemented with 3 navigators over 2 weeks. Implementation strategies were developed to target barriers identified by the pre-implementation evaluation. RESULTS: Fourteen (70%) of the identified stakeholders responded to the survey. Ten constructs encompassing all five CFIR domains were present in responses as implementation influencers, with the Intervention domain most frequently represented. Through these results and operational feedback from navigators during the pilot period, stakeholders selected multiple implementation strategies: audit and provide feedback, develop educational materials, conduct ongoing training, promote adaptability, assess and redesign workflow, identify and prepare champions, and engage community resources. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated how a conceptually based pre-implementation program evaluation can be used to rapidly inform optimal implementation strategies. We report key factors to inform design and implementation strategies for a novel ICU family engagement navigator program that may be useful to others wishing to adopt similar programs.","Taylor, Stephanie Parks; Short, Robert T; Asher, Anthony M; Taylor, Brice; Beidas, Rinad S",Implement Sci Commun,,257
390224,Supporting the Mental Health Workforce During and After COVID-19,2021,"Clinical and laboratory predictors of COVID-19 severity are now well described and combined to propose mortality or severity scores. However, they all necessitate saturable equipment such as scanners, or procedures difficult to implement such as blood gas measures. To provide an easy and fast COVID-19 severity risk score upon hospital admission, and keeping in mind the above limits, we sought for a scoring system needing limited invasive data such as a simple blood test and co-morbidity assessment by anamnesis. A retrospective study of 303 patients (203 from Bordeaux University hospital and an external independent cohort of 100 patients from Paris Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital) collected clinical and biochemical parameters at admission. Using stepwise model selection by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), we built the severity score Covichem. Among 26 tested variables, 7: obesity, cardiovascular conditions, plasma sodium, albumin, ferritin, LDH and CK were the independent predictors of severity used in Covichem (accuracy 0.87, AUROC 0.91). Accuracy was 0.92 in the external validation cohort (89% sensitivity and 95% specificity). Covichem score could be useful as a rapid, costless and easy to implement severity assessment tool during acute COVID-19 pandemic waves.","Bats, Marie-Lise; Rucheton, Benoit; Fleur, Tara; Orieux, Arthur; Chemin, Clément; Rubin, Sébastien; Colombies, Brigitte; Desclaux, Arnaud; Rivoisy, Claire; Mériglier, Etienne; Rivière, Etienne; Boyer, Alexandre; Gruson, Didier; Pellegrin, Isabelle; Trimoulet, Pascale; Garrigue, Isabelle; Alkouri, Rana; Dupin, Charles; Moreau-Gaudry, François; Bedel, Aurélie; Dabernat, Sandrine",PLoS One,,257
390324,Internalized stigmatization and subjective recovery in individuals with chronic mental illness,2020,"BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests the COVID-19 pandemic has negative effects on public mental health. Digital interventions that have been developed and evaluated in recent years may be used to mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic. However, evidence-based recommendations on the use of existing telemedicine and internet-based (eHealth) and app-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the theoretical and empirical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions related to public mental health provision (ie, mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders) that may help to reduce the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A rapid meta-review was conducted. The MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews and meta-analyses that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions and determinants likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Overall, 815 peer-reviewed systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identified, of which 83 met the inclusion criteria. Our findings suggest that there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions. Evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (eg, blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion. However, evidence on process quality, cost-effectiveness, and long-term effects is very limited. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that digital interventions are particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the population level. In times of physical distancing, quarantine, and restrictions on social contacts, decision makers should develop digital strategies for continued mental health care and invest time and efforts in the development and implementation of mental health promotion and prevention programs.","Rauschenberg, Christian; Schick, Anita; Hirjak, Dusan; Seidler, Andreas; Paetzold, Isabell; Apfelbacher, Christian; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G; Reininghaus, Ulrich",J Med Internet Res,,257
390607,Lessons learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic: Why Australian schools should be prioritised to stay open,2021,"During infection with positive-strand RNA viruses, viral RNA synthesis associates with modified intracellular membranes that form unique and captivating structures in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. These viral replication organelles (ROs) play a key role in the replicative cycle of important human pathogens like coronaviruses, enteroviruses, or flaviviruses. From their discovery to date, progress in our understanding of viral ROs has closely followed new developments in electron microscopy (EM). This review gives a chronological account of this progress and an introduction to the different EM techniques that enabled it. With an ample repertoire of imaging modalities, EM is nowadays a versatile technique that provides structural and functional information at a wide range of scales. Together with well-established approaches like electron tomography or labeling methods, we examine more recent developments, such as volume scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and in situ cryotomography, which are only beginning to be applied to the study of viral ROs. We also highlight the first cryotomography analyses of viral ROs, which have led to the discovery of macromolecular complexes that may serve as RO channels that control the export of newly-made viral RNA. These studies are key first steps towards elucidating the macromolecular complexity of viral ROs.","Wolff, Georg; Bárcena, Montserrat",Viruses,,257

392126,Homeopathy and the COVID-19 pandemic: quasi-experimental observational study: Abstract,2021,"Policy Points This article reconceptualizes our understanding of the opioid epidemic and proposes six strategies that address the epidemic's social roots. In order to successfully reduce drug-related mortality over the long term, policymakers and public health leaders should develop partnerships with people who use drugs, incorporate harm reduction interventions, and reverse decades of drug criminalization policies. CONTEXT: Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. Synthetic opioids, predominantly illicit fentanyl and its analogs, surpassed prescription opioids and heroin in associated mortality rates in 2016. Unfortunately, interventions fail to fully address the current wave of the opioid epidemic and often omit the voices of people with lived experiences regarding drug use. Every overdose death is a culmination of a long series of policy failures and lost opportunities for harm reduction. METHODS: In this article, we conducted a scoping review of the opioid literature to propose a novel framework designed to foreground social determinants more directly into our understanding of this national emergency. The ""continuum of overdose risk"" framework is our synthesis of the global evidence base and is grounded in contemporary theories, models, and policies that have been successfully applied both domestically and internationally. FINDINGS: De-escalating overdose risk in the long term will require scaling up innovative and comprehensive solutions that have been designed through partnerships with people who use drugs and are rooted in harm reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Without recognizing the full drug-use continuum and the role of social determinants, the current responses to drug overdose will continue to aggravate the problem they are trying to solve.","Park, Ju Nyeong; Rouhani, Saba; Beletsky, Leo; Vincent, Louise; Saloner, Brendan; Sherman, Susan G",Milbank Q,,257

This novel virus leads to pneumonia, which is an infection that inflames the lungs' air sacs of a human. One of the methods to detect those inflames is by using x-rays for the chest. In this paper, a pneumonia chest x-ray detection based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) with a fine-tuned deep transfer learning for a limited dataset will be presented. The use of GAN positively affects the proposed model robustness and made it immune to the overfitting problem and helps in generating more images from the dataset. The dataset used in this research consists of 5863 X-ray images with two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. This research uses only 10% of the dataset for training data and generates 90% of images using GAN to prove the efficiency of the proposed model. Through the paper, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Squeeznet, and Resnet18 are selected as deep transfer learning models to detect the pneumonia from chest x-rays. Those models are selected based on their small number of layers on their architectures, which will reflect in reducing the complexity of the models and the consumed memory and time. Using a combination of GAN and deep transfer models proved it is efficiency according to testing accuracy measurement. The research concludes that the Resnet18 is the most appropriate deep transfer model according to testing accuracy measurement and achieved 99% with the other performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score while using GAN as an image augmenter. Finally, a comparison result was carried out at the end of the research with related work which used the same dataset except that this research used only 10% of original dataset. The presented work achieved a superior result than the related work in terms of testing accuracy.","Khalifa, Nour Eldeen M.; Taha, Mohamed Hamed N.; Hassanien, Aboul Ella; Elghamrawy, Sally",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01184v1.pdf,257

Here, a comprehensive review of the possible links between GH-insulinlike growth factor 1 axis impairment and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity is offered. First, unequivocal evidence suggests that immune system dysregulation represents a key element in determining SARS-CoV-2 severity, as well as the association with adult-onset GH deficiency (GHD); notably, if GH is physiologically involved in the development and maintenance of the immune system, its pharmacological replacement in GHD patients seems to positively influence their inflammatory status. In addition, the impaired fibrinolysis associated with GHD may represent a further link between GH-insulin-like growth factor 1 axis impairment and COVID-19 severity, as it has been associated with both conditions. In conclusion, several sources of evidence have supported a relationship between GHD and COVID-19, and they also shed light upon potential beneficial effects of recombinant GH treatment on COVID-19 patients.","Lubrano, Carla; Masi, Davide; Risi, Renata; Balena, Angela; Watanabe, Mikiko; Mariani, Stefania; Gnessi, Lucio",Obesity (Silver Spring),,257

As a public health response to control the pandemic, wearing homemade face coverings has been proven as a resort to protect both the wearer and others from droplets and aerosols transmission. Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through these non-medical materials with a series of filtration mechanisms, their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail. Moreover, many factors, such as the fabric properties and the method of usage, also affect filtration performance. In this study, the size-dependent filtration performances of non-medical materials as candidates for face coverings were evaluated comprehensively. The flow resistance across these filter materials, an indicator of breathability, was also examined. The effect of materials properties, washing and drying cycles, and triboelectric effect on particle filtration was also studied. Results showed that the filtration efficiency varied considerably from 5-50% among fabrics materials due to the material properties, such as density and microscopic structure of the materials. Microfiber cloth demonstrated the highest efficiency among the tested materials. In general, fabric materials with higher grams per square meter (GSM) show higher particle filtration efficiency. The results on washing and drying fabric materials indicated decent reusability for fabric materials. The triboelectric charge could increase the filtration performance of the tested fabric materials, but this effect diminishes soon due to the dissipation of charges, meaning that triboelectric charging may not be effective in manufacturing homemade face coverings.","Hao, Weixing; Xu, Guang; Wang, Yang",J Occup Environ Hyg,,257

Worldwide, vaccination is now expected to provide containment of the novel virus, resulting in an antibody-mediated immunity. To verify this, serological antibody assays qualitatively as well as quantitatively depicting the amount of generated antibodies are of great importance. Currently available test methods are either laboratory based or do not have the ability to indicate an estimation about the immune response. To overcome this, a novel and rapid serological magnetic immunodetection (MID) point-of-care (PoC) assay was developed, with sensitivity and specificity comparable to laboratory-based DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay. To specifically enrich human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in immunofiltration columns (IFCs) from patient sera, a SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigen was transiently produced in plants, purified and immobilized on the IFC. Then, an IgG-specific secondary antibody could bind to the retained antibodies, which was finally labeled using superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Based on frequency magnetic mixing technology (FMMD), the magnetic particles enriched in IFC were detected using a portable FMMD device. The obtained measurement signal correlates with the amount of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in the sera, which could be demonstrated by titer determination. In this study, a MID-based assay could be developed, giving qualitative as well as semiquantitative results of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels in patient's sera within 21 min of assay time with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 92%, based on the analysis of 170 sera from hospitalized patients that were tested using an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-certified chemiluminescence assay.","Pietschmann, J.; Voepel, N.; Vos, L.; Rasche, S.; Schubert, M.; Kleines, M.; Krause, H.

Working conditions (unemployment, low wages, instability, precariousness) emerge as one of the main channels through which mental health is put at risk or deteriorates. This deterioration occurs with intensity in particularly vulnerable groups, such as immigrant population and families with economic burdens. In the case of suicides, the results were inconclusive. Regarding the use of health care services, an increase in the consumption of certain drugs seems to be identified, although the conclusions of all the studies are not coincidental. Social inequalities in mental health do not seem to have remitted. We conclude that Spain needs to improve information systems to a better understanding of the health effects of economic crises. In terms of public policies, together with the reinforcement of health services aimed at addressing mental health problems, an income guarantee network for people in vulnerable situations should be promoted, as well as the development of policies aimed at the labour market.","Oliva, Juan; López-Varcárcel, Beatriz González; Pérez, Patricia Barber; Peña-Longobardo, Luz María; Garrido, Rosa M Urbanos; González, Néboa Zozaya","Gac. sanit.

401562,The Enduring Importance of Trust in the Leadership of Health Care Organizations,2020,"BACKGROUND: Changes in relationships, sleep rhythms, and physical activity caused by school closures instituted to curb the spread of COVID-19 influenced children's mental health. We explored changes in children's daily life and effects on their mental health during school closures. METHODS: Participants included elementary and junior high school students 9 years of age and older seen in the outpatient clinic during school closures and were required to complete the Japanese version of WHO Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5-J). The results were compared with those of students seen after schools reopened. RESULTS: Participants included 78 students in the school closure group and 113 in the school reopening group. Although those in the closure group devoted more time to family and sleep, their sleep rhythms, eating habits, and physical activities were disrupted. Although there were no significant differences between the two groups in total WHO-5-J scores, single WHO-5-J items such as activity and vigor and interest were significantly worse and rest was significantly better in the school closure group. CONCLUSION: Although school closures resulted in elementary and junior high school students spending more time with family and sleeping, their sleep rhythms, eating habits, and physical activities were disrupted. As the children's living environment changed, they felt less active and vigorous and had difficulty finding things that interested them. However, their sleep improved and overall, the number of children with potential mental health problems did not change.","Saito, Mari; Kikuchi, Yutaka; Lefor, Alan Kawarai; Hoshina, Masaru",Pediatr. int,,257

To conduct this systematic review, the Cochrane Handbook recommendations will be followed. Patients aged 60 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be included. A comprehensive literature search will be performed in the following databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Spanish Bibliographic Index on Health Sciences (IBECS) and Epistemonikos COVID-19 L·OVE platform. No language restrictions will be applied. To assess the methodological quality of the included studies and the certainty of the evidence, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used. The meta-analysis will be performed using R software. We believe this rapid systematic review will be able to summarize the currently available evidence on clinical, socioeconomic characteristics, and management of COVID-19 in older adults. Therefore, it will help implement adequate strategies to fight the pandemic and assist in understanding the clinical profile of older patients with COVID-19, providing data with due scientific support upon which to base future choices of procedures and interventions.","Pegorari, Maycon Sousa; Matos, Areolino Pena; Iosimuta, Natalia Camargo Rodrigues; Ferreira, Vânia Tie Koga; Ohara, Daniela Gonçalves; Santos, Elane Priscila Rosa; Silva, Caroline de Fátima Ribeiro; Santos, Nara Loren Oliveira dos; Rocha, Aline Pereira; Atallah, Álvaro Nagib; Pinto, Ana Carolina Pereira Nunes",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,257

Change ideas were selected and implemented sequentially, using Plan-Do-Study- Act methodology.These included:1) Weekly review of PRN prescribing2) Nursing administration sheetData were collected weekly and plotted on our run chart.ResultBy the end of May 2020, we had exceeded our initial goal, reducing the weekly median number of doses of oral psychotropic PRN medication administered by over 30%.Our balancing measures remained stable and we gained useful insights and development ideas from a staff survey.Further change ideas were planned for implementation over the months that followed, however, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic meant that the project lost some momentum.ConclusionDespite running into some difficulty over recent months, the team remain motivated to maintain and build upon our previous success.In the past few weeks, “Calm Cards”, (a patient-centred intervention promoting use of individualised alternative coping strategies), have been introduced.We hope that the outcomes of this intervention will be positive, both in terms of further reducing use of PRN medication and encouraging development of skills which can be utilised beyond the hospital environment.We also intend to share our learning with colleagues and explore the possibility of introducing the project to other wards within the hospital.","Moore, Zoe Morrow Rachel McGee Meta",BJPsych Open,,257

These measures may have unintended consequences on individuals’ well-being, such as increased stress, anxiety, and sleep disruptions. We investigated the extent to which individuals’ mental health status is associated with perceived changes in sleep amount and sleep quality among a sample of adult twin pairs (N = 909 pairs;77% MZ, 23% DZ), less than a month after the outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. About half of participants reported no change in sleep amount (50.1%) or sleep quality (55.6%). Approximately one-third of the participants had increased amount of sleep (29.8%), and 32.9% reported a decrease in sleep quality. We found that stress and anxiety levels were associated with sleep reduction (ORs = 2.36 and 3.12 for stress and anxiety, respectively) and poorer sleep quality (ORs = 2.45 and 3.73 for stress and anxiety, respectively), even after taking into account between-family confounds.

Hence, the study aims to investigate and characterize the manifestations which appear after eradication of the coronavirus infection and its relation to disease severity. METHOD: 287 survivors from COVID-19 were included in the study, each received a questionnaire divided into three main parts starting from subjects' demographic data, data about the COVID-19 status and other comorbidities of the subject, and finally data about post-COVID-19 manifestations. Response surface plots were produced to visualize the link between several factors. RESULTS: Only 10.8 % of all subjects have no manifestation after recovery from the disease while a large percentage of subjects suffered from several symptoms and diseases. The most common symptom reported was fatigue (72.8 %), more critical manifestations like stroke, renal failure, myocarditis, and pulmonary fibrosis were reported by a few percent of the subjects. There was a relationship between the presence of other comorbidities and severity of the disease. Also, the severity of COVID-19 was related to the severity of post-COVID-19 manifestations. CONCLUSION: The post-COVID-19 manifestation is largely similar to the post-SARS syndrome. All subjects recovered from COVID-19 should undergo long-term monitoring for evaluation and treatment of symptoms and conditions that might be precipitated with the new coronavirus infection.","Tolba, Marwa; Abo Omirah, Marwa; Hussein, Amal; Saeed, Haitham",Int J Clin Pract,,257
406726,The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and implications for clinical practice,2020,"Risk communication plays a central role in public health emergencies: it must enable informed decisions, promote protective or life-sustaining behaviour, and maintain trust in public institutions. In addition, uncertainties in knowledge must be named transparently; irrational fears and rumours must be refuted. Success factors for risk communication are the participation of citizens as well as the continuous recording of risk perception and risk competence in population groups. The current COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) pandemic poses specific challenges for risk communication.The state of knowledge on many important aspects concerning COVID-19 was and is often uncertain or preliminary, e.g. on transmission, symptoms, long-term effects and immunity. Communication is characterised by scientific language and an array of figures and statistics, which can render the content difficult to understand. Alongside the official announcements and statements by experts, COVID-19 is widely communicated on social media, spreading misinformation and speculation; this ""infodemic"" can complicate risk communication.Various national and international scientific projects will help tailor risk communication on COVID-19 to target groups and thereby render it more effective. These projects include explorative studies on how people deal with COVID-19-related information; the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO) project, a regularly conducted online survey on risk perception and protective behaviour; and an interdisciplinary qualitative study that compares the design, implementation and effectiveness of risk communication strategies in four countries.","Loss, Julika; Boklage, Evgeniya; Jordan, Susanne; Jenny, Mirjam A; Weishaar, Heide; El Bcheraoui, Charbel",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,257

After about 10 years, in 2012, another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world. Herein we will provide with an update on the main features of COVID-19 and suggest possible solutions how to halt the expansion of this novel pandemic.","Contini, Carlo; Di Nuzzo, Mariachiara; Barp, Nicole; Bonazza, Aurora; De Giorgio, Roberto; Tognon, Mauro; Rubino, Salvatore",J Infect Dev Ctries,,257

In the past, biosensors based on synthetic biology have been designed on living cells, but the development of cell biosensors has been greatly limited by defects such as genetically modified organism problem and the obstruction of cell membrane. However, the advent of cell-free synthetic biology addresses these limitations. Biosensors based on the cell-free protein synthesis system have the advantages of higher safety, higher sensitivity, and faster response time over cell biosensors, which make cell-free biosensors have a broader application prospect. This review summarizes the workflow of various cell-free biosensors, including the identification of analytes and signal output. The detection range of cell-free biosensors is greatly enlarged by different recognition mechanisms and output methods. In addition, the review also discusses the applications of cell-free biosensors in environmental monitoring and health diagnosis, as well as existing deficiencies and aspects that should be improved. In the future, through continuous improvement and optimization, the potential of cell-free biosensors will be stimulated, and their application fields will be expanded.","Zhang, Liyuan; Guo, Wei; Lu, Yuan",Biotechnol J,,257

409944,Ethnic-minority health care workers discrimination: An example from Japan during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Doctors and healthcare workers (HCW) are at frontline in control of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). The virus is transmitted by contact, droplet, and airborne transmission; hence, hand hygiene, social distancing, environmental disinfection, and use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) form important components to protect HCWs from cross-infection. Appropriate use of PPE is of paramount importance not only to reduce the risk of transmission but also to maintain adequate stock for those who are dealing directly with COVID-19 patients. AIMS: In this article, we aim to provide the rationale for appropriate use of PPE in the dermatology setting in the current scenario. We have also discussed the scientific evidence for use of each component of protection and the practical problems faced in our COVID referral tertiary hospital. METHODS: Our review was based on articles that have studied or analyzed the efficacy of various protective measures being utilized by health workers against spread of COVID-19. This was done by carrying out a PUBMED search with terms ""coronavirus, COVID-19, personal protective equipment (PPE), transmission, mask, face shields, goggles, gloves."" We also scrutinized the various pragmatic issues being faced by doctors in our setup while using PPE. RESULTS: In order to maximize the appropriate use of PPE, the rationale for use needs to be understood and problems encountered in daily practice need to be addressed. CONCLUSION: Adherence to protective measures and use of PPE is of utmost importance for HCWs to prevent cross-infection in this pandemic. The use of PPE can limit transmission to a great extent, but appropriate use and avoiding misuse is equally important in the dermatology setting in order to avoid depletion of stock. It is also essential to consider various practical issues with use of PPE and device measures to avoid them so that breach in protocols can be prevented and spread of infection minimized.","Arora, Pooja; Sardana, Kabir; Sinha, Surabhi",J. cosmet. dermatol,,257
409968,Eye care during the COVID-19 public health emergency: a WHO perspective,2020,"Background: As of 18 June 2020 a total of 187,764 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections were reported in Germany and of these 6.9% were under the age of 19 years. There were initial indications that children are often asymptomatic and show a milder clinical course. Objective: The aim of this study was to gain information on the prevalence of SARS-CoV­2 infections in a pediatric cohort. Material and methods: Between 13 March and 18 June 2020 all children from whom a smear for SARS-CoV­2 was taken either to rule out an infection or as a suspected case were included. Data were collected on standardized patient record sheets. The analysis of data was anonymized and retrospective. Results: During the given period 2192 children were investigated and 37 patients tested positive (1.7%) for SARS-CoV­2. Of these 36/37 were suspected cases and 28/37 were symptomatic. The leading symptoms were dry cough, runny nose and fever and three children had to be hospitalized. None showed a difficult course of the disease. Among those tested 505 were patients at risk due to an underlying chronic disease, 3 of whom (0.6%) were tested positive with an asymptomatic or mild course. Conclusion: We can confirm the first data showing that children and adolescents often have an asymptomatic or mild clinical course of infection or disease. We found no evidence of a high grey area of SARS-CoV­2 infections in this regional pediatric cohort.","Meyer, M; Rübsteck, E; Lehmann, C; Klein, F; Gruell, H; Hünseler, C; Weber, L T",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,,257

This dysfunction may cause loss of appetite, malnutrition, poisoning, and depression. Obviously, the impairment has a strong impact on the quality of life. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify effective treatments. Various therapies have been studied to treat smell disorders after infection, and olfactory training (OT) is considered a promising treatment option. Assessing the effectiveness and safety of olfactory training for COVID-19 patients with smell disorders is the main purpose of this systematic review protocol. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang Database, ClinicalTrials.gov trials registry, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry will be searched from January 2019 to January 2021. A combination of subject words and free text words will be applied in the searches. The language is limited to Chinese and English. The complete process will include study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and meta-analyses. Endnote X9.3 will be used to manage data screening. The statistical analysis will be completed by Review Manager V.5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration) or Stata V.16.0 software. RESULTS: This proposed study will assess the effectiveness and safety of OT for COVID-19 patients with smell disorders. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of this study will provide evidence to prove the effectiveness and safety of olfactory training for COVID-19 patients with smell disorders. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol will not evaluate individual patient information or infringe patient rights and therefore does not require ethical approval.

METHODS: A questionnaire regarding COVID-19 symptoms and exposure history was administered to all individuals contacting the Israeli Defense Forces ""Corona call-center"", prior to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Surveyed symptoms included cough, fever, sore throat, rhinorrhea, loss of taste or smell, chest pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Factors were compared between positive and negative cases based on confirmatory test results, and positive likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated. Results were stratified by sex, BMI, previous medical history and dates of questioning and a multivariable analysis for association with positive test was conducted. RESULTS: Of 24,362 respondents, 59.1% were men with a median age of 20.5 years (IQR 19.6-22.4). Significant positive LRs were associated with loss of taste or smell (LR 3.38, 95%CI 3.01-3.79), suspected exposure (LR 1.33, 95%CI 1.28-1.39) and fever (LR 1.26, 95%CI 1.17-1.36). Those factors were also associated with positive PCR result in a multivariable analysis (OR 3.51 (3.04-4.06), OR 1.86 (1.65-2.09) and OR 1.34 (1.19-1.51), respectively). Reports of loss of taste or smell increased gradually over time and were significantly more frequent at the late period of the study (63/5,231 (1.21%), 156/7,941 (1.96%), and 1,505/11,190 (13.45%), p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Loss of taste or smell, report of a suspicious exposure and fever (>37.5ºC) were consistently associated with positive LRs for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result, in a population of predominantly young and healthy adults.","Nitecki, Maya; Taran, Boris; Ketko, Itay; Geva, Gil; Yosef, Roey; Toledo, Itay; Twig, Gilad; Avramovitch, Eva; Gordon, Barak; Derazne, Estela; Fink, Noam; Furer, Ariel",Clin. microbiol. infect,,257

It has robust historical precedence and sound biological plausibility. Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe as a treatment for COVID-19.METHODSThus, we analyzed key safety metrics after transfusion of ABO-compatible human COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 5000 hospitalized adults with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, with 66% in the intensive care unit, as part of the US FDA expanded access program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma.RESULTSThe incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs), including mortality rate (0.3%), in the first 4 hours after transfusion was <1%. Of the 36 reported SAEs, there were 25 reported incidences of related SAEs, including mortality (n = 4), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (n = 7), transfusion-related acute lung injury (n = 11), and severe allergic transfusion reactions (n = 3). However, only 2 of 36 SAEs were judged as definitely related to the convalescent plasma transfusion by the treating physician. The 7-day mortality rate was 14.9%.CONCLUSIONGiven the deadly nature of COVID-19 and the large population of critically ill patients included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive.

413757,Multi-Objective Predictive Control of Covid-19 Epidemics and Mental Health,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Recently the COVID-19 pandemic became the main global priority; main efforts and health infrastructures have been prioritized in favor of COVID-19 battle and the treatment of benign diseases has been postponed. Renal cell cancer (RCC) patients configure a heterogenous populations: some of them present indolent cases which can safely have postponed their treatments, others present aggressive tumors, deserving immediate care. These scenarios must be properly identified before a tailored therapeutic choice. Objectives We propose a risk- based approach for patients with RCC, to be used during this unprecedented viral infection time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a literature review focused in COVID-19 and current RCC treatments, we suggest therapeutic strategies of RCC in two sections: surgical approach and systemic therapy, in all stages of this malignance. RESULTS: Patients with cT1a tumors (and complex cysts, Bosniak III/IV), must be put under active surveillance and delayed intervention. cT1b-T2a/b cases must be managed by partial or radical nephrectomy, some selected T1b-T2a ((&#8804;7cm) cases can have the surgery postponed by 60-90 days). Locally advanced tumors (&#8805;cT3 and or N+) must be promptly resected. As possible, minimally invasive surgery and early hospital discharge are encouraged. Upfront cytoreduction, is not recommendable for low risk oligometastatic patients, which must start systemic treatment or even could be put under surveillance and delayed therapy. Intermediate and poor risk metastatic patients must start target therapy and/or immunotherapy (few good responders intermediate cases can have postponed cytoreduction). The recommendation about hereditary RCC syndromes are lacking, thus we recommend its usual care. Local or loco regional recurrence must have individualized approaches. For all cases, we suggest the application of a specific informed consent and a shared therapeutic choice. CONCLUSION: In the pandemic COVID -19 times, a tailored risk-based approach must be used for a safe management of RCC, aiming to not compromise the oncological outcomes of the patients.","Zequi, Stênio de Cássio; Abreu, Diego",Int Braz J Urol,,257

Available evidence suggest they improve oxygenation in a subset of patients without changing long-term trajectory. Given the differences in respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and ""traditional"" ARDS, we sought to identify their physiologic impact. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of patients mechanically ventilated for COVID-19, from the ICUs of 2 tertiary care centers, who received inhaled epoprostenol (iEpo) for the management of hypoxemia. The primary outcome is change in PaO2/FiO2. Additionally, we measured several patient level features to predict iEpo responsiveness (or lack thereof). RESULTS: Eighty patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV2 received iEpo while mechanically ventilated and had PaO2/FiO2 measured before and after. The median PaO2/FiO2 prior to receiving iEpo was 92 mmHg and interquartile range (74 - 122). The median change in PaO2/FiO2 was 9 mmHg (-9 - 37) corresponding to a 10% improvement (-8 - 41). Fifty-percent (40 / 80) met our a priori definition of a clinically significant improvement in PaO2/FiO2 (increase in 10% from the baseline value). Prone position and lower PaO2/FiO2 when iEpo was started predicted a more robust response, which held after multivariate adjustment. For proned individuals, improvement in PaO2/FiO2 was 14 mmHg (-6 to 45) vs. 3 mmHg (-11 - 20), p = 0.04 for supine individuals; for those with severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 100, n = 49) the median improvement was 16 mmHg (-2 - 46). CONCLUSION: Fifty percent of patients have a clinically significant improvement in PaO2/FiO2 after the initiation of iEpo. This suggests it is worth trying as a rescue therapy; although generally the benefit was modest with a wide variability. Those who were prone and had lower PaO2/FiO2 were more likely to respond.","Sonti, Rajiv; Pike, C William; Cobb, Nathan",J Intensive Care Med,,257

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We built a linked graph for registered COVID-19 clinical trials: the COVID-19 Trial Graph, to facilitate retrieval of clinical trials. Natural language processing (NLP) tools were leveraged to extract and normalize the clinical trial information from both their eligibility criteria free texts and structured information from ClinicalTrials.gov. We linked the extracted data using the COVID-19 Trial Graph and imported it to a graph database, which supports both query and visualization. We evaluated trial graph using case queries and graph embedding. RESULTS: The graph currently (as of 10-05-2020) contains 3,392 registered COVID-19 clinical trials, with 17,480 nodes and 65,236 relationships. Manual evaluation of case queries found high-precision and recall scores on retrieving relevant clinical trials searching from both eligibility criteria and trial-structured information. We observed clustering in clinical trials via graph embedding, which also showed superiority over the baseline (0.8704 vs. 0.8199) in evaluating whether a trial can complete its recruitment successfully. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 Trial Graph is a novel representation of clinical trials that allows diverse search queries and provides a graph-based visualization of COVID-19 clinical trials. High-dimensional vectors mapped by graph embedding for clinical trials would be potentially beneficial for many downstream applications, such as trial end recruitment status prediction, and trial similarity comparison. Our methodology also is generalizable to other clinical trials, such as cancer clinical trials.","Du, Jingcheng; Wang, Qing; Wang, Jingqi; Ramesh, Prerana; Xiang, Yang; Jiang, Xiaoqian; Tao, Cui",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,257

418931,Management of a Immunotherapy Unit During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Building a Resilient Health Care System,2021,"Attempts to curb the spread of coronavirus by introducing strict quarantine measures apparently have different effect in different countries: while the number of new cases has reportedly decreased in China and South Korea, it still exhibit significant growth in Italy and other countries across Europe. In this brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by means of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we introduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all infected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that they cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is determined by the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ (the number of newly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different compared to that for the standard SIR model. If $\mathcal{R}_0>1$, then the number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if $\mathcal{R}_0<1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions imposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays exponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease development in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth dynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth). Analysis of the data in China and Korea shows that the peak of infection (maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting measures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the total number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate remains exponential in Italy. Arguably, it suggests that the introduced quarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.","Volpert, Vitaly; Banerjee, Malay; Petrovskii, Sergei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09444v1.pdf,257

Following these drastic cutbacks, a cautious resumption of elective care is planned. This also applies to the delivery of inpatient and day-care interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy (IMPT). Since the majority of pain medicine centers have been closed to date, the question has arisen as to whether a resumption of regular care can be easily provided under the required protective measures. To answer this question, the authors conducted a survey among patients that were in a position to make a direct comparison between IMPT under normal conditions as well as under the currently required protective measures. The survey recorded the level of disruption caused by the different protective measures in the various treatment modules. An evaluation of the questionnaires, which were completed by two patient groups and all therapists involved, revealed that interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy is possible without significant impairments even under the required protective measures. In particular, wearing protective masks proved to be the protective measure with the greatest negative impact. However, options like the use of protective visors or relocating treatment modules to the outdoors offer practicable alternative solutions for protection. Both patient and therapist satisfaction was high despite these constraints, and personal concern regarding possible infection low.","Luchting, Benjamin",Schmerz,,257

421663,Winning the Hearts and Minds of Young Adults in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"To dissect the mechanisms underlying the inflation of variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we present a large-scale analysis of intra-host genomic diversity, which reveals that most samples exhibit heterogeneous genomic architectures, due to the interplay between host-related mutational processes and transmission dynamics. The decomposition of minor variants profiles unveils three non-overlapping mutational signatures related to nucleotide substitutions and likely ruled by APOBEC, Reactive Oxygen Species and ADAR, highlighting heterogeneous host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. A corrected-for-signatures dN/dS analysis demonstrates that such mutational processes are affected by purifying selection, with important exceptions. In fact, several mutations appear to transit toward clonality, defining new clonal genotypes that increase the overall genomic diversity. Furthermore, the phylogenomic analysis shows the presence of homoplasies and supports the hypothesis of transmission of minor variants. This study paves the way for the integrated analysis of intra-host genomic diversity and clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Graudenzi, Alex; Maspero, Davide; Angaroni, Fabrizio; Piazza, Rocco; Ramazzotti, Daniele",iScience,,257

Although there are quantitative studies on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-care professionals and other population groups, there are few studies that have evaluated the experiences of patients in the initial phases of the pandemic. Aim: This study aims to conduct a qualitative study assessing the experiences of the patients in isolation and quarantine in the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: The present study was a qualitative study through telephonic interviews with patients in isolation and quarantine due to COVID-19 from April 4 to 12, 2020. Patients in isolation had confirmed COVID-19 and were mandatorily admitted in specially designated COVID hospitals. Patients in quarantine were suspected to have COVID-19 due to symptoms or contact with confirmed patients with COVID-19. Results: The experiences could be classified as having psychological impact, interpersonal impact, social impact, behavioral changes and impact on occupational aspects. The experience was predominantly unpleasant and characterized by anxiety, stigma, ostracization, guilt, and worry about the future. Conclusion: The experiences of the individuals in both the groups emphasize the importance of addressing psychological stressors. It could be concluded that individuals and their families would accordingly benefit from effective interventions to deal with the negative experiences they have been through due to the present pandemic.","Kumar, K.; Jha, S.; Sharma, M.

426625,COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature,2020,"Counterfactual inference is a useful tool for comparing outcomes of interventions on complex systems. It requires us to represent the system in form of a structural causal model, complete with a causal diagram, probabilistic assumptions on exogenous variables, and functional assignments. Specifying such models can be extremely difficult in practice. The process requires substantial domain expertise, and does not scale easily to large systems, multiple systems, or novel system modifications. At the same time, many application domains, such as molecular biology, are rich in structured causal knowledge that is qualitative in nature. This manuscript proposes a general approach for querying a causal biological knowledge graph, and converting the qualitative result into a quantitative structural causal model that can learn from data to answer the question. We demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy and versatility of this approach using two case studies in systems biology. The first demonstrates the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions and the accuracy of the results. The second demonstrates the versatility of the approach by querying a knowledge base for the molecular determinants of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced cytokine storm, and performing counterfactual inference to estimate the causal effect of medical countermeasures for severely ill patients.","Zucker, Jeremy; Paneri, Kaushal; Mohammad-Taheri, Sara; Bhargava, Somya; Kolambkar, Pallavi; Bakker, Craig; Teuton, Jeremy; Hoyt, Charles Tapley; Oxford, Kristie; Ness, Robert; Vitek, Olga",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05136v1.pdf,257

T cells play a key role in the adaptive antiviral immune response by killing infected cells and facilitating the selection of virus-specific antibodies. However, neither the dynamics and cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response nor the diversity of resulting immune memory is well understood. In this study, we use longitudinal high-throughput T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to track changes in the T-cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19. In both donors, we identified CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell clones with transient clonal expansion after infection. We describe characteristic motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones and show preferential occurrence of these motifs in publicly available large dataset of repertoires from COVID-19 patients. We show that in both donors, the majority of infection-reactive clonotypes acquire memory phenotypes. Certain T-cell clones were detected in the memory fraction at the pre-infection time point, suggesting participation of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","Minervina, Anastasia A; Komech, Ekaterina A; Titov, Aleksei; Bensouda Koraichi, Meriem; Rosati, Elisa; Mamedov, Ilgar Z; Franke, Andre; Efimov, Grigory A; Chudakov, Dmitriy M; Mora, Thierry; Walczak, Aleksandra M; Lebedev, Yuri B; Pogorelyy, Mikhail V",eLife (Cambridge),,257

DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. SETTING: Fifteen PICUs across the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to United Kingdom PICUs with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 between March 14, 2020, and May 20, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Deidentified data collected as part of routine clinical care were analyzed. All children were diagnosed and staged for acute kidney injury based on the level of serum creatinine above the upper limit of reference interval values according to published guidance. Severe acute kidney injury was defined as stage 2/3 acute kidney injury. Uni- and multivariable analyses were performed to study the association between demographic data, clinical features, markers of inflammation and cardiac injury, and severe acute kidney injury. Over the study period, 116 patients with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 were admitted to 15 United Kingdom PICUs. Any-stage acute kidney injury occurred in 48 of 116 patients (41.4%) and severe acute kidney injury in 32 of 116 (27.6%) patients, which was mostly evident at admission (24/32, 75%). In univariable analysis, body mass index, hyperferritinemia, high C-reactive protein, Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 score, vasoactive medication, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with severe acute kidney injury. In multivariable logistic regression, hyperferritinemia was associated with severe acute kidney injury (compared with nonsevere acute kidney injury; adjusted odds ratio 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p = 0.04). Severe acute kidney injury was associated with longer PICU stay (median 5 days [interquartile range, 4-7 d] vs 3 days [interquartile range, 1.5-5 d]; p < 0.001) and increased duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (median 4 days [interquartile range, 2-6 d] vs 2 days [interquartile range, 1-3 d]; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Severe acute kidney injury occurred in just over a quarter of children admitted to United Kingdom PICUs with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Hyperferritinemia was significantly associated with severe acute kidney injury. Severe acute kidney injury was associated with increased duration of stay and ventilation.

Even with the availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the extraordinary effort to distribute the vaccines must be paired with continued adherence to behavioral recommendations as well as vaccine confidence. To facilitate rapid and equitable uptake of the vaccines, there is a need for responsive, trustworthy, and evidence-informed communication about vaccination, enhanced trust in science, and engaging populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Efforts to address vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine confidence will address the emerging gaps between vaccine availability and actual vaccination. Although these gaps are attributable, in part, to challenges with logistics and access, social and behavioral drivers of vaccination decision making also have a significant role in vaccination uptake. As federal, state, and local health and public health agencies coordinate vaccine dissemination, there will be a continuous need to adapt to an evolving landscape of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, new scientific information, and the spread of COVID-19- and vaccine-related misinformation. Facilitating widespread vaccination and maintaining a focus on equity requires thoughtful and compassionate approaches to reach and address the needs of those who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic such as underserved, vulnerable, and racial/ethnic minority populations. This commentary focuses on several National Institutes of Health initiatives that are supporting behavioral and social science research to address SARS-CoV-2 vaccine communication and increase the uptake of vaccination.

Previous studies have shown that Pulsatilla chinensis has significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, but the mechanism of cisplatin induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in vivo has not been thoroughly studied. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effect of pulchinenoside B4 (PB4), a representative and major component with a content of up to 10% in root of P. chinensis, on AKI induced by CP in mice. Our results indicated the significant protective effect of PB4 by evaluating renal function indicators, inflammatory factor levels and renal histopathological changes. In addition, PB4 may mainly act on NF-&#954;B signaling pathway to reduce the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the kidney after CP exposure, thus exerting anti-inflammatory activity. Furthermore, PB4 regulated MAPK signaling pathway and its downstream apoptotic factors to inhibit the occurrence of apoptosis, such as Bax, Bcl-2, caspase 3 and caspase 9. Notably, the activations of caspase 3 induced by cisplatin were strikingly reduced in PB4-treated mice. Therefore, the above evidence suggested that PB4 is a potential renal protectant with significant anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects.","Wang, Shuang; Tang, Shan; Chen, Xuan; Li, Xin; Jiang, Shuang; Li, Hui-Ping; Jia, Pin-Hui; Song, Ming-Jie; Di, Peng; Li, Wei",Chem Biol Interact,,257

Fundamental work at the interface of engineering and medicine has allowed nanomedicines to deliver therapeutic small molecules and nucleic acids more efficiently. While nanomedicines are used in oncology for immunotherapy or to deliver combinations of cytotoxics, the clinical successes of gene silencing approaches like patisiran lipid complexes (Onpattro®) have paved the way for a variety of therapies beyond cancer. In parallel, the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has highlighted the potential of mRNA vaccines to develop immunization strategies at unprecedented speed. To rationally design therapeutic and vaccines, chemists, materials scientists, and drug delivery experts need to better understand how nanotechnologies interact with the immune system. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the innate and adaptative immune systems and emphasizes the intricate mechanisms through which nanomedicines interact with these biological functions.","de Oliveira Viana, Iara Maíra; Roussel, Sabrina; Defrêne, Joan; Lima, Eliana Martins; Barabé, Frédéric; Bertrand, Nicolas",,,257

A total of 99 COVID-19 patients were recruited and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Scale. Results showed there was no significant difference in anxiety or depressive symptoms between male and female. Patients aged 46-60 years old had a higher ratio of both anxiety and depressive symptoms. Besides, patients whose hospital stays was longer than 14 days had a higher risk of depressive symptoms than those stays was less than 7 days. There was no significant difference in the correlation between level of dyspnea and the levels of anxiety or depressive symptoms. In conclusion, COVID-19 patients might have anxiety and depressive symptoms during hospitalization. Clinicians should pay attention to the middle age group and patients with longer hospital stays.","Li, Xueyi; Tian, Jun; Xu, Qun",Psychiatr. q,,257

Our previous study showed that the use of minimal media for P. gingivalis allowed to isolate novel inhibitors of P. gingivalis growth. However, growth of P. gingivalis in minimal media was not always reproducible. METHODS: To explain this phenomenon, we analyzed the growth of seven wild-type ATCC 33277 strains and two wild-type W83 strains in 10 minimal media and three complex media. RESULTS: All nine strains grew in LF (Lactalbumin-Ferric chloride), GC (bovine Î³-immunoglobulin G-Calcium chloride), and newly developed mC (milk-Casein) minimal media. Therefore, LF, GC, and mC could be used as minimal media for P. gingivalis. In contrast, other six minimal media containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) supported the growth of several less strains; among these, two media also showed lack of reproducibility in growth among ATCC 33277 strains. On the other hand, four ATCC 33277 strains grew similarly in all 13 media, but two W83 and other three ATCC 33277 strains grew differently in at least one medium. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the lack of reproducibility of P. gingivalis growth on minimal media is caused by the presence of BSA, and by differences among the standard strains of P. gingivalis.","Saiki, Keitarou; Urano-Tashiro, Yumiko; Takahashi, Yukihiro",,,257

Recognizing that the politicization of COVID-19 and the resulting polarization have become increasingly critical issues, this study investigates how death-related thinking and hope about the pandemic can affect hostility toward outgroups as well as how conservative and liberal media usages moderate the indirect effects of hope. An online survey experiment of people in the U.S. (N = 759) during the pandemic showed that death arousal reduced hope and that these low levels of hope exacerbated hostility toward outgroups in the pandemic context, confirming the positive impact of hope. Importantly, however, our study did not show that hope had a beneficial impact for heavy conservative media users.","Lee, Jiyoung; Kim, Yungwook; Kelsey, John P",Health Commun,,257

436973,"COVID-19 pandemic planning, response, and lessons learned at a community hospital",2020,"OBJECTIVES: Based on the current clinical routine, we aimed to develop a novel deep learning model to distinguish coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia from other types of pneumonia and validate it with a real-world dataset (RWD). METHODS: A total of 563 chest CT scans of 380 patients (227/380 were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia) from 5 hospitals were collected to train our deep learning (DL) model. Lung regions were extracted by U-net, then transformed and fed to pre-trained ResNet-50-based IDANNet (Identification and Analysis of New covid-19 Net) to produce a diagnostic probability. Fivefold cross-validation was employed to validate the application of our model. Another 318 scans of 316 patients (243/316 were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia) from 2 other hospitals were enrolled prospectively as the RWDs to testify our DL model's performance and compared it with that from 3 experienced radiologists. RESULTS: A three-dimensional DL model was successfully established. The diagnostic threshold to differentiate COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia was 0.685 with an AUC of 0.906 (95% CI: 0.886-0.913) in the internal validation group. In the RWD cohort, our model achieved an AUC of 0.868 (95% CI: 0.851-0.876) with the sensitivity of 0.811 and the specificity of 0.822, non-inferior to the performance of 3 experienced radiologists, suggesting promising clinical practical usage. CONCLUSIONS: The established DL model was able to achieve accurate identification of COVID-19 pneumonia from other suspected ones in the real-world situation, which could become a reliable tool in clinical routine. KEY POINTS: â¢ In an internal validation set, our DL model achieved the best performance to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia with a sensitivity of 0.836, a specificity of 0.800, and an AUC of 0.906 (95% CI: 0.886-0.913) when the threshold was set at 0.685. â¢ In the prospective RWD cohort, our DL diagnostic model achieved a sensitivity of 0.811, a specificity of 0.822, and AUC of 0.868 (95% CI: 0.851-0.876), non-inferior to the performance of 3 experienced radiologists. â¢ The attention heatmaps were fully generated by the model without additional manual annotation and the attention regions were highly aligned with the ROIs acquired by human radiologists for diagnosis.","Xie, Qiuchen; Lu, Yiping; Xie, Xiancheng; Mei, Nan; Xiong, Yun; Li, Xuanxuan; Zhu, Yangyong; Xiao, Anling; Yin, Bo",Eur. radiol,,257

Our objective was to quantify the presence and magnitude of antibody response in vaccinated, older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities. DESIGN: A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted March 15 - April 1, 2021 in the greater Pittsburgh region. SETTING AND POPULATION: Participants were older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities, who received mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. Conditions that impair immune responses were exclusionary criteria. METHODS: Sera were collected to measure IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level with reflex to total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin levels, and blinded evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization titers. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and multiple linear regression analysis evaluated relationships between factors potentially associated with antibody levels. Spearman correlations were calculated between antibody levels and neutralization titers. RESULTS: All participants (N = 70) had received two rounds of vaccination and were found to have antibodies with wide variation in relative levels. Antibody levels trended lower in males, advanced age, current use of steroids, and longer length of time from vaccination. Pseudovirus neutralization titer levels were strongly correlated (P < .001) with Beckman Coulter antibody levels [D614 G NT50, rs = 0.91; B.1.1.7 (UK) NT50, rs = 0.91]. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Higher functioning, healthier, residential older adults mounted detectable antibody responses when vaccinated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Data suggests some degree of immunity is present during the immediate period following vaccination. However, protective effects remain to be determined in larger studies as clinical protection is afforded by ongoing adaptive immunity, which is known to be decreased in older adults. This study provides important preliminary results on level of population risk in older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities to inform reopening strategies, but are not likely to be translatable for residents in nursing homes.","Nace, David A; Kip, Kevin E; Mellors, John W; Peck Palmer, Octavia M; Shurin, Michael R; Mulvey, Katie; Crandall, Melissa; Sobolewski, Michele D; Enick, P Nathan; McCormick, Kevin D; Jacobs, Jana L; Kane, April L; Lukanski, Amy; Kip, Paula L; Wells, Alan",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,257

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients frequently require immunosuppressive therapy and are known to be at risk of opportunistic infections. AREAS COVERED: We hereby review the available literature pertaining to COVID-19 in IBD based on published consensus guidelines, expert opinions, case series, registries and reports. EXPERT OPINION: Preliminary data suggests no increase in incidence of COVID-19 in IBD patients as compared to general population. Morbidity and mortality rates attributable to COVID-19 are also similar in IBD patients as compared to general population. Though exact reason is unknown, some aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis may explain this paradox. Medications for IBD need to be carefully reviewed during COVID-19 crisis. Steroids may need dose tapering or substitution to avoid complications based on anecdotal evidence. Endoscopic procedures for IBD maybe deferred unless absolutely necessary. General measures recommended for COVID-19 tailored to specific needs of IBD patients maybe the best way to prevent infection.

Hypertension and age are the 2 principal determinants of arterial stiffness (AS). This study aimed to estimate AS in patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization and analyze its association with all-cause in-hospital mortality. This observational, retrospective, multicenter cohort study analyzed 12 170 patients admitted to 150 Spanish centers included in the SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared AS, defined as pulse pressure &#8805;60 mm Hg, and clinical characteristics between survivors and nonsurvivors. Mean age was 67.5 (±16.1) years and 42.5% were women. Overall, 2606 (21.4%) subjects died. Admission systolic blood pressure (BP) <120 and &#8805;140 mm Hg was a predictor of higher all-cause mortality (23.5% and 22.8%, respectively, P<0.001), compared with systolic BP between 120 and 140 mm Hg (18.6%).

447021,Initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity and sedentary behavior in hypertensive older adults: An accelerometer-based analysis,2020,"Purpose: This paper aims to assess the effectiveness of videotaped learning when used in a university in the UAE, in terms of evaluating the experiences of the students, along with highlighting its benefits along with challenges The research aims to analyse the challenges and benefits of videotaped story workshop method for university students in the UAE Experiential learning theory can be the basis of this videotaped method of learning and can be used for further theory and the contribution of this research study to knowledge in international education in business Design/methodology/approach: The results got by extracting primary data (quantitative and qualitative) from a sample size of 201 students The paper used an action research methodology within a university degree course and within the teaching profession The research design is associated with measuring and assessing the challenges and benefits of videotaped story workshop method for university students, along with the perceptions of the students towards its use The study primarily used participatory action research which is a community-based study, action-based enquiry and action learning The approach mostly used to improve the conditions and practices in a range of social environments Findings: The results suggest that most students were in favour of incorporating videotaped story workshop method for the learning experience as this eradicates common linguistic and cultural barriers Observations indicate the students found it quite challenging to learn new techniques of making videos but later on shown a positive attitude towards the adoption of technology in terms of creating videos and presenting Technology allowed students to make videos to showcase previous experiences and stories via digital storytelling Such methods enhance student’s knowledge and academic skills while supporting learning behaviour and inspires them to plan, organise and share their ideas and expertise Research limitations/implications: The above methodology has good potential for inclusive learning and teaching at the higher education level which was not attempted due to lack of connecting to the learners with challenges at the university and for the researchers able to connect to such people This method can be easily extended to inclusive teaching and learning with minor adjustments as required with the disabilities noticed for the learners Hence, while most students displayed a positive attitude towards learning from creating, sharing and viewing digital stories, it can be argued that a certain proportion of them was not able to benefit entirely from it due to lack of experience and skills in generating videos Therefore, attention must be emphasised upon factors to minimise these challenges in multiple ways, for example, provision of training to students for easy employment of videotaping or affordable internet access, etc Practical implications: The students also stated that initially, they perceived videotape methodology quite challenging;however, with time, they started enjoying this method Videotaped story workshops, learners easily grasp the idea/knowledge through subtitles, even if the lessons are not delivered in their native language This aspect results in increasing student’s motivation towards learning new concepts and coordinating with other teams to share knowledge and ideas The method creates a strong sense of achievement amongst students that serves as a motivational driver for academic performance The videotaped story workshop method supports student’s learning rate, increases their interest and makes the whole learning process more enjoyable Social implications: The learning experience will improve as students and teachers get comfortable using this videotape learning methodology The method will be useful in remote learning as in the COVID19 situation and has immense social implications, especially in education It can extend to most domains and knowledge, teaching scenarios for engineering and business The research promises to add to he knowledge of blended learning and to the experiential learning approach which is useful to the international business of education and its future Originality/value: The classroom activities videotapes stored in platforms, making it convenient for the students and teachers to browse through at their convenience and to improve on in the future This videotape method applies to any field of learning such as music, cooking, engineering, language study, business studies as it has the advantage to be transcribed and also captions added for the learners and teachers to understand it better It can be useful in remote learning situations, also like the current one It promises to be a more efficient way of learning for

Overall, the results corroborate the construct validity, reliability and criterion-related validity of the JIM. Based on the results of the exploratory factor analysis, the new scale has 15 items and three items were removed from the dimensions of job loss and job change because of differences in culture and understanding between Chinese and Western employees. Additionally, the relationship between job insecurity and theoretically viable antecedents (three different types of conflicts) and outcomes (i.e., job satisfaction and counterproductive work behaviour) were also examined, and the results show that the three conflicts are effective predictors of job insecurity and job insecurity is predictor of outcomes variables. All findings show that this new JIM is more parsimonious and more effective in assessing job insecurity in the Chinese context.","Wang, Dawei; Hao, Leilei; Zong, Zhaobiao; Siu, OiLing; Xiao, Yilin; Zhao, Chaoyue; Zhang, Xinyong; O039,; Neill, Patrick; Hu, Yixin",,,257

Pharmacologically, it is crucial to understand the diverse mechanism of mutations for stable vaccine or anti-viral drug design. Our current study concentrates on all the constituent proteins of 469 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples, derived from Indian patients. However, the study may easily be extended to the samples across the globe. We perform clustering analysis towards identifying unique variants in each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A total of 536 mutated positions within the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are detected among the identified variants from Indian isolates. We quantify mutations by focusing on the unique variants of each SARS-CoV-2 protein. We report the average number of mutation per variant, percentage of mutated positions, synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, mutations occurring in three codon positions and so on. Our study reveals the most susceptible six (06) proteins, which are ORF1ab, Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), ORF3a, ORF7a, and ORF8. Several non-synonymous substitutions are observed to be unique in different SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A total of 57 possible deleterious amino acid substitutions are predicted, which may impact on the protein functions. Several mutations show a large decrease in protein stability and are observed in putative functional domains of the proteins that might have some role in disease pathogenesis. We observe a good number of physicochemical property change during above deleterious substitutions.","Das, Jayanta Kumar; Sengupta, Antara; Choudhury, Pabitra Pal; Roy, Swarup",Gene Rep,,257

449198,The COVID-19 Pandemic: Setting the Mental Health Research Agenda,2020,"AIM: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted Emergency Medical Services (EMS) operations throughout the country. Some studies described variation in total volume of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) during the pandemic. We aimed to describe the changes in volume and characteristics of OHCA patients and resuscitations in one urban EMS system. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all recorded atraumatic OHCA in Marion County, Indiana, from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 and from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. We described patient, arrest, EMS response, and survival characteristics. We performed paired and unpaired t-tests to evaluate the changes in those characteristics during COVID-19 as compared to the prior year. Data were matched by month to control for seasonal variation. RESULTS: The total number of arrests increased from 884 in 2019 to 1034 in 2020 (p = 0.016). Comparing 2019 to 2020, there was little difference in age [median 62 (IQR 59-73) and 60 (IQR 47-72), p = 0.086], gender (38.5% and 39.8% female, p = 0.7466, witness to arrest (44.3% and 39.6%, p = 0.092), bystander AED use (10.1% and 11.4% p = 0.379), bystander CPR (48.7% and 51.4%, p = 0.242). Patients with a shockable initial rhythm (19.2% and 15.4%, p = 0.044) both decreased in 2020, and response time increased by 18 s [6.0 min (IQR 4.5-7.7) and 6.3 min (IQR 4.7-8.0), p = 0.008]. 47.7% and 54.8% (p = 0.001) of OHCA patients died in the field, 19.7% and 19.3% (p = 0.809) died in the Emergency Department, 21.8% and 18.5% (p = 0.044) died in the hospital, 10.8% and 7.4% (p = 0.012) were discharged from the hospital, and 9.3% and 5.9% (p = 0.005) were discharged with Cerebral Performance Category score &#8804; 2. CONCLUSION: Total OHCA increased during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with the prior year. Although patient characteristics were similar, initial shockable rhythm, and proportion of patients who died in the hospital decreased during the pandemic. Further investigation will explore etiologies of those findings.","Glober, Nancy K; Supples, Michael; Faris, Greg; Arkins, Thomas; Christopher, Shawn; Fulks, Tyler; Rayburn, David; Weinstein, Elizabeth; Liao, Mark; O039,; Donnell, Daniel; Lardaro, Thomas",Am J Emerg Med,,257

Patient Initial Decisions for Telepsychiatry Participation after the COVID-19 Michigan Stay-at-Home Order: A Telephone-Based Survey,2020,"PURPOSE: Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are a rapidly growing population with ever-increasing complexity, and intensive care unit (ICU) management is often necessary. This review summarizes common cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular complications in ACHD and provides a framework for ICU care. RECENT FINDINGS: Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization and mortality in ACHD. Varied anatomy and repairs, as well as differing physiological complications, limit generalized application of management algorithms. Recent studies suggest that earlier mechanical support in advanced cases is feasible and potentially helpful. Cardiac arrhythmias are poorly tolerated and often require immediate attention. Other complications requiring intensive care include infections such as endocarditis and COVID-19, pulmonary hypertension, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, and stroke. Successful ICU care in ACHD requires a multi-disciplinary approach with careful consideration of anatomy, physiology, and associated comorbidities. Few studies have formally examined ICU management in ACHD and further research is necessary.","Kendsersky, Payton; Krasuski, Richard A",Curr Cardiol Rep,,257

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is the human cell receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. ACE2 expression increases on lung alveolar epithelial cells and adipose tissue due to obesity, smoking and air pollution. A significant relationship exists between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection, as more severe COVID-19 symptoms occur in smokers; comorbid conditions due to obesity or excess ectopic fat accumulation as underlying risk factors for severe COVID-19 strongly encourage the virus/ACE2 receptor-ligand interaction concept. Indeed, obesity, air pollution and smoking associated risk factors share underlying pathophysiologies that are related to the Renin-Angiotensin-System in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

457072,Mental Health Status of Healthcare Workers in China for COVID-19 Epidemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation offers the best potential for full rehabilitation in patients with end-stage kidney disease who are treated with dialysis. However, due to organ shortage which is a universal phenomenon, most patients need to be maintained on a period of dialysis therapy before the prospect of transplantation. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) could be an ideal form of renal replacement therapy due to its favorable profile toward preservation of residual renal function, patient survival, lower overall burden on cardiovascular morbidity and infection risks. METHODS: With extensive experience in PD therapy from Hong Kong where PD-first is a mandatory health policy, we reviewed the literature and present current evidence that favors PD as an optimal form of bridging renal replacement therapy prior to kidney transplantation. RESULTS: PD provides a viable and advantageous form of renal reaplcement particularly in terms of preservation of residual renal function, patient survival and quality of life, and cost among many other factors. Potential misconceptions that PD-related peritonitis and dialysis inadequacy are potentially deterrent factors for initiating PD therapy are clarified. CONCLUSION: PD is a practical and noninferior form of renal replacement that serves as an ideal bridge from conservative therapy to kidney transplantation.","Tang, Sydney C W; Lai, Kar Neng",J. nephrol,,257

457838,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of nurses in British Columbia, Canada using trends analysis across three time points: The impact of COVID-19 on nurse mental health",2021,"The application of computer vision for COVID-19 diagnosis is complex and challenging, given the risks associated with patient misclassifications. Arguably, the primary value of medical imaging for COVID-19 lies rather on patient prognosis. Radiological images can guide physicians assessing the severity of the disease, and a series of images from the same patient at different stages can help to gauge disease progression. Based on these premises, a simple method based on lung-pathology features for scoring disease severity from Chest X-rays is proposed here. As the primary contribution, this method shows to be correlated to patient severity in different stages of disease progression comparatively well when contrasted with other existing methods. An original approach for data selection is also proposed, allowing the simple model to learn the severity-related features. It is hypothesized that the resulting competitive performance presented here is related to the method being feature-based rather than reliant on lung involvement or compromise as others in the literature. The fact that it is simpler and interpretable than other end-to-end, more complex models, also sets aside this work. As the data set is small, bias-inducing artifacts that could lead to overfitting are minimized through an image normalization and lung segmentation step at the learning phase. A second contribution comes from the validation of the results, conceptualized as the scoring of patients groups from different stages of the disease. Besides performing such validation on an independent data set, the results were also compared with other proposed scoring methods in the literature.

460172,Dual impacts of coronavirus anxiety on mental health in 35 societies,2021,"At present, more than 200 countries and territories are directly affected by the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Incidence and case fatality rate are significantly higher among elderly individuals (age &gt; 60 years), type 2 diabetes and hypertension patients. Cellular receptor ACE2, serine protease TMPRSS2 and exopeptidase CD26 (also known as DPP4) are the three membrane bound proteins potentially implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesised that common variants from TMPRSS2 and CD26 may play critical role in infection susceptibility of predisposed population or group of individuals. Coding (missense) and regulatory variants from TMPRSS2 and CD26 were studied across 26 global populations. Two missense and five regulatory SNPs were identified to have differential allelic frequency. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) signature was observed in different populations. Modelled protein‒protein interaction (PPI) predicted strong molecular interaction between these two receptors and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1 domain). However, two missense SNPs, rs12329760 (TMPRSS2) and rs1129599 (CD26), were not found to be involved physically in the said interaction. Four regulatory variants (rs112657409, rs11910678, rs77675406 and rs713400) from TMPRSS2 were found to influence the expression of TMPRSS2 and pathologically relevant MX1. rs13015258 a 5′ UTR variant from CD26 have significant role in regulation of expression of key regulatory genes that could be involved in SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Overexpression of CD26 through epigenetic modification at rs13015258-C allele was found critical and could explain the higher SARS-CoV-2 infected fatality rate among type 2 diabetes.","Senapati, Sabyasachi; Kumar, Shashank; Singh, Atul K.; Banerjee, Pratibha; Bhagavatula, Sandilya",J.

There is no doubt that less developed countries such as the African ones have a weak capacity to respond. According to data provided by the WHO, UN-OCHA and other accredited sources, the spread of the Virus in the Continent appears limited compared to other areas of the Planet; the most affected country is South Africa. The governments of some countries have reacted by implementing, on the European model, procedures such as curfew (Egypt) or lockdown (South Africa and Nigeria). The research aims to develop a framework on the spread of Covid-19 in Africa and the socio-economic impact of the measures implemented in the emergency. Another aim is to highlight the changes in the socio-anthropological aspects, considering that many African societies define themselves on the basis of ethnicity, interaction with other communities and therefore social distancing measures will not be as effective as elsewhere.","Varani, Nicoletta; Bernardini, Enrico",Documenti Geografici,,257

As the pandemic continues, many companies have increased their corporate report disclosures so that stakeholders can have a comprehensive view on how the companies create value as well as impacts faced beyond the companies. It is expected that integrated reporting is able to provide relevant information to stakeholders. Integrated reporting produces financial and non-financial information into a single report which is much better than the traditional corporate reporting. Content analysis using published annual reports will be applied on Malaysian public listed companies to examine the relationship between integrated reporting and firm performance. This study proposes that firm performance of companies can be improved with the adoption of integrated reporting disclosures. Furthermore, the moderating effects of board gender diversity and family firms could also impact on the integrated reporting disclosures as well as firm performance. This study also provides a clear picture on the level of integrated reporting practices on Malaysian public listed companies. Therefore, integrated reporting is a precious approach to aid the company management team to enhance company’s information disclosure.

Although much has been learned about the clinical course, prognostic inflammatory markers, and disease complications of COVID-19, the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the thyroid is poorly understood. In contrast to SARS-CoV-1, limited available evidence indicates there is no pathological evidence of thyroid injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, subacute thyroiditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been reported for the first time. Thyroid dysfunction is common in patients with COVID-19 infection. By contrast, certain thyroid diseases may have a negative impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19. In addition, some anti-COVID-19 agents may cause thyroid injury or affect its metabolism. COVID-19 and thyroid disease may mutually aggravate the disease burden. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection should not ignore the effect on thyroid function, especially when there are obvious related symptoms. In addition, patients with thyroid diseases should follow specific management principles during the epidemic period.","Chen, Wenjie; Tian, Yuang; Li, Zhihui; Zhu, Jingqiang; Wei, Tao; Lei, Jianyong",Endocrinology,,257

However, systemic respiratory vaccines generally provide limited protection against viral replication and shedding within the airway, as this requires a local mucosal secretory IgA response. Indeed, preclinical studies of adenovirus and mRNA candidate vaccines demonstrated persistent virus in nasal swabs despite preventing COVID-19. This suggests that systemically vaccinated patients, while asymptomatic, may still be become infected and transmit live virus from the upper airway. COVID-19 is known to spread through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Furthermore, significant evidence has shown that many clinic and surgical endonasal procedures are aerosol generating. Until further knowledge is acquired regarding mucosal immunity following systemic vaccination, otolaryngology providers should maintain precautions against viral transmission to protect the proportion of persistently vulnerable patients who exhibit subtotal vaccine efficacy or waning immunity or who defer vaccination.","Bleier, Benjamin S; Ramanathan, Murugappan; Lane, Andrew P",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,257

464414,Supporting Hispanic/Latinx Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Brief Report,2020,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral microbleeds are increasingly reported in critical ill patients with respiratory failure in need of mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Typically, these critical illness-associated microbleeds involve the juxtacortical white matter and corpus callosum. Recently, this pattern was reported in patients with respiratory failure, suffering from COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we listed patients from March 11, 2020 to September 2, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, critical illness and cerebral microbleeds. Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on Pubmed databases on critical illness-associated microbleeds and cerebral microbleeds described in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: On 279 COVID-19 admissions, two cases of cerebral microbleeds were detected in critical ill patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Based on review of existing literature critical illness-associated microbleeds tend to predominate in subcortical white matter and corpus callosum. Cerebral microbleeds in patients with COVID-19 tend to follow similar patterns as reported in critical illness-associated microbleeds. Hence, one patient with typical critical illness-associated microbleeds and COVID-19 is reported. However, a new pattern of widespread cortico-juxtacortical microbleeds, predominantly in the anterior vascular territory with relative sparing of deep gray matter, corpus callosum and infratentorial structures is documented in a second case. The possible etiologies of these microbleeds include hypoxia, hemorrhagic diathesis, brain endothelial erythrophagocytosis and/or cytokinopathies. An association with COVID-19 remains to be determined. CONCLUSION: Further systematic investigation of microbleed patterns in patients with neurological impairment and COVID-19 is necessary.","Toeback, Jonas; Depoortere, Sofie Dr; Vermassen, Joris; Vereecke, Elke Lh; Van Driessche, Veroniek; Hemelsoet, Dimitri M",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,257

COVID-19 spreads all over 268 countries, and more than 70 000 people got infected till February 23th, 2020. COVID-19 can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure due to its strong infectivity and extensive spread. These severe complications are believed to be the consequence of cytokine storm caused by the virus infection. In the “Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia”, glucocorticoid is recommended as the immunosuppressive agents to prevent acute immune reaction in critical patients. However, the usage of glucocorticoid may bring severe residual effects such as superinfection risks, prolonged course of disease. Traditional Chinese medicine might have advantages in the moderation of immune system. Actually, TCM is now applied in the treatment of COVID-19 clinically, and exhibits excellent therapeutic effects. In this review, the potential usage of TCM or traditional prescriptions in inhibiting cytokine storm and treating in acute lung injury were analyzed, which would be an effective strategy for the treatment of COVID-19.","He, Li-Li; Gong, Pu-Yang; Feng, Yue; Zou, Wei; Wang, En-Long; Gu, Jian",Chin.

We constructed a machine learning model for COVID-19 diagnosis that was based and cross-validated on the routine blood tests of 5333 patients with various bacterial and viral infections, and 160 COVID-19-positive patients. We selected the operational ROC point at a sensitivity of 81.9% and a specificity of 97.9%. The cross-validated AUC was 0.97. The five most useful routine blood parameters for COVID-19 diagnosis according to the feature importance scoring of the XGBoost algorithm were: MCHC, eosinophil count, albumin, INR, and prothrombin activity percentage. t-SNE visualization showed that the blood parameters of the patients with a severe COVID-19 course are more like the parameters of a bacterial than a viral infection. The reported diagnostic accuracy is at least comparable and probably complementary to RT-PCR and chest CT studies. Patients with fever, cough, myalgia, and other symptoms can now have initial routine blood tests assessed by our diagnostic tool. All patients with a positive COVID-19 prediction would then undergo standard RT-PCR studies to confirm the diagnosis.

The symptoms of COVID-19 vary from mild to severe among different age groups, but the physiological changes related to COVID-19 are barely understood. METHODS: In the present study, a high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based lipidomic strategy was used to characterize the endogenous plasma lipids for cured COVID-19 patients with different ages and symptoms. These patients were further divided into two groups: those with severe symptoms or who were elderly and relatively young patients with mild symptoms. In addition, automated lipidomic identification and alignment was conducted by LipidSearch software. Multivariate and univariate analyses were used for differential comparison. RESULTS: Nearly 500 lipid compounds were identified in each cured COVID-19 group through LipidSearch software. At the level of lipid subclasses, patients with severe symptoms or elderly patients displayed dramatic changes in plasma lipidomic alterations, such as increased triglycerides and decreased cholesteryl esters (ChE). Some of these differential lipids might also have essential biological functions. Furthermore, the differential analysis of plasma lipids among groups was performed to provide potential prognostic indicators, and the change in signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Dyslipidemia was observed in cured COVID-19 patients due to the viral infection and medical treatment, and the discharged patients should continue to undergo consolidation therapy. This work provides valuable knowledge about plasma lipid markers and potential therapeutic targets of COVID-19 and essential resources for further research on the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Bai, Yunpeng; Huang, Wendong; Li, Yaocai; Lai, Changchun; Huang, Sumei; Wang, Guangwen; He, Yuemei; Hu, Linhui; Chen, Chunbo",Biosci. rep,,257

This study aims to analyze the role of probiotics on severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In the current retrospective single-center study, we collected data of 311 consecutive severe patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 3rd to Feb 20th, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and medication characteristics were compared and analyzed between patients with or without probiotics. RESULTS: In total, 93 of the 123 patients (75.61%) who were treated with probiotics survived to hospital discharge with the median inpatient day of 32 days and mean virus clearance time of 23 days, which were significantly longer than those of patients without probiotics. There were no bias in laboratory parameters, except for IL-6 and ESR, which were significantly higher in patients treated probiotics. We tracked the dynamic changes of 8 selected laboratory parameters (IL-6, CRP, total T lymphocytes, NK cells, B lymphocyte, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and CD4/CD8 ratio) and found that probiotics could not reduce the increased IL-6 levels but possessed the ability to moderate the immunity and decreased the incidence of secondary infection in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics could be an effective strategy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients to reduce the secondary infection and moderated the immunity.","Li, Q.; Cheng, F.; Xu, Q.; Su, Y.; Cai, X.; Zeng, F.; Zhang, Y.",International Immunopharmacology,,257

Little is known about the impact of co-use on the developing brain. OBJECTIVES: Preliminary investigation of the effects of nicotine on white matter (WM) cerebral blood flow (CBF) in adolescents/young adults and its potential moderation by cannabis use. METHODS: Adolescent/young adult (16-22 years old) nicotine and tobacco product users (NTP; N = 37) and non-nicotine users (non-NTP; N = 26) underwent a neuroimaging session comprised of anatomical, optimized pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling, and diffusion tensor imaging scans. Groups were compared on whole-brain WM CBF estimates and their relation to past-year cannabis use. Follow-up analyses assessed correlations between identified CBF clusters and corresponding fractional anisotropy (FA) values. RESULTS: Group by cannabis effects were observed in five clusters (voxel-wise alpha < 0.001, cluster-wise alpha < 0.05; &#8805; 11 contiguous voxels): non-NTP exhibited positive correlations between CBF and cannabis use in all clusters, whereas no significant relationships were observed for NTP. Greater CBF extracted from one cluster (including portions of right superior longitudinal fasciculus) was associated with reduced FA for non-NTP group only. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first investigation of WM health as indexed by CBF, and its association with FA, in adolescents/young adults with nicotine and/or cannabis use. Results suggest that cannabis use by itself may be related to increased CBF in WM fiber tracts demonstrating poorer structural intergrity, yet the occurrence of even infrequent NTP use (greater than once per month) appears to diminish this relationship.","Courtney, Kelly E; Baca, Rachel; Doran, Neal; Jacobson, Aaron; Liu, Thomas T; Jacobus, Joanna",Psychopharmacology,,257

Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the ß-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide valuable insights on the molecular basis of the specificity of ß-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptor adaptation of circulating and future novel ß-CoVs.","Pontes, Camila; Ruiz-Serra, Victoria; Lepore, Rosalba; Valencia, Alfonso",,,257

484360,"Implications of COVID-19-induced nationwide lockdown on children's behaviour in Punjab, India",2020,"SARS-CoV-2 entry requires sequential cleavage of the spike glycoprotein at the S1/S2 and the S2' cleavage sites to mediate membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic insertion (PRRAR) at the S1/S2 cleavage site that can be cleaved by furin. Using lentiviral pseudotypes and a cell-culture-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with an S1/S2 deletion, we show that the polybasic insertion endows SARS-CoV-2 with a selective advantage in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cells, but impairs replication in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. Using engineered spike variants and live virus competition assays and by measuring growth kinetics, we find that the selective advantage in lung and primary human airway epithelial cells depends on the expression of the cell surface protease TMPRSS2, which enables endosome-independent virus entry by a route that avoids antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the S1/S2 furin cleavage site was shed to lower titres from infected ferrets and was not transmitted to cohoused sentinel animals, unlike wild-type virus. Analysis of 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences derived from patients and 24 human postmortem tissues showed low frequencies of naturally occurring mutants that harbour deletions at the polybasic site. Taken together, our findings reveal that the furin cleavage site is an important determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Peacock, Thomas P; Goldhill, Daniel H; Zhou, Jie; Baillon, Laury; Frise, Rebecca; Swann, Olivia C; Kugathasan, Ruthiran; Penn, Rebecca; Brown, Jonathan C; Sanchez-David, Raul Y; Braga, Luca; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Hassard, Jack A; Staller, Ecco; Hanley, Brian; Osborn, Michael; Giacca, Mauro; Davidson, Andrew D; Matthews, David A; Barclay, Wendy S",Nat Microbiol,,257

If the viral outbreak has exposed gross inadequacies in the healthcare systems of nations both rich and poor, it has stirred a digital healthcare revolution that has been building since the past decade. We have seen how this new era of digital health evolved over the years since healthcare started getting increasingly unaffordable in the western countries forcing a relook in their strategies to explosion of digital innovations in mobile telephony and applications, internet, wearable devices, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data and genomics. The single biggest trigger for the digital shift has indeed been the COVID-19 pandemic this year, more so in India with astonishing response from the private enterprise and the proactive push from the government so evident. However, the full potential of this digital revolution cannot be realized as long as core structural reforms in public healthcare do not take place along with significant boost in digital infrastructure. The way digital technologies have helped facilitate strategy and response to the global pandemic and with predictions of more zoonotic outbreaks impending in the coming years, it has become imperative for the world to increasingly adopt and integrate digital innovations to make healthcare more accessible, interconnected and affordable.","Seethalakshmi, S; Nandan, Rahul",J Indian Inst Sci,,257

486377,Can remotely supervised exercise positively affect self-reported depressive symptoms and physical activity levels during social distancing?,2021,"Human respiratory virus infections lead to a spectrum of respiratory symptoms and disease severity, contributing to substantial morbidity, mortality and economic losses worldwide, as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. Belonging to diverse families, respiratory viruses differ in how easy they spread (transmissibility) and the mechanism (modes) of transmission. Transmissibility as estimated by the basic reproduction number (R0) or secondary attack rate is heterogeneous for the same virus. Respiratory viruses can be transmitted via four major modes of transmission: direct (physical) contact, indirect contact (fomite), (large) droplets and (fine) aerosols. We know little about the relative contribution of each mode to the transmission of a particular virus in different settings, and how its variation affects transmissibility and transmission dynamics. Discussion on the particle size threshold between droplets and aerosols and the importance of aerosol transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is ongoing. Mechanistic evidence supports the efficacies of non-pharmaceutical interventions with regard to virus reduction; however, more data are needed on their effectiveness in reducing transmission. Understanding the relative contribution of different modes to transmission is crucial to inform the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the population. Intervening against multiple modes of transmission should be more effective than acting on a single mode.","Leung, Nancy H L",Nat. rev. microbiol,,257

486926,Longitudinal Evidence of How Media Audiences Differ in Public Health Perceptions and Behaviors During a Global Pandemic,2020,"Biofouling is among the key factors slowing down healing of acute and chronic wounds. Here we report both anti-biofilm and wound-healing properties of the chitosan-immobilized Ficin. The proposed chitosan-adsorption approach allowed preserving ~90% of the initial total activity of the enzyme (when using azocasein as a substrate) with stabilization factor of 4.9, and ~70% of its specific enzymatic activity. In vitro, the chitosan-immobilized Ficin degraded staphylococcal biofilms, this way increasing the efficacy of antimicrobials against biofilm-embedded bacteria. In vivo, in the presence of Ficin (either soluble or immobilized), the S. aureus-infected skin wound areas in rats reduced twofold after 4 instead of 6â¯days of treatment. Moreover, topical application of the immobilized enzyme resulted in a 3-log reduction of S. aureus cell count on the wound surfaces in 6â¯days, compared to more than 10â¯days required to achieve the same effect in control. Additional advantages include smoother reepithelisation, and new tissue formation exhibiting collagen structure characteristics closely reminiscent of those observed in the native tissue. Taken together, our data suggest that both soluble and immobilized Ficin appear beneficial for the treatment of biofilm-associated infections, as well as speeding up wound healing and microbial decontamination.","Baidamshina, Diana R; Koroleva, Victoria A; Trizna, Elena Yu; Pankova, Svetlana M; Agafonova, Mariya N; Chirkova, Milana N; Vasileva, Olga S; Akhmetov, Nafis; Shubina, Valeriya V; Porfiryev, Andrey G; Semenova, Elena V; Sachenkov, Oskar A; Bogachev, Mikhail I; Artyukhov, Valeriy G; Baltina, Tatyana V; Holyavka, Marina G; Kayumov, Airat R",Int. j. biol. macromol,,257

METHODS: A total of 155 cured COVID-19 patients admitted to designated hospitals in Yunnan Province, China, from February 1, 2020, to March 20, 2020, were included. All patients underwent pulmonary CT at discharge and at 2 weeks after discharge (during reexamination at hospital). A retrospective analysis was performed using these two pulmonary CT scans of the cured patients to observe changes in the number, distribution, morphology, and density of lesions. RESULTS: At discharge, the lung CT images of 15 cured patients showed no obvious lesions, while those of the remaining 140 patients showed different degrees of residual lesions. Patients with moderate disease mostly had multiple pulmonary lesions, mainly in the lower lobes of both lungs. At reexamination, the lung lesions in the patients with moderate disease had significantly improved (P<0.05), and the lung lesions in the patients with severe disease had partially improved, especially in patients with multi-lobe involvement (&#967; 2 =3.956, P<0.05). At reexamination, the lung lesions of patients with severe disease did not show significant changes (P>0.05).

Although significant effort has been invested in identifying antibodies that block infection, the ability of antibodies to target infected cells through Fc interactions may be vital to eliminate the virus. To explore the role of Fc activity in SARS-CoV-2 immunity, the functional potential of a cross-SARS-reactive antibody, CR3022, was assessed. CR3022 was able to broadly drive antibody effector functions, providing critical immune clearance at entry and upon egress. Using selectively engineered Fc variants, no protection was observed after administration of WT IgG1 in mice or hamsters. Conversely, the functionally enhanced Fc variant resulted in increased pathology in both the mouse and hamster models, causing weight loss in mice and enhanced viral replication and weight loss in the more susceptible hamster model, highlighting the pathological functions of Fc-enhancing mutations. These data point to the critical need for strategic Fc engineering for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Atyeo, Caroline; Slein, Matthew D; Fischinger, Stephanie; Burke, John; Schäfer, Alexandra; Leist, Sarah R; Kuzmina, Natalia A; Mire, Chad; Honko, Anna; Johnson, Rebecca; Storm, Nadia; Bernett, Matthew; Tong, Pei; Zuo, Teng; Lin, Junrui; Zuiani, Adam; Linde, Caitlyn; Suscovich, Todd; Wesemann, Duane R; Griffiths, Anthony; Desjarlais, John R; Juelg, Boris D; Goudsmit, Jaap; Bukreyev, Alexander; Baric, Ralph; Alter, Galit",JCI insight,,257

490641,Digital phenotyping to enhance substance use treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic: Viewpoint,2020,"The reuse of preexisting small molecules for a novel emerging disease threat is a rapid measure to discover unknown applications for previously validated therapies. A pertinent and recent example where such a strategy could be employed is in the fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therapies designed or discovered to target viral proteins also have off-target effects on the host proteome when employed in a complex physiological environment. This study aims to assess these host cell targets for a panel of FDA-approved antiviral compounds including remdesivir, using the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) coupled with mass spectrometry (CETSA MS) in noninfected cells. CETSA MS is a powerful method to delineate direct and indirect interactions between small molecules and protein targets in intact cells. Biologically active compounds can induce changes in thermal stability, in their primary binding partners, and in proteins that in turn interact with the direct targets. Such engagement of host targets by antiviral drugs may contribute to the clinical effect against the virus but can also constitute a liability. We present here a comparative study of CETSA molecular target engagement fingerprints of antiviral drugs to better understand the link between off-targets and efficacy.","Friman, Tomas; Chernobrovkin, Alexey; Martinez Molina, Daniel; Arnold, Laurence",SLAS Discov,,257

METHODS: Online-based survey. RESULTS: A total of 1190 questionnaires were (partly) answered. With respect to outpatient care and consultations from 15 March to 15 April 2020, a total of 69 (5.8%) participants indicated unlimited, 756 (63.5%) reduced and 330 (27.7%) emergency care only, independent of the type of institution. Outpatient surgery was restricted to emergency surgery in 68% of clinics, 42.0% of inpatient wards, 45.0% of surgical medical care centers and group practices and 33.0% of private practices. Inpatient procedures were limited to emergency care in 75.0% of inpatient wards and in 71.0% of clinics. With the exception of endophthalmitis (+8.2%), the number of urgent indications and emergencies declined: retinal detachment (-34.8%), perforating eyeball injuries (-7.3%), acute glaucoma (-17.8%), central retinal artery occlusion and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (-31.0%), others (-30.9%), penetrating keratoplasty and amniotic membrane transplantation (-59.1%). Institutional or professional policy requirements (76.0%) and appointment cancellation by patients (84.0%) were the most common reasons for limitations in ophthalmic patient care. CONCLUSION: The initial phase of the pandemic was characterized by a massive reduction in non-urgent conservative and surgical treatment that affected all areas of ophthalmology. Due to intensive care capacities required for COVID-19 patients, inpatient treatment was largely restricted to emergencies. Treatment of ophthalmological patients, including ocular emergencies and urgent treatment, was maintained across all sectors with a (considerable) decrease in the number of cases even in these groups.","Hattenbach, Lars-Olof; Heinz, Peter; Feltgen, Nicolas; Hoerauf, Hans; Kohnen, Thomas; Priglinger, Siegfried; Bachmann, Werner; Rieks, Johannes; Eter, Nicole; Reinhard, Thomas",Ophthalmologe,,257

492578,Supporting Adolescents and Young Adults Exposed to or Experiencing Violence During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Podoplanin is a small transmembrane mucin-like glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the development of the lung, heart and lymphatic vascular system. Its expression is upregulated in several types of human carcinomas and podoplanin levels in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the oral cavity and the lung correlate with cancer invasiveness, lymph node metastasis and shorter survival time of patients, indicating that podoplanin promotes tumor progression. However, its role during the early stages of carcinogenesis remain unclear. We generated mice with a specific deletion of podoplanin in epidermal keratinocytes (K5-Cre;Pdpnflox/flox mice) and subjected them to a multistep chemical skin carcinogenesis regimen. The rate of tumor initiation; the number, size and differentiation of tumors; and the malignant transformation rate were comparable in K5-Cre;Pdpnflox/flox mice and Pdpnflox/flox control mice. However, tumor cell invasion was reduced in K5-Cre;Pdpnflox/flox mice, in particular single cell invasion. Quantitative immunofluorescence analyses revealed that peritumoral lymphangiogenesis was reduced in K5-Cre;Pdpnflox/flox mice, whereas there were no major changes of tumor-associated immune cell subpopulations. Thus, keratinocyte-expressed podoplanin is dispensable for the early steps of skin carcinogenesis but contributes to the progression of established tumors.","Sesartic, Marko; Ikenberg, Kristian; Yoon, Sun-Young; Detmar, Michael",,,257

This review examines the global impact of COVID-19 pandemic on incidence of STEMI admissions, and relationship between the pandemic and door-to-balloon time (D2B), all-cause mortality and other secondary STEMI outcomes. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to primarily compare D2B time and in-hospital mortality of STEMI patients who underwent primary PCI during and before the pandemic. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the influence of geographical region and income status of a country on STEMI care. An online database search included studies comparing the aforementioned outcomes between STEMI patients during and before the pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 32 articles were analyzed. Overall, 19,140 and 68,662 STEMI patients underwent primary PCI during and before the pandemic respectively. Significant delay in D2B was observed during the pandemic (WMD=8.10mins; CI:3.90-12.30mins; p=0.0002, I2=90%). In-hospital mortality was higher during the pandemic (OR=1.27; CI:1.09-1.49; p=0.002, I2=36%), however this varied with factors such as geographical location and income status of a country. Subgroup analysis found that low-middle income countries observed a higher rate of mortality during the pandemic (OR=1.52; CI:1.13-2.05; p=0.006), with a similar but insignificant trend seen among the high income countries (OR=1.17; CI:0.95-1.44; p=0.13).

The PAX components, also known as evidence-based kernels, are proposed to be useful in classrooms, families, organizations, criminal justice, and in improving public discussion and government. Kernels affect behavior in the short- and long-term through combinations of antecedents, reinforcers, relational networks, and physiological effects. Identifying common strategies, tools, and clear targets of change is suggested as a way to work towards evolving freely available evidence-based tools that can be combined to improve social conditions in multiple contexts.","Johansson, Magnus; Biglan, Anthony; Embry, Dennis",Clin. child fam. psychol. rev,,257

We aimed to determine COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate in HCWs people in France. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous survey from the March 26th to July 2nd 2020. Primary endpoint was the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine was available. RESULTS: Two thousand and forty-seven HCWs answered the survey; women accounted for 74% of respondents. Among respondents, 1.554 (76.9%, 95 %CI 75.1-78.9) would accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Older age, male gender, fear about COVID-19, individual perceived risk and flu vaccination during previous season were associated with hypothetic COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Nurses and assistant nurses were less prone to get vaccinated against COVID-19 than physicians. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Flu vaccine rate was 57.3 % during the previous season, and 54.6 % of the respondents had intention to get flu vaccine during the next season. CONCLUSIONS: Intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 reached 75% in HCWs with discrepancies between occupational categories. COVID-19 pandemic had no positive effect on flu vaccine acceptance rate.","Gagneux-Brunon, Amandine; Detoc, Maëlle; Bruel, Sébastien; Tardy, Bernard; Rozaire, Olivier; Frappe, Paul; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth",J. hosp. infect,,257

499837,Stress and resilience of paediatric healthcare workers during COVID-19,2021,"In response to reports of people experiencing varying levels of anxiety and depression during the outbreak of COVID-19, researchers have argued that exposure to related information on social media is a salient contributing factor. Based on the integrated model of ruminative response style and the diathesis-stress model, it has been suggested that incorporating rumination and mindfulness may elucidate the potential mechanism underlying the aforementioned association. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of rumination and the moderating role of mindfulness in the association between social media exposure (SME) to COVID-19 information and psychological distress. The results from online questionnaire responses of 439 college students from two universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, showed that rumination mediated the association between SME and psychological distress. Furthermore, mindfulness was revealed as a protective factor that buffered the adverse effect of SME on psychological distress through rumination. These findings advance a better understanding of the formation process of psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide insights regarding effective interventions for adverse mental health consequences in college students.","Hong, Wei; Liu, Ru-De; Ding, Yi; Fu, Xinchen; Zhen, Rui; Sheng, Xiaotian",Cyberpsychology behav. soc. netw.

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a prospective observational cohort study of 124 children hospitalized and treated under the institutional MIS-C Task Force protocol from March-September 2020 at Children's National, a quaternary freestanding Children's Hospital in Washington DC. Of this cohort, 63 of the patients had the diagnosis of MIS-C (39 confirmed, 24 probable) and 61 were from the same cohort of admitted patients who subsequently had an alternative diagnosis (controls). RESULTS: Median age and sex were similar between MIS-C and controls. Black (46%) and Latino (35%) children were overrepresented in the MIS-C cohort, with Black children at highest risk (OR 4.62, 95% CI 1.151-14.10; P = .007). Cardiac complications were more frequent in critically ill MIS-C (55% vs. 28%; p=0.04) including systolic myocardial dysfunction (39% vs. 3%; p=0.001), and valvular regurgitation (33% vs. 7%; p=0.01). Median cycle threshold (Ct) was 31.8 (27.95--35.1 IQR) in MIS-C cases, significantly higher (indicating lower viral load) than in primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cytokines siL2R, IL10, and IL-6 were higher in MIS-C compared with controls. Cytokine analysis revealed sub-phenotype differences between critically ill vs. noncritically ill (IL-2, sIL2R, IL-10, Il-6); PCR positive vs. negative (TNF-&#945;, IL10, IL-6), and presence vs. absence of cardiac abnormalities (IL-17). Phylogenetic analysis of viral genome sequences revealed predominance of GH clade originating in Europe, with no differences comparing MIS-C with primary COVID patients. Treatment was well tolerated, and no children died. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a well-characterized large cohort of MIS-C treated following a standardized protocol and identifies key clinical, biomarker, cytokine, viral load, and sequencing features. Long term follow up will provide opportunity for future insights into MIS-C and its sequelae.","DeBiasi, Roberta L; Harahsheh, Ashraf S; Srinivasalu, Hemalatha; Krishnan, Anita; Sharron, Matthew P; Parikh, Kavita; Smith, Karen; Bell, Michael; Michael, Drew; Delaney, Meghan; Campos, Joseph; Vilain, Eric; LoTiempo, Jonathan; Kline, Jaclyn N; Ronis, Tova; Majumdar, Suvankar; Sadler, Eleanor; Conway, Susan R; Berul, Charles L; Sule, Sangeeta; Lahoz, Rebeca; Ansusinha, Emily; Pershad, Jay; Bundy, Vanessa; Wells, Elizabeth; Bost, James E; Wessel, David",J. pediatr.

This study developed a wearable plantar pressure force measurement and analysis (WPPFMA) system based on a flexible sensor matrix film to monitor plantar pressure force in real time. The developed system comprised a flexible sensor matrix film embedded in the insole of the shoe, a wearable data acquisition (DAQ) device with a Bluetooth module, and dedicated software with an intuitive graphical user interface for displaying the plantar pressure force data from receivers by using a terminal unit (laptop or smart-phone). The flexible sensor matrix film integrated 16 piezoresistive cell sensors to detect pressure force at different anatomical zones of the plantar and under different body positions. The signals from the flexible sensor matrix film were collected using the DAQ module embedded in the shoe and transmitted to the receivers through Bluetooth. The real-time display and analysis software can monitor, visualize, and record the detailed plantar pressure force data, such as average pressure force, maximum pressure force, and pressure force distributions and variations over time. The outcomes of the trials in which the system was worn revealed the applicability of the developed WPPFMA system for monitoring plantar pressure force under static and dynamic wearing conditions. The plantar pressure force data derived from this system provide valuable insights for personal foot care, gait analysis, and clinical diagnosis.","Zhao, Shumi; Liu, Rong; Fei, Chengwei; Zia, Abdul Wasy; Jing, Lingxiao",PLoS One,,257

In this cross-sectional comparative study, our objective is to compare the depression and anxiety symptoms in elderly COVID-19 survivors with a control group. METHOD: 69 elderly COVID-19 survivors (age 65 or older) within 2 weeks post-discharge were assessed for anxiety and depression symptoms by a package of self-rating scales (Geriatric Anxiety Scale-10 (GAS-10), Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) and General Health Questionar-28 (GHQ-28)). Their scores were compared with a group of aged-matched residents without COVID-19 in their community. RESULTS: The mean scores on GAS-10, GDS-15 and GHQ-28 in the COVID-19 survivors group and control group were 12.06 vs. 6.53 (p < .001), 12.48 vs. 5.73 (p < .001), 52.7 vs. 29.8 (p < .001), respectively. All of the COVID-19 survivors and 60% of the controls had scores in the pathological range of GHQ-28 scale. A total of 93.2% of COVID-19 survivors revealed anxiety symptoms in GAS-10 scale. This rate was 60% in the control group. A total of 86.6% of COVID-19 survivors compared to 46.6% of the controls reported symptoms of depression in GDS-15 scale. CONCLUSION: The rate of depression and anxiety symptoms in elderly COVID-19 survivors and controls found to be high during the pandemic.

506527,Considerations for assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in Australia,2020,"BACKGROUND: One-third of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions for pediatric acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are inappropriate. We evaluated a distance learning program's effectiveness for reducing outpatient antibiotic prescribing for ARTI visits. METHODS: In this stepped-wedge clinical trial run from November 2015 to June 2018, we randomly assigned 19 pediatric practices belonging to the Pediatric Research in Office Settings Network or the NorthShore University HealthSystem to 4 wedges. Visits for acute otitis media, bronchitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and upper respiratory infection for children 6 months to <11 years old without recent antibiotic use were included. Clinicians received the intervention as 3 program modules containing online tutorials and webinars on evidence-based communication strategies and antibiotic prescribing, booster video vignettes, and individualized antibiotic prescribing feedback reports over 11 months. The primary outcome was overall antibiotic prescribing rates for all ARTI visits. Mixed-effects logistic regression compared prescribing rates during each program module and a postintervention period to a baseline control period. Odds ratios were converted to adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) for interpretability. RESULTS: Among 72 723 ARTI visits by 29 762 patients, intention-to-treat analyses revealed a 7% decrease in the probability of antibiotic prescribing for ARTI overall between the baseline and postintervention periods (aRR 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-0.96). Second-line antibiotic prescribing decreased for streptococcal pharyngitis (aRR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-0.87) and sinusitis (aRR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44-0.77) but not for acute otitis media (aRR 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83-1.03). Any antibiotic prescribing decreased for viral ARTIs (aRR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.51-0.70).

The latter is a multiplicative version of the Kullback-Leibler distance, with values between 0 and 1. For product measures and self-similar phenomena, it does not depend on the measurement level. Hence, C is an alternative to Gini's concentration coefficient for measures with variation on different levels. Simple examples concern population density and gross domestic product. Application to time series patterns is indicated with a Markov chain. For the Covid-19 pandemic, entropy ratios indicate a homogeneous distribution of infections and the potential of local action when compared to measures for a whole region.","Bandt, Christoph",,,257
507927,Associations of risk perception of COVID-19 with emotion and mental health during the pandemic,2021,"When effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, home quarantine and far-reaching shutdown of public life are the only available strategies to prevent the spread of epidemics. Based on an extended SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and continuous-time optimal control theory, we compute the optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy for the case that a vaccine is never found and complete containment (eradication of the epidemic) is impossible. In this case, the optimal control must meet competing requirements: First, the minimization of disease-related deaths, and, second, the establishment of a sufficient degree of natural immunity at the end of the measures, in order to exclude a second wave. Moreover, the socio-economic costs of the intervention shall be kept at a minimum. The numerically computed optimal control strategy is a single-intervention scenario that goes beyond heuristically motivated interventions and simple “flattening of the curve”. Careful analysis of the computed control strategy reveals, however, that the obtained solution is in fact a tightrope walk close to the stability boundary of the system, where socio-economic costs and the risk of a new outbreak must be constantly balanced against one another. The model system is calibrated to reproduce the initial exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.","Kantner, Markus; Koprucki, Thomas",J. Math. Ind.,,257

One of the major challenges of acute viral infections is the treatment of advanced disease. Thus, extending the window of therapeutic intervention is critical. Here, we explore the benefit of combination therapy with a mAb and remdesivir in a non-human primate model of Marburg virus (MARV) disease. While rhesus monkeys are protected against lethal infection when treatment with either a human mAb (MR186-YTE; 100%), or remdesivir (80%), is initiated 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) with MARV, no animals survive when either treatment is initiated alone beginning 6 dpi. However, by combining MR186-YTE with remdesivir beginning 6 dpi, significant protection (80%) is achieved, thereby extending the therapeutic window. These results suggest value in exploring combination therapy in patients presenting with advanced filovirus disease.","Cross, Robert W; Bornholdt, Zachary A; Prasad, Abhishek N; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Agans, Krystle N; Deer, Daniel J; Abelson, Dafna M; Kim, Do H; Shestowsky, William S; Campbell, Lioudmila A; Bunyan, Elaine; Geisbert, Joan B; Fenton, Karla A; Zeitlin, Larry; Porter, Danielle P; Geisbert, Thomas W",Nat Commun,,257

A huge number of people are infected by this deadly virus and the number is still getting increased day by day. At this time, no specific vaccines or treatments of COVID-19 are found. Numerous ways are offered to detect COVID-19 such as swab test, CDC and RT-PCR tests. All of them can detect corona virus in different ways but they are not recommended by the reason of their limited availability, inaccurate results, high false-negative rate predicates, high cost and time consuming. Hence, medical radiography and Computer Tomography (CT) images were suggested as the next best alternative of RT -PCR and other tests for detecting Covid-19 cases. Recent studies found that patients with COVID-19 cases are present abnormalities in chest X-Ray images. Motivated by this, many researchers propose deep learning systems for COVID-19 detection. Although, these developed AI systems have shown quite promising results in terms of accuracy, they are closed source and unavailable to the research community. Therefore, in the present work, we introduced a deep convolutional neural network design (SAARSNet) designed to detect COVID-19 cases from chest X-Ray images. 1292 X-Ray images have been used to train and test the proposed model. the images have been collected from two open-source datasets. The input images are progressively resized into (220 by 150 by 3) in order to decrease the training time of the system and improve the performance of the SAARSNet architecture. Furthermore, we also investigate how SAARSNet makes predictions under three different scenarios with the aim of distinguishing COVID-19 class from both Normal and Abnormal classes as well as gaining deeper perceptions into critical factors related to COVID-19 cases. We also used the confusion metrics for evaluating the performance of SAARSNet CNN in an attempt to measure the true and false identifications of the classes from the tested images. With the proposed architecture promising results has been achieved in all of the three different scenarios. Although, there are some misclassified cases of COVID-19, the corresponding performance was best in detecting both Normal and Abnormal cases correctly. Furthermore, in the three classes scenario, normal class has been achieved 100% positive predictive value while optimistic results have been investigated in detecting COVID-19 and abnormal classes. © 2020 IEEE.","Abdulla, H.

510424,The COVID-19 outbreak: Impact on mental health and intervention strategies,2020,"Social isolation has adverse effects on mental health, physical exercise, and dietary habits. This longitudinal observational study aimed to investigate the effects of mood states and exercise on nutritional choices, on 176 college students (92 males, 84 females; 23 ± 4 years old) during the COVID-19 lockdown. During 21 days, nutrition and exercise were daily monitored, and the mood states assessed. A factor analysis was used to reduce the number of nutritional variables collected. The relationships between exercise, mood and nutrition were investigated using a multivariate general linear model and a mediation model. Seven factors were found, reflecting different nutritional choices. Exercise was positively associated with fruit, vegetables and fish consumption (p = 0.004). Depression and quality of life were, directly and inversely, associated with cereals, legumes (p = 0.005; p = 0.004) and low-fat meat intake (p = 0.040; p = 0.004). Exercise mediated the effect of mood states on fruit, vegetables and fish consumption, respectively, accounting for 4.2% and 1.8% of the total variance. Poorer mood states possibly led to unhealthy dietary habits, which can themselves be linked to negative mood levels. Exercise led to healthier nutritional choices, and mediating the effects of mood states, it might represent a key measure in uncommon situations, such as home-confinement.","Amatori, Stefano; Donati Zeppa, Sabrina; Preti, Antonio; Gervasi, Marco; Gobbi, Erica; Ferrini, Fabio; Rocchi, Marco B L; Baldari, Carlo; Perroni, Fabrizio; Piccoli, Giovanni; Stocchi, Vilberto; Sestili, Piero; Sisti, Davide",Nutrients,,257
510882,An observational study of the impact of COVID-19 and the rapid implementation of telehealth on community mental health center providers,2021,"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis, the handling of biological samples from confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals demanded the use of inactivation protocols to ensure laboratory operators' safety. While not standardized, these practices can be roughly divided into two categories, namely heat inactivation and solvent-detergent treatments. These routine procedures should also apply to samples intended for Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) analysis. Assessing the impact of virus-inactivating pre-treatments is therefore of pivotal importance, given the well-known variability introduced by different pre-analytical steps on downstream EVs isolation and analysis. Arguably, shared guidelines on inactivation protocols tailored to best address EVs-specific requirements will be needed among the analytical community, yet deep investigations in this direction have not yet been reported. We here provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 inactivation practices to be adopted prior to serum EVs analysis by comparing solvent/detergent treatment vs. heat inactivation. Our analysis entails the evaluation of EVs recovery and purity along with biochemical, biophysical and biomolecular profiling by means of a set of complementary analytical techniques: Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, Western Blotting, Atomic Force Microscopy, miRNA content (digital droplet PCR) and tetraspanin assessment by microarrays. Our data suggest an increase in ultracentrifugation (UC) recovery following heat treatment; however, it is accompanied by a marked enrichment in EVs-associated contaminants. On the other hand, solvent/detergent treatment is promising for small EVs (<150 nm range), yet a depletion of larger vesicular entities was detected. This work represents a first step towards the identification of optimal serum inactivation protocols targeted to EVs analysis.","Frigerio, Roberto; Musicò, Angelo; Brucale, Marco; Ridolfi, Andrea; Galbiati, Silvia; Vago, Riccardo; Bergamaschi, Greta; Ferretti, Anna Maria; Chiari, Marcella; Valle, Francesco; Gori, Alessandro; Cretich, Marina",,,257

The general advice given for prenatal care is to reduce face-to-face visits. All women who refer for prenatal visits should be evaluated for signs of the infection at the time of entry. The triage of suspected women should be done separately from other patients. Outpatient monitoring with a 14-day selfquarantine can be considered for asymptomatic infected women and for those with mild symptoms. Inpatient management criteria include moderate to severe symptoms and the target level of oxygen saturation is 92 to 95% in different guidelines. In the presence of fever, it is important to conduct a thorough examination of other causes of the fever. It is important to monitor fluid intake and output, maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and prevent fluid overload. Thromboembolic prophylaxis is recommended. Corticosteroid administration is based on obstetrics indications, while in critical ill cases, it should be based on multi-disciplinary teams (MDT) decision. A positive COVID-19 result in the absence of other obstetrics causes, cannot be considered an indication for delivery in mild and asymptomatic cases. In critically ill pregnant women, an individualized decision should be made about delivery time by the MDT. General anesthetic should be avoided unless inevitable for standard procedures such as intubation is an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP). There is agreement on the point that babies born to infected mothers, even if isolated from the mother at birth, should be considered a close contact of the mother and tested for COVID-19 and separated from other neonates. Breastfeeding is encouraged and hand hygiene and face mask during feeding are highly recommended by all guidelines.","Pirjani, Reihaneh; Rabiei, Maryam; Abiri, Ameneh; Moini, Ashraf",Int J Fertil Steril,,257

513538,Child and adolescent psychiatry telemedicine: A singaporean experience born in Covid-19,2020,"AIM: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced surgeons to adapt their standard procedures. The modifications introduced are designed to favour minimally invasive surgery. The positive results obtained with intracorporeal resection and anastomosis in the right colon and rectum prompt us to adapt these procedures to the left colon. We describe a 'don't touch the bowel' technique and outline the benefits to patients of the use of less surgically aggressive techniques and also to surgeons in terms of the lower emission of aerosols that might transmit the COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This was an observational study of intracorporeal resection and anastomosis in left colectomy. We describe the technical details of intracorporeal resection, end-to-end stapled anastomosis and extraction of the specimen through mini-laparotomy in the ideal location. RESULTS: We present preliminary results of 17 patients with left-sided colonic pathologies, 15 neoplasia and two diverticular disease, who underwent four left hemicolectomies, six sigmoidectomies and seven high anterior resections. Median operating time was 186 min (range 120-280). No patient required conversion to extracorporeal laparoscopy or open surgery. Median hospital stay was 4.7 days (range 3-12 days). There was one case of anastomotic leak managed with conservative treatment. CONCLUSION: Intracorporeal resection and end-to-end anastomosis with the possibility of extraction of the specimen by a mini-laparotomy in the ideal location may present benefits and also adapts well to the conditions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Future comparative studies are needed to demonstrate these benefits with respect to extracorporeal anastomosis.","Serra-Aracil, Xavier; Mora-Lopez, Laura; Gomez-Torres, Irene; Pallisera-Lloveras, Anna; Serra-Pla, Sheila; Serracant, Anna; Garcia-Nalda, Albert; Pino-Perez, Oriol; Navarro-Soto, Salvador",Colorectal dis,,257

Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell immune profiling of 64 COVID-19 patients across the full range of disease severity, from outpatients with mild disease to fatal cases. Our transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses revealed widespread dysfunction of peripheral innate immunity in severe and fatal COVID-19, including prominent hyperactivation signatures in neutrophils and NK cells. We also identified chromatin accessibility changes at NF-&#954;B binding sites within cytokine gene loci as a potential mechanism for the striking lack of pro-inflammatory cytokine production observed in monocytes in severe and fatal COVID-19. We further demonstrated that emergency myelopoiesis is a prominent feature of fatal COVID-19.

However, there are no data about how the COVID-19 epidemic influenced the treatment of OHCA victims. METHODS: We performed an analysis of the Lombardia Cardiac Arrest Registry comparing all the OHCAs occurred in the Provinces of Lodi, Cremona, Pavia and Mantua (northern Italy) in the first 100 days of the epidemic with those occurred in the same period in 2019. RESULTS: The OHCAs occurred were 694 in 2020 and 520 in 2019. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rate was lower in 2020 (20% vs 31%, p<0.001), whilst the rate of bystander automated external defibrillator (AED) use was similar (2% vs 4%, p = 0.11). Resuscitation was attempted by EMS in 64.5% of patients in 2020 and in 72% in 2019, whereof 45% in 2020 and 64% in 2019 received ALS. At univariable analysis, the presence of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 was not a predictor of resuscitation attempt. Age, unwitnessed status, non-shockable presenting rhythm, absence of bystander CPR and EMS arrival time were independent predictors of ALS attempt. No difference regarding resuscitation duration, epinephrine and amiodarone administration, and mechanical compression device use were highlighted. The return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rate at hospital admission was lower in the general population in 2020 [11% vs 20%, p = 0.001], but was similar in patients with ALS initiated [19% vs 26%, p = 0.15]. Suspected/confirmed COVID-19 was not a predictor of ROSC at hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Compared to 2019, during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak we observed a lower attitude of laypeople to start CPR, while resuscitation attempts by BLS and ALS staff were not influenced by suspected/confirmed infection, even at univariable analysis.","Baldi, Enrico; Sechi, Giuseppe Maria; Mare, Claudio; Canevari, Fabrizio; Brancaglione, Antonella; Primi, Roberto; Palo, Alessandra; Contri, Enrico; Ronchi, Vincenza; Beretta, Giorgio; Reali, Francesca; Parogni, Pier Paolo; Facchin, Fabio; Rizzi, Ugo; Bussi, Daniele; Ruggeri, Simone; Oltrona Visconti, Luigi; Savastano, Simone",PLoS One,,257
517290,Implementation of Obstetric Telehealth During COVID-19 and Beyond,2020,"COVID-19 vaccination is being conducted in over 200 countries and regions to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission and return to a pre-pandemic lifestyle. However, understanding when non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can be lifted as immunity builds up remains a key question for policy makers. To address this, we built a data-driven model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for China. We estimated that, to prevent the escalation of local outbreaks to widespread epidemics, stringent NPIs need to remain in place at least one year after the start of vaccination. Should NPIs alone be capable of keeping the reproduction number (Rt) around 1.3, the synergetic effect of NPIs and vaccination could reduce the COVID-19 burden by up to 99% and bring Rt below the epidemic threshold in about 9 months. Maintaining strict NPIs throughout 2021 is of paramount importance to reduce COVID-19 burden while vaccines are distributed to the population, especially in large populations with little natural immunity.","Yang, Juan; Marziano, Valentina; Deng, Xiaowei; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Zhang, Juanjuan; Trentini, Filippo; Cai, Jun; Poletti, Piero; Zheng, Wen; Wang, Wei; Wu, Qianhui; Zhao, Zeyao; Dong, Kaige; Zhong, Guangjie; Viboud, Cécile; Merler, Stefano; Ajelli, Marco; Yu, Hongjie",Nat Hum Behav,,257

This was a retrospective review of patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 who received tocilizumab and completed 14 days of follow up. Twenty-five patients were included, median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50-63) and the majority were males (92%). Co-morbidities included diabetes mellitus (48%), chronic kidney disease (16%), and cardiovascular disease (12%). Fever (92%), cough (84%), and dyspnea (72%) were the commonest presenting symptoms. All patients received at least two concomitant investigational antiviral agents. Median oral temperature was on day 1, 3, and 7 was 38.0°C, 37.3°C (P = .043), and 37.0°C (P = .064), respectively. Corresponding median C-reactive protein was 193 and 7.9 mg/L (P < .0001) and <6 mg/L (P = .0001). Radiological improvement was noted in 44% of patients by day 7% and 68% by day 14. Nine patients (36%) were discharged alive from intensive care unit and three (12%) died. The proportion of patients on invasive ventilation declined from (84%) at the time of tocilizumab initiation to 60% on day 7 (P = .031) and 28% on day 14 (P = .001). The majority (92%) of patients experienced at least one adverse event. However, it is not possible to ascertain which adverse events were directly related to tocilizumab therapy. In patients with severe COVID-19, tocilizumab was associated with dramatic decline in inflammatory markers, radiological improvement and reduced ventilatory support requirements.

METHODS: We searched articles in Medline, Embase, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. Random-effects meta-analyses on the proportions of individuals with symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and PD were generated and between-group differences for gender, healthcare workers (HCWs), and regions where studies were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 2189 articles were screened, 136 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Fifty-five peer-reviewed studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis (N=189,159). The prevalence of depression (k=46) was 15.97% (95%CI, 13.24-19.13). The prevalence of anxiety (k=54) was 15.15% (95%CI, 12.29-18.54). The prevalence of insomnia (k=14) was 23.87% (95%CI, 15.74-34.48). The prevalence of PTSD (k=13) was 21.94% (95%CI, 9.37-43.31). Finally, the prevalence of psychological distress (k=19) was 13.29% (95%CI, 8.80-19.57). Between-group differences were only found in HCWs (z=2.69, p < 0.05) who had a higher prevalence of insomnia than others.

In conjunction with our infectious disease experts, we developed our guidelines based on potential patterns of spread, risk of exposure, and conservation of PPE. RESULTS: A decision tree algorithm describing our institutional guidelines for precautions for operating room team members was created. This algorithm is based on urgency of operation, anticipated viral burden at the surgical site, opportunity for a procedure to aerosolize virus, and likelihood a patient could be infected based on symptoms and testing.

As parent, they need to take care of their children while as a worker, they need to complete the task given as ordered. All these make parents have to choose which will be their priority to do on that day. Unfortunately, if most of the day they decided to choose work as their priority, the outcomes is, parents did not realize they have neglect their children. Weather busy working of office work or doing house chores children are abandoned. They let the children play alone, watch television alone unattended, not responding to the questions and more. Children by themselves are force to understand their parents' “work” while deep inside, they are emotionally abuse by their parents. Therefore this study is to find what effects parents to neglect their children. There are 158 parents were involved in this study during the Movement Control Order (MCO) period. They are at least having one child. Result found, there are not significant but, by mean score, a father is more likely to neglect their children because by perspective, a father is less likely to involve with their children compared to a mother. A father roles also is usually to fulfil the family's necessary needs such as food, shelter, clothes and money. They rarely at home with the children. By having helpers such as maid or spouse, it can be help to ease their burden. Hence, it can prevent them to neglect their children. Lastly, this study is to find the working affairs of the family. Result shown by mean score comparison, parents who get high pay RM 8001 and above is leading to parental neglect and those who need to go to work during MCO, also lead to parental neglect. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

521294,The impact of sitting time and physical activity on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"Early risk stratification for complications and death related to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is needed. Because many patients with COVID-19 who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome have diffuse alveolar inflammatory damage associated with microvessel thrombosis, we aimed to investigate a common clinical tool, the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc, to aid in the prognostication of outcomes for COVID-19 patients. We analyzed consecutive patients from the multicenter observational CORACLE registry, which contains data of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection in 4 regions of Italy, according to data-driven tertiles of CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score. The primary outcomes were inpatient death and a composite of inpatient death or invasive ventilation. Of 1045 patients in the registry, 864 (82.7%) had data available to calculate CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score and were included in the analysis. Of these, 167 (19.3%) died, 123 (14.2%) received invasive ventilation, and 249 (28.8%) had the composite outcome. Stratification by CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc tertiles (T1: &#8804;1; T2: 2 to 3; T3: &#8805;4) revealed increases in both death (8.1%, 24.3%, 33.3%, respectively; p <0.001) and the composite end point (18.6%, 31.9%, 43.5%, respectively; p <0.001). The odds ratios for mortality and the composite end point for T2 patients versus T1 CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score were 3.62 (95% CI:2.29 to 5.73,p <0.001) and 2.04 (95% CI:1.42 to 2.93, p <0.001), respectively. Similarly, the odds ratios for mortality and the composite end point for T3 patients versus T1 were 5.65 (95% CI:3.54 to 9.01, p <0.001) and 3.36 (95% CI:2.30 to 4.90,p <0.001), respectively. In conclusion, among Italian patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc risk score for thromboembolic events enhanced the ability to achieve risk stratification for complications and death.","Ruocco, Gaetano; McCullough, Peter A; Tecson, Kristen M; Mancone, Massimo; De Ferrari, Gaetano M; D039,; Ascenzo, Fabrizio; De Rosa, Francesco G; Paggi, Anita; Forleo, Giovanni; Secco, Gioel G; Pistis, Gianfranco; Monticone, Silvia; Vicenzi, Marco; Rota, Irene; Blasi, Francesco; Pugliese, Francesco; Fedele, Francesco; Palazzuoli, Alberto",Am J Cardiol,,257

523951,Survey of mental health of dentists in the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK,2021,"COVID-19 has had a substantial impact on clinical care and lifestyles globally. The State of Michigan reports over 80,000 positive COVID-19 tests between March 1, 2020 and July 29, 2020. We surveyed 8,041 Michigan Medicine biorepository participants in late June 2020. We found that 55% of COVID-19 cases reported no known exposure to family members or to someone outside the house diagnosed with COVID-19. A significantly higher rate of COVID-19 cases were employed as essential workers (45% vs 19%, p = 9x10-12). COVID-19 cases reporting a fever were more likely to require hospitalization (categorized as severe; OR = 4.4 [95% CI: 1.6-12.5, p = 0.005]) whereas respondents reporting rhinorrhea was less likely to require hospitalization (categorized as mild-to-moderate; OR = 0.16 [95% CI: 0.04-0.73, p = 0.018]). African-Americans reported higher rates of being diagnosed with COVID-19 (OR = 4.0 [95% CI: 2.2-7.2, p = 5x10-6]), as well as higher rates of exposure to family or someone outside the household diagnosed with COVID-19, an annual household income < $40,000, living in rental housing, and chronic diseases. During the Executive Order in Michigan, African Americans, women, and the lowest income group reported worsening health behaviors and higher overall concern for the potential detrimental effects of the pandemic. The higher risk of contracting COVID-19 observed among African Americans may be due to the increased rates of working as essential employees, lower socioeconomic status, and exposure to known positive cases. Continued efforts should focus on COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies, as well as address the inequality gaps that result in higher risks for both short-term and long-term health outcomes.","Wu, Kuan-Han H; Hornsby, Whitney E; Klunder, Bethany; Krause, Amelia; Driscoll, Anisa; Kulka, John; Bickett-Hickok, Ryan; Fellows, Austin; Graham, Sarah; Kaleba, Erin O; Hayek, Salim S; Shi, Xu; Sutton, Nadia R; Douville, Nicholas; Mukherjee, Bhramar; Jamerson, Kenneth; Brummett, Chad M; Willer, Cristen J",PLoS One,,257

Common clinically focused tools may be less appropriate. OBJECTIVES: To identify stakeholder perceptions of key outcomes from supplementary palliative care support services, then map these onto outcome measurement tools to assess relevance and item redundancy. METHODS: A scoping review using the design by Arksey and O'Malley. EMBASE, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PSYCHinfo searched using terms relating to palliative care, qualitative research, and supplementary support interventions. Articles were imported into Endnote™, and Covidence™ was used by two reviewers to assess against inclusion criteria. Included articles were imported into NVivo™ and thematically coded to identify key concepts underpinning outcomes. Each item within contender outcome measurement tools was assessed against each concept. RESULTS: Sixty included articles focused on advance care planning, guided conversations, and volunteer befriending services. Four concepts were identified: enriching relationships; greater autonomy and perceived control; knowing more; and improved mental health. Mapping concepts to contender tool items revealed issues of relevance and redundancy. Some tools had no redundant items but mapped only to two of four outcome themes; others mapped to all concepts, but with many redundant questions. Tools such as ICECAP-Supportive Care Measure and McGill Quality of Life had high relevance and low redundancy. CONCLUSION: Pertinent outcome concepts for these services and population are not well represented in commonly used outcome measurement tools, and this may have implications in appropriately measuring outcomes. This review and mapping method may have utility in fields where selecting appropriate outcome tools can be challenging.","Dodd, Steven R; Payne, Sheila A; Preston, Nancy J; Walshe, Catherine E",J Pain Symptom Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32201310/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.010,257

592516,"Rapid report: Early demand, profiles and concerns of mental health users during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic",2020-06-01,"Over the past two decades, the poultry sector in China went through a phase of tremendous growth as well as rapid intensification and concentration. Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 was first detected in 1996 in Guangdong province, South China and started spreading throughout Asia in early 2004. Since then, control of the disease in China has relied heavily on wide-scale preventive vaccination combined with movement control, quarantine and stamping out. This strategy has been successful in drastically reducing the number of outbreaks during the past 5 years. However, HPAIV H5N1 is still circulating and is regularly isolated in traditional live bird markets (LBMs) where viral infection can persist, which represent a public health hazard for people visiting them. The use of social network analysis in combination with epidemiological surveillance in South China has identified areas where the success of current strategies for HPAI control in the poultry production sector may benefit from better knowledge of poultry trading patterns and the LBM network configuration as well as their capacity for maintaining HPAIV H5N1 infection. We produced a set of LBM network maps and estimated the associated risk of HPAIV H5N1 within LBMs and along poultry market chains, providing new insights into how live poultry trade and infection are intertwined. More specifically, our study provides evidence that several biosecurity factors such as daily cage cleaning, daily cage disinfection or manure processing contribute to a reduction in HPAIV H5N1 presence in LBMs. Of significant importance is that the results of our study also show the association between social network indicators and the presence of HPAIV H5N1 in specific network configurations such as the one represented by the counties of origin of the birds traded in LBMs. This new information could be used to develop more targeted and effective control interventions.","Martin, Vincent; Zhou, Xiaoyan; Marshall, Edith; Jia, Beibei; Fusheng, Guo; FrancoDixon, Mary Ann; DeHaan, Nicoline; Pfeiffer, Dirk U.; Soares Magalhães, Ricardo J.; Gilbert, Marius",Prev Vet Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21925753/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587711002339; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587711002339; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.07.007,257

The present study’s goal was to explore how health workers interpreted the meaning of the pandemic crisis in their life. An online survey was available during the Italian lockdown. Respondents were asked to write a passage about the meaning of living in the time of COVID-19. A total number of 130 questionnaires (M = 42.35; DS = 10.52; women: 56.2%) were collected. The Automated Method for Content Analysis (ACASM) procedure was applied to the collected texts to detect the factorial dimensions underpinning (dis)similarities in the respondents’ narratives. Such factors were interpreted as the markers of latent dimensions of meanings (DS). The two main DS that emerged were characterised by the pertinentisation of two extremely basic issues: what the pandemic represents (health emergency versus personal crisis) and its impact (powerlessness versus discovery of new meanings). On the whole, health workers’ narratives help to highlight the risk of normalising the feelings of fear and impotence experienced when facing the health emergency and the need to recognise that such feelings are strictly intertwined with the limited resources received to “face the battle”; the need to recognize the human vulnerability of the women and men “inside the lab coat” and the human effort to maintain or reconstruct a sense of self and purpose in the face of troubled circumstances.","Marinaci, Tiziana; Venuleo, Claudia; Savarese, Giulia",Hu Arenas,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42087-021-00232-z,257
593201,Covid-19—Beyond virology: Potentials for maintaining mental health during lockdown,2020-08-04,"Currently, COVID‐19 has been reported in nearly all countries globally. To date, little is known about the viral shedding duration, clinical course, and treatment efficacy of COVID‐19 near Hubei Province, China. This multicentre, retrospective study was performed in 12 hospitals in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces from January 20 to February 8, 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up until March 26, 2020. The viral shedding duration, full clinical course, and treatment efficacy were analysed in different subgroups of patients. A total of 149 COVID‐19 patients were enrolled. The median age was 42 years, and 61.1% (91) were males. Of them, 133 (89.3%) had fever, 131 of 144 (91%) had pneumonia, 27 (18.1%) required intensive care unit (ICU) management, 3 (2%) were pregnant, and 3 (2%) died. Two premature newborns were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2. In total, the median SARS‐CoV‐2 shedding period and clinical course were 12 (IQR: 9‐17; mean: 13.4, 95% CI: 12.5, 14.2) and 20 (IQR: 16‐24; mean: 21.2, 95% CI: 20.1, 22.3) days, respectively; and ICU patients had longer median viral shedding periods (21 [17‐24] vs 11 [9‐15]) and clinical courses (30 [22‐33] vs 19 [15.8‐22]) than non‐ICU patients (both p<0.0001). SARS‐CoV‐2 clearances occurred at least 2 days before fatality in 3 non‐survivors. Current treatment with any antiviral agent or combination did not present the benefit of shortening viral shedding period and clinical course (all p>0.05) in real‐life settings. In conclusion, the viral shedding duration and clinical course in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces were shorter than those in Hubei Province, and current antiviral therapies were ineffective for shortening viral shedding duration and clinical course in real‐world settings. These findings expand our knowledge of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and may be helpful for management of the epidemic outbreak of COVID‐19 worldwide. Further studies concerning effective antiviral agents and vaccines are urgently needed.","Zeng, Qing‐Lei; Li, Guang‐Ming; Ji, Fanpu; Ma, Shu‐Huan; Zhang, Guo‐Fan; Xu, Jiang‐Hai; Lin, Wan‐Bao; Xu, Guang‐Hua; Zhang, Guo‐Qiang; Li, Guo‐Tao; Cui, Guang‐Lin; Liu, Na; Zeng, Fan‐Jun; Ai, Zhi‐Guo; Xu, Guang‐Feng; Liu, Na; Liang, Jie; Zhang, Min‐Min; Li, Cheng; Zhang, Zhi‐Hao; Wang, Ze‐Shuai; Li, Zongfang; Yu, Zu‐Jiang",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531138/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13674,257

We evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) hexamer peptide, Poly6, which is capable of eliciting an antiviral effect against human immunodeficiency virus -1 (HIV-1), as a novel HIV-1 integrase inhibitor, and a strong anticancer immune response in an IFN-I-dependent manner, as a novel potential adjuvant in anticancer immunotherapy. Here, we report that Poly6 exerts an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, with an estimated 50% inhibitory concentration of 2.617 µM, in the human bronchial epithelial cell line, Calu-3 but not in Vero-E6 cells, which are deficient in type 1 interferon (IFN-I) signaling. We proved via assays based on mRNA profiles, inhibitors, or blocking antibodies that Poly6 can exert an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect in an IFN-I-dependent manner. We also found that Poly6 inhibits IL-6 production enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 in infected Calu-3 cells at both the transcription and the translation levels, mediated via IL-10 induction in an IFN-I-dependent manner. These results indicate the feasibility of Poly6 as an IFN-I-inducing COVID-19 drug with potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities.","Choi, Yu-Min; Jeong, Hyein; Park, Uni; Cho, Nam-Hyuk; Kim, Bum-Joon",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13071227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202029/,257

Each player typically represents a region or a country which is assumed to choose its control action to implement a tradeoff between socioeconomic aspects and the health aspect. We conduct the Nash equilibrium analysis of this game. Since the analysis is not trivial in general, sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness are provided. Then we quantify through numerical results the loss induced by decentralization, measured in terms of price of anarchy (PoA) and price of connectedness (PoC). These results allow one to clearly identify scenarios where decentralization is acceptable or not regarding to the retained global efficiency measures.","Silva, Olivier Lindamulage De; Lasaulce, Samson; Moruarescu, Irinel-Constantin",IEEE Control Systems Letters,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06220v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1109/lcsys.2021.3087101,257

The case of Cladocora caespitosa in the eastern Mediterranean Sea,2021-01-08,"OBJECTIVE: As of January 2020, there were 2,519 confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases with 866 deaths across 27 countries. Most of these cases (2,121) were reported in KSA. Since the initial identification of MERS, few studies have investigated the role of comorbidities that could potentially lead to mortality in cases of the infectious disease. This study aimed to examine the association between comorbidities and MERS mortality in KSA. METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study. We retrieved the data published by the World Health Organization (WHO) between January 2017 and November 2019, and analysed the association between comorbidities and mortality. RESULTS: We found 572 MERS-CoV cases reported by WHO in KSA during the defined period. Of these, 387 (68%) had a history of chronic illness. The overall mortality rate was found to be 25%. Diabetes mellitus was the most prevalent comorbidity—the mortality rate in the diabetics was 32% as opposed to 12% in the non-diabetics (p-value <0.01). Hypertension was second, with a mortality rate of 35%, as opposed to 15% in the non-hypertensive patients (p-value <0.001). The mortality rate in cases with cardiovascular disease was 39% as opposed to 21% in those without cardiovascular disease (p-value <0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study shows that MERS-CoV had a significant case fatality rate in patients with comorbidities. Thus, it will be beneficial if future clinical trials for MERS-CoV examine the impact of improved societal infection control measures such as social distancing and masks, in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, on the prevalence and incidence of MERS and its clinical outcomes.","Alotaibi, Mohammad H.; Bahammam, Salman A.",J Taibah Univ Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtumed.2021.02.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S165836122100041X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S165836122100041X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33727906/,257

This study examined the mediating roles of resilience and coronavirus fear in the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses who were actively treating patients confirmed with COVID-19. We recruited 204 healthcare professionals (50% females) with a mean age of 32.92 years (SD = 7.01). Results showed that perceived risk and coronavirus fear positively predicted depression, anxiety, and stress while resilience negatively predicted those mental health problems. Coronavirus fear mediated the relationship between perceived risk and resilience, depression, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, resilience mitigated the effect of coronavirus fear on depression, anxiety, and stress. This study is among the first indicating the importance of resilience and fear as a critical mechanism that explains the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among health professionals directly caring for COVID-19 patients.","Yıldırım, Murat; Arslan, Gökmen; Özaslan, Ahmet",Int J Ment Health Addict,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00424-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223977/,257
599856,Exploring the association between mental health and subjective sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi university students,2021-05-16,"Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious bacterial infection of the endocardium and/or heart valves that carries considerable morbidity and mortality. Often presenting with very non-specific symptoms, this disease presents many challenges to the emergency medicine practitioner. A 47-year-old male with no pertinent medical history presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath. He stated that his symptoms had been persistent for the last three weeks and were associated with malaise and fatigue. CT of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast revealed a 7-cm hypodensity of the spleen concerning for abscess versus infarct. He denied any trauma or IV drug use. Follow-up ultrasound was ordered, which characterized the hypodensity as a splenic abscess. An echocardiogram was recommended for possible IE, and cardiology was consulted. The transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on hospital day 2, which showed minimal mitral valve thickening with mild mitral regurgitation. The interventional radiology (IR) service was consulted for the splenic abscess in order to perform CT-guided drainage. An IR drain was successfully placed on hospital day 3. On the same day, blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. On hospital day 5, that patient was transferred to the ICU for possible empyema formation with signs of respiratory distress. The patient underwent CT of the chest that showed the development of a left-sided effusion. The patient had also been persistently tachycardic and febrile, with high leukocytosis since admission and worsening respiratory status. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was scheduled but put on hold due to worsening respiratory status. Repeat TEE was scheduled five days later, which showed mitral regurgitation and increased size of the vegetation despite antibiotic therapy. Two days later, he was scheduled for mitral valve repair. When reviewing our case, the patient had both common and uncommon aspects of splenic abscess or IE. First, despite having respiratory symptoms for two weeks, the primary reason he came to the hospital was due to the new onset of fevers. He was febrile, tachycardic, and with significant leukocytosis. He continued to have fevers despite antibiotic therapy and IR drainage of the abscess. With no history of IV drug use history, negative transthoracic echocardiography, lack of immunocompromising condition, and blood cultures with gram-negative rods, IE became less likely of a diagnosis. Establishing the diagnosis of IE proved to be exceptionally complicated, especially in the setting of a COVID-19 pandemic. The most notable challenge was having a high index of suspicion despite any risk factors. The patient was a previously healthy 47-year-old male with no medical problems. IE continues to be a clinical challenge for physicians, especially in the emergency department, due to the lack of diagnostic criteria such as positive blood cultures or vegetations visualized on echocardiographic studies. IE has a wide gamut of presentations with different levels of acuity. Diagnosis is more straightforward when patients present with obvious risk factors, but, in many cases, such as this one, those risk factors may be absent. A high index of suspicion is required, especially in patients with additional findings such as splenic abscess, embolic phenomenon, focal neurologic deficit, mycotic aneurysm, decompensated heart failure, new murmurs, or pleural effusions.","Ulloa, Nicolas; Cook, Jessica M; Smithson, Shaun",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101821/,257

This qualitative study examined key stakeholders’ perspectives of the relationship between the U.S. food banking system and obesity disparities among food insecure clients. METHODS: We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 10 key stakeholders (e.g., food bank director, food bank board member, advocate) who are familiar with food bank operations. Data were transcribed verbatim, coded in NVivo [v11], and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Multiple themes emerged drawing linkages between structural characteristics of the food banking system and disparities in the dual burden of food insecurity and obesity: [a] access to unhealthy food from donors; [b] federal emergency food policy and programming; [c] state-level emergency food policy and programming; [d] geography-based risk profiles; and [e] inadequate food supply versus client need. Interviewees also identified social challenges between system leaders and clients that maintain disparities in obesity risk among individuals with very low food security including: [a] media representation and stereotypes about food pantry clients; [b] mistrust in communities of color; [c] lack of inclusion/representation among food bank system leaders; and [d] access to information. CONCLUSION: Future efforts to alleviate obesity inequities among clients chronically burdened by food insecurity, especially among certain subpopulations of clients, should prioritize policy, systems, and environmental strategies to overcome these structural and social challenges within the food banking system.","Cooksey Stowers, Kristen; Marfo, Nana Yaa A.; Gurganus, Eminet Abebe; Gans, Kim M.; Kumanyika, Shiriki K.; Schwartz, Marlene B.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33085685/,257
601217,Why we need longitudinal mental health research with children and youth during (and after) the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-28,"Diabetes mellitus affects over 463 million individuals worldwide. Religious activities such as the Hajj pilgrimage have a major impact on patients with diabetes mellitus, including increasing the risk of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. This increased risk is due to dietary changes and intense physical activity during pilgrimage while being on antidiabetic medications. Approximately 20% of the pilgrims with underlying illnesses who visit Mecca are diabetic, and complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, nonketotic hyperosmolar state, and fatigue/unconsciousness due to hypoglycaemia, have been observed among these patients. Diabetic patients are also at a high risk for foot complications and infections. To avoid any aggravation of the diabetes, a complete biochemical evaluation of the patient must be conducted before Hajj, and the patients must be provided contextualized educational guidance to avert these potential health challenges. This counselling should include the importance of carrying with them at all time their relevant medical history, summaries of the current treatment regimen and emergency snacks. In addition, to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, the dosage of insulin should be reduced in selected patients by 20% and that of sulfonylurea should be reduced as needed. Basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists are associated with fewer complications and can be preferentially prescribed. Those patients with type 1 diabetes can continue with the use of insulin pump with suitable education prior to Hajj. For the prevention of foot problems, the use of padded socks and well-fitting shoes is recommended along with an insistence on not walking barefoot. After Hajj, the patient must be followed up, and necessary investigations must be made along with readjustment of insulin dosage in those patients for whom it was reduced. Until the pandemic situation abates, all diabetic patients should avoid making the Hajj journey.","Shaikh, Shehla; Ashraf, Hamid; Shaikh, Khalid; Iraqi, Hinde; Ndour Mbaye, Maimouna; Kake, Amadou; Mohamed, Gaman Ali; Selim, Shahjada; Wali Naseri, Mohammad; Syed, Imran; Said, Jamil Abdul Kadir; Raza, S.

601543,The Mental Health of Healthcare Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic: It Depends on How Much They Work and Their Age,2020-08-21,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of COVID-19 has depended on the use of a Reverse transcriptase polymerase chase reaction test (RT-PCR) on respiratory samples. While this has directed the response and care of patients with suspected COVID-19, there have been false-negative results depending on when the test was administered in relation to time of exposure and symptom onset. CASE PRESENTATION: A 19-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department in July 2020 with a persistent fever of 100 -103F for 10 days. He returned from Texas 9 days prior with onset of fever one day before depature. He had a mild, non-productive cough, body aches, and poor oral intake. He also had diffuse abdominal pain with diarrhea and bilious, non-bloody vomiting - up to three times a day. He had elevated WBC, ESR, CRP and LDH with Lymphopenia. Blood cultures and HIV, Syphilis, EBV and Mycoplasma screening were negative as was a COVID-19 test. CT scan of his chest and abdomen revealed peripheral ground glass opacities suspicious of COVID 19. A repeat COVID test on hospital day 2 was again negative. He was treated with Azithromycin and Doxycycline and discharged home on Azithromycin on hospital day 4. He was readmitted 6 days later because of persistent fever to 103F, joint pains, malaise and weight loss of about 10 pounds. ESR, CRP, Ferritin and LDH were again elevated. A repeat CT scan showed resolution of previously seen ground glass opacities in the anterior lung fields and new confluent areas of ground glass attenuation and interlobular septal thickening posteriorly. A 3rd, 4th and 5th COVID-19 tests performed were negative. He was treated with Acetaminophen alternating with Ketorolac. A TTE showed a hyperlucency concerning for a right atrial thrombus or vegetation. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 50%. An MRI of the heart showed an inflammatory picture consistent with myocarditis. Further testing was done to reveal the etiology of his myocarditis to be Coxsackie A7,9, and 16. Clinically, there was significant improvement with resolution of fever and malaise and return of WBC count to normal. DISCUSSION: This patient's diagnosis of Coxsackie A myocarditis was clouded by the medical team's strong suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia because of his clinical presentation and history of travel during the month of June to a part of the US with rising rates of COVID-19 cases. The unknown precise false-negative rate of the COVID-19 test, which can be anywhere from 2-27% depending on the time of testing from initial exposure meant that the diagnosis was never deemed impossible even with consecutive negative test results. CONCLUSIONS: While the attention COVID-19 is receiving is well deserved, anecdotal accumulation of evidence along with the scientific community's first wave of research has produced heuristics that need to be overcome to optimize patient care and outcomes.

Currently, no prophylactics or therapies exist to control virus spread or mitigate the disease. Thus, the risk of infection for physicians and scientists is high, requiring work to be conducted in Biosafety Level‐3 (BSL‐3) facilities if virus will be isolated or propagated. However, inactivation of the virus can enable safe handling at a reduced biosafety level, making samples accessible to a diverse array of institutions and investigators. Institutions of all types have an immediate need for guidelines that outline safe collection, handling, and inactivation of samples suspected to contain active virus.

Infection control algorithms delineating a standard approach to patient management decrease risk of secondary exposure, but few articles document health care workers' (HCWs) perceptions as to their effectiveness and ease of implementation. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey approach was used to explore HCWs perceptions in 2 emergency departments of the current algorithms for management of potentially infectious respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. RESULTS: Surveys from 96 HCWs revealed that algorithms were perceived as invaluable in protecting staff, patients, and colleagues. Differences in self-reported compliance, clarity, and ease of implementation of the respiratory algorithm were noted between facilities, likely reflecting variation in the physical plant. Physicians scored significantly lower for compliance with the respiratory algorithm. CONCLUSION: Algorithms were perceived to offer a clear and consistent approach to patient management and protect HCWs in spite of environmental and resource limitations.","Siow, Serena; Bryce, Elizabeth A.; Scharf, Sydney",Am J Infect Control,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655309005380; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2009.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19576661/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655309005380,257

604488,Eating habits and mental health among rugby players of the Peruvian pre-selection during the second quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-09-01,"Sepsis develops from a serious microbial infection that causes the immune system to go into overdrive. The major microorganisms that induce sepsis are Gram-negative bacteria with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in their cell walls. Nitric oxide (NO) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are the key factors involved in the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory process. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of polyphenol Tellimagrandin II (TGII) on anti-inflammatory activity and its underlying basic mechanism in murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Macrophages with more than 90% cell viability were found in the cytotoxicity assay under 50 μM TGII. Pre- or post-treatment with TGII significantly reduced LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) protein and mRNA expression, reducing LPS-induced COX-2 protein. Downstream of NOS2 and COX-2, NO and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were significantly inhibited by TGII. Upstream of NOS2 and COX-2, phospho-p65, c-fos and phospho-c-jun were also reduced after pre-treatment with TGII. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are also critical to nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) stimulation, and phospho-p38 expression was found to have been blocked by TGII. TGII efficiently reduces LPS-induced NO production and its upstream regulatory factors, suggesting that TGII may be a potential therapeutic agent for sepsis and other inflammatory diseases.","Lin, Chun-Yu; Kao, Shih-Han; Hung, Ling-Chien; Chien, Hsin-Ju; Wang, Wen-Hung; Chang, Yu-Wei; Chen, Yen-Hsu",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33946374/; https://doi.org/10.3390/life11050411,257
605515,Predictors of poor mental health among nurses during COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-11-20,"AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading worldwide. Drug therapy is one of the major treatments, but contradictory results of clinical trials have been reported among different individuals. Furthermore, comprehensive analysis of personalized pharmacotherapy is still lacking. In this study, analyses were performed on 47 well-characterized COVID-19 drugs used in the personalized treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical trials with published results of drugs use for COVID-19 treatment were collected to evaluate drug efficacy. Drug-to-Drug Interactions (DDIs) were summarized and classified. Functional variations in actionable pharmacogenes were collected and systematically analysed. “Gene Score” and “Drug Score” were defined and calculated to systematically analyse ethnicity-based genetic differences, which are important for the safer use of COVID-19 drugs. RESULTS: Our results indicated that four antiviral agents (ritonavir, darunavir, daclatasvir and sofosbuvir) and three immune regulators (budesonide, colchicine and prednisone) as well as heparin and enalapril could generate the highest number of DDIs with common concomitantly utilized drugs. Eight drugs (ritonavir, daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, ribavirin, interferon alpha-2b, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and ceftriaxone had actionable pharmacogenomics (PGx) biomarkers among all ethnic groups. Fourteen drugs (ritonavir, daclatasvir, prednisone, dexamethasone, ribavirin, HCQ, ceftriaxone, zinc, interferon beta-1a, remdesivir, levofloxacin, lopinavir, human immunoglobulin G and losartan) showed significantly different pharmacogenomic characteristics in relation to the ethnic origin of the patient. CONCLUSION: We recommend that particularly for patients with comorbidities to avoid serious DDIs, the predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM, 3 PM) strategies have to be applied for COVID-19 treatment, and genetic tests should be performed for drugs with actionable pharmacogenes, especially in some ethnic groups with a higher frequency of functional variations, as our analysis showed. We also suggest that drugs associated with higher ethnic genetic differences should be given priority in future pharmacogenetic studies for COVID-19 management. To facilitate translation of our results into clinical practice, an approach conform with PPPM/3 PM principles was suggested. In summary, the proposed PPPM/3 PM attitude should be obligatory considered for the overall COVID-19 management.

Iceland has been known as a front runner in gender equality, and women’s participation in the workforce is high. Data consists of 97 stories that were collected during the peak of COVID‐19 in April 2020 using the story completion method. The stories were thematically analysed. Most of the participants were university‐educated women. The themes demonstrate the power of neoliberal discourses in framing parenting. Parenting during a pandemic, especially mothering, is constructed as an overwhelming project that requires detailed organization and management. There is also resistance to neoliberal governmentality through redefining successful parenthood. Furthermore, the gendered nature of domestic work is questioned, especially the traditional, inactive father who prioritizes his own needs only to fail comically in the domestic sphere. The study contributes to our understanding of gendered parenthood in neoliberal, pandemic times.","Auðardóttir, Auður Magndís; Rúdólfsdóttir, Annadís G.",Gend Work Organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837027/; https://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12519,257
606362,Child and adolescent psychiatry telemedicine: A singaporean experience born in Covid-19,2020-08-14,"Post-transcriptional control makes a major contribution to the overall regulation of gene expression pathway. Within the cytoplasm this is mediated by a combination of regulatory RNA motifs within the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of mRNAs and their interacting protein/RNA partners. One of the most common regulatory RNA elements in mammalian transcripts (present in approximately 40% of all mRNAs) are upstream open reading frames (uORFs). However, despite the prevalence of these RNA elements how they function is not well understood. In general, they act to repress translation of the physiological ORF under control conditions, and under certain pathophysiological stresses this repression can be alleviated. It is known that re-initiation following the translation of an uORF is utilised in some situations however there are numerous alternative mechanisms that control the synthesis of a protein whose mRNA contains uORFs. Moreover, the trans-acting factors that are also involved in this process are not well defined. In this review we summarise our current understanding of this area and highlight some common features of these RNA motifs that have been discovered to date.","Somers, Joanna; Pöyry, Tuija; Willis, Anne E.",Int J Biochem Cell Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357272513001258; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272513001258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23624144/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2013.04.020,257

Lasmiditan, ubrogepant, rimegepant and monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab, and eptinezumab) are new drugs that were launched on the US pharmaceutical market; some of them also in Europe. This publication reviews the available worldwide references on the safety of these anti-migraine drugs with a focus on the possible drug–drug (DDI) or drug–food interactions. As is known, bioavailability of a drug and, hence, its pharmacological efficacy depend on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which may be altered by drug interactions. This paper discusses the interactions of gepants and lasmiditan with, i.a., serotonergic drugs, CYP3A4 inhibitors, and inducers or breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors. In the case of monoclonal antibodies, the issue of pharmacodynamic interactions related to the modulation of the immune system functions was addressed.

608344,Catering Work Profession and Medico-Oral Health: A Study on 603 Subjects,2021-05-13,"Background: Pathogens are often assumed to evolve towards reduced virulence, but counterexamples abound. Faced with a new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to be able to forecast the case fatality rate (CFR) and the overall disease burden. Considerable effort has been invested towards developing a mathematical framework for predicting virulence evolution. Although many approaches accurately recapitulate complex outcomes, most rely on an assumed trade-off between CFR and infection rate. It is often impractical to empirically validate this constraint for human pathogens. Methods: A compartment model with parameters tuning the degree to which symptomatic individuals are isolated and the duration of immunity is constructed and evaluated at both short timescales and at equilibrium. Results: We reveal kinetic constraints whereby variation of multiple parameters in concert leads to decreased CFR and increased pathogen fitness, whereas independent variation of the parameters decreases pathogen fitness. Smallpox, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza are analyzed as diverse representatives of human respiratory viruses. We show that highly virulent viruses, such as smallpox, are often constrained by the host behavior, whereas moderately virulent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, appear to be typically constrained by the relationship between the duration of immunity and CFR. Conclusions: Evolution of human respiratory epidemics appears to be often kinetically constrained and a reduction in CFR should not be assumed. These results agree with previous work demonstrating an increase in virulence for smallpox and further predict that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to continue presenting a substantial disease burden. Herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and viruses with similar life history traits might be unachievable without vaccination. However, partial isolation of symptomatic individuals can have a major effect on the epidemic dynamics not only by reducing the number of fatalities in the short term but also by changing the evolutionary trajectory of moderate CFR viruses towards reduced CFR.","Rochman, Nash; Wolf, Yuri; V.

608449,A case for location based contact tracing,2021-06-16,"Background Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a pediatric complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by multiorgan inflammation and frequently, cardiovascular dysfunction. It occurs predominantly in otherwise healthy children. We previously reported haploinsufficiency of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 (SOCS1), a negative regulator of Type I and II interferons, as a genetic risk factor for MIS-C. Objectives We aimed to identify additional genetic mechanisms underlying susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C. Methods In a single center, prospective cohort study, whole exome sequencing was performed on patients with MIS-C. The impact of candidate variants was tested using patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained at least seven months after recovery. Results We enrolled 18 patients with MIS-C (median age: 8 years, IQR 5 – 12.25 years), of whom 89% had no conditions other than obesity. In two boys with no significant infection history, we identified and validated hemizygous, deleterious defects in XIAP, encoding X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and CYBB, encoding cytochrome b-245. Including the previously reported SOCS1 haploinsufficiency, a genetic diagnosis was identified in three (17%) of 18 patients. Even after recovery, patients with defects in SOCS1, XIAP, or CYBB exhibit an inflammatory immune cell transcriptome with enrichment of differentially expressed genes in pathways downstream of IL-18, oncostatin M, and NF-κB, compared to those with mild COVID-19. Conclusions Although inflammatory disorders are rare in the general population, our cohort of patients with MIS-C was enriched for monogenic susceptibility to inflammation. Our results support the use of next-generation sequencing in previously healthy children who develop MIS-C.","Chou, Janet; Platt, Craig D.; Habiballah, Saddiq; Nguyen, Alan A.; Elkins, Megan; Weeks, Sabrina; Peters, Zachary; Day-Lewis, Megan; Novak, Tanya; Armant, Myriam; Williams, Lucinda; Rockowitz, Shira; Sliz, Piotr; Williams, David A.; Randolph, Adrienne G.; Geha, Raif S.; Almutairi, Abduarahman; Jaber, Faris; Banzon, Tina; Roberts, Jordan; Halyabar, Olha; Lo, Mindy; Kahn, Stacy; Henderson, Lauren A.; Lee, Pui Y.; Son, Mary Beth; Cheng, Leah",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674921010526?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224783/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2021.06.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674921010526,257

The effect of LHRH-antagonist on body composition has never been explored. We evaluated changes in fat (FBM) and lean body mass (LBM) in PCa patients undergoing Degarelix. METHODS: This is a single-center prospective study, enrolling 29 non-metastatic PCa patients eligible to LHRH-antagonist from 2017 to 2019. All patients received monthly subcutaneous injection of Degarelix for 12 months. Changes in FBM and LBM between baseline and 12-month Degarelix, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, were the co-primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were changes in serum lipids, glucose profile and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) and ALMI/FBM ratio were assessed as post-hoc analyses. Linear mixed models with random intercept tested for estimated least squared means differences (EMD). RESULTS: FBM significantly increased after 12 months (EMD +2920.7, +13.8%, p < 0.001), whereas LBM remained stable (EMD −187.1, −0.3%, p = 0.8). No differences occurred in lipid profile. Glycated hemoglobin significantly increased and serum FSH significantly decreased. A significant inverse relationship was found between serum FSH and ALMI/FBM ratio after 12 month (r = −0.44, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The BLADE study prospectively evaluated changes in body composition after LHRH-antagonist. LHRH-antagonist therapy is associated to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes, but lean body mass and serum lipids are not affected. This may represent an additional evidence supporting the reduced cardiovascular risk associated with LHRH-antagonist. The role of FSH in influencing sarcopenic obesity in PCa after androgen deprivation deserves to be further explored.","Palumbo, Carlotta; Antonelli, Alessandro; Triggiani, Luca; Dalla Volta, Alberto; Maffezzoni, Filippo; Zamboni, Stefania; Borghetti, Paolo; Rinaudo, Luca; Valcamonico, Francesca; Maroldi, Roberto; Magrini, Stefano Maria; Simeone, Claudio; Berruti, Alfredo",Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41391-021-00345-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723362/,257

A Longitudinal Twitter Analysis (JANUARY-APRIL 2020),2020-12-10,"Chikungunya fever is a mosquito-borne viral illness characterized by a sudden onset of fever associated with joint pains. It was first described in the 1950s during a Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak in southern Tanzania and has since (re-) emerged and spread to several other geographical areas, reaching large populations and causing massive epidemics. In recent years, CHIKV has gained considerable attention due to its quick spread to the Caribbean and then in the Americas, with many cases reported between 2014 and 2017. CHIKV has further garnered attention due to the clinical diagnostic difficulties when Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) viruses are simultaneously present. In this review, topical CHIKV-related issues, such as epidemiology and transmission, are examined. The different manifestations of infection (acute, chronic and atypical) are described and a particular focus is placed upon the diagnostic handling in the case of ZIKV and DENV co-circulating. Natural and synthetic compounds under evaluation for treatment of chikungunya disease, including drugs already licensed for other purposes, are also discussed. Finally, previous and current vaccine strategies, as well as the control of the CHIKV transmission through an integrated vector management, are reviewed in some detail.","Silva, José V.J.; Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F.; Oliveira-Filho, Edmilson F. de; Oliveira, Renato A.S.; Durães-Carvalho, Ricardo; Lopes, Thaísa R.R.; Silva, Daisy E.A.; Gil, Laura H.V.G.",Acta Trop,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X18309379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30195666/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001706X18309379; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.09.003,257

The Pain Assessment in Impaired Cognition-15 (PAIC15) covers 15 items that indicate pain, but it is unclear how probable pain is, for each summed score (range 0–45). We aimed to determine sensitivity and specificity of cut-offs for probable pain on the PAIC15 against three standards: (1) self-report when able, (2) the established Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) cut-off of 2, and (3) observer’s overall estimate based on a series of systematic observations. We used data of 238 nursing home residents with dementia who were observed by their physician in training or nursing staff in the context of an evidence-based medicine (EBM) training study, with re-assessment after 2 months in 137 residents. The area under the ROC curve was excellent against the PAINAD cut-off (≥0.8) but acceptable or less than acceptable for the other two standards. Across standards and criteria for optimal sensitivity and specificity, PAIC15 scores of 3 and higher represent possible pain for screening in practice, with sensitivity and specificity against self-report in the 0.5 to 0.7 range. While sensitivity for screening in practice may be too low, a cut-off of 4 is reasonable to indicate probable pain in research.","van der Steen, Jenny T.; Westzaan, Andrew; Hanemaayer, Kimberley; Muhamad, Muhamad; de Waal, Margot W.

Reservoir management consists of both the fluid production and reinjection of brine to the underground. The management of wells is important to ensure the sustainability of the reservoir. Thus, the flow rate control systems are essential to protect geothermal reservoirs under long-term power production. The second issue is the daily change in electricity prices and the load change process is complex because geothermal well controls are not flexible operations. The well management thus requires control approaches, and fuzzy control can be one effective solution. In this study, a fuzzy control system has been developed to control flow rates of the wells in Kızıldere geothermal field and its performance has been compared with the real data taken from the Kızıldere Power Plant. The results of comparison show that the fuzzy controllers achieved the target energy production in two hours instead of five hours, compared to the real data.

Similar to findings evaluating the airway, there was no difference in tissue ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in EoE or EG when compared with control non-EoE/EG esophagus/stomach. ACE2 gene expression was significantly lower in esophagi from children with or without EoE and from adults with EoE as compared with normal adult esophagi.

Currently, several clinical trials are underway to identify specific drugs for the treatment of this novel virus. The inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is necessary for the blockage of the viral replication. Here, in this study, we have utilized a blind molecular docking approach to identify the possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, by screening a total of 33 molecules which includes natural products, anti-virals, anti-fungals, anti-nematodes and anti-protozoals. All the studied molecules could bind to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 protease (PDB: 6Y84), out of which rutin (a natural compound) has the highest inhibitor efficiency among the 33 molecules studied, followed by ritonavir (control drug), emetine (anti-protozoal), hesperidin (a natural compound), lopinavir (control drug) and indinavir (anti-viral drug). All the molecules, studied out here could bind near the crucial catalytic residues, HIS41 and CYS145 of the main protease, and the molecules were surrounded by other active site residues like MET49, GLY143, HIS163, HIS164, GLU166, PRO168, and GLN189. As this study is based on molecular docking, hence being particular about the results obtained, requires extensive wet-lab experimentation and clinical trials under in vitro as well as in vivo conditions.

HFMD predominantly infects children under seven years old and occasionally causes severe disease in adults. Among the enteroviruses, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus 16 (CA16) are the major causative agents of HFMD. In addition, adenovirus cocirculates with enterovirus and has become a possible additional pathogenic factor for HFMD in some cases. Here, we have investigated the neutralizing antibody responses to both enterovirus and adenovirus in adults, with the aim of exploring the prevalence trends of these viruses and the nature of protective immunity in humans to these viral infections. Sera from 391 healthy adults from 21 provinces and cities in China were tested for the presence of antibodies against EV71, CA16, adenovirus human serotype 5 (AdHu5) and chimpanzee adenovirus pan7 (AdC7) using neutralization tests. High seroprevalence rates of EV71, CA16 and AdHu5 were found in the population (85.7%, 58.8% and 74.2%, respectively). The coseropositivity rate of these three viruses was 39.4% (154 of 391), with median neutralizing antibody titers of 80, 40 and 640, respectively, and the neutralizing antibody titer for EV71 was found to be correlated with those of CA16 and AdHu5. AdC7 was found to be a rare adenovirus serotype in the human population, with a seropositivity rate of 11.8%, suggesting that it could be a good choice for a vaccine carrier that could be used in vaccine development.","Wang, Xiang; Xing, Man; Zhang, Chao; Yang, Yong; Chi, Yudan; Tang, Xinying; Zhang, Hongbo; Xiong, Sidong; Yu, Luogang; Zhou, Dongming",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038738/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2014.30,257

The study hypothesis was that this exceptional situation temporarily altered childhood trauma epidemiology. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study was performed during the 8 weeks of lockdown. Pediatric traumatology emergency activity was compared to that during the same period in the previous 3 years. RESULTS: During lockdown, emergency consultations decreased by 50%. The number of patients operated on was 86% of that in the previous 3 years. Patients operated on during lockdown had a mean age of 7.6 years (median, 7.5 years) compared to 9.3 years (9.4 years). The rate of domestic accidents (59% versus 23%) and trampoline accidents (16% versus 5%) increased, while those of sport and locomotion-related accidents decreased. Wounds were more frequent, at 35% of procedures, versus 13% previously. The rate of surgery for upper-limb fracture deceased, while that of lower-limb fracture was unchanged. Distal forearm fracture was less frequent, as was distal tibial fracture. DISCUSSION: The present study found a 50% decrease in pediatric traumatology emergency activity during lockdown, without decrease in surgery. In case of renewed lockdown, we recommend reorganizing emergency admission to free teams for management of Covid-19 patients, while maintaining operative rooms for emergency surgery. A general public information campaign could help prevent domestic accidents and risk related to use of trampolines.

Inicialmente se reportó que en los pacientes con progresión grave de la COVID-19 existía una mortalidad elevada, los cuales tenían antecedentes de sufrir de hipertensión arterial, diabetes mellitus, enfermedad cardiovascular y enfermedad renal crónica. Parte de estos pacientes también tenían en común que utilizaban IECA, lo cual alertó a la comunidad médica sobre su riesgo potencial en coexistencia con COVID-19. Sin embargo, estudios más recientes de casos-controles encontraron que los inhibidores del sistema renina-angiotensina, incluyendo los IECA, no incrementan el riesgo de COVID-19 o de requerir admisión hospitalaria por esta causa. Diferentes revistas científicas han facilitado el acceso a reportes preliminares, dejando a discreción de la comunidad médica y científica hacer uso de dicha información para promover el desarrollo de estudios que confirmen experimentalmente dichos hallazgos, preclínicos y epidemiológicos, que finalmente impacten en las decisiones de la práctica clínica para beneficiar a los pacientes con COVID-19.

Abstract There is limited evidence for determining the impact of the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) in the tendency to worsening of coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19). It was initially reported that, in patients with serious progression of COVID-19, there was an increased mortality in those that had a history of suffering arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. A proportion of these patients also had in common that they used ACE-I, which alerted the medical community on the potential risk in coexisting with COVID-19. However, in more recent case-control studies, they found that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, including ACE-I, does not increase the risk of COVID-19 or require hospital admission due to this cause. Several scientific journals have provided access to preliminary reports, leaving the use of such information at the discretion of the medical and scientific community for promoting the development of studies that might confirm these preclinical and epidemiological findings experimentally. These may finally have an impact on the clinical practice decisions, in order to benefit patients with COVID-19. In this literature review, the different effects mediated by ACE-I that could be related to the immune response during the infection and transmission of COVID-19 are examined, gathering available evidence that evaluates whether, in reality, they represent a risk or if on the other hand, they confer a protector effect.","Ardila, Dora Lucía Vallejo; Cáceres, Yenny Rocío Tamayo; Munive, Abraham Alí",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0120563320300942; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0120563320300942?v=s5,257

It can be used to capture possible smog-related public health disasters in its early stage. We then propose a predictive analytic approach that utilizes both social media and physical sensor data to forecast the next day smog-related health hazard. First, we model smog-related health hazards and smog severity through mining raw microblogging text and network information diffusion data. Second, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to forecast smog-related health hazard with the current health hazard and smog severity observations. We evaluate the performance of the approach with other alternative machine learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate social media and physical sensor data for smog-related health hazard forecasting. The empirical findings can help researchers to better understand the non-linear relationships between the current smog observations and the next day health hazard.

One of the ways for prevention of Covid-19 is by disabling its spike protein which results in inhibiting its binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). The other alternative is to inhibit its replication once inside the body. The aim of this study was to explore the literature to identify whether there were any Ayurvedic remedies which contained ingredients which demonstrated this dual effect. METHODS: :In silico studies were carried out to find the structures of the targets i.e. spike protein of the virus and its main protease (Mpro). Databases were searched to identify the composition of Ayurvedic decoctions used for respiratory ailments. RESULTS: : We have found that two components out of 26 active ingredients of Ayurvedic decoction are strong binders for spike protein as well as corresponding Mpro (3CL protease) which plays an essential role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive antiviral drug target. Out of 26 components of Ayurvedic herbal decoction used for influenza, one compound was found to be most active. It is a well-known antioxidant, antinflammatory and hepatoprotective molecule. CONCLUSION: : The resultant compound could act as a repurposed drug or like other methoxyphenols, could be a good lead molecule for a potent drug for Covid-19.","Shukla, Richa; Singh, Sangeeta; Singh, Anirudh; Misra, Krishna",Eur J Integr Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876382020314499?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101268; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876382020314499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520014/,257

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study and identified 13 kidney transplant recipients (10 living and 3 deceased donors) with recurrent COVID-19, and here we report demographics, immunosuppression regimens, clinical profiles, treatments, and outcomes. RESULTS COVID-19 second infection rate was 0.9% (13/1350) in kidney transplant recipients with a median age of 46 years; median time interval from transplant to first episode of COVID-19 diagnosis was 9.2 months (interquartile range, 2.2-46.5 months). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (84%) and diabetes (23%). Fever was significantly less common with recurrent COVID-19. COVID-19 severity ranged from asymptomatic (23%), mild (31%), and moderate (46%) during the first infection and asymptomatic (8%), mild (46%), and severe (46%) in the second infection. All 6 kidney transplant recipients with severe second infections died. The median interval between the 2 episodes based upon reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction COVID-19- positive tests was 135 days (interquartile range, 71-274 days) without symptoms. Statistically signi - ficant risk factors for mortality were dyspnea (P = .04), disease severity (P = .004), allograft dysfunction (P < .05), higher levels of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = .05), and intensive care unit/ventilator requirement (P = .004). Although our limited resources did not allow for molecular diagnostics and typing, we suggest that these second episodes were reinfections with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the largest study of kidney transplant recipients with reoccurring SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we observed 46% mortality.","Kute, Vivek B; Hegde, Umapati; Das, Pratik; Sharma, Ashish; Bahadur, Madan M; Sil, Keshab; Guleria, Sandeep; Varma, Prem P; Jamale, Tukaram; Meshram, Hari Shankar",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.6002/ect.2021.0284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34498549/,257
621261,Mental health of surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic: an urgent need for intervention,2020-09-14,"BACKGROUND: In 2018, about 10 million people were found infected by tuberculosis, with approximately 1.2 million deaths worldwide. Despite these numbers have been relatively stable in recent years, tuberculosis is still considered one of the top 10 deadliest diseases worldwide. Over the years, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has developed a form of resistance to first-line tuberculosis treatments, specifically to isoniazid, leading to multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. In this context, the EU and Indian DBT funded project STriTuVaD—In Silico Trial for Tuberculosis Vaccine Development—is supporting the identification of new interventional strategies against tuberculosis thanks to the use of Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS), a computational framework capable of predicting the immunity induced by specific drugs such as therapeutic vaccines and antibiotics. RESULTS: Here, we present how UISS accurately simulates tuberculosis dynamics and its interaction within the immune system, and how it predicts the efficacy of the combined action of isoniazid and RUTI vaccine in a specific digital population cohort. Specifically, we simulated two groups of 100 digital patients. The first group was treated with isoniazid only, while the second one was treated with the combination of RUTI vaccine and isoniazid, according to the dosage strategy described in the clinical trial design. UISS-TB shows to be in good agreement with clinical trial results suggesting that RUTI vaccine may favor a partial recover of infected lung tissue. CONCLUSIONS: In silico trials innovations represent a powerful pipeline for the prediction of the effects of specific therapeutic strategies and related clinical outcomes. Here, we present a further step in UISS framework implementation. Specifically, we found that the simulated mechanism of action of RUTI and INH are in good alignment with the results coming from past clinical phase IIa trials.","Russo, Giulia; Sgroi, Giuseppe; Parasiliti Palumbo, Giuseppe Alessandro; Pennisi, Marzio; Juarez, Miguel A.; Cardona, Pere-Joan; Motta, Santo; Walker, Kenneth B.; Fichera, Epifanio; Viceconti, Marco; Pappalardo, Francesco",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308139/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03762-5,257

The cumulative caseload data were extracted from regional epidemics in Italy. Epidemic features in regions where lockdown was applied early were compared to those where lockdown was applied later for statistical differences. There were statistically significant differences in the timing of the peak, the cumulative incidence at peak and the case/km2 at peak between regions where the lockdown had been applied early and those where it was applied late. The peak occurred 7 days earlier with four times less cases/km2 in regions where the lockdown was applied within 10 days of the start of the epidemic. Cumulative caseloads, cases/km2 and/or the number of days into an epidemic can be used to plan future localised suppression measures as part of a national postlockdown policy.

This study aimed to evaluate the longitudinal changes in their physical and psychological states with respect to gender in rehabilitation outpatients between the pre-nationwide (T1) and post-nationwide state of emergency (T2) caused by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Gait speed (GS), timed up and go (TUG), handgrip strength (HG), and maximum phonation time (MPT) were measured as indices of physical status. The Japanese version of the Apathy Scale and five-level EuroQoL five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) were used to assess the psychological state. Both states were measured in the male and female groups at T1 and T2 and then were compared. The final analysis was comprised of 13 outpatients. In males, the physical (GS, p = 0.463; TUG, p = 0.600; HG, p = 0.753; and MPT, p = 0.249) and psychological (Apathy Scale, p = 0.891 and EQ-5D-5L, p = 0.249) states did not change significantly between T1 and T2. In the females, the physical (GS, p = 0.600; TUG, p = 0.735; HG, p = 1.000; and MPT, p = 0.310) and psychological (Apathy Scale, p = 0.588 and EQ-5D-5L, p = 0.176) states also did not show significant change between T1 and T2.

RESULTS: Primer sequence is converted to a vector of the full potential hydrogen numbers (3 for G or C, 2 for A or T), while template sequence is converted to a vector of the actual hydrogen bond numbers formed after primer annealing. The former is considered as source information and the latter destination information. An information coefficient is calculated as a measure for fidelity of this information transfer process and thus a measure of similarity between primer and potential annealing site on template. CONCLUSION: Successful prediction of PCR products from whole genomic sequences with a computer program based on the algorithm demonstrated the potential of this new algorithm in areas like in silico PCR and gene finding.","Cao, Youfang; Wang, Lianjie; Xu, Kexue; Kou, Chunhai; Zhang, Yulei; Wei, Guifang; He, Junjian; Wang, Yunfang; Zhao, Liping",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16042814/,257

In order to evaluate the comparative barrier performance effect of face masks and face shields, we used an aerosol generator and a particle counter to evaluate the performance of the various devices in comparable situations. We tested different configurations in an experimental setup with manikin heads wearing masks (surgical type I), face shields (22.5 cm high with overhang under the chin of 7 cm and circumference of 35 cm) on an emitter or a receiver manikin head, or both. The manikins were face to face, 25 cm apart, with an intense particle emission (52.5 L/min) for 30 s. The particle counter calculated the total cumulative particles aspirated on a volume of 1.416 L In our experimental conditions, when the receiver alone wore a protection, the face shield was more effective (reduction factor = 54.8%), while reduction was lower with a mask (reduction factor = 21.8%) (p = 0.002). The wearing of a protective device by the emitter alone reduced the level of received particles by 96.8% for both the mask and face shield (p = NS). When both the emitter and receiver manikin heads wore a face shield, the protection allowed for better results in our experimental conditions: 98% reduction for the face shields versus 97.3% for the masks (p = 0.01). Face shields offered an even better barrier effect than the mask against small inhaled particles (<0.3 µm–0.3 to 0.5 µm–0.5 to 1 µm) in all configurations. Therefore, it would be interesting to include face shields as used in our experimental study as part of strategies to reduce transmission within the community setting.","Wendling, Jean-Michel; Fabacher, Thibaut; Pébaÿ, Philippe-Pierre; Cosperec, Isabelle; Rochoy, Michaël",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33671300/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041942,257

INTRODUCTION: COVID‐19 has created widespread global transmission. Rapid increase in individuals infected with COVID‐19 prompted significant public health responses from governments globally. However, the social and economic impact on communities may leave some individuals more susceptible to the detrimental effects. METHODS: A three‐step search strategy was used to find published and unpublished papers. Databases searched included: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. All identified citations were uploaded into Endnote X9, with duplicates removed. Methodological quality of eligible papers was assessed by two reviewers, with meta‐synthesis conducted in accordance with JBI methodology. RESULTS: Fifteen papers were included. Three synthesized‐conclusions were established (a) Vulnerable populations groups, particularly those from a racial minority and those with low incomes, are more susceptible and have been disproportionately affected by COVID‐19 including mortality; (b) Gender inequalities and family violence have been exacerbated by COVID‐19, leading to diminished wellbeing among women; and (c) COVID‐19 is exacerbating existing social determinants of health through loss of employment/income, disparities in social class leading to lack of access to health care, housing instability, homelessness, and difficulties in physical distancing.

Border screening typically consists of arriving individuals being thermally scanned for signs of fever and/or completing a survey to declare any possible symptoms, and while more thorough testing typically exists, these would generally prove more disruptive to deploy. In this paper, we utilise epidemiological data and Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the potential success rate of deploying border screening for a range of diseases (including the current COVID-19 pandemic) in varying outbreak scenarios. We negate the issue of testing precision by assuming a perfect test is used; our outputs then represent the best-case scenario. We then use these outputs to briefly explore the types of scenarios where the implementation of border screening could prove most effective. Our models only considers screening implemented at airports, due to air travel being the predominant method of international travel. Primary results showed that in the best-case scenario, screening has the potential to detect 46.4%, 12.9% and 4.0% of travellers infected with influenza, SARS and ebola respectively, while screening for COVID-19 could potentially detect 12.0% of infected travellers.

However, it is unknown whether eosinophil counts could serve as a predictor of the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1004 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China, were enrolled in this study, including 905 patients in the general ward and 99 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We reviewed their medical data to analyze the association between eosinophils and ICU admission and death. RESULTS: Of our 1004 patients with COVID-19, low eosinophil counts/ratios were observed in severe cases. After adjusting for confounders that could have affected the outcome, we found that eosinophil counts might not be a predictor of ICU admission. In 99 ICU patients, 58 of whom survived and 41 of whom died, low eosinophil level was an indicator of death in severe COVID-19 patients with a cutoff value of 0.04 × 109/L, which had an area under the curve of 0.665 (95% CI = 1.089-17.839; P = .045) with sensitivity and specificity of 0.569 and 0.7317, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our research revealed that a low eosinophil level is a predictor of death in ICU patients rather than a cause of ICU admission.","Xuan, Wei; Jiang, Xuliang; Huang, Lili; Pan, Shuting; Chen, Caiyang; Zhang, Xiao; Zhu, Hui; Zhang, Song; Yu, Weifeng; Peng, Zhiyong; Su, Diansan",J Intensive Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1177/08850666211037326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34550036/,257

Herein, we conducted a review of the literature of the influenza pandemics of the 20th century; and of the coronavirus and influenza pandemics of the 21st century. Influenza and coronavirus pandemics are zoonoses that spread rapidly in consistent seasonal patterns during an initial wave of infection and subsequent waves of spread. For all of their differences in the state of available medical technologies, global population changes, and social and geopolitical factors surrounding each pandemic, there are remarkable similarities among them. While vaccination of high-risk groups is advocated as an instrumental mode of interrupting pandemics, non-pharmacological interventions including avoidance of mass gatherings, school closings, case isolation, contact tracing, and the implementation of infection prevention strategies in healthcare settings represent the cornerstone to halting transmission. In conjunction with lessons learned from previous pandemics, the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes the basis for delineating best practices to confront future pandemics.","Mujica, Graciela; Sternberg, Zane; Solis, Jamie; Wand, Taylor; Carrasco, Peter; Henao-Martínez, Andrés F.; Franco-Paredes, Carlos",Trop Med Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed5040182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33266051/,257

Real-time RT-PCR is the most commonly used method for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, serological assays are urgently needed as complementary tools to RT-PCR. Hachim et al. 2020 and Burbelo et al. 2020 demonstrated that anti-nucleocapsid(N) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are higher and appear earlier than the spike antibodies. Additionally, cross-reactive antibodies against N protein are more prevalent than those against spike protein. We developed a less cross-reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG) indirect ELISA by using a truncated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein as assay antigen. A highly conserved region of coronaviruses N protein was deleted and the protein was prepared using an E. coli protein expression system. A total of 177 samples collected from COVID-19 suspected cases and 155 negative control sera collected during the pre-COVID-19 period were applied to evaluate the assay’s performance, with the plaque reduction neutralization test and the commercial SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG ELISA as gold standards. The SARS-CoV-2 N truncated protein-based ELISA showed similar sensitivity (91.1% vs. 91.9%) and specificity (93.8% vs. 93.8%) between the PRNT and spike IgG ELISA, as well as also higher specificity compared to the full-length N protein (93.8% vs. 89.9%).

Identification and characterization of novel antigenic APP vaccine candidates are underway. In the present study, we use an immunoproteomic approach to identify APP protein antigens that may elicit an immune response in serotype 1 naturally infected swine and serotype 1 virulent strain S259-immunized rabbits. RESULTS: Proteins from total cell lysates of serotype 1 APP were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). Western blot analysis revealed 21 immunoreactive protein spots separated in the pH 4-7 range and 4 spots in the pH 7-11 range with the convalescent sera from swine; we found 5 immunoreactive protein spots that separated in the pH 4-7 range and 2 in the pH 7-11 range with hyperimmune sera from S259-immunized rabbits. The proteins included the known antigens ApxIIA, protective surface antigen D15, outer membrane proteins P5, subunit NqrA. The remaining antigens are being reported as immunoreactive proteins in APP for the first time, to our knowledge.

AIMS: To describe the COVID‐19 impact on medical oncology care provision in an Australian setting. METHODS: Calvary Mater Newcastle and Newcastle Private Hospital medical oncology data from 1 February to 31 April 2019 versus 2020 were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty‐four inpatient admissions occurred in 2020, 21% less than in 2019. Total inpatient days decreased by 22% (2842 vs 2203). April was most impacted (36% and 44% fewer admissions and inpatient days respectively). Mean length of stay remained unchanged (6.4 vs 6.2 days, P = 0.7). In all, 5072 outpatient consultations were conducted, including 417 new‐patient consultations (4% and 6% increase on 2019 respectively). Telephone consultations (0 vs 1380) replaced one‐quarter of face‐to‐face consultations (4859 vs 3623, −25%), with minimal telehealth use (6 vs 69). Day Treatment Centre encounters remained stable (3751 vs 3444, −8%). The proportion of new patients planned for palliative treatment decreased (35% vs 28%, P = 0.04), observation increased (16% vs 23%, P = 0.04) and curative intent treatment was unchanged (both 41%). Recruiting clinical trials decreased by one‐third (45 vs 30), two trials were activated (vs 5 in 2019) and 45% fewer patients consented to trial participation (62 vs 34). CONCLUSION: Our medical oncology teams adapted rapidly to COVID‐19 with significant changes to care provision, including fewer hospital admissions, a notable transition to telephone‐based outpatient clinics and reduced clinical trial activity.

This is an extremely challenging task given the constraints in small‐scale manufacturing for clinical trials, clinical testing timelines involving multiple phases and large‐scale drug substance and drug product manufacturing. To tackle these challenges, regulatory processes are fast‐tracked, and rapid‐response manufacturing platform technologies are used. Here, we evaluate the current progress, challenges ahead and potential solutions for providing vaccines for pandemic response at an unprecedented scale and rate. Emerging rapid‐response vaccine platform technologies, especially RNA platforms, offer a high productivity estimated at over 1 billion doses per year with a small manufacturing footprint and low capital cost facilities. The self‐amplifying RNA (saRNA) drug product cost is estimated at below 1 USD/dose. These manufacturing processes and facilities can be decentralized to facilitate production, distribution, but also raw material supply. The RNA platform technology can be complemented by an a priori Quality by Design analysis aided by computational modeling in order to assure product quality and further speed up the regulatory approval processes when these platforms are used for epidemic or pandemic response in the future.","Kis, Zoltán; Kontoravdi, Cleo; Dey, Antu K.; Shattock, Robin; Shah, Nilay",Journal of advanced manufacturing and processing,https://doi.org/10.1002/amp2.10060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33977274/,257

So far, no therapeutics have yet proven to be effective. Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in China because of its in vitro activity. However, evidence supporting its clinical use with good efficacy is still lacking. Methods A total of 208 confirmed severe COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in Wuhan Union West Campus between 1 February 2020 and 10 March 2020 were enrolled in the retrospective study. Patients were divided into two groups based on the use of ribavirin. The primary endpoint was the time to clinical improvement. The secondary endpoints included mortality, survival time, time to throat swab SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negative conversion, and the length of hospital stay. Results 68 patients were treated with ribavirin while 140 not. There were no significant between-group differences in demographic characteristics, baseline laboratory test results, treatment, and distribution of ordinal scale scores at enrollment, except for coexisting diseases especially cancer (ribavirin group vs no ribavirin group, P = 0.01). Treatment with ribavirin was not associated with a difference in the time to clinical improvement (P = 0.48, HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.63-1.25).

Besides endocrine therapy and targeted agents, chemotherapy is often used in the treatment of this disease. However, lack of tumor specificity and toxicity associated with dose exposure limit the manageability of cytotoxic agents. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel and evolving class of antineoplastic agents. By merging the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies with the cytotoxic properties of chemotherapy, researchers aim to optimize the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs. Some of these compounds, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan, showed activity not only in HER2-positive, but also in HER2-low BC patients, possibly due to the bystander effect. In this review, the current clinical landscape about ADC development for BC treatment will be discussed, as well as the possible limitations of this treatment class. ABSTRACT: Metastatic breast cancer (BC) is currently an incurable disease. Besides endocrine therapy and targeted agents, chemotherapy is often used in the treatment of this disease. However, lack of tumor specificity and toxicity associated with dose exposure limit the manageability of cytotoxic agents. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are a relatively new class of anticancer drugs. By merging the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies with the cytotoxic properties of chemotherapy, they improve the therapeutic index of antineoplastic agents. Three core components characterize ADCs: the antibody, directed to a target antigen; the payload, typically a cytotoxic agent; a linker, connecting the antibody to the payload. The most studied target antigen is HER2 with some agents, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan, showing activity not only in HER2-positive, but also in HER2-low BC patients, possibly due to a bystander effect. This property to provide a cytotoxic impact also against off-target cancer cells may overcome the intratumoral heterogeneity of some target antigens. Other cancer-associated antigens represent a strategy for the development of ADCs against triple-negative BC, as shown by the recent approval of sacituzumab govitecan. In this review, we discuss the current landscape of ADC development for the treatment of BC, as well as the possible limitations of this treatment.","Corti, Chiara; Giugliano, Federica; Nicolò, Eleonora; Ascione, Liliana; Curigliano, Giuseppe",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207890/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13122898,257

Since UVGI was developed and refined more than 80–90 years ago, the ultraviolet source of choice has been almost exclusively the low‐pressure mercury vapor discharge lamp. Today, with new lamp technologies, there has been significant interest in the application of ultraviolet light‐emitting diodes and excimer lamps that emit in the UV‐C (180–280 nm) spectral band.

The increasing number of confirmed cases during the quarantine period of ‘Diamond Princess’ questioned the efficiency and science behind the Japanese government's emergency management of the outbreak and led to a debate on the responsibilities of the ship's country of registry and port country. In order to deal with the spread of virus on a cruise ship rationally, the present study analyses why cruise ships are more prone to an emergent epidemic and discusses requirements of international conventions and domestic laws on cruise ship sanitation and epidemic prevention. It also evaluates the rescue responsibility of Flag State and Port State, explores the legal lacunae of international conventions on the rescue obligation of cruise home port, and provides solutions for prevention and control of cruise ship epidemic with short-term response measures and long-term mechanism construction. In terms of a short-term response, it is vital to adopt the quarantine idea of a ‘temporary cabin hospital’ and a disposal procedure of ‘circular disinfection-section repeat testing-batch transfer and quarantine-international collaborative medical treatment’. For a long-term mechanism construction, three aspects need to be considered: the risk emergency management mechanism of cruise lines, health and epidemic prevention supervision mechanisms, and international cooperation mechanisms of infectious disease prevention.","Liu, Xiaofei; Chang, Yen-Chiang",Mar Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834406/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X20302451; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0308597X20302451; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104093,257

Here we studied the response trajectories of antibodies directed to the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike glycoprotein and in vitro SARS-CoV-2 live virus neutralizing titers (VN) in 175 convalescent donors longitudinally sampled for up to 142 days post onset of symptoms (DPO). We observed robust IgM, IgG, and viral neutralization responses to SARS-CoV-2 that persist, in the aggregate, for at least 100 DPO. However, there is a notable decline in VN titers ≥160 for convalescent plasma therapy, starting 60 DPO. The results also show that individuals 30 years of age or younger have significantly lower VN, IgG and IgM antibody titers than those in the older age groups; and individuals with greater disease severity also have significantly higher IgM and IgG antibody titers. Taken together, these findings define the optimal window for donating convalescent plasma useful for immunotherapy of COVID-19 patients and reveal important predictors of an ideal plasma donor.","Gontu, Abhinay; Srinivasan, Sreenidhi; Salazar, Eric; Nair, Meera Surendran; Nissly, Ruth H.; Greenawalt, Denver; Bird, Ian M.; Herzog, Catherine M.; Ferrari, Matthew J.; Poojary, Indira; Katani, Robab; Lindner, Scott E.; Minns, Allen M.; Rossi, Randall; Christensen, Paul A.; Castillo, Brian; Chen, Jian; Eagar, Todd N.; Yi, Xin; Zhao, Picheng; Leveque, Christopher; Olsen, Randall J.; Bernard, David W.; Gollihar, Jimmy; Kuchipudi, Suresh V.; Musser, James M.; Kapur, Vivek",Commun Biol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-01813-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627795/,257

The present study aimed to assess the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the three metropolitan cities of Pakistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted in 276 HCWs from April 10, 2020, to June 5, 2020. Depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) were used for the mental health assessment of the HCWs. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (MLRA) was performed to measure the association between the demographics and the occurrence of depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS). RESULTS: The frequency of DAS in the HCWs was 10.1%, 25.4%, and 7.3%, respectively. The MLRA showed that the depression in HCWs was significantly associated with the profession (P<0.001). The anxiety in HCWs was significantly associated with their age (P=0.005), profession (P<0.05), and residence (P<0.05). The stress in HCWs was significantly associated with their age (P<0.05).

While there have been several reviews published on COVID-19 and population health disparities generally—including some with attention to HIV—none has focused on sexual health (ie, STI care, female sexual health, sexual behaviour). We have conducted a scoping review focused on sexual health (excluding reproductive health (RH), intimate partner violence (IPV) and gender-based violence (GBV)) in the COVID-19 era, examining sexual behaviours and sexual health outcomes. METHODS: A scoping review, compiling both peer-reviewed and grey literature, focused on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and COVID-19 was conducted on 15 September 2020. Multiple bibliographical databases were searched. Study selection conformed to Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers’ Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. We only included English-language original studies. RESULTS: We found that men who have sex with men may be moving back toward pre-pandemic levels of sexual activity, and that STI and HIV testing rates seem to have decreased. There was minimal focus on outcomes such as the economic impact on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and STI care, especially STI care of marginalised populations. In terms of population groups, there was limited focus on sex workers or on women, especially women’s sexual behaviour and mental health. We noticed limited use of qualitative techniques. Very few studies were in low/middle-income countries (LMICs).

We aimed to explore how healthcare workers experienced the preparedness period of COVID-19 pandemic, in order to ascertain the perceived weaknesses and strengths. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 17 participants encompassing senior physicians, residents, and nurses. They were audio-recorded, and the transcription was verbatim. We used thematic analysis. RESULTS: We identified four themes, with subsequent subthemes: dealing with the unknown, human versus doctors, sense of helplessness, and a bridge to heaven, which explore how healthcare workers experienced the lack of knowledge, their feeling of losing control, and how they managed their internal fights. The disappointment provoked by the authorities and their colleagues was further evaluated. We identified factors involved in their well-being. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic represented and will still pose a challenge for healthcare workers (HCWs) from all over the world. They felt unprepared for such a crisis. Further measures should be implemented in every hospital to maintain HCWs awareness and to prevent physical imbalance. Appropriate standards of care should be further stated by the authorities so that the healthcare providers may find easier a balance between their safety and their patients’ needs.

This study aimed to analyse the changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviours in Spanish university students before and during the confinement by COVID-19 with special focus on gender. We also analysed enjoyment, the tools used and motivation and impediments for doing physical activity. An online questionnaire, which included the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form and certain “ad hoc” questions, was designed. Students were recruited by distributing an invitation through the administrative channels of 16 universities and a total of 13,754 valid surveys were collected. Overall, university students reduced moderate (−29.5%) and vigorous (−18.3%) physical activity during the confinement and increased sedentary time (+52.7%). However, they spent more time on high intensity interval training (HIIT) (+18.2%) and mind-body activities (e.g., yoga) (+80.0%). Adaptation to the confinement, in terms of physical activity, was handled better by women than by men.

Michigan Medicine, a primary regional centre, provided an ideal setting for studying testing patterns during the first wave of the pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To identify the characteristics of patients who underwent repeated testing for COVID‐19 and determine if repeated testing was associated with downstream outcomes amongst positive cases. METHODS: Characteristics, test results, and health outcomes for patients presenting for a COVID‐19 diagnostic test were collected. We examined whether patient characteristics differed with repeated testing and estimated a false‐negative rate for the test. We then studied repeated testing patterns in patients with severe COVID‐19‐related outcomes. RESULTS: Patient age, sex, body mass index, neighbourhood poverty levels, pre‐existing type 2 diabetes, circulatory, kidney, and liver diseases, and cough, fever/chills, and pain symptoms 14 days prior to a first test were associated with repeated testing. Amongst patients with a positive result, age (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: (1.05, 1.34)) and pre‐existing kidney diseases (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: (1.41, 3.68)) remained significant. Hospitalization (OR: 7.88; 95% CI: (5.15, 12.26)) and ICU‐level care (OR: 6.93; 95% CI: (4.44, 10.92)) were associated with repeated testing. The estimated false‐negative rate was 23.8% (95% CI: (19.5%, 28.5%)). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst most patients were tested once and received a negative result, a meaningful subset underwent multiple rounds of testing. These results shed light on testing patterns and have important implications for understanding the variation of repeated testing results within and between patients.","Salerno, S.; Zhao, Z.; Prabhu Sankar, S.; Salvatore, M.; Gu, T.; Fritsche, L.

Although this enzyme constitutes a plausible target in treatment of advanced cancer, there are few known LDH-A inhibitors. STUDY DESIGN: In this work, we utilized a high-throughput enzyme micro-array format to screen and evaluate > 900 commonly used medicinal plant extracts (0.00001-.5 mg/ml) for capacity to inhibit activity of recombinant full length human LDHA; EC .1.1.1.27. METHODOLOGY: The protein sequence of purified enzyme was confirmed using 1D gel electrophoresis- MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, enzyme activity was validated by oxidation of NADH (500μM) and kinetic inhibition established in the presence of a known inhibitor (Oxalic Acid). RESULTS: Of the natural extracts tested, the lowest IC(50)s [<0.001 mg/ml] were obtained by: Chinese Gallnut (Melaphis chinensis gallnut), Bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus), Kelp (Laminaria Japonica) and Babul (Acacia Arabica).

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection from a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute renal impairment has been observed in some patients with SARS. Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and laboratory features of the acute renal impairment complicating this new viral infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the plasma creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters of the 536 SARS patients with normal plasma creatinine at first clinical presentation, admitted to two regional hospitals following a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Kidney tissues from seven other patients with postmortem examinations were studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Among these 536 patients with SARS, 36 (6.7%) developed acute renal impairment occurring at a median duration of 20 days (range 5–48 days) after the onset of viral infection despite a normal plasma creatinine level at first clinical presentation. The acute renal impairment reflected the different prerenal and renal factors that exerted renal insult occurring in the context of multiorgan failure. Eventually, 33 SARS patients (91.7%) with acute renal impairment died. The mortality rate was significantly higher among patients with SARS and acute renal impairment compared with those with SARS and no renal impairment (91.7% vs. 8.8%) (P < 0.0001). Renal tissues revealed predominantly acute tubular necrosis with no evidence of glomerular pathology. The adjusted relative risk of mortality associated with the development of acute renal impairment was 4.057 (P < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and age were the most significant independent risk factors predicting the development of acute renal impairment in SARS. CONCLUSION: Acute renal impairment is uncommon in SARS but carries a high mortality. The acute renal impairment is likely to be related to multi-organ failure rather than the kidney tropism of the virus. The development of acute renal impairment is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with SARS.","Chu, Kwok Hong; Tsang, Wai Kay; Tang, Colin S.; Lam, Man Fai; Lai, Fernand M.; To, Ka Fai; Fung, Ka Shun; Tang, Hon Lok; Yan, Wing Wa; Chan, Hilda W.H.; Lai, Thomas S.T.; Tong, Kwok Lung; Lai, Kar Neng",Kidney Int,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253815505061; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815505061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15673319/,257

However, non-neurotropic viruses or peripheral viral infections pose a considerable challenge as their neuropathological manifestations do not emerge because of primary infection. Their secondary or bystander pathologies develop much later, like a syndrome, during and after the recovery of patients from the primary disease. Massive inflammation caused by peripheral viral infections can trigger multiple neurological anomalies. These neurological damages may range from a general cognitive and motor dysfunction up to a wide spectrum of CNS anomalies, such as Acute Necrotizing Hemorrhagic Encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Encephalitis, Meningitis, anxiety, and other audio-visual disabilities. Peripheral viruses like Measles virus, Enteroviruses, Influenza viruses (HIN1 series), SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and, recently, SARS-CoV-2 are reported to cause various neurological manifestations in patients and are proven to be neuropathogenic even in cellular and animal model systems. This review presents a comprehensive picture of CNS susceptibilities toward these peripheral viral infections and explains some common underlying themes of their neuropathology in the human brain.","Mishra, Ritu; Banerjea, Akhil C.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33013930/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.565521,257
641633,Transformative learning in early-career child and adolescent psychiatry in the pandemic,2021-02-28,SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause severe disease for which currently no specific therapy is available. The use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is controversial and its mode of action poorly understood. We demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity at the functional and epigenetic level and is accompanied by profound changes in the cellular lipidome as well as reduced expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Trained immunity comprises a functional adaptation induced by epigenetic reprogramming which facilitates the anti-viral innate immune response. Our findings therefore suggest that hydroxychloroquine may not have a beneficial effect on the anti-viral immune response to SARS-CoV-2.,"Rother, N.; Yanginlar, C.; Lindeboom, R. G.

Alere i RSV is a novel molecular rapid test which identifies respiratory syncytial virus in less than 13 min. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical performance of the Alere i RSV assay in a pediatric point-of-care setting during winter season 2016 / 2017. Test results from 518 nasopharyngeal swab samples were compared to a real-time reverse transcription PCR reference standard. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of the Alere i RSV test assay was 93% (CI(95) 89% – 96%) and 96% (CI(95) 93% – 98%), respectively. Alere i RSV performed well in children of all age groups. An optimal sensitivity of 98% (CI(95) 94% - 100%) and specificity of 96% (CI(95) 90% - 99%) was obtained in children < 6 months. In children ≥ 2 years, sensitivity and specificity remained at 87% (CI(95) 73% – 96%) and 98% (CI(95) 92% – 100%), respectively. False negative Alere i RSV test results mostly occurred in samples with low viral load (mean CT value 31.1; CI(95) 29.6 – 32.6). The Alere i RSV assay is easy to use and can be operated after minimal initial training. Test results are available within 13 min, with most RSV positive samples being identified after approximately 5 min. CONCLUSION: The Alere i RSV assay has the potential to facilitate the detection of RSV in pediatric point-of-care settings.

Infection with multiple pathogens occurs in many cases. Rapid diagnosis of these multiple infections is important for providing timely and effective treatment. To improve diagnosis, in this study, two new multiplex polymerase chain reactions (mPCRs) were developed for simultaneous detection of canine respiratory viruses (CRV) and canine enteric viruses (CEV) using two separate primer mixes. The viruses included canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine influenza virus (CIV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine circovirus (CanineCV), canine coronavirus (CCoV) and canine parvovirus (CPV). The sensitivity of the mPCR results showed that the detection limit of both mPCR methods was 1×10(4) viral copies. Twenty nasal swabs (NS) and 20 anal swabs (AS) collected from dogs with symptoms of respiratory disease or enteric disease were evaluated using the novel mPCR methods as a clinical test. The mPCR protocols, when applied to these respiratory specimens and intestinal samples, could detect 7 viruses simultaneously, allowing rapid investigation of CRV (CAV-2, CDV, CIV and CPIV) and CEV (CAV-2, CanineCV, CCoV and CPV) status and prompt evaluation of coinfection.

The extent to which this tool has been used and the evidence supporting its use in dermatology have not been systematically examined. Objective To perform a scoping review of the literature regarding SDM in dermatology. Evidence Review Searches of Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Sciverse Scopus, and EBM Reviews were conduced on July 11, 2019, and March 6, 2020. There were no limits on date, type of article, language, or subject for the initial search. A total of 1673 titles and abstracts were screened by 2 independent reviewers in the Covidence mixed-methods platform. Forty-one full-text studies were assessed for eligibility. For inclusion, articles needed to include a dermatologic diagnosis as well as discussion of SDM or patient decision aids. Two independent reviewers screened 29 full-text articles for inclusion and extracted qualitative data using a set of 26 predefined codes. Qualitative coding was applied to excerpts to categorize the article, define and describe advantages and disadvantages of SDM, understand patient and physician requests for SDM, and discuss methods of implementation. Findings Despite a small number of articles on SDM (n = 29) in dermatology, the selected literature provided consistent messages regarding the importance of SDM for dermatology and a number of strategies and tools for implementation. Medical dermatology was the most common subspecialty studied, with melanoma, psoriasis, and connective tissue diseases most examined. Only 5 publications introduced SDM tools specifically for dermatologic conditions; of these, only 2 tools were validated. Barriers to implementation that were cited included time and a lack of training for clinicians, although the literature also provided potential solutions to these issues. All articles emphasized the value of SDM for both patients and physicians. Conclusions and Relevance The literature regarding SDM in dermatology consistently suggests that it is a useful tool for providing patient-centered care. Established tools have been proposed since 2012. More research is needed to implement better practices, especially in dermatologic subspecialties. However, there are substantial suggestions from the literature for strategies and tools with which to begin a shared decision-making practice.","Morrison, Tessalyn; Johnson, Jacob; Baghoomian, Wenelia; Hamilton, Andrew; Simpson, Eric; Greiling, Teri; Foster, Erin",JAMA dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamadermatol.2020.5362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533921/,257

Imaging modalities enable evaluation of the character and extent of pulmonary lesions and monitoring of the disease course. The aim of this study was to verify the prognostic value of chest CT in COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of clinical data and CT scans of 156 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay hospitalized in the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior in Warsaw and in the Medical Centre in Łańcut, Poland. The total severity score (TSS) was used to quantify the extent of lung opacification in CT scans. RESULTS: The dominant pattern in discharged patients was ground-glass opacities, whereas in the non-survivors, the dominant pulmonary changes were consolidations. The non-survivors were more likely to have pleural effusion, pleural thickening, lymphadenopathy, air bronchogram, and bronchiolectasis. There were no statistically significant differences among the 3 analyzed groups (non-survivors, discharged patients, and patients who underwent prolonged hospitalization) in the presence of fibrotic lesions, segmental or subsegmental pulmonary vessel enlargement, subpleural lines, air bubble sign, and halo sign. CONCLUSIONS: Lung CT is a diagnostic tool with prognostic utility in COVID-19 patients. The correlation of the available clinical data with semi-quantitative radiological features enables evaluation of disease severity. The occurrence of specific radiomics shows a positive correlation with prognosis.","Mruk, Bartosz; Walecki, Jerzy; Górecki, Andrzej; Kostkiewicz, Agnieszka; Sklinda, Katarzyna",Med Sci Monit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149047/; https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.931285,257

In the current oncological landscape, where immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies, distinguishing between COVID-19 and immune-mediated pneumonitis can be hard because of shared clinical, radiological and pathological features. Indeed, their common mechanism of aberrant inflammation could lead to a mutual and amplifying interaction. We describe the case of a 65–year-old patient affected by metastatic squamous head and neck cancer and candidate to an experimental therapy including an anti-PD-L1 agent. COVID-19 ground-glass opacities under resolution were an incidental finding during screening procedures and worsened after starting immunotherapy. The diagnostic work-up was consistent with ICIs-related pneumonia and it is conceivable that lung injury by SARS-CoV-2 has acted as an inflammatory primer for the development of the immune-related adverse event. Patients recovered from COVID-19 starting ICIs could be at greater risk of recall immune-mediated pneumonitis. Nasopharyngeal swab and chest CT scan are recommended before starting immunotherapy. The awareness of the phenomenon could allow an easier interpretation of radiological changes under treatment and a faster diagnostic work-up to resume ICIs. In the presence of clinical benefit, for asymptomatic ICIs-related pneumonia a watchful-waiting approach and immunotherapy prosecution are suggested.","Dipasquale, Angelo; Persico, Pasquale; Lorenzi, Elena; Rahal, Daoud; Santoro, Armando; Simonelli, Matteo",J Immunother Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2020-001870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33574054/,257

644921,Editorial Perspective: Perils and promise for child and adolescent sleep and associated psychopathology during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-05-31,"COVID-19 represented an important challenge to the Italian healthcare system (IHCS). Our main aim was to obtain evidence to support the use of modified national early warning score (m-NEWS) as an interdisciplinary, common, and universal scoring scale to quickly recognize patients with a risk of clinical deterioration before admission and during hospitalization. As a secondary goal, we tried to find a score threshold that can trigger patients’ immediate medical review as a part of an optimal triaging protocol for an emergency setting where healthcare resources are overloaded. We performed a retrospective observational study. We included in our study all patients treated for COVID-19 infection in surgical departments between 01 March 2020 and 16 April 2020. Patients with negative test results for SARS-COV-2 were excluded. m-NEWS was obtained twice a day. Patients’ m-NEWS were analyzed in order to verify the correlation between m-NEWS (at admission and m-NEWS variation 24 h after admission) and outcome (positive outcome-survival, negative outcome-death, or intensive care unit (ICU) transfer). We included a population-based sample of 225 SARS-COV-2-infected patients. Overall, the average age at hospitalization was 71 (ranging from 40 to 95). 144 (64%) patients were males and 81 (36%) females. m-NEWS values lower or equal to 7 were associated with the majority of the “recovered” population (100/132 75.75%) and at the same time with the minority of the “non-recovered” population (25/93 26.88%). For our sample, age is statistically correlated to the outcome but a triage protocol based solely on this variable is less effective than m-NEWS, which showed to be a reliable and easy-to-use score for first patient evaluation. Our observations pave the way towards further studies aiming at optimizing territorial and community healthcare management protocols.","Tagliabue, Fabio; Schena, Daniele; Galassi, Luca; Magni, Matteo; Guerrazzi, Guglielmo; Acerbis, Andrea; Rinallo, Christina; Longhi, Daniel; Ronzani, Alberto; Mariani, Pierpaolo",SN Compr Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-021-00997-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179692/,257

645024,Tropical Medicine & International Health,2021,"The molecular mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) Spike protein was characterized to identify novel therapies. The impact of tofacitinib, IL‐6R Ab, or TNFi therapy was determined on Spike protein or LPS/IFN‐γ‐induced signaling, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming in MΦs and/or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast‐like synoviocyte (FLS). ACE2 frequency was markedly expanded in MΦs compared to T cells and RA FLS. Tofacitinib suppresses Spike protein potentiated STAT1 signaling, whereas this function was unchanged by TNFi. Tofacitinib impairs IL‐6/IFN/LPS‐induced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in RA MΦs and FLS. Interestingly, tofacitinib had a broader inhibitory effect on the monokines, glycolytic regulators, or oxidative metabolites compared to IL‐6R Ab and TNFi in Spike‐protein‐activated MΦs. In contrast, all three therapies disrupted IFN‐α and IFN‐β secretion in response to Spike protein; nonetheless, the IFN‐γ was only curtailed by tofacitinib or IL‐6R Ab. While tofacitinib counteracted MΦ metabolic rewiring instigated by Spike protein, it was inconsequential on the glycolysis expansion mediated via HK2 and/or LDHA in the activated RA MΦ and FLS. Nevertheless, the potentiated inflammatory response and the diminished oxidative phosphorylation modulated by Spike protein and/or LPS/IFN‐γ stimulation in MΦs or RA FLS were reversed by tofacitinib. In conclusion, tofacitinib suppresses MΦ inflammation and immunometabolism triggered by Spike protein and may provide a promising strategy for COVID‐19 patients.","Palasiewicz, Karol; Umar, Sadiq; Romay, Bianca; Zomorrodi, Ryan K.; Shahrara, Shiva",Eur J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34107055/; https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.202049159,257

METHODS: We conducted a single-site, cross-sectional, observational, instrument validation study. Non-mydriatic fundus photographs centred at the optic disc were obtained from 276 eyes of 68 glaucoma and 70 normal patients, using a portable fundus camera (Smartscope, Optomed, Oulu, Finland). A senior Glaucoma consultant, masked to the patient’s study participation, performed a gold standard dilated fundus examination to make the diagnosis of glaucoma. Following this, a mydriatic photograph was taken by a standard table-top fundus camera. All the images were digitalized and de-identified by an independent investigator and presented to two remote graders, masked to the patients, their diagnoses, and photographic modality. Based on individual disc characteristics, a diagnosis of screening positive or negative for glaucoma was made. In the end, the independent investigator re-identified the images. Sensitivity and specificity to detect glaucoma with the undilated Smartscope camera was calculated compared to dilated fundus examination. RESULTS: Grading remote images taken with the portable non-mydriatic fundus camera showed a sensitivity of 96.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 91.6–98.8%) and 94.8% (95% CI: 89.7–97.9%) and a specificity of 98.5% (95% CI: 94.9–99.8%) and 97.8% (95% CI: 93.9–99.6%) for the two graders respectively as compared to gold standard dilated fundus examination. CONCLUSION: The non-mydriatic Smartscope fundus images have high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing glaucoma remotely and thus may be an effective tool for use in community outreach programs.","Upadhyaya, Swati; Agarwal, Anushri; Rengaraj, Venkatesh; Srinivasan, Kavitha; Newman Casey, Paula Anne; Schehlein, Emily",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33707762/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-021-01485-2,257

A total of 1091 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia were included from Wuhan, China. Overall, 2.8% (n = 31) received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 10.8% (n = 118) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 6.4% (n = 70) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 4.4% (n = 48) died. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of IMV therapy, ICU admission and ARDS associated with obesity were 2.86 (1.16-7.05), 2.62 (1.52-4.49) and 3.15 (1.69-5.88), respectively; underweight was significantly associated with death (HR 3.85, 95%CI 1.26-11.76). Restricted cubic spline analyses suggested U-shaped associations of BMI with ICU admission and death, but linear relationships of BMI with IMV therapy and ARDS. In conclusion, obesity had an increased risk of IMV therapy, ICU admission and ARDS, while underweight was associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia. U-shaped associations of BMI with ICU admission and death, and linear relationships of BMI with IMV therapy and ARDS, were found. These findings indicate that extra caution should be taken when treating COVID-19 patients with underweight and obesity.","Wu, Xiaodong; Li, Chenghong; Chen, Shi; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Feilong; Shi, Ting; Li, Qiang; Lin, Lin",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761466/,257

In a disease where there are acute inflammation and compromised oxygenation, we investigated the impact of initial hemoglobin (Hgb) levels at Emergency Department (ED) triage on the severity and the clinical course of COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 601 COVID-19 patients in a COVID-19 national referral center between 13 and 27 June 2020. All adult patients presented at our hospital that required admission or hotel isolation were included in this study. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) had a lower initial Hgb than those admitted outside the ICU (12.84 g/dL vs. 13.31 g/dL, p = 0.026) and over the course of admission; the prevalence of anemia (Hgb < 12.5 g/dL) was 65% in patients admitted to ICU, whereas it was only 43% in non-ICU patients (odds ratio of 2.464, 95% CI 1.71–3.52). Anemic ICU patients had a higher mortality compared with non-anemic ICU patients (hazard ratio = 1.88, log-rank p = 0.0104). A direct agglutination test (DAT) for all anemic patients showed that 14.7% of ICU patients and 9% of non-ICU patients had autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). AIHA patients had significantly longer length of hospital stay compared with anemic patients without AIHA (17.1 days vs. 14.08 days, p = 0.034).

The “success” of a pathogen lies not in its ability to cause signs and symptoms of illness but in its ability to be shed from the initial hosts, survive between hosts, and then establish infection in a new host. Recent insights have shown the importance of the interaction between the pathogen and both the commensal microbiome and coinfecting pathogens on shedding, environmental survival, and acquisition of infection. Pathogens have evolved in the context of cooperation and competition with other microbes, and the roles of these cooperations and competitions in transmission can inform novel preventative and therapeutic strategies.","Rowe, Hannah M.; Rosch, Jason W.",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01027-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006664/,257

Although there is no clear gender or socioeconomic discrimination in the incidence of COVID-19, individuals who are older adults and/or with comorbidities and compromised immunity have a relatively higher risk of contracting this disease. Since no specific drug has yet been discovered, strengthening immunity along with maintaining a healthy living is the best way to survive this disease. As a healthy practice, calorie restriction in the form of intermittent fasting (IF) in several clinical settings has been reported to promote several health benefits, including priming of the immune response. This dietary restriction also activates autophagy, a cell surveillance system that boosts up immunity. With these prevailing significance in priming host defense, IF could be a potential strategy amid this outbreak to fighting off SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, no review so far available proposing IF as an encouraging strategy in the prevention of COVID-19. A comprehensive review has therefore been planned to highlight the beneficial role of fasting in immunity and autophagy, that underlie the possible defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The COVID-19 pathogenesis and its impact on host immune response have also been briefly outlined. This review aimed at revisiting the immunomodulatory potential of IF that may constitute a promising preventive approach against COVID-19.","Hannan, Md. Abdul; Rahman, Md.

Chemokines are a family of cytokines which are chemotactic in nature and cause the recruitment of cells of inflammation. Periodontitis has long been attributed to having its pathophysiology rooted in a cytokine response. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has been reported to have adverse outcomes related to the establishment of a cytokine storm, many of the components of which are common with the cytokine expression profile of periodontitis. This communication explores the connection between COVID-19 and periodontal disease through their cytokine connection to form a translational basis for recommending maintenance of oral hygiene in the COVID era and to red flag patients with periodontitis as having an increased risk of exhibiting COVID related adverse outcomes.","Sahni, Vaibhav; Gupta, Shipra",Med Hypotheses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720313578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32534336/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109908; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720313578,257

Previously, we showed that this disease is partially CD4 T cell-mediated since infection with a recombinant JHMV (rJ) mutated in only a single immunodominant CD4 T cell epitope (epitope M133, rJ.MY135Q) results in a nonlethal disease. Increased mortality correlated with a greater number of JHMV-specific CD4 T cells in the brains of rJ compared to rJ.MY135Q-infected mice. Here, we extend these results to show that the diminished number of virus-specific T cells correlates with a reduced cytokine/chemokine response in the infected brain. We also show that regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs) are critical for mild disease in rJ.MY135Q-infected mice because their depletion results in increased mortality. Further, a relative paucity of Tregs characterizes lethal infection because adoptive transfer of Tregs into rJ-infected mice increases survival from 0% to 50%. These results support the notion that clinical disease in coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis results from a balance between factors critical for virus clearance, such as virus-specific effector T cells and anti-inflammatory elements, such as Tregs. These findings also show that unlike chronic infections, in which an excessive number of Tregs contributes to pathogen persistence, Tregs in the setting of acute encephalitis may help to limit immunopathological disease without delaying virus clearance.","Anghelina, Daniela; Zhao, Jingxian; Trandem, Kathryn; Perlman, Stanley",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208008155; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208008155; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.12.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19141357/,257

We analyze COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 15 survey samples covering 10 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa and South America, Russia (an upper-middle-income country) and the United States, including a total of 44,260 individuals.

Vaccine acceptance in LMICs is primarily explained by an interest in personal protection against COVID-19, while concern about side effects is the most common reason for hesitancy. Health workers are the most trusted sources of guidance about COVID-19 vaccines. Evidence from this sample of LMICs suggests that prioritizing vaccine distribution to the Global South should yield high returns in advancing global immunization coverage. Vaccination campaigns should focus on translating the high levels of stated acceptance into actual uptake. Messages highlighting vaccine efficacy and safety, delivered by healthcare workers, could be effective for addressing any remaining hesitancy in the analyzed LMICs.","Solís Arce, Julio S.; Warren, Shana S.; Meriggi, Niccolò F.; Scacco, Alexandra; McMurry, Nina; Voors, Maarten; Syunyaev, Georgiy; Malik, Amyn Abdul; Aboutajdine, Samya; Adeojo, Opeyemi; Anigo, Deborah; Armand, Alex; Asad, Saher; Atyera, Martin; Augsburg, Britta; Awasthi, Manisha; Ayesiga, Gloria Eden; Bancalari, Antonella; Björkman Nyqvist, Martina; Borisova, Ekaterina; Bosancianu, Constantin Manuel; Cabra García, Magarita Rosa; Cheema, Ali; Collins, Elliott; Cuccaro, Filippo; Farooqi, Ahsan Zia; Fatima, Tatheer; Fracchia, Mattia; Galindo Soria, Mery Len; Guariso, Andrea; Hasanain, Ali; Jaramillo, Sofía; Kallon, Sellu; Kamwesigye, Anthony; Kharel, Arjun; Kreps, Sarah; Levine, Madison; Littman, Rebecca; Malik, Mohammad; Manirabaruta, Gisele; Mfura, Jean Léodomir Habarimana; Momoh, Fatoma; Mucauque, Alberto; Mussa, Imamo; Nsabimana, Jean Aime; Obara, Isaac; Otálora, María Juliana; Ouédraogo, Béchir Wendemi; Pare, Touba Bakary; Platas, Melina R.; Polanco, Laura; Qureshi, Javaeria Ashraf; Raheem, Mariam; Ramakrishna, Vasudha; Rendrá, Ismail; Shah, Taimur; Shaked, Sarene Eyla; Shapiro, Jacob N.; Svensson, Jakob; Tariq, Ahsan; Tchibozo, Achille Mignondo; Tiwana, Hamid Ali; Trivedi, Bhartendu; Vernot, Corey; Vicente, Pedro C.; Weissinger, Laurin B.; Zafar, Basit; Zhang, Baobao; Karlan, Dean; Callen, Michael; Teachout, Matthieu; Humphreys, Macartan; Mobarak, Ahmed Mushfiq; Omer, Saad B.",Nat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34272499/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01454-y,257

The study aims to examine the change in frailty status and associated health outcomes. METHODS: This interim report presents data from March 2019–October 2020. The study setting is 12 RACS from one organisation across metropolitan and rural South Australia involving 1243 residents. All permanent (i.e. respite or transition care program excluded) residents living in the RACS for at least 8 weeks were invited to participate. Residents who were deemed to be medically unstable (e.g. experiencing delirium), have less than 3 months to live, or not fluent in English were excluded. Data collected included frailty status, medical diagnoses, medicines, pain, nutrition, sarcopenia, falls, dementia, anxiety and depression, sleep quality, quality of life, satisfaction with care, activities of daily living, and life space use at baseline and 12-months. Data Linkage will occur over the 3 years from baseline. RESULTS: A total of 561 permanent residents (mean age 87.69 ± 7.25) were included. The majority of residents were female (n = 411, 73.3%) with 95.3% (n = 527) being classified as either frail (n = 377, 68.2%) or most-frail (n = 150, 27.1%) according to the Frailty Index (FI). Most residents were severely impaired in their basic activities of daily living (n = 554, 98.8%), and were at-risk of malnutrition (n = 305, 55.0%) and at-risk of sarcopenia (n = 492, 89.5%). Most residents did not experience pain (n = 475, 85.4%), had normal daytime sleepiness (n = 385, 69.7%), and low anxiety and depression scores (n = 327, 58.9%).

DESIGN: Three rounds of semi-structured surveys in an online expert panel using a modified Delphi approach. PARTICIPANTS: Experts in informatics, African public health and HIV/AIDS and bioethics were invited to participate. MEASURES: Perceived importance of or agreement about relevance of ethical issues on 5-point unipolar Likert scales. Qualitative data analysis identified emergent themes related to ethical issues and development of an ethical framework and recommendations for open-ended questions. RESULTS: Of the 35 invited experts, 22 participated in the online expert panel (63%). Emergent themes were the inclusion of African researchers in all aspects of study design, analysis and dissemination to identify and address local contextual issues, as well as engagement of communities. Experts focused on engagement with health and science professionals to address risks, benefits and communication of findings. Respondents prioritised the mitigation of stigma to research participants but recognised trade-offs between privacy and the need to disseminate findings to realise public health benefits. Strategies for responsible communication of results were suggested, including careful word choice in presentation of results and limited dissemination to need-to-know stakeholders such as public health planners. CONCLUSION: Experts identified ethical issues specific to the African context and to research on sensitive, publicly available data and strategies for addressing these issues. These findings can be used to inform an ethical implementation framework with research stage-specific recommendations on how to use publicly available data for machine learning-based predictive analytics to predict HIV/AIDS risk in SSA.","Nichol, Ariadne A; Bendavid, Eran; Mutenherwa, Farirai; Patel, Chirag; Cho, Mildred K",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34321310/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052287,257

RESULTS: Of the 50 initial consultation requests, 11 (22.0%) patients were evaluated for abnormal movements (nine male and two female). Myoclonus was diagnosed in 6/11 (54.5%) patients. Additionally, two patients were diagnosed with seizures (confirmed on EEG in one), while two additional patients were diagnosed with tremor (physiologic and probable functional). A single case of serotonin syndrome was also identified. CONCLUSION: Abnormal movements observed in hospitalized Covid-19 patients can have a wide range of etiologies and were a frequent initial indication for neurologic consultation. Myoclonus was the most frequent type of abnormal movement observed. Early clinical recognition and directed diagnostic work-up is essential for accurate diagnoses in these patients.","Clark, Jeffrey R.; Liotta, Eric M.; Reish, Nicholas J.; Shlobin, Nathan A.; Hoffman, Steven C.; Orban, Zachary S.; Lim, Patrick H.; Koralnik, Igor J.; Batra, Ayush",J Neurol Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X21000708?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X21000708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33676146/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2021.117377,257
652998,The immediate and longer-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of older adults in England,2021-05-03,"COVID-19 is a respiratory infection that has been declared as a global health crisis by the WHO. It mainly affects the respiratory system. Apart from respiratory system, it also affects other organs as well including the brain. Numerous emerging reports have demonstrated that the COVID-19 has detrimental effects on neurological functions, and can lead to severe impairment of the nervous system. The neurological manifestations linked with COVID-19 include headache, anosmia, encephalitis, epileptic seizures, Guillain-Barre syndrome, stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage alongwith multiple others complications. The CNS related complications may be severe are they are linked with poor diagnosis which may worsen the condition. Therefore, there is a need to precisely understand the neurological sequelae along with upcoming clinical outcomes. Here, we presented a brief review of neurological complications and symptoms associated with COVID-19 along with brain imaging findings. Further, we have discussed about the emerging biosensing approaches which may aid in rapid, precise and mass diagnosis of COVID-19.","Singh, Vishakha; Allawadhi, Prince; Khurana, Amit; Banothu, Anil Kumar; Bharani, Kala Kumar",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266635112100019X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S266635112100019X,257

653677,Do women empowerment indicators predict receipt of quality antenatal care in Cameroon? Evidence from a nationwide survey,2021,"The novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has created a medical emergency worldwide. It has spread rapidly to multiple countries and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In India, it is already reported more than 18 thousand cases and more than 600 deaths due to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) till April 20, 2020. Previous studies on various viral infections like influenza have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that the cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments favor the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases. These viral transmissions found attenuated in warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments. However, the role of temperature, humidity, and absolute humidity in the transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been well established. Therefore the study to investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of COVID-19 infection, to predict the epidemiology of the infectious disease, and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease is required for India. In this work, we analyze the local weather patterns of the Indian region affected by the COVID-19 virus for March and April months, 2020. We have investigated the effect of meteorological parameters like Temperature, relative humidity, and absolute humidity on the rate of spread of COVID-19 using daily confirm cases in India. We have used daily averaged meteorological data for the last three years (2017-2019) for March and April month and the same for the year 2020 for March 1 to April 15. We found a positive association (Pearsons r=0.56) between temperature and daily COVID-19 cases over India. We found a negative association of humidity (RH and AH) with daily COVID-19 Cases (Persons r=-0.62, -0.37). We have also investigated the role of aerosol in spreading the pandemic across India because its possible airborne nature. For this, we have investigated the association of aerosols (AOD) and other pollutions (NO2) with COVID-19 cases during the study period and also during the first lockdown period (25 March-15 April) in India. We found a negative association in March when there were few cases, but in April, it shows positive association when the number of cases is more (for AOD it was r=-0.41 and r=0.28 respectively). During the lockdown period, aerosols (AOD) and other pollutants (NO2; an indicator of PM2.5) reduced sharply with a percentage drop of about 36 and 37, respectively. This reduction may have reduced the risk for COVID-19 through air transmission due to the unavailability of aerosol particles as a base. HYSPLIT forward trajectory model also shows that surface aerosols may travel up to 4 km according to wind and direction within three h of its generation. If coronavirus becomes airborne as suggested by many studies, then it may have a higher risk of transmission by aerosols particles. So relaxing in the lockdown and environmental rules in terms of pollutant emissions from power plants, factories, and other facilities would be a wrong choice and could result in more COVID-19 incidences and deaths in India. Therefore the current study, although limited, suggests that it is doubtful that the spread of COVID-19 would slow down in India due to meteorological factors, like high temperature and high humidity. Because a large number of cases have already been reported in the range of high Tem, high Relative, and high absolute humidity regions of India. Thus our results in no way suggest that COVID-19 would not spread in warm, humid regions or during summer/monsoon. So effective public health interventions should be implemented across India to slow down the transmission of COVID-19. If COVID-19 is indeed sensitive to environmental factors, it could be tested in the coming summer-monsoon for India. So the only summer is not going to help India until monsoon is coming. Only government mitigations strategies would be helpful, whether its lockdown, aggressive and strategic testing, medical facilities, imposing social distancing, encouraging to use face mask or monitoring by a mobile application (Aarogya Setu).","Kumar, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075499; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20075499v1?rss=1,257
654191,"Long COVID-19, persistent somatic symptoms and social stigmatisation",2021-02-23,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: Drugs with the potential to prolong QT are used in the treatment of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pneumonia. We have developed a telemedicine-based corrected QT (QTc) follow-up algorithm that allows early rule out for follow up. AIMS: In this study, we investigated the availability and safety of the algorithm. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort METHODS: Consecutive patients; administered hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled into digital ECG recording program which includes QTc follow-up algorithm. RESULTS: Patients were classified into three groups as those, excluded promptly from the QTc follow-up based on two consecutive ECG findings (early rule out, n = 92) and those, for whom the follow-up was continued (n = 12) and usual care group (n = 68). Of note, 237 ECG tracings were performed in our algorithm population contrary to standard practice of daily recommended ECG monitoring which could have yielded 975 ECG tracings along with accompanied risks of exposure. This way; we ended in 738 (75.7%) fewer ECG tracings. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death was not observed in the entire patient population. CONCLUSIONS: It is safe to rely on telemedicine-based early rule out algorithm in COVID-19 patients, receiving hydroxychloroquine treatment. This algorithm abolished the need for further ECG in majority of patients without increased risk during follow up. These algorithms can significantly reduce the healthcare worker exposures by eliminating the need for ECG follow-up promptly.","Turan, OE; Yilancioglu, RY; Alak, C; Baskurt, AA; Hunuk, B; Dugral, E; Yilmaz, MB; Ergene, AO; Ozcan, EE",Europace,https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euab116.518,257
654894,COVID-19 and Mental Health: A Study of its Impact on Students,2020-08-11,"(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the exacerbation of various chronic diseases. Due to the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mast cells, we aimed to analyze the relevance of COVID-19 disease on chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) clinical presentation and biological profile. (2) Methods: This study is a retrospective case series of patients with CSU diagnosed and treated in the Allergy Department of the Professor Doctor Octavian Fodor RIGH, (Cluj-Napoca, Romania). Patients were assessed for disease activity and level of control with the weekly urticaria activity score and the visual analogue scale. Results were correlated with COVID-19 severity and with nonspecific markers of inflammation during and after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. (3) Results: SARS-CoV-2 impacted a significant proportion (33%) of the CSU patients, of which 71% developed a moderate-severe form of COVID-19. Most of the patients (68%) had moderate-severe forms of CSU and 65% took AH1 treatment (one dose, two-fold dose or four-fold dose). The rest of them (35%) received the second-line treatment (40.3% Omalizumab, 53% Prednisolone and 4.8% Cyclosporine). In Omalizumab treated group of UCS patients we observed that COVID-19 disease was not severe. We established a positive correlation between the severity of the infection and that of the CSU clinical presentation, with most bothersome symptoms of urticaria being experienced by moderate to severe COVID-19 CSU patients (47%). Inflammatory markers were positively correlated (p = 0.01) with a more severe clinical profile of CSU, in accordance with our hypothesis that the level of inflammation triggered by COVID-19 disease has a role in CSU exacerbation. The non-specific inflammatory markers, such as CRP, were positively associated with the UAS7 score (R2 = 0.363; p = 0.001). An increased rate of exacerbation of CSU was observed in moderate-severe COVID-19 infection. (4) Conclusions: COVID-19 disease can result in the exacerbation of chronic spontaneous urticaria, more likely in moderate to severe forms of infection.","Muntean, Ioana Adriana; Pintea, Irena; Bocsan, Ioana Corina; Dobrican, Carmen Teodora; Deleanu, Diana",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574918/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9091144,257

This study aimed to assess the exposure health risks of COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. METHOD: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on public health workers from May to August 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire via email and telegram services. Both descriptive statistics and bivariate followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify distribution patterns and factors associated with exposure risks to COVID-19. Odds ratio with 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and a P-value of <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. RESULT: A total of 418 health care workers participated in the study with a response rate of 99.1%. The majority of the study participants 310(74.2%), were males, and 163(39%) were nurses/ midwives respectively. More than half of the respondents 237(56.7%), had reported that they didn`t have face-to-face contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Among the respondents, 173(41.4%), 147(35.2%), 63(15.1%), and 65(15.6%) of the health professionals had always used gloves, medical masks, face shield, or goggles/protective glasses, and disposable gown, respectively. In this study, age between 25–34 years (AOR = 0.20), age between 35–44 years (AOR = 0.13), family size of >6 (AOR = 3.77), work experience of 21–30 years (AOR = 0.01), and good handwashing habit (AOR = 0.44) were the protective factors against COVID-19. On the other hand, perception of non-exposure to COVD 19 (AOR = 9.56), and poor habit of decontamination of high touch areas (AOR = 2.52) were the risk factors associated with confirmed COVID 19 cases among health care workers. CONCLUSION: Poor adherence to personal protective equipment use and aseptic practices during and after health care interactions with patients were identified. Strategies should be implemented to institute effective and sustainable infection control measures that protect the health care workers from COVID-19 infection.","Atnafie, Seyfe Asrade; Anteneh, Demssie Ayalew; Yimenu, Dawit Kumilachew; Kifle, Zemene Demelash",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914826/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251000,257

Due to a greater appreciation of their role in modulating host physiology, microbes have come to the forefront of biological investigation of human health and disease. Despite this, capturing the heterogeneity of microbes, and that of the host responses they induce, has been challenging due to the bulk methods of nucleic acid and cellular analysis. One of the greatest recent advancements in our understanding of complex organisms has happened in the field of single-cell analysis through genomics, transcriptomics, and spatial resolution. While significantly advancing our understanding of host biology, these techniques have only recently been applied to microbial systems to shed light on their diversity as well as interactions with host cells in both commensal and pathogenic contexts. In this review, we highlight emerging technologies that are poised to provide key insights into understanding how microbe heterogeneity can be studied. We then take a detailed look into how host single-cell analysis has uncovered the impact of microbes on host heterogeneity and the effect of host biology on microorganisms. Most of these insights would have been challenging, and in some cases impossible, without the advent of single-cell analysis, suggesting the importance of the single-cell paradigm for progressing the microbiology field forward through a host-microbiome perspective and applying these insights to better understand and treat human disease.","Sharma, Prateek V.; Thaiss, Christoph A.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.569070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33163417/,257

OBJECTIVE: To provide guidance on setting up and running an optimised telementoring service that can be integrated into current validated curricula. We define a standardised approach to training candidates in skill acquisition via telepresence technologies. We aim to describe an approach based on the current evidence and available technologies, and define the key elements within optimised telepresence services, by seeking consensus from an expert committee comprising key opinion leaders in training. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This project was carried out in phases: a systematic review of the current literature, a teleconference meeting, and then an initial survey were conducted based on the current evidence and expert opinion, and sent to the committee. Twenty-four experts in training, including clinicians, academics, and industry, contributed to the Delphi process. An accelerated Delphi process underwent three rounds and was completed within 72 h. Additions to the second- and third-round surveys were formulated based on the answers and comments from the previous rounds. Consensus opinion was defined as ≥80% agreement. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: There was 100% consensus regarding an urgent need for international agreement on guidance for optimised telepresence. Consensus was reached in multiple areas, including (1) infrastructure and functionality; (2) definitions and terminology; (3) protocols for training, communication, and safety issues; and (4) accountability including ethical and legal issues. The resulting formulated guidance showed good internal consistency among experts, with a Cronbach alpha of 0.90. CONCLUSIONS: Using the Delphi methodology, we achieved international consensus among experts for development and content validation of optimised telepresence services for robotic surgery training. This guidance lays the foundation for launching telepresence services in robotic surgery. This guidance will require further validation.

The quality of the sequence data obtained from these genotyping efforts depends on several factors, including the quantity/integrity of the input material, the technology as well as laboratory-specific implementation. The current lack of guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping leads to inclusion of error-containing genome sequences in genomic epidemiology studies. We aimed at establishing clear and broadly applicable recommendations for reliable virus genotyping. METHODS: We established and used a sequencing data analysis workflow that reliably identifies and removes technical artifacts, which can result in miscalls when using alternative pipelines, to process clinical samples and synthetic viral genomes with an amplicon-based genotyping approach. We evaluated the impact of experimental factors, including viral load and sequencing depth, on correct sequence determination. RESULTS: We found that at least 1000 viral genomes are necessary to confidently detect variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome at frequencies of 10% or higher. The broad applicability of our recommendations was validated in over 200 clinical samples from six independent laboratories. The genotypes we determined for clinical isolates with sufficient quality cluster by sampling location and period. Our analysis also supports the rise in frequency of 20A.EU1 and 20A.EU2, two recently reported European strains whose dissemination was facilitated by travelling during the summer of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We present much-needed recommendations for reliable determination of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence and demonstrate their broad applicability in a large cohort of clinical samples.","Kubik, Slawomir; Marques, Ana Claudia; Xing, Xiaobin; Silvery, Janine; Bertelli, Claire; De Maio, Flavio; Pournaras, Spyros; Burr, Tom; Duffourd, Yannis; Siemens, Helena; Alloui, Chakib; Song, Lin; Wenger, Yvan; Saitta, Alexandra; Macheret, Morgane; Smith, Ewan W.; Menu, Philippe; Brayer, Marion; Steinmetz, Lars M.; Si-Mohammed, Ali; Chuisseu, Josiane; Stevens, Richard; Constantoulakis, Pantelis; Sali, Michela; Greub, Gilbert; Tiemann, Carsten; Pelechano, Vicent; Willig, Adrian; Xu, Zhenyu",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X21001646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813118/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.03.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X21001646?v=s5,257

The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of an online combination exercise intervention in improving the physical and mental health of obese children. Methods: This study adopted a one-group pre-test and post-test research design. A total of 28 obese children from 6 elementary schools in Heze City, Shandong Province, China, were recruited. All participants received an 8-week online combination exercise intervention and were tested at a three-month follow-up. Participants were tested and surveyed regarding their demographic, feasibility, and obesity indicators using mental health and quality of life questionnaires. The data were statistically analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. Results: A total of 26 obese children (Mean(age) = 10.15 years) completed the study. The retention rate was 92.9% for the entire trial (two obese children withdrew due to their inability to exercise) and no adverse events were reported. In addition, the obese children completed 25/32 (78.1%) of the online courses. After 8 weeks of the intervention, the changes in the body fat percentage of the obese children [mean difference (MD) = –3.126, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = –1.777], thinking dimension score (MD = 1.654, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.603), total quality of life score (MD = 6.385, p < 0.05, Cohen’s d = 0.610), and work attitude dimension score (MD = 1.346, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.744) showed significant differences compared to the baseline. However, no significant differences were identified between the post-intervention and three-month follow-up measurements (p > 0.05), and we assumed that the intervention effect was maintained three months after the intervention. Conclusion: An online combination exercise intervention is a safe and feasible option to improve the mental health and quality of life of obese children and may have long-term health benefits.","Ding, Meng; Yi, Xiangren; Yan, Peisai; McDonough, Daniel J.; Gao, Zan; Dong, Xiaosheng",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594257/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.638618,257

In order to design primer sets for the detection of a wide range of NVs, NVs were categorized into three groups, that is, genogroup I (GI), prevalent GII, and minor GII; three sets of primers were developed for each group. Clinical specimens of patients suffering from enteric RNA viruses, such as NV, group A and C rotavirus, and sapovirus were examined using these primer sets. Various genotypes of NVs were detected in clinical specimens from patients infected with NV where no false positive reaction was observed with other enteric RNA viruses. Additionally, 88 samples of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks were analyzed by an RT‐LAMP assay and compared with the results of routine RT‐PCR. The results of the RT‐LAMP assay corresponded well to that of RT‐PCR. These findings suggest the practical application of the RT‐LAMP assay for the detection of NVs in clinical specimens. Consequently, the RT‐LAMP system and conventional detection kits (NVGI and NVGII detection kits; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan) were compared. The detection rate of the prevalent and minor GII primer sets was similar to that of the conventional NVGII kit, while the detection rate of the GI primer set is different because it can detect several genotypes better than the conventional NVGI kit. This is an initial report that the RT‐LAMP system is able to detect NVs in clinical specimens within a wide range. J. Med.

Most newly approved drugs related to oncology (34%) and neurology (15%). We discuss these new drugs by level of innovation they provide, i.e., first to treat a condition, first using a novel mechanisms of action, and “others.” Six drugs were first in indication, 15 first using a novel mechanism of action, and 32 other. This includes many drugs for the treatment of orphan indications and some for the treatment of tropical diseases previously neglected for commercial reasons. Small molecules continue to dominate new drug approvals, followed by antibodies. Of note, newly approved drugs also included small-interfering RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides.

662016,The COVID-19 Pandemic: Setting the Mental Health Research Agenda,2020-05-18,"The timing of transmission plays a key role in the dynamics and controllability of an epidemic. However, observing generation times—the time interval between the infection of an infector and an infectee in a transmission pair—requires data on infection times, which are generally unknown. The timing of symptom onset is more easily observed; generation times are therefore often estimated based on serial intervals—the time interval between symptom onset of an infector and an infectee. This estimation follows one of two approaches: (i) approximating the generation time distribution by the serial interval distribution or (ii) deriving the generation time distribution from the serial interval and incubation period—the time interval between infection and symptom onset in a single individual—distributions. These two approaches make different—and not always explicitly stated—assumptions about the relationship between infectiousness and symptoms, resulting in different generation time distributions with the same mean but unequal variances. Here, we clarify the assumptions that each approach makes and show that neither set of assumptions is plausible for most pathogens. However, the variances of the generation time distribution derived under each assumption can reasonably be considered as upper (approximation with serial interval) and lower (derivation from serial interval) bounds. Thus, we suggest a pragmatic solution is to use both approaches and treat these as edge cases in downstream analysis. We discuss the impact of the variance of the generation time distribution on the controllability of an epidemic through strategies based on contact tracing, and we show that underestimating this variance is likely to overestimate controllability.","Lehtinen, Sonja; Ashcroft, Peter; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian",J R Soc Interface,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402022/,257
662351,Consequences of gestational age limits for people needing abortion care during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-10-02,"PURPOSE: The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) has been extensively studied in various diseases. However, the relationship between PLR and hip fracture remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether PLR would be an independent prognostic factor in elderly hip fracture patients. METHODS: Between January 2014 and December 2018, a retrospective cohort study was conducted in a orthopaedic centre, China. A total of 460 hip fracture patients were included. PLR was calculated as the ratio of platelet to lymphocyte counts and divided into high PLR group (≥ 189) and low PLR group (< 189) by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The relationship between PLR and one year all-cause mortality rate was assessed by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Further subgroup analysis stratified by different clinical and biological characteristics was performed to make the results more accurate. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 32.0 months (range, 12.0–75.4), 92 patients (mortality rate: 20.0%) died within one year. PLR was significantly higher in dead patients compared with alive patients (p < 0.05), and high PLR group also had a high mortality rate (32.21% vs. 14.15%, p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, high PLR remained an independent predictor for one year all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–2.41, p = 0.041). Moreover, advanced age (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.08), male (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.06–2.45), CCI ≥ 2 (HR 2.83, 95% CI 1.64–4.89), conservative treatment (HR 5.94, 95% CI 3.71–9.73), low haemoglobin level (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.04), and low albumin level (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02–1.13) were independent risk factors for survival. Furthermore, subgroup analysis results were consistent with the main findings in most stratified groups. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that high PLR (≥ 189) is associated with increased one year all-cause mortality in elderly hip fracture patients. As PLR is a simple indicator that can be calculated from the blood routine test, it can be easily performed in usual clinical practice.","Wang, Zhicong; Wang, Hong; Yang, Ling; Jiang, Wei; Chen, Xi; Liu, Yuehong",Int Orthop,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04833-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989560/,257
663057,"The Effects of Social Support and Morbidities on Self-Rated Health among Migrant Elderly Following Children to Jinan, China",2021-06-07,"INTRODUCTION: During a pandemic, there are many situations in which the first available vaccines may not have as high of an effectiveness as vaccines that are still under development or are not yet ready for distribution, raising the question of whether it is better to go with what is available now or wait. METHODS: In 2020, the team developed a computational model that represents the U.S. population, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread, and vaccines with different possible efficacies (to prevent infection or reduce severe disease) and vaccination timings to estimate the clinical and economic value of vaccination. RESULTS: Except for a limited number of situations, mainly early on in a pandemic and for a vaccine that prevents infection, when an initial vaccine is available, waiting for a vaccine with a higher efficacy results in additional hospitalizations and costs over the course of the pandemic. For example, if a vaccine with a 50% efficacy in preventing infection becomes available when 10% of the population has already been infected, waiting until 40% are infected for a vaccine with 80% efficacy in preventing infection results in 15.6 million additional cases and 1.5 million additional hospitalizations, costing $20.6 billion more in direct medical costs and $12.4 billion more in productivity losses. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there are relatively few situations in which it is worth foregoing the first COVID-19 vaccine available in favor of a vaccine that becomes available later on in the pandemic, even if the latter vaccine has a substantially higher efficacy.","Bartsch, Sarah M.; O'Shea, Kelly J.; Wedlock, Patrick T.; Strych, Ulrich; Ferguson, Marie C.; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Randall, Samuel L.; Siegmund, Sheryl S.; Cox, Sarah N.; Hotez, Peter J.; Lee, Bruce Y.",Am J Prev Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632650/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379721000210?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749379721000210; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2021.01.001,257

Furious efforts to end the pandemic including prevention of spread of SARS-CoV-2, use of antiviral drugs, symptomatic treatments and vaccination are underway. But there are no effective treatments available to save the dying patient in stage 2 (pulmonary) and stage 3 (hyperinflammation) of the infection. The detailed genetic and phenotypical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the spike protein (S1) has increased positive charges (compared to SARS-CoV) on them and are responsible for attachment to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and infection by the virus. In addition, it was also reported that the inflammation in the tissue rendered the lung environment more acidic supporting the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with the cells. We hypothesize that the intermittent use of the oxygen ionizer generating negative oxygen ion clusters [O(2)(−)(H(2)O)(n)] and sodium bicarbonate nebulizer (generating HCO(-)); when connected to ventilator inlet or oxygen concentrator will neutralize the spike protein of the virus in respiratory tract and lungs and change the lung environment to neutral/alkaline condition respectively facilitating improved oxygen pressure in blood.

The reproduction number during travel ranged from 0.12 to 0.19 on airplanes and from 0.07 to 0.12 on trains, with the risk varying by seat distance from the index case and joint travel time, but the difference in risk was not significant between the types of aircraft and train. Overall, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on planes and high-speed trains with high efficiency air filtration devices was relatively low.

The lockdown imposed to cope with the health issues caused by the outbreak of the disease has dramatically challenged and negatively affected all the economic sectors of the modern global economy. Specifically, the livestock sector and its related industries are among the most impacted sectors. This is mainly ascribed to the limitations of animal movement and the decrease of production inputs' availability. Other factors negatively affecting the sustainability of the livestock sector have been the shortage of workers due to the lockdown/curfew, the strong decrease in the purchasing power of the consumer, and the intensification of health care tasks. Such an impact is not only highly relevant because of their economic consequences, but also because of the effects of the lockdown and sanitary rules on animal care and welfare. The current review aims to offer: (a) a comprehensive overview of the impact of COVID-19 on the welfare of farm animals and on the performance of livestock farming systems, on food chain sustainability, and finally, on the global economy and food security; and (b) a prospective outline of alleviation actions.","Hashem, Nesrein M.; González-Bulnes, Antonio; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J.",Front Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.582528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33195601/,257

We investigated such relation in the 530,000-inhabitant North-Eastern Italian province of Udine. METHODS: We analysed real‐time reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 on upper respiratory specimens conducted at the Virology Laboratory of the University Hospital of Udine, Italy, serving the whole province, from March 1 to April 30, 2020, on positive subjects of four groups characterized by different disease severity (critically ill patients admitted to Intensive Care Units, patients admitted to Infectious Disease Units, symptomatic patients visited at the Emergency Department and not hospitalized, and asymptomatic subjects tested during contact tracing or screening activities). Duration of viral positivity was assessed from the first positive test to the day of the first of two consecutive negative tests. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate differences in the four groups. RESULTS: From March 1 to April 30, 39,483 RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were conducted on 23,778 persons. 974 subjects had a positive test result. Among those with multiple tests (N=878), mean time to negativity was 23.7 days (standard error 0.3639) (median 23, interquartile range: 16-30 days). Mean time to negativity was longer in the ICU group than in the others, whereas no difference was observed between asymptomatic patients and those with mild disease.

While two reports support this conclusion, multiple studies have reported unexpectedly favorable outcomes in patients with SCD. However, mechanisms explaining these disparate conclusions are lacking. Here, we review recent studies indicating that the majority of patients with SCD express elevated levels of anti-viral type 1 interferons (IFNα/β) and interferon stimulated genes, independent of COVID-19, during their baseline state of health. We also present our data from the pre-COVID-19 era, illustrating elevated expression of a well-characterized interferon stimulated gene in a cohort of patients with SCD, compared to race-matched controls. These type 1 interferons and interferon stimulated genes have the potential to contribute to the variable progression of COVID-19 and other viral infections in patients with SCD. While the majority of evidence supports a protective role, the role of IFNα/β in COVID-19 severity in the general population remains an area of current investigation. We conclude that type 1 interferon responses in patients with SCD may contribute to the variable COVID-19 responses reported in prior studies. Additional studies investigating the mechanisms underlying IFNα/β production and other clinical consequences of IFNα/β-mediated inflammation in SCD disease are warranted.","Madany, Emaan; Okwan-Duodu, Derick; Balbuena-Merle, Raisa; Hendrickson, Jeanne E.; Gibb, David R.",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368185/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.679030,257

In addition to un-glycosylated and glycosylated proteins, one product with smaller size initiated in-frame from the third Met residues probably through ribosomal re-initiation was also detected. Translation initiated in-frame from the third Met is unusual since the sequence around the first Met of SARS-CoV M protein contains the optimal consensus Kozak sequence. The function of this smaller translated product awaits further investigation. Similar to other N-glycosylated proteins, glycosylation of SARS-CoV M protein was occurred co-translationally in the presence of microsomes. The SARS-CoV M protein is predicted as a triple-spanning membrane protein lack of a conventional signal peptide. The second and third trans-membrane regions (a.a. 46–68 and 78–100) are predicted to be the primary type helices, which will be able to penetrate into membrane by themselves, while the first trans-membrane region (a.a. 14–36) is predicted to be the secondary type helix, which is considered to be stabilized by the interaction with other trans-membrane segments. As expected, the second and third trans-membrane regions were able to insert a cytoplasmic protein into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane more efficiently than the first one. These results should be important for the study of SARS-CoV morphogenesis.

A focused screening and lead optimization effort identified 4b (GS-5734) with anti-EBOV EC(50) = 86 nM in macrophages as the clinical candidate. Structure activity relationships established that the 1′-CN group and C-linked nucleobase were critical for optimal anti-EBOV potency and selectivity against host polymerases. A robust diastereoselective synthesis provided sufficient quantities of 4b to enable preclinical efficacy in a non-human-primate EBOV challenge model. Once-daily 10 mg/kg iv treatment on days 3–14 postinfection had a significant effect on viremia and mortality, resulting in 100% survival of infected treated animals [Nature2016, 531, 381−38526934220].

In an attempt to curb the spread of the virus and circumvent health systems from being overwhelmed, governments have imposed regulations such as lockdown restrictions and home confinement. These restrictions, while effective for infection control, have contributed to poorer lifestyle behaviors. Currently, Positive Psychology and Lifestyle Medicine are two distinct but complimentary disciplines that offer an array of evidence-based approaches for promoting mental health and well-being across a universal population. However, these strategies for improving mental health are typically used in isolation. This perspective calls for a new paradigm shift to create and rollout well-designed interdisciplinary universal multicomponent mental health interventions that integrates the benefits of both disciplines, and uses innovative digital mental health solutions to achieve scalability and accessibility within the limitations and beyond the COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions.","Przybylko, Geraldine; Morton, Darren Peter; Renfrew, Melanie Elise",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.644337; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33927669/,257

In some cases, the problem of outbreak detection is logistically straightforward and mathematically easy: a single case of a disease of great concern can constitute an outbreak. However, for the vast majority of maladies, a simple analytical solution does not exist. Furthermore, each step in developing reliable, sensitive, effective surveillance systems demonstrates enormous complexities in the transmission, manifestation, detection, and control of emerging health threats. In this communication, we explore potential future innovations in early outbreak detection systems that can overcome the pitfalls of current surveillance. We believe that modern advances in assembling data, techniques for collating and processing information, and technology that enables integrated analysis will facilitate a new paradigm in outbreak definition and detection. We anticipate that moving forward in this direction will provide the highly desired sensitivity and specificity in early detection required to meet the emerging challenges of global disease surveillance.","Fefferman, NH; Naumova, EN",Emerg Health Threats J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22460396/; https://doi.org/10.3134/ehtj.10.006,257

SARS-CoV-2 is highly lethal in older adults (>65 years old) and in cases with underlying medical conditions including chronic respiratory diseases, immunosuppression, and cardio-metabolic diseases including severe obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. The course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico has led to many fatal cases in younger patients attributable to cardio-metabolic conditions. Here, we aimed to perform an early spatial epidemiological analysis for the COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico to evaluate how tested case-fatality risks (t-CFRs) are geographically distributed and to explore spatial predictors of early t-CFRs considering the variation of their impact on COVID-19 fatality across different states in Mexico, controlling for the severity of the disease. As results, considering health related variables; diabetes and obesity were highly associated with COVID-19 fatality. We identified that both external and internal migration had an important impact over early COVID-19 risks in Mexico, with external migration having the second highest impact when analyzing Mexico as a whole. Physicians-to-population ratio, as a representation of urbanity, population density, and overcrowding households, has the highest impact on t-CFRs, whereas the age group of 10 to 39 years was associated with lower risks. Geographically, the states of Quintana Roo, Baja California, Chihuahua, and Tabasco had higher t-CFRs and relative risks comparing with a national standard, suggesting that risks in these states were above of what was nationally expected; additionally, the strength of the association between some spatial predictors and the COVID-19 fatality risks variates by zone depending on the predictor.","RamÃ­rez-Aldana, Ricardo; Gomez-Verjan, Juan Carlos; Bello-Chavolla, Omar Yaxmehen; Garcia-PeÃ±a, Carmen",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.26.20239376v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.26.20239376,257

Pangolins were recently identified as carriers and intermediate hosts of coronaviruses. Previous research has shown that infection with coronaviruses activates an innate immune response upon sensing of viral RNA by interferon-induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1), also known as MDA5. Here, we performed a comparative genomics study of RNA sensor genes in three species of pangolins. DDX58/RIG-I, a sensor of cytoplasmic viral RNA and toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7, and 8, which bind RNA in endosomes, are conserved in pangolins. By contrast, IFIH1 a sensor of intracellular double-stranded RNA, has been inactivated by mutations in pangolins. Likewise, Z-DNA-binding protein (ZBP1), which senses both Z-DNA and Z-RNA, has been lost during the evolution of pangolins. These results suggest that the innate immune response to viruses differs significantly between pangolins and other mammals, including humans. We put forward the hypothesis that loss of IFIH1 and ZBP1 provided an evolutionary advantage by reducing inflammation-induced damage to host tissues and thereby contributed to a switch from resistance to tolerance of viral infections in pangolins.","Fischer, Heinz; Tschachler, Erwin; Eckhart, Leopold",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574256/,257

However, based on our experience in four third-level public hospitals in Mexico, we identified substantial gaps in the WPPS guide with regards to addressing common challenges for the implementation of PPSs. While the oversimplified narrative of WPPS could facilitate the adoption of this methodology and extend its use, it underestimates the efforts and potential pitfalls for survey preparation, coordination, and reliable implementation.

679882,Covid-19 and the social suffering attached to it,2021-07-07,"Locusts are short horned grasshoppers that exhibit two behaviour types depending on their local population density. These are: solitarious, where they will actively avoid other locusts, and gregarious where they will seek them out. It is in this gregarious state that locusts can form massive and destructive flying swarms or plagues. However, these swarms are usually preceded by the aggregation of juvenile wingless locust nymphs. In this paper we attempt to understand how the distribution of food resources affect the group formation process. We do this by introducing a multi-population partial differential equation model that includes non-local locust interactions, local locust and food interactions, and gregarisation. Our results suggest that, food acts to increase the maximum density of locust groups, lowers the percentage of the population that needs to be gregarious for group formation, and decreases both the required density of locusts and time for group formation around an optimal food width. Finally, by looking at foraging efficiency within the numerical experiments we find that there exists a foraging advantage to being gregarious.","Georgiou, Fillipe; Buhl, Jerome; Green, J. E.

All nations are facing this pandemic, including eastern Mediterranean countries. The aim of this study is to assess and compare the impact of this devastating pandemic on lower-middle-income countries in the eastern Mediterranean region, identify the leading causes of its spread, examine the various risk factors associated with its virulence in each country, and provide effective intervention strategies to contain it. METHODS: Using the analysis of variance method, this research compares infection, case fatality, recovery, and positivity rates in seven countries, namely, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Djibouti, Pakistan, Sudan, and Palestine. It focuses on their daily reported confirmed incidents, recoveries, deaths, and tests. RESULTS: The results highlight the significant differences in the effect of COVID-19 in these countries. Regarding the infection rate, Djibouti and Palestine have the highest rate, which could be related to the high poverty and the young population in these countries. However, it has been demonstrated that Tunisia, Djibouti, Egypt, and Sudan have the greatest case fatality rate in this comparison, which might be attributed to the relatively old population in Tunisia, the co-morbidity in Egypt, and the deficiency of the healthcare system in Djibouti and Sudan. Furthermore, the comparison of the recovery rate in these countries indicates that Djibouti has the highest recovery rate, which might be due to the young population.

As the number of sepsis cases increases, so does the number of sepsis survivors who suffer from “post-sepsis syndrome” after hospital discharge. This syndrome involves deficits in multiple systems, including the immune, cognitive, psychiatric, cardiovascular, and renal systems. Combined, these detrimental consequences lead to rehospitalizations, poorer quality of life, and increased mortality. Understanding the pathophysiology of these issues is crucial to develop new therapeutic opportunities to improve survival rate and quality of life of sepsis survivors. Such novel strategies include modulating the immune system and addressing mitochondrial dysfunction.

This discordance illustrates the need for a more unifying explanation as to whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects erythropoiesis. Here, we show significantly enriched CD71(+) erythroid precursors/progenitors in the blood circulation of COVID-19 patients. We found that these cells have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. In agreement, we observed a strong negative correlation between the frequency of these cells with T and B cell proportions in COVID-19 patients. The expansion of these CD71(+) erythroid precursors/progenitors was negatively correlated with the hemoglobin levels. A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45(+) CD71(+) cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, and CD26, and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2.

Our primary objectives in this effort are 3-fold. First, we seek to determine the upper limits of early warning detection through physiological measurements. Second, we investigate whether the detected physiological response is specific to the pathogen. Third, we explore the feasibility of extending early warning detection with wearable devices. Research Methods: For the first objective, we developed a supervised random forest algorithm to detect pathogen exposure in the asymptomatic period prior to overt symptoms (fever). We used high-resolution physiological telemetry data (aortic blood pressure, intrathoracic pressure, electrocardiograms, and core temperature) from non-human primate animal models exposed to two viral pathogens: Ebola and Marburg (N = 20). Second, to determine reusability across different pathogens, we evaluated our algorithm against three independent physiological datasets from non-human primate models (N = 13) exposed to three different pathogens: Lassa and Nipah viruses and Y. pestis. For the third objective, we evaluated performance degradation when the algorithm was restricted to features derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms to emulate data from a non-invasive wearable device. Results: First, our cross-validated random forest classifier provides a mean early warning of 51 ± 12 h, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.93 ± 0.01. Second, our algorithm achieved comparable performance when applied to datasets from different pathogen exposures – a mean early warning of 51 ± 14 h and AUC of 0.95 ± 0.01. Last, with a degraded feature set derived solely from ECG, we observed minimal degradation – a mean early warning of 46 ± 14 h and AUC of 0.91 ± 0.001. Conclusion: Under controlled experimental conditions, physiological measurements can provide over 2 days of early warning with high AUC. Deviations in physiological signals following exposure to a pathogen are due to the underlying host’s immunological response and are not specific to the pathogen. Pre-symptomatic detection is strong even when features are limited to ECG-derivatives, suggesting that this approach may translate to non-invasive wearable devices.","Davis, Shakti; Milechin, Lauren; Patel, Tejash; Hernandez, Mark; Ciccarelli, Greg; Samsi, Siddharth; Hensley, Lisa; Goff, Arthur; Trefry, John; Johnston, Sara; Purcell, Bret; Cabrera, Catherine; Fleischman, Jack; Reuther, Albert; Claypool, Kajal; Rossi, Franco; Honko, Anna; Pratt, William; Swiston, Albert",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552498/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.691074,257

The pandemic has also triggered numerous global initiatives to tackle the newly emerging disease, including the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the attempt to discover potential pharmacological therapies. Nonetheless, despite the success of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, COVID-19 therapy remains challenging. Several repurposed drugs that were documented to be useful in small clinical trials have been shown to be ineffective in larger studies. Additionally, the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection displayed the predominance of hyperinflammation and immune dysregulation in inducing multiorgan damage. Therefore, the potential benefits of both immune modulation and suppression in COVID-19 have been extensively discussed. Here, we reviewed the roles of immunomodulation as potential COVID-19 pharmacological modalities based on the existing data and proposed several new immunologic targets to be tested in the foreseeable future.","Hertanto, Decsa Medika; Wiratama, Bayu Satria; Sutanto, Henry; Wungu, Citrawati Dyah Kencono",J Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34321903/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jir.s322831,257

We assume that each individual can take measures to reduce the probability of contagion, and the level of effort each agent applies can change due to social interactions. We propose simple rules to model the propagation of behaviors that modify the level of effort, and analyze their impact on the dynamics of the disease. We derive a two dimensional set of ordinary differential equations describing the dynamic of the proportion of the number of infected individuals and the mean value of the effort parameter, and analyze the equilibria of the system. The stability of the endemic phase and disease free equilibria depends only on the mean value of the levels of efforts, and not on the initial distribution of levels of effort.","Giambiagi Ferrari, Carlo; Pinasco, Juan Pablo; Saintier, Nicolas",Bull Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34008047/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00910-7,257

Vaccines and biologics are highly efficacious when administered properly. Sixteen rabies-related viruses (lyssaviruses) are similarly lethal, but some are divergent enough to evade protection from current vaccines and biologics, which are based only on the classical rabies virus (RABV). Here we present the development and characterization of LyssaVax, a vaccine featuring a structurally designed, functional chimeric glycoprotein (G) containing immunologically important domains from both RABV G and the highly divergent Mokola virus (MOKV) G. LyssaVax elicits high titers of antibodies specific to both RABV and MOKV Gs in mice. Immune sera also neutralize a range of wild-type lyssaviruses across the major phylogroups. LyssaVax-immunized mice are protected against challenge with recombinant RABV and MOKV. Altogether, LyssaVax demonstrates the utility of structural modeling in vaccine design and constitutes a broadened lyssavirus vaccine candidate.","Fisher, Christine R.; Lowe, David E.; Smith, Todd G.; Yang, Yong; Hutson, Christina L.; Wirblich, Christoph; Cingolani, Gino; Schnell, Matthias J.",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32697993/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107920; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124720309013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720309013,257

It is important to address mental health needs and not to ignore the psychological dimension in this group of patients. In this regard, the first practical step is to have a clear understanding of patients’ psychological issues. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the psychological disturbances of COVID-19 survivors throughout the disease crisis. METHOD: This qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological approach through 14 individual semi-structured in-depth interviews with patients recovered from COVID-19. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi’s seven-step method. RESULTS: Three themes of “living in limbo”, “psychological distress behind the wall” and “psychological burden of being a carrier” were extracted as the psychological disturbances of COVID-19 survivors throughout the disease crisis. CONCLUSION: This study portrayed a better understanding of psychological disturbances of COVID-19 survivors throughout the disease crisis based on their lived experiences. Given the ambiguity in the time of the disease eradication and its continuing course, a deep understanding of these experiences in the current critical situation can help healthcare officials to make appropriate decisions and take measures to assess and identify psychological traumas and perform interventions to improve the mental state of these patients.","Moradi, Yaser; Mollazadeh, Farzin; Karimi, Parivash; Hosseingholipour, Keyvan; Baghaei, Rahim",BMC Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-03009-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33334331/,257

To fabricate the nanolayer on the PET substrate, Au is sputter coated on the flexible PET substrate and MoS(2) NPs are spin coated on Au, which is sputter coated once again with Au. The gp120 antibody is then immobilized on this flexible electrode through cysteamine (Cys) modified on the surface of the Au/MoS(2)/Au nanolayer. Fabrication of the biosensor is verified by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. A flexibility test is done using a micro-fatigue tester. Detection of the gp120 is measured by square wave voltammetry. The results indicate that the prepared biosensor detects 0.1 pg/mL of gp120, which is comparable with previously reported gp120 biosensors prepared even without flexibility. Therefore, the proposed biosensor supports the development of a nanomaterial-based flexible sensing platform for highly sensitive biosensors with flexibility for wearable device application.","Shin, Minkyu; Yoon, Jinho; Yi, Chanyong; Lee, Taek; Choi, Jeong-Woo",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/nano9081076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357466/,257

Abstract Introduction: SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first detected in Spain on 31 January 2020. On 14 March 2020, a State of Emergency was declared in Spain in a bid to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The aim of our study is to analyse the impact on emergency medicine attendance after the national lockdown, as well as the clinical presentation and the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED). Patients and methods: This retrospective observational study included children and adolescents under the age of 18, attended in our PED during the period March 14 to April 17, 2020. Results: A total of 1666 patients were attended during the study period, 65.4% less than in the same period of 2019. Just over half (51.2%) were males, and mean age was 5.4 years. In triage, 39.9% were high priority levels, 6.5% more than 2019. Most frequent reasons for consultation at the PED were fever (26.5%), respiratory symptoms (16.1%), and trauma (15.2%). A total of 218 patients (13%) received a diagnosis of possible COVID-19, with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in 18.4%, and 23.8% (52/218) were hospitalised. At discharge, 44% (96/218) were diagnosed with lower, and 33.9% (74/218) with upper respiratory infection. Conclusions: During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the demand for urgent paediatric care decreased, with the proportion of cases with high priority triage levels increasing.

It has been theorized that children who are asymptomatic or who do not display significant respiratory symptoms are potential vectors for community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This is incompletely understood due to the current lack of widespread testing in the pediatric population. We describe a case of a 2-year-old female who presented with symptoms of prolonged fever, conjunctivitis, extremity edema, rash, dry/cracked lips, fussiness and fatigue, and a notable absence of respiratory symptoms. She was diagnosed with and treated for Kawasaki disease. Due to her prolonged fever, she was tested for COVID-19 which was positive; however, she did not develop respiratory symptoms during her illness. At the time of manuscript submission, this is the second case report to our knowledge showing an association between Kawasaki Disease and SARS-CoV-2 virus, both of which are poorly understood diseases in the pediatric population. This case highlights the value of testing pediatric patients for COVID-19 who present with fever in the absence of other symptoms to improve epidemiologic measures during the ongoing pandemic, and it also adds to a foundation of cases for future research on the presence of a link between Kawasaki Disease and COVID-19.","Peterson, Nicholas; Sagdeo, Kaustubh; Tyungu, Donna; Harper, Cristin; Mihaylo, Kyle; Pollak-Christian, Elza",Case Rep Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8880242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33062362/,257

Face masks are a well-established preventive measure, but their effectiveness for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still under debate. We show that variations in mask efficacy can be explained by different regimes of virus abundance and related to population-average infection probability and reproduction number. For SARS-CoV-2, the viral load of infectious individuals can vary by orders of magnitude. We find that most environments and contacts are under conditions of low virus abundance (virus-limited) where surgical masks are effective at preventing virus spread. More advanced masks and other protective equipment are required in potentially virus-rich indoor environments including medical centers and hospitals. Masks are particularly effective in combination with other preventive measures like ventilation and distancing.","Cheng, Yafang; Ma, Nan; Witt, Christian; Rapp, Steffen; Wild, Philipp S.; Andreae, Meinrat O.; Pöschl, Ulrich; Su, Hang",Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016743/; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg6296,257

World-wide studies have been conducted aiming to understand the COVID-19 mechanism, transmission, clinical features, etc. A cross-language terminology of COVID-19 is essential for improving knowledge sharing and scientific discovery dissemination. METHODS: We developed a bilingual terminology of COVID-19 named COVID Term with mapping Chinese and English terms. The terminology was constructed as follows: (1) Classification schema design; (2) Concept representation model building; (3) Term source selection and term extraction; (4) Hierarchical structure construction; (5) Quality control (6) Web service. We built open access for the terminology, providing search, browse, and download services. RESULTS: The proposed COVID Term include 10 categories: disease, anatomic site, clinical manifestation, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, living organism, qualifiers, psychological assistance, medical equipment, instruments and materials, epidemic prevention and control, diagnosis and treatment technique respectively. In total, COVID Terms covered 464 concepts with 724 Chinese terms and 887 English terms. All terms are openly available online (COVID Term URL: http://covidterm.imicams.ac.cn). CONCLUSIONS: COVID Term is a bilingual terminology focused on COVID-19, the epidemic pneumonia with a high risk of infection around the world.

In this study, in Guinea, we tested a total of 319 bats belonging to 14 genera and six families of insectivorous and frugivorous bats across the country, for the presence of coronaviruses. We found CoVs in 35 (11%) of the tested bats—in three insectivorous bat species and five fruit bat species that were mostly captured close to human habitat. Positivity rates varied from 5.7% to 100%, depending on bat species. A wide diversity of alpha and beta coronaviruses was found across the country, including three sequences belonging to SarbeCoVs and MerbeCoVs subgenera known to harbor highly pathogenic human coronaviruses.

Risk factors for severe maternal outcomes were pulmonary comorbidities [aOR 4.3, 95% CI 1.9–9.5], hypertensive disorders [aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.0–7.0] and diabetes [aOR2.2, 95% CI 1.1–4.5]. Pregnant women with severe maternal outcomes were at higher risk of caesarean section [70.7% (n = 53/75)], preterm delivery [62.7% (n = 32/51)] and newborns requiring admission to the neonatal intensive care unit [41.3% (n = 31/75)].

Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes appear to be influenced by the severity of maternal disease.","Vouga, Manon; Favre, Guillaume; Martinez-Perez, Oscar; Pomar, Leo; Acebal, Laura Forcen; Abascal-Saiz, Alejandra; Hernandez, Maria Rosa Vila; Hcini, Najeh; Lambert, Véronique; Carles, Gabriel; Sichitiu, Joanna; Salomon, Laurent; Stirnemann, Julien; Ville, Yves; de Tejada, Begoña Martinez; Goncé, Anna; Hawkins-Villarreal, Ameth; Castillo, Karen; Solsona, Eduard Gratacos; Trigo, Lucas; Cleary, Brian; Geary, Michael; Bartels, Helena; Al-Kharouf, Feras; Malone, Fergal; Higgins, Mary; Keating, Niamh; Knowles, Susan; Poncelet, Christophe; Ribeiro-do-Valle, Carolina Carvalho; Surita, Fernanda; Dantas-Silva, Amanda; Borrelli, Carolina; Luz, Adriana Gomes; Fuenzalida, Javiera; Carvajal, Jorge; Canales, Manuel Guerra; Hernandez, Olivia; Grechukhina, Olga; Ko, Albert I.; Reddy, Uma; Figueiredo, Rita; Moucho, Marina; Pinto, Pedro Viana; De Luca, Carmen; De Santis, Marco; de Campos, Diogo Ayres; Martins, Inês; Garabedian, Charles; Subtil, Damien; Bohrer, Betania; Da Rocha Oppermann, Maria Lucia; Wender, Maria Celeste Osorio; Schuler-Faccini, Lavinia; Sanseverino, Maria Teresa Vieira; Giugliani, Camila; Friedrich, Luciana; Scherer, Mariana Horn; Mottet, Nicolas; Ducarme, Guillaume; Pelerin, Helene; Moreau, Chloe; Breton, Bénédicte; Quibel, Thibaud; Rozenberg, Patrick; Giannoni, Eric; Granado, Cristina; Monod, Cécile; Mueller, Doris; Hoesli, Irene; Bassler, Dirk; Heldstab, Sandra; Kölble, Nicole Ochsenbein; Sentilhes, Loïc; Charvet, Melissa; Deprest, Jan; Richter, Jute; Van der Veeken, Lennart; Eggel-Hort, Béatrice; Plantefeve, Gaetan; Derouich, Mohamed; Calvache, Albaro José Nieto; Lopez-Giron, Maria Camila; Burgos-Luna, Juan Manuel; Escobar-Vidarte, Maria Fernanda; Hecher, Kurt; Tallarek, Ann-Christin; Hadar, Eran; Haratz, Karina Krajden; Amikam, Uri; Malinger, Gustavo; Maymon, Ron; Yogev, Yariv; Schäffer, Leonhard; Toussaint, Arnaud; Rossier, Marie-Claude; De Sa, Renato Augusto Moreira; Grawe, Claudia; Aebi-Popp, Karoline; Radan, Anda-Petronela; Raio, Luigi; Surbek, Daniel; Böckenhoff, Paul; Strizek, Brigitte; Kaufmann, Martin; Bloch, Andrea; Boulvain, Michel; Johann, Silke; Heldstab, Sandra Andrea; Bernasconi, Monya Todesco; Grant, Gaston; Feki, Anis; Brochut, Anne-Claude Muller; Giral, Marylene; Sedille, Lucie; Papadia, Andrea; Brugger, Romina Capoccia; Weber, Brigitte; Fischer, Tina; Kahlert, Christian; Saines, Karin Nielsen; Cambou, Mary; Kanellos, Panagiotis; Chen, Xiang; Yin, Mingzhu; Haessig, Annina; Ackermann, Sandrine; Baud, David; Panchaud, Alice",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230507/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92357-y,257
