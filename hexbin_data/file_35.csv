44,44,44,Sequence specific visual detection of LAMP reactions by addition of cationic polymers,11.96919,5.790839,2006-01-10,"BACKGROUND: Development of a practical gene point-of-care testing device (g-POCT device) requires innovative detection methods for demonstrating the results of the gene amplification reaction without the use of expensive equipment. We have studied a new method for the sequence-specific visual detection of minute amounts of nucleic acids using precipitation reaction by addition of cationic polymers to amplicons of Loop mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP). RESULTS: Oligo DNA probes labeled with different fluorescent dyes were prepared for multiple nucleic acid templates, and the templates were amplified by the LAMP reactions under the existence of the probes. At completion of the LAMP reaction, an optimal amount of low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI) was added, resulting in the precipitation of the insoluble LAMP amplicon-PEI complex. The fluorescently labeled Oligo DNA probes hybridized to the LAMP product were incorporated into the precipitation, and the precipitate emitted fluorescence corresponding to the amplified nucleic acid templates. The color of emitted fluorescence can be detected easily by naked eye on a conventional UV illuminator. CONCLUSION: The presence or absence of minute amount of nucleic acid templates could be detected in a simple manner through visual assessment for the color of the LAMP amplicon-PEI complex precipitate. We conclude that this detection method may facilitate development of small and simple g-POCT device.","Mori, Yasuyoshi; Hirano, Tsuyoshi; Notomi, Tsugunori",BMC Biotechnol,35,1
73,73,73,MIMOX: a web tool for phage display based epitope mapping,12.061836,5.8987446,2006-10-12,"BACKGROUND: Phage display is widely used in basic research such as the exploration of protein-protein interaction sites and networks, and applied research such as the development of new drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. It has also become a promising method for epitope mapping. Research on new algorithms that assist and automate phage display based epitope mapping has attracted many groups. Most of the existing tools have not been implemented as an online service until now however, making it less convenient for the community to access, utilize, and evaluate them. RESULTS: We present MIMOX, a free web tool that helps to map the native epitope of an antibody based on one or more user supplied mimotopes and the antigen structure. MIMOX was coded in Perl using modules from the Bioperl project. It has two sections. In the first section, MIMOX provides a simple interface for ClustalW to align a set of mimotopes. It also provides a simple statistical method to derive the consensus sequence and embeds JalView as a Java applet to view and manage the alignment. In the second section, MIMOX can map a single mimotope or a consensus sequence of a set of mimotopes, on to the corresponding antigen structure and search for all of the clusters of residues that could represent the native epitope. NACCESS is used to evaluate the surface accessibility of the candidate clusters; and Jmol is embedded to view them interactively in their 3D context. Initial case studies show that MIMOX can reproduce mappings from existing tools such as FINDMAP and 3DEX, as well as providing novel, rational results. CONCLUSION: A web-based tool called MIMOX has been developed for phage display based epitope mapping. As a publicly available online service in this area, it is convenient for the community to access, utilize, and evaluate, complementing other existing programs.

101,101,101,Screen for ISG15-crossreactive Deubiquitinases,11.849006,5.959397,2007-07-25,"BACKGROUND: The family of ubiquitin-like molecules (UbLs) comprises several members, each of which has sequence, structural, or functional similarity to ubiquitin. ISG15 is a homolog of ubiquitin in vertebrates and is strongly upregulated following induction by type I interferon. ISG15 can be covalently attached to proteins, analogous to ubiquitination and with actual support of ubiquitin conjugating factors. Specific proteases are able to reverse modification with ubiquitin or UbLs by hydrolyzing the covalent bond between their C-termini and substrate proteins. The tail regions of ubiquitin and ISG15 are identical and we therefore hypothesized that promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs) might exist, capable of recognizing both ubiquitin and ISG15. RESULTS: We have cloned and expressed 22 human DUBs, representing the major clades of the USP protease family. Utilizing suicide inhibitors based on ubiquitin and ISG15, we have identified USP2, USP5 (IsoT1), USP13 (IsoT3), and USP14 as ISG15-reactive proteases, in addition to the bona fide ISG15-specific protease USP18 (UBP43). USP14 is a proteasome-associated DUB, and its ISG15 isopeptidase activity increases when complexed with the proteasome. CONCLUSIONS: By evolutionary standards, ISG15 is a newcomer among the UbLs and it apparently not only utilizes the conjugating but also the deconjugating machinery of its more established relative ubiquitin. Functional overlap between these two posttranslational modifiers might therefore be more extensive than previously appreciated and explain the rather innocuous phenotype of ISG15 null mice.","Catic, André; Fiebiger, Edda; Korbel, Gregory A.; Blom, Daniël; Galardy, Paul J.; Ploegh, Hidde L.",PLoS One,35,1
170,170,170,Investigating selection on viruses: a statistical alignment approach,11.735935,5.80181,2008-07-10,"BACKGROUND: Two problems complicate the study of selection in viral genomes: Firstly, the presence of genes in overlapping reading frames implies that selection in one reading frame can bias our estimates of neutral mutation rates in another reading frame. Secondly, the high mutation rates we are likely to encounter complicate the inference of a reliable alignment of genomes. To address these issues, we develop a model that explicitly models selection in overlapping reading frames. We then integrate this model into a statistical alignment framework, enabling us to estimate selection while explicitly dealing with the uncertainty of individual alignments. We show that in this way we obtain un-biased selection parameters for different genomic regions of interest, and can improve in accuracy compared to using a fixed alignment. RESULTS: We run a series of simulation studies to gauge how well we do in selection estimation, especially in comparison to the use of a fixed alignment. We show that the standard practice of using a ClustalW alignment can lead to considerable biases and that estimation accuracy increases substantially when explicitly integrating over the uncertainty in inferred alignments. We even manage to compete favourably for general evolutionary distances with an alignment produced by GenAl. We subsequently run our method on HIV2 and Hepatitis B sequences. CONCLUSION: We propose that marginalizing over all alignments, as opposed to using a fixed one, should be considered in any parametric inference from divergent sequence data for which the alignments are not known with certainty. Moreover, we discover in HIV2 that double coding regions appear to be under less stringent selection than single coding ones. Additionally, there appears to be evidence for differential selection, where one overlapping reading frame is under positive and the other under negative selection.","de Groot, Saskia; Mailund, Thomas; Lunter, Gerton; Hein, Jotun",BMC Bioinformatics,35,1
529,529,529,In Vitro Gene Delivery Mediated by Asialofetuin-Appended Cationic Liposomes Associated with γ-Cyclodextrin into Hepatocytes,11.7086315,6.124732,2010-12-09,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate in vitro gene delivery mediated by asialofetuin-appended cationic liposomes (AF-liposomes) associating cyclodextrins (CyD/AF-liposomes) as a hepatocyte-selective nonviral vector. Of various CyDs, AF-liposomes associated with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CyD) (pDNA/γ-CyD/AF-liposomes) showed the highest gene transfer activity in HepG2 cells without any significant cytotoxicity. In addition, γ-CyD enhanced the encapsulation ratio of pDNA with AF-liposomes, and also increased gene transfer activity as the entrapment ratio of pDNA into AF-liposomes was increased. γ-CyD stabilized the liposomal membrane of AF-liposomes and inhibited the release of calcein from AF-liposomes. The stabilizing effect of γ-CyD may be, at least in part, involved in the enhancing gene transfer activity of pDNA/γ-CyD/AF-liposomes. Therefore, these results suggest the potential use of γ-CyD for an enhancer of transfection efficiency of AF-liposomes.","Motoyama, Keiichi; Nakashima, Yoshihiro; Aramaki, Yukihiko; Hirayama, Fumitoshi; Uekama, Kaneto; Arima, Hidetoshi",J Drug Deliv,35,1

Their distribution was studied histologically at six time points by measuring iron-positive areas (μm(2)) in organ sections stained with Prussian blue. The uptake of the differently sized particles was also compared by cultured murine macrophages (J774.1). Iron-positive areas in the liver were significantly larger in the mice injected with USPIO than those injected with SPIO at the first three time points (P < 0.05). The amount of USPIO in the lung parenchyma around the airway was larger than that of SPIO at four time points (P < 0.05); distribution to the lymph nodes was not significantly different. The amount of iron was significantly larger in SPIO- than USPIO-treated cultured cells (P < 0.05). In conclusion, it is suggested that intra peritoneally injected USPIO particles could be used more quickly than SPIO to make Kupffer images of the liver and that both agents could help get lymph node images of similar quality.","Tsuchiya, Keiko; Nitta, Norihisa; Sonoda, Akinaga; Nitta-Seko, Ayumi; Ohta, Shinichi; Otani, Hideji; Takahashi, Masashi; Murata, Kiyoshi; Murase, Katsutoshi; Nohara, Satoshi; Mukaisho, Kenichi",Int J Nanomedicine,35,1
758,758,758,The Dispanins: A Novel Gene Family of Ancient Origin That Contains 14 Human Members,11.806524,5.79956,2012-02-20,"The Interferon induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM) are a family of transmembrane proteins that is known to inhibit cell invasion of viruses such as HIV-1 and influenza. We show that the IFITM genes are a subfamily in a larger family of transmembrane (TM) proteins that we call Dispanins, which refers to a common 2TM structure. We mined the Dispanins in 36 eukaryotic species, covering all major eukaryotic groups, and investigated their evolutionary history using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches to infer a phylogenetic tree. We identified ten human genes that together with the known IFITM genes form the Dispanin family. We show that the Dispanins first emerged in eukaryotes in a common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoa, and that the family later expanded in vertebrates where it forms four subfamilies (A–D). Interestingly, we also find that the family is found in several different phyla of bacteria and propose that it was horizontally transferred to eukaryotes from bacteria in the common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoa. The bacterial and eukaryotic sequences have a considerably conserved protein structure. In conclusion, we introduce a novel family, the Dispanins, together with a nomenclature based on the evolutionary origin.","Sällman Almén, Markus; Bringeland, Nathalie; Fredriksson, Robert; Schiöth, Helgi B.",PLoS One,35,11
912,912,912,Proteomic Investigation of Falciparum and Vivax Malaria for Identification of Surrogate Protein Markers,11.832623,5.939072,2012-08-09,"This study was conducted to analyze alterations in the human serum proteome as a consequence of infection by malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax to obtain mechanistic insights about disease pathogenesis, host immune response, and identification of potential protein markers. Serum samples from patients diagnosed with falciparum malaria (FM) (n = 20), vivax malaria (VM) (n = 17) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 20) were investigated using multiple proteomic techniques and results were validated by employing immunoassay-based approaches. Specificity of the identified malaria related serum markers was evaluated by means of analysis of leptospirosis as a febrile control (FC). Compared to HC, 30 and 31 differentially expressed and statistically significant (p<0.05) serum proteins were identified in FM and VM respectively, and almost half (46.2%) of these proteins were commonly modulated due to both of the plasmodial infections. 13 proteins were found to be differentially expressed in FM compared to VM. Functional pathway analysis involving the identified proteins revealed the modulation of different vital physiological pathways, including acute phase response signaling, chemokine and cytokine signaling, complement cascades and blood coagulation in malaria. A panel of identified proteins consists of six candidates; serum amyloid A, hemopexin, apolipoprotein E, haptoglobin, retinol-binding protein and apolipoprotein A-I was used to build statistical sample class prediction models. By employing PLS-DA and other classification methods the clinical phenotypic classes (FM, VM, FC and HC) were predicted with over 95% prediction accuracy. Individual performance of three classifier proteins; haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A-I and retinol-binding protein in diagnosis of malaria was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The discrimination of FM, VM, FC and HC groups on the basis of differentially expressed serum proteins demonstrates the potential of this analytical approach for the detection of malaria as well as other human diseases.","Ray, Sandipan; Renu, Durairaj; Srivastava, Rajneesh; Gollapalli, Kishore; Taur, Santosh; Jhaveri, Tulip; Dhali, Snigdha; Chennareddy, Srinivasarao; Potla, Ankit; Dikshit, Jyoti Bajpai; Srikanth, Rapole; Gogtay, Nithya; Thatte, Urmila; Patankar, Swati; Srivastava, Sanjeeva",PLoS One,35,1
975,975,975,A Single Native Ganglioside GM(1)-Binding Site Is Sufficient for Cholera Toxin To Bind to Cells and Complete the Intoxication Pathway,11.630945,6.0445952,2012-10-30,"Cholera toxin (CT) from Vibrio cholerae is responsible for the majority of the symptoms of the diarrheal disease cholera. CT is a heterohexameric protein complex with a 240-residue A subunit and a pentameric B subunit of identical 103-residue B polypeptides. The A subunit is proteolytically cleaved within a disulfide-linked loop to generate the A1 and A2 fragments. The B subunit of wild-type (wt) CT binds 5 cell surface ganglioside GM(1) (GM(1)) molecules, and the toxin-GM(1) complex traffics from the plasma membrane (PM) retrograde through endosomes and the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). From the ER, the enzymatic A1 fragment retrotranslocates to the cytosol to cause disease. Clustering of GM(1) by multivalent toxin binding can structurally remodel cell membranes in ways that may assist toxin uptake and retrograde trafficking. We have recently found, however, that CT may traffic from the PM to the ER by exploiting an endogenous glycosphingolipid pathway (A. A. Wolf et al., Infect. Immun. 76:1476–1484, 2008, and D. J. F. Chinnapen et al., Dev. Cell 23:573–586, 2012), suggesting that multivalent binding to GM(1) is dispensable. Here we formally tested this idea by creating homogenous chimeric holotoxins with defined numbers of native GM(1) binding sites from zero (nonbinding) to five (wild type). We found that a single GM(1) binding site is sufficient for activity of the holotoxin. Therefore, remodeling of cell membranes by mechanisms that involve multivalent binding of toxin to GM(1) receptors is not essential for toxicity of CT.","Jobling, Michael G.; Yang, ZhiJie; Kam, Wendy R.; Lencer, Wayne I.; Holmes, Randall K.",mBio,35,1

These cells express toll-like receptors (TLRs), innate immune receptors which govern tailored inflammatory gene expression patterns. Monocytes, which produce pro-inflammatory mediators, are readily recruited to the central nervous system (CNS) in neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: This study explored the expression of receptors (CD11b, TLR2 and TLR4) on circulating monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy elderly adults who we classified as either IQ memory-consistent (high-performing, HP) or IQ memory-discrepant (low-performing, LP). RESULTS: The expression of CD11b, TLR4 and TLR2 was increased in MDMs from the LP group when compared to HP cohort. MDMs from both groups responded robustly to treatment with the TLR4 activator, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in terms of cytokine production. Significantly, MDMs from the LP group displayed hypersensitivity to LPS exposure. INTERPRETATION: Overall these findings define differential receptor expression and cytokine profiles that occur in MDMs derived from a cohort of IQ memory-discrepant individuals. These changes are indicative of inflammation and may be involved in the prodromal processes leading to the development of neurodegenerative disease.","Downer, Eric J.; Jones, Raasay S.; McDonald, Claire L.; Greco, Eleonora; Brennan, Sabina; Connor, Thomas J.; Robertson, Ian H.; Lynch, Marina A.",PLoS One,35,1
1163,1163,1163,Self-Oligomerization Is Essential for Enhanced Immunological Activities of Soluble Recombinant Calreticulin,12.082971,5.8306966,2013-06-10,"We have recently reported that calreticulin (CRT), a luminal resident protein, can be found in the sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and also that recombinant CRT (rCRT) exhibits extraordinarily strong immunological activities. We herein further demonstrate that rCRT fragments 18–412 (rCRT/18-412), rCRT/39-272, rCRT/120-308 and rCRT/120-250 can self-oligomerize in solution and are 50–100 fold more potent than native CRT (nCRT, isolated from mouse livers) in activating macrophages in vitro. We narrowed down the active site of CRT to residues 150–230, the activity of which also depends on dimerization. By contrast, rCRT/18-197 is almost completely inactive. When rCRT/18-412 is fractionated into oligomers and monomers by gel filtration, the oligomers maintain most of their immunological activities in terms of activating macrophages in vitro and inducing specific antibodies in vivo, while the monomers were much less active by comparison. Additionally, rCRT/18-412 oligomers are much better than monomers in binding to, and uptake by, macrophages. Inhibition of macrophage endocytosis partially blocks the stimulatory effect of rCRT/18-412. We conclude that the immunologically active site of CRT maps between residues 198–230 and that soluble CRT could acquire potent immuno-pathological activities in microenvironments favoring its oligomerization.","Huang, Shang-Hui; Zhao, Li-Xiang; Hong, Chao; Duo, Cui-Cui; Guo, Bing-Nan; Zhang, Li-Juan; Gong, Zheng; Xiong, Si-Dong; Gong, Fang-Yuan; Gao, Xiao-Ming",PLoS One,35,31
1190,1190,1190,Hepatic Deficiency of COP9 Signalosome Subunit 8 Induces Ubiquitin-Proteasome System Impairment and Bim-Mediated Apoptosis in Murine Livers,12.022028,6.017347,2013-07-01,"The COP9 signalosome (CSN), an evolutionally highly conserved protein complex composed of 8 unique subunits (CSN1 through CSN8) in higher eukaryotes, is purported to modulate protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) but this has not been demonstrated in a critical mitotic parenchymal organ of vertebrates. Hepatocyte-specific knockout of the Cops8 gene (HS-Csn8KO) was shown to cause massive hepatocyte apoptosis and liver malfunction but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that Csn8/CSN exerts profound impacts on hepatic UPS function and is critical to the stability of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. Significant decreases in CIS (cytokine-inducible Src homology 2 domain-containing protein), a Bim receptor of a cullin2-based ubiquitin ligase, were found to co-exist with a marked increase of Bim proteins. Csn8 deficiency also significantly decreased 19S proteasome subunit Rpt5 and markedly increased high molecular weight neddylated and ubiquitinated proteins. The use of a surrogate UPS substrate further reveals severe impairment of UPS-mediated proteolysis in HS-Csn8KO livers. Inclusion body-like materials were accumulated in Csn8 deficient hepatocytes. In addition to Bim, massive hepatocyte apoptosis in HS-Csn8KO livers is also associated with elevated expression of other members of the Bcl2 family, including pro-apoptotic Bax as well as anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and Bcl-XL. Increased interaction between Bcl2 and Bim, but not between Bcl2 and Bax, was detected. Hence, it is concluded that hepatic CSN8 deficiency impairs the UPS in the liver and the resultant Bim upregulation likely plays an important role in triggering hepatocyte apoptosis via sequestering Bcl2 away from Bax.","Lei, Daoxiong; Li, Faqian; Su, Huabo; Liu, Jinbao; Wei, Ning; Wang, Xuejun",PLoS One,35,19

1892,1892,1892,"Bridge hosts, a missing link for disease ecology in multi-host systems",12.001914,5.927766,2015-07-21,"In ecology, the grouping of species into functional groups has played a valuable role in simplifying ecological complexity. In epidemiology, further clarifications of epidemiological functions are needed: while host roles may be defined, they are often used loosely, partly because of a lack of clarity on the relationships between a host’s function and its epidemiological role. Here we focus on the definition of bridge hosts and their epidemiological consequences. Bridge hosts provide a link through which pathogens can be transmitted from maintenance host populations or communities to receptive populations that people want to protect (i.e., target hosts). A bridge host should (1) be competent for the pathogen or able to mechanically transmit it; and (2) come into direct contact or share habitat with both maintenance and target populations. Demonstration of bridging requires an operational framework that integrates ecological and epidemiological approaches. We illustrate this framework using the example of the transmission of Avian Influenza Viruses across wild bird/poultry interfaces in Africa and discuss a range of other examples that demonstrate the usefulness of our definition for other multi-host systems. Bridge hosts can be particularly important for understanding and managing infectious disease dynamics in multi-host systems at wildlife/domestic/human interfaces, including emerging infections.

Whereas in the case of allotransplantation the transmitted microorganisms and their pathogenic effect are well characterized, the possible influence of porcine microorganisms on humans is mostly unknown. Porcine circoviruses (PCVs) are common in pig breeds and they belong to porcine microorganisms that still have not been fully addressed in terms of evaluating the potential risk of xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues, and organs. Two types of PCVs are known: porcine circovirus (PCV) 1 and PCV2. Whereas PCV1 is apathogenic in pigs, PCV2 may induce severe pig diseases. Although most pigs are subclinically infected, we do not know whether this infection impairs pig transplant functionality, particularly because PCV2 is immunosuppressive. In addition, vaccination against PCV2 is able to prevent diseases, but in most cases not transmission of the virus. Therefore, PCV2 has to be eliminated to obtain xenotransplants from uninfected healthy animals. Although there is evidence that PCV2 does not infect—at least immunocompetent—humans, animals should be screened using sensitive methods to ensure virus elimination by selection, Cesarean delivery, vaccination, or embryo transfer.","Denner, Joachim; Mankertz, Annette",Viruses,35,1

However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species likely harbor the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries(5–7). Here we conduct the most comprehensive analysis yet of mammalian host-virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species, and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy, and human population within a species range – which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate for the first time that bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of ‘missing viruses’ and ‘missing zoonoses’ and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people.","Olival, Kevin J.; Hosseini, Parviez R.; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos; Ross, Noam; Bogich, Tiffany L.; Daszak, Peter",Nature,35,1

Here, we aimed to understand how the evolution shapes the bacteriophage lambda genes by performing a high resolution analysis of ribosomal profiling data and gene expression related synonymous/silent information encoded in bacteriophage coding regions. We demonstrated evidence of selection for distinct compositions of synonymous codons in early and late viral genes related to the adaptation of translation efficiency to different bacteriophage developmental stages. Specifically, we showed that evolution of viral coding regions is driven, among others, by selection for codons with higher decoding rates; during the initial/progressive stages of infection the decoding rates in early/late genes were found to be superior to those in late/early genes, respectively. Moreover, we argued that selection for translation efficiency could be partially explained by adaptation to Escherichia coli tRNA pool and the fact that it can change during the bacteriophage life cycle. An analysis of additional aspects related to the expression of viral genes, such as mRNA folding and more complex/longer regulatory signals in the coding regions, is also reported. The reported conclusions are likely to be relevant also to additional viruses.","Goz, Eli; Mioduser, Oriah; Diament, Alon; Tuller, Tamir",DNA Res,35,1

However, the techniques required are complicated and analysis standards have yet to develop. This, together with the wealth of different tools and workflows that have been proposed, poses a barrier for new users. We evaluated 49 published computational classification workflows for virus metagenomics in a literature review. To this end, we described the methods of existing workflows by breaking them up into five general steps and assessed their ease-of-use and validation experiments. Performance scores of previous benchmarks were summarized and correlations between methods and performance were investigated. We indicate the potential suitability of the different workflows for (1) time-constrained diagnostics, (2) surveillance and outbreak source tracing, (3) detection of remote homologies (discovery), and (4) biodiversity studies. We provide two decision trees for virologists to help select a workflow for medical or biodiversity studies, as well as directions for future developments in clinical viral metagenomics.","Nooij, Sam; Schmitz, Dennis; Vennema, Harry; Kroneman, Annelies; Koopmans, Marion P.

In the past number of in silico methods have been developed for predicting the antimicrobial property of the peptide containing natural residues. This study describes models developed for predicting the antimicrobial property of a chemically modified peptide. Our models have been trained, tested and evaluated on a dataset that contains 948 antimicrobial and 931 non-antimicrobial peptides, containing chemically modified and natural residues. Firstly, the tertiary structure of all peptides has been predicted using software PEPstrMOD. Structure analysis indicates that certain type of modifications enhance the antimicrobial property of peptides. Secondly, a wide range of features was computed from the structure of these peptides using software PaDEL. Finally, models were developed for predicting the antimicrobial potential of chemically modified peptides using a wide range of structural features of these peptides. Our best model based on support vector machine achieve maximum MCC of 0.84 with an accuracy of 91.62% on training dataset and MCC of 0.80 with an accuracy of 89.89% on validation dataset.

3770,3770,3770,New Insight Into Avian Papillomavirus Ecology and Evolution From Characterization of Novel Wild Bird Papillomaviruses,11.837814,5.663392,2019-04-12,"Viruses in the family Papillomaviridae have circular dsDNA genomes of approximately 5.7–8.6 kb that are packaged within non-enveloped, icosahedral capsids. The known papillomavirus (PV) representatives infect vertebrates, and there are currently more than 130 recognized PV species in more than 50 genera. We identified 12 novel avian papillomavirus (APV) types in wild birds that could represent five distinct species and two genera. Viruses were detected in paired oropharyngeal/cloacal swabs collected from six bird species, increasing the number of avian species known to harbor PVs by 40%. A new duck PV (DuPV-3) was found in mallard and American black duck (27.6% estimated prevalence) that was monophyletic with other known DuPVs. A single viral type was identified in Atlantic puffin (PuPV-1, 9.8% estimated prevalence), while a higher genetic diversity was found in other Charadriiformes. Specifically, three types [gull PV-1 (GuPV-1), -2, and -3] were identified in two gull species (estimated prevalence of 17% and 2.6% in American herring and great black-backed gull, respectively), and seven types [kittiwake PV-1 (KiPV-1) through -7] were found in black-legged kittiwake (81.3% estimated prevalence). Significantly higher DuPV-3 circulation was observed in spring compared to fall and in adults compared to juveniles. The studied host species’ tendencies to be in crowded environments likely affect infection rates and their migratory behaviors could explain the high viral diversity, illustrating how host behavior can influence viral ecology and distribution. For DuPV-3, GuPV-1, PuPV-1, and KiPV-2, we obtained the complete genomic sequences, which showed the same organization as other known APVs. Phylogenetic analyses showed evidence for virus–host co-divergence at the host taxonomic levels of family, order, and inter-order, but we also observed that host-specificity constraints are relaxed among highly related hosts as we found cross-species transmission within ducks and within gulls. Furthermore, the phylogeny of viruses infecting the Charadriiformes did not match the host phylogeny and gull viruses formed distinct monophyletic clades with kittiwake viruses, possibly reflecting past host-switching events. Considering the vast PV genotype diversity in other hosts and the large number of bird species, many more APVs likely remain to be discovered.","Canuti, Marta; Munro, Hannah J.; Robertson, Gregory J.; Kroyer, Ashley N.

4013,4013,4013,Evolution and containment of transmissible recombinant vector vaccines,11.868776,6.146558,2019-06-12,"Transmissible vaccines offer a revolutionary approach for controlling infectious disease and may provide one of the few feasible methods for eliminating pathogens from inaccessible wildlife populations. Current efforts to develop transmissible vaccines use recombinant vector technology whereby pathogen antigens are engineered to be expressed from innocuous infectious viral vectors. The resulting vaccines can transmit from host to host, amplifying the number of vaccine‐protected individuals beyond those initially vaccinated directly through parenteral inoculation. One main engineering challenge is the potential for natural selection to favor vaccine mutants that eliminate or reduce expression of antigenic inserts, resulting in immunogenic decay of the vaccine over time. Here, we study a mathematical model of vector mutation whereby continuous elimination of the antigenic insert results in reversion of the vaccine back into the insert‐free vector. We use this model to quantify the maximum allowable rate of reversion that can be tolerated for a transmissible vaccine to maintain a critical threshold level of immunogenicity against a target pathogen. Our results demonstrate that even for transmissible vaccines where reversion is frequent, performance will often substantially exceed that of conventional, directly administered vaccines. Further, our results demonstrate the feasibility of designing transmissible vaccines that yield desired levels of immunogenicity, yet degrade at a rate sufficient for persistence of the recombinant vaccine within the environment to be minimized.","Nuismer, Scott L.; Basinski, Andrew; Bull, James J.",Evol Appl,35,1

Cohort members were followed for 3 years and interviewed annually regarding (1) demography and attitudes regarding zoonotic disease, (2) medical history, (3) specific exposures to potential zoonotic infection sources, and (4) socioeconomic status. Interview information over the 3 years was combined and analyzed as cross-sectional data. Of the 297 cohort members interviewed, the majority (79.8%; 237/297) reported raising livestock; almost all (99.6%; 236/237) reported being routinely exposed to domestic animals, and more than a quarter (28.7%; 68/237) were exposed to exotic animals.

Among eight viral RNA segments, the multiple functions of nucleoprotein (NP) play important roles in viral replication and transcription. METHODS: To understand how NP contributes to the virus evolution, we analyzed the NP gene of H3N2 viruses in Taiwan and 14,220 NP sequences collected from Influenza Research Database. The identified genetic variations were further analyzed by mini-genome assay, virus growth assay, viral RNA and protein expression as well as ferret model to analyze their impacts on viral replication properties. RESULTS: The NP genetic analysis by Taiwan and global sequences showed similar evolution pattern that the NP backbones changed through time accompanied with specific residue substitutions from 1999 to 2018. Other than the conserved residues, fifteen sporadic substitutions were observed in which the 31R, 377G and 450S showed higher frequency. We found 31R and 450S decreased polymerase activity while the dominant residues (31 K and 450G) had higher activity. The 31 K and 450G showed better viral translation and replication in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated variations identified in evolution have roles in modulating viral replication in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates that the interaction between variations of NP during virus evolution deserves future attention.","Hung, Su-Jhen; Hsu, Yin-Mei; Huang, Sheng-Wen; Tsai, Huey-Pin; Lee, Leo Yi Yang; Hurt, Aeron C.; Barr, Ian G.; Shih, Shin-Ru; Wang, Jen-Ren",J Biomed Sci,35,1

The Hep B Free campaign was launched to eliminate HBV in San Francisco by increasing awareness, testing, vaccination and linkage to care. The campaign conducted 306 street intercept and telephone interviews of San Francisco Asians to assess current levels of HBV knowledge, testing behaviors and effectiveness of existing campaign media materials. One-third of respondents ranked HBV as a key health issue in the Asian community, second to diabetes. General HBV awareness is high (85%); however, a majority could not name an effective prevention method. Sixty percent reported having been tested for HBV; provider recommendation was the most often cited reason for testing. Respondents reported a high level of trust in their providers to correctly assess which health issues they may be at risk for developing and test accordingly, confirming that efforts to increase HBV testing among Asians must simultaneously mobilize the public to request testing and compel providers to test high-risk patients. Regarding community awareness, more than half reported hearing more about HBV recently; younger respondents were more likely to have encountered campaign materials and recall correct HBV facts. Assessment of specific campaign materials found that while upbeat images and taglines captured attention and destigmatized HBV, messages that emphasize the pervasiveness and deadly consequence of infection were more likely to drive respondents to seek education and testing.

RESULTS: Decision-making with regard to vaccine policy implementation has been and is still most often driven by fear: fear of disease (when perceived as rampant and/or dangerous), but also fear of vaccine-associated adverse events (when the disease is less or no longer “visible”). However, methodology for introducing evidence-based immunisation policies exists and can be used by public health authorities, while vaccination information systems (such as the Swiss InfoVac) have proven their usefulness in providing trustworthy, peer-based knowledge to health-care workers.

Our strategy includes the prediction of selective interactions, developing structure, and knowledge-based selective pharmacophore models, followed by database screening and molecular docking. This unique strategy was employed in addressing the off-target toxicity of Gsk3β and CDKs. The connections of Gsk3β in eukaryotic cell apoptosis and the extensive potency of Gsk3β inhibitors to block cell death have made it a potential drug-discovery target for many grievous human disorders. Gsk3β is phylogenetically very closely related to the CDKs, such as CDK1 and CDK2, which are suggested to be the off-target proteins of Gsk3β inhibitors. Here, we have employed novel computational approaches in designing the ligand candidates that are potentially inhibitory against Gsk3β, with well-defined the exclusion ability to CDKs. A structure-ligand -based selective pharmacophore was modeled. This model was used to retrieve molecules from the zinc database. The hits retrieved were further screened by molecular docking and protein–ligand interaction fingerprints. Based on these results, four molecules were predicted as selective Gsk3β antagonists.

However, little research has examined the factors that underlie initial worry about infection and subsequent behavioral responses to such worry. PURPOSE: This study seeks to model some key predictors of worry and behavioral responses in the early stages of the swine flu pandemic (WHO pandemic stage 5). METHOD: A cross-sectional internet questionnaire study (N = 186). RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of respondents rated themselves as worried about being a victim of swine flu, 40% that they were worried of a family member contracting the virus. Twenty percent had bought, or intended to buy, preparatory materials (e.g., face masks), 20% intended to delay or cancel air travel. In a structural equation model, conservation values and family or friends perception of risks predicted worry about infection, while worry correlated with the purchase of preparatory materials, a lesser willingness to travel by public transport, and difficulty in focusing on everyday activities. CONCLUSION: While previous research on pandemic risk perception has focused on cognitive risk judgments, our data suggests that initial “emotional” concerns about infection are also significant predictors of behavioral responses to pandemic threat. Such worry is likely to be influenced by a variety of individual factors, such as personal values, as well as normative pressures. Practitioners can use and expand on such models of pandemic response when tailoring health campaigns to meet newly emergent threats.","Goodwin, Robin; Gaines, Stanley O.; Myers, Lynn; Neto, Felix",Int J Behav Med,35,1

Disease-free survival was 51% (19 patients) with a median of 352 days and 59% (21 patients) with a median of 760 days for PBSC and BMT transplants, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate that allogeneic PBSCT led to significantly faster leukocyte engraftment but is associated with a higher incidence and more rapid onset of severe acute GVHD comparing all patients, including the 17 mismatched transplants. However, the incidence of severe acute GVHD in HLA-identical patients was not different between the PBSCT and BMT groups.

This hypothesis was tested during cardiac surgery and during the adult respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN: We used patients with an expected different degree of endothelial cell damage. ACE levels in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were compared with indirect markers of alveolo-capillary barrier integrity. SETTING: Interdisciplinary team in a university hospital. METHODS: 13 Cardiac surgery patients received no glucocorticoids and 13 others received 2g methylprednisolone before extracorporeal circulation. Thirteen patients were used as controls and 15 patients had nonseptic adult respiratory distress syndrome. All underwent bronchoalveolar lavage for ACE determination. RESULTS: At different times during surgery serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were not significantly different between the two groups. In post-operative bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were significantly higher in patients who received corticoids (27.8±1.7U/1, mean±SEM), compared to patients without corticoids (19.8±1.4U/1), control patients (18.2±1.3U/1) or patients with full blown non-septic adult respiratory distress syndrome (18.8±1.1U/1). There were no correlations between lavage angiotensin-converting enzyme and other parameters for alveolo-capillary membrane integrity in the lavage fluid such as the number of neutrophil cells, albumin or protein concentration, and between lavage angiotensin-converting enzyme and PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio during lavage. CONCLUSION: Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid does not reflect damage of endothelial cells or damage of alveolocapillary integrity in acute pulmonary disease.","De Jongh, R.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational study in a single-center bed pediatric intensive care unit serving two Dutch provinces. PATIENTS: 533 mechanically ventilated children aged 0–16 years, all of whom met the North-American European Consensus Conference criteria for ARDS. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Chest radiographs were screened for the novel presence of bilateral infiltrates, in patients with bilateral infiltrates the PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was calculated on two separate consecutive measurements. If below 200, the patient was classified as having ARDS. Left ventricular dysfunction was ruled out by echocardiography. The incidence was calculated by obtaining the number of children aged 0–16 years in our region. For each patient it was noted whether the patient was currently considered to have ARDS. Forty-one patients (7.7%) met the criteria for ARDS, with an incidence of 2.2 per 100,000 per year. The mortality rate was 20.4%. Thirty patients (73.1%) had primary ARDS, mainly from viral lower respiratory tract disease. Only ten patients (24.4%) currently had ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pediatric ARDS is low compared to that of adult ARDS, and further underestimated as most patients were diagnosed by their underlying diseases.","Kneyber, Martin C.

Prompt diagnosis of GAS can improve the quality of patient care and minimize the unnecessary use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop an alternative nucleic acid amplification method for the diagnosis of GAS. METHOD: We developed and evaluated a strand invasion based amplification (SIBA) assay to rapidly and specifically detect GAS. The performance of the developed GAS SIBA assay was compared with an established GAS polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: The GAS SIBA assay detected small amounts (ten copies) of S. pyogenes DNA within 13 min. The rapid detection time was achieved in part by optimization of magnesium concentration and reaction temperature. The sensitivity and specificity of the GAS SIBA assay for detection of S. pyogenes from clinical specimens were both 100%, and clinical specimens were detected within ~ 8 min of starting the reaction. CONCLUSION: Because the GAS SIBA assay is performed at low and constant temperature, it can be used both in centralized laboratories and for point-of-care testing. Furthermore, given its short detection time and strong analytical performance, the GAS SIBA assay could help to improve patient care and minimize unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.","Elf, Sonja; Olli, Jenni; Hirvonen, Sanna; Auvinen, Pauliina; Eboigbodin, Kevin E.",Mol Diagn Ther,35,19

The microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved with autophagy in many diseases. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the relationship between the miRNA expression and the autophagic activity of the AT-II cells in the pathogenesis of ALI and its molecular mechanism. A mouse model of ALI and AT-II cell injury was induced using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo and in vitro, and the expression of miR-34a and the autophagy-related proteins LC3 II/I and p62 were determined. Moreover, the autophagic activity was investigated after miR-34a overexpression and inhibition. The effects of miR-34a on its target gene, FoxO3, in regulating autophagic activity in AT-II cells were also determined. LPS induced autophagic activity and increased the expression of miR-34a in lung tissues and in AT-II cells. The in vitro results showed that the upregulation of miR-34a suppressed, whereas the inhibition of miR-34a promoted, autophagy in AT-II cells. Moreover, miR-34a could directly bind to the 3′-untranslated region of the autophagy-related gene, FoxO3, to decrease its expression. In addition, the knockdown of FoxO3 expression inhibited the autophagic activity in AT-II cells. Together, this study suggested that miR-34a might suppress the excessive autophagic activity in AT-II cells via targeting FoxO3 to reduce the damage of LPS-induced ALI.","Song, Lan; Zhou, Fangliang; Cheng, Lijuan; Hu, Mei; He, Yingchun; Zhang, Bo; Liao, Duanfang; Xu, Zhaojun",Inflammation,35,1

An observational cohort study of HIV-negative adults with PJP documented by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) through Gomori–Grocott staining or immunofluorescence, admitted to one intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure, was undertaken. From 1990 to 2010, 70 patients (24 females, 46 males) were included, with a mean age of 58.6 ± 18.3 years. The mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)-II was 36.9 ± 20.4. Underlying conditions included hematologic malignancies (n = 21), vasculitis (n = 13), and solid tumors (n = 13). Most patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids (n = 63) and cytotoxic drugs (n = 51). Not a single patient received trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole as PJP prophylaxis. Endotracheal intubation (ETI) was required in 42 patients (60.0 %), including 38 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In-ICU mortality was 52.9 % overall, reaching 80.9 % and 86.8 %, respectively, for patients who required ETI and for patients with ARDS. In the univariate analysis, in-ICU mortality was associated with SAPS-II (p = 0.0131), ARDS (p < 0.0001), shock (p < 0.0001), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) on BAL (p = 0.0031). In the multivariate analysis, only ARDS was associated with in-ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] 23.4 [4.5–121.9], p < 0.0001). PJP in non-HIV patients remains a serious disease with high in-hospital mortality. Pulmonary co-infection with HSV or CMV may contribute to fatal outcome.","Fillatre, P.; Chevrier, S.; Revest, M.; Gacouin, A.; Jouneau, S.; Leroy, H.; Robert-Gangneux, F.; Minjolle, S.; Le Tulzo, Y.; Tattevin, P.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,35,1

However, the expression and regulatory mechanisms of serum CEACAM1 in gastrointestinal cancer are still unclear. The expression ratio of the CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-S isoforms has seldom been investigated in gastrointestinal cancer. In this study, we intended to explore the expression and diagnostic value of CEACAM1 in gastrointestinal cancer. Serum CEACAM1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The protein expression and distribution of CEACAM1 in tumors were examined by immunohistochemical staining. The expression patterns and ratio of CEACAM1-L/S were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that serum CEACAM1 levels were significantly higher in cancer patients than in healthy controls. CEACAM1 was found in secreted forms within the neoplastic glands, and its expression was more intense at the tumor invasion front. The CEACAM1-L/S (L:S) ratios were up-regulated during tumorigenesis. Our data suggest that the serum level of CEACAM1 may be used to discriminate gastrointestinal cancer patients from health controls.","Zhou, Muqing; Jin, Zhiming; Liu, Yiwen; He, Yiqing; Du, Yan; Yang, Cuixia; Wang, Yingzhi; Hu, Jiajie; Cui, Lian; Gao, Feng; Cao, Manlin",Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),35,1

Overactivity of RAAS promotes both systemic and regional glomerular capillary hypertension, which could induce hemodynamic injury to the glomerulus, leading to kidney damage and renal fibrosis via profibrotic and proinflammatory pathway. Therefore, the use of RAAS inhibitors (i.e., ACEIs, ARBs, and MRAs) as the optional therapy has been demonstrated to prevent proteinuria, and kidney fibrosis and slow the decline of renal function effectively in the process of kidney disease during the last few decades. Recently, several new components of the RAAS have been discovered, including ACE2 and the corresponding ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis, which are also present in the kidney. Besides the classic RAAS inhibitors target the angiotensin-AT1-aldosterone axis, with the expanding knowledge about RAAS, a number of potential therapeutic targets in this system is emerging. Newer agents that are more specific are being developed.

Miniature stearate probes detected DA and 5-HT release, on line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Psychostimulant behaviors, in the form of four behavioral components (i.e., the classically DA-dependent behaviors of locomotor activity [ambulations], rearing, and stereotypy, and a 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations) were studied concurrently with infrared photobeam detection. The results show that (IP) cocaine significantly increased vlNAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and 5-HT release (p < 0.0012). Each of the four parameters of cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior was concurrently and significantly increased as well (ambulations: p < 0.0001; rearing: p < 0.0008; stereotypy: p < 0.0004; central ambulations: p < 0.0082). Moreover, exactly coincident data points for DA and 5-HT release occurred 10 and 40 min after (IP) cocaine administration. Cocaine-induced DA and 5-HT release were highly and positively correlated during the first hour of study (p < 0.01). As expected, increased DA release in vlNAcc after cocaine administration was significantly and positively correlated with classically DA-dependent behaviors (first- and second-hour effects) (p < 0.01) and with the 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations (p < 0.01). Also, cocaine-induced 5-HT release was significantly and positively correlated with 5-HT behavior (p < 0.01). However, not as expected, classically DA-dependent behaviors were more positively correlated with cocaine-induced 5-HT release in vlNAcc throughout the two-hour period of study. Thus, the present findings show that 5-HT is a comediator with DA in the cocaine response in vlNAcc.

In particular, areas of Jeju Island with extensive swine production have faced repeated epidemics since the re‐emergence in 2014. The current study reports the complete genome sequences and molecular characterization of the representative PEDV strains responsible for the 2018 endemic outbreaks on Jeju Island. All isolates were determined to belong genetically to the highly pathogenic pandemic G2b group. Full‐length genome sizes of four isolates differed from that of the G2b epidemic field strain due to insertion or deletion (DEL) mutations in the non‐structural protein (nsp)‐ or spike (S) protein‐coding regions. The 2018 Jeju isolates shared 96.7%–98.7% and 98.5%–99.4% identity at the S gene and whole‐genome levels, respectively, compared to global G2b PEDV strains. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the 2018 isolates were closest to the 2014 G2b re‐emergent Jeju strains, but appeared to have undergone substantial rapid independent evolution. Among the isolates, a notable nsp3 DEL variant strain, KOR/KNU‐1807/2018, was isolated and propagated by continuous passages in Vero cells, and displayed typical PEDV‐induced syncytia formation. Genomic sequencing identified a unique 8‐nt DEL in the extreme C‐terminal region of the S gene at the 4th passage (KNU‐1807‐P4) compared to its original sample. This DEL resulted in the premature termination of S by nine amino acid residues (EVFEKVHVQ), which contained a KxHxx motif that is a potential endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal. In vivo animal studies showed that variant strain KNU‐1807 had decreased virulence in suckling piglets.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of hospitalized adults and adolescents with influenza-related pneumonia (Flu-p) from type A and type B strains in China. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from Flu-p patients in five hospitals in China from January 2013 to May 2019. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were used to assess the effects of influenza virus subtypes on clinical outcomes, and to explore the risk factors of 30-day mortality for Flu-p patients. RESULTS: In total, 963 laboratory-confirmed influenza A-related pneumonia (FluA-p) and 386 influenza B-related pneumonia (FluB-p) patients were included. Upon adjustment for confounders, multivariate logistic regression models showed that FluA-p was associated with an increased risk of invasive ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.824, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.279–6.414; P < 0.001), admittance to intensive care unit (aOR: 1.630, 95% CI: 1.074–2.473, P = 0.022) and 30-day mortality (aOR: 2.427, 95% CI: 1.568–3.756, P < 0.001) compared to FluB-p. Multivariate Cox regression models confirmed that influenza A virus infection (hazard ratio: 2.637, 95% CI: 1.134–6.131, P = 0.024) was an independent predictor for 30-day mortality in Flu-p patients. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of illness and clinical outcomes of FluA-p patients are more severe than FluB-p. This highlights the importance of identifying the virus strain during the management of severe influenza.","Chen, Liang; Han, Xiu-Di; Li, Yan-Li; Zhang, Chun-Xiao; Xing, Xi-Qian",Infect Dis Poverty,35,1

Thirty‐four patients with root‐filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. In Group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in Group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. The gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. Bacterial DNA was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. The mean number (±SD) of species detected was 33.7±3.3 in Group 1 and 21.3±6.3 in Group 2 (P<0.001). The majority of the probe‐detected bacteria were present in more lesions from Group1 than from Group 2. The differences were most notable for Campylobacter gracilis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus constellatus and Actinomyces naeslundii I. Bacterial species such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. Also, P. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. The data supported the idea that following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon‐released bacteremia. The study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. The detection of much more bacteria with the “checkerboard” DNA‐DNA hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.","Sunde, P.

Wetlands are ecologically and economically important ecosystems but are threatened globally by many forms of human disturbance. Understanding the responses of wetland species to human disturbance is essential for effective wetland management and conservation. 2. We undertook a study to determine (i) whether anurans can be used effectively to assess the ecological integrity of wetlands affected by groundwater withdrawal and, if so, (ii) what effect increasing urbanization might have on the utility of anurans as wetland indicators. We monitored the intensity of anuran calls at 42 wetlands in south‐western Florida throughout 2001–2002 and 2005–2009. 3. We first validated the use of anurans to assess wetland integrity using a small group of wetlands by comparing anuran calling and subsequent tadpole development with an established index employing vegetation composition and structure. We then verified that the results could be expanded to a variety of sites throughout the region. Finally, we focused on urbanized wetlands to determine whether urbanization could interfere with the use of anurans to assess wetland integrity. 4. We used PRESENCE to estimate occupancy and detection probabilities and to examine the relationship between occupancy and five covariates expected to influence individual species occurrence. We used FRAGSTATS to calculate the mean proximity index for urbanized wetlands, which assesses the size and distribution of land use types within a specified area. 5. Our results showed that the group of species including oak toad Anaxyrus quercicus, southern cricket frog Acris gryllus, pinewoods treefrog Hyla femoralis, barking treefrog Hyla gratiosa, and little grass frog Pseudacris ocularis is a reliable indicator of wetland integrity. However, this same group of species, which is sensitive to wetland health, is selectively excluded from urbanized wetlands. 6. Synthesis and applications. Although anurans are effective indicators of wetland health and complement vegetation surveys, the usefulness of this group for monitoring the ecological integrity of wetlands can be substantially reduced, or eliminated, as a consequence of urbanization. We urge for careful consideration of confounding factors in any studies examining the utility of indicator species.","Guzy, Jacquelyn C.; McCoy, Earl D.; Deyle, Anna C.; Gonzalez, Shannon M.; Halstead, Neal; Mushinsky, Henry R.",J Appl Ecol,35,1

Moreover, the opioid crisis has manifested despite clinical access to three approved opioid use disorder medications: the full opioid agonist methadone, the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine, and the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Although current opioid use disorder medications are underutilized, the ongoing opioid crisis has also identified the need for basic research to develop both safer and more effective opioid use disorder medications. Emerging preclinical evidence suggests that opioid-targeted vaccines or immunopharmacotherapies may be promising opioid use disorder therapeutics. One premise for this article is to critically examine whether vaccine effectiveness evaluated using preclinical antinociceptive endpoints is predictive of vaccine effectiveness on abuse-related endpoints such as drug self-administration, drug discrimination, and conditioned place preference. A second premise is to apply decades of knowledge in the preclinical evaluation of candidate small-molecule therapeutics for opioid use disorder to the preclinical evaluation of candidate opioid use disorder immunopharmacotherapies. We conclude with preclinical experimental design attributes to enhance preclinical-to-clinical translatability and potential future directions for immunopharmacotherapies to address the dynamic illicit opioid environment.","Townsend, E.

RECENT FINDINGS: Influenza vaccination in HCP provides benefits to both HCP and patients, including reductions in patient morbidity and mortality and decreases in HCP absenteeism. Despite these benefits, influenza vaccine coverage among HCP still falls short of the Healthy People 2020 goal of 90%. As a result, healthcare institutions have used various practices to boost vaccination, including mandatory vaccine policies and requiring non-immunized HCP to wear masks during the influenza season. All of these efforts have been successful at increasing vaccination rates, and employer vaccination requirements have led to rates that meet the Healthy People 2020 goal. Rates of mandatory vaccine policies have increased over time, and several states now have influenza vaccine requirements. However, additional study into how these policies improve patient outcomes is needed. SUMMARY: Continued effort is needed to boost influenza vaccination rates among HCP, and mandatory vaccine policies may be used if other methods have not been effective in adequately raising vaccination rates. Future research should focus on how mandatory vaccine policies can improve patient outcomes.","Gallagher, Megan C.; Haessler, Sarah; Babcock, Hilary M.",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,35,4

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study, data from patients after RTA by the TraumaRegister DGU® from 1993 to 2014 were evaluated for demographical and injury characteristics. The predictor variable was mechanism of injury and the outcome variables were type of injury, severity and hospital resources utilization. RESULTS: During the investigation period, n = 62,196 patients were enclosed with a prevalence of maxillofacial injuries of 20.3% (MFT positive). The injury severity score of MFT-positive patients was higher than in the MTF-negative subgroup (27 ± 12.8 vs. 23.0 ± 12.7). If MFT positive, 39.8% show minor, 37.1% moderate, 21.5% serious and 1.6% severe maxillofacial injuries. Injuries of the midface occurred in 60.3% of MTF-positive patients. A relevant blood loss (> 20% of total blood volume) occurred in 1.9%. MFT-positive patients had a higher coincidence with cervical spine fractures (11.3% vs. 7.8%) and traumatic brain injuries (62.6% vs. 34.8%) than MFT-negative patients. There was a noticeable decrease in the incidence of facial injuries in car/truck drivers during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Every 5th patient after RTA shows a MFT and the whole trauma team must be aware that this indicates a high prevalence of traumatic brain and cervical spine injuries. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Even if sole injuries of the face are seldom life threatening, maxillofacial expertise in interdisciplinary trauma centres is strongly recommended.","Pietzka, Sebastian; Kämmerer, Peer W.; Pietzka, Silke; Schramm, Alexander; Lampl, Lorenz; Lefering, Rolf; Bieler, Dan; Kulla, Martin",Clin Oral Investig,35,11

An outbreak of dengue-like illness (DLI) that occurred in April 2016 prompted this study, which aimed to determine the population’s immunity status and identify the arboviruses circulating in the country. METHODS: A household survey, involving 188 participants in two urban areas (Honiara and Gizo), and a parallel hospital-based clinical survey were conducted in April 2016. The latter was repeated in December after a surge in DLI cases. Arbovirus IgG ELISA were performed on the household blood samples to determine the prevalence of arboviruses in the community, while qPCR testing of the clinical samples was used to identify the circulating arboviruses. Dengue virus (DENV)-positive samples were further characterized by amplifying and sequencing the envelope gene. RESULTS: The overall prevalence rates of DENV, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus were 83.4%, 7.6%, and 0.9%, respectively. The qPCR positivity rates of the clinical samples collected in April 2016 were as follows: DENV 39.6%, Zika virus 16.7%, and chikungunya virus 6.3%, which increased to 74%, 48%, and 20% respectively in December 2016. The displacement of the circulating serotype-3, genotype-1, with DENV serotype 2, genotype cosmopolitan was responsible for the outbreak in 2016. CONCLUSIONS: A DENV outbreak in Solomon Islands was caused by the introduction of a single serotype. The high prevalence of DENV provided transient cross-protection, which prevented the introduction of a new serotype from the hyperendemic region for at least 3 years. The severe outcomes seen in the recent outbreak probably resulted from changes in the causative viruses and the effects of population immunity and changes in the outbreak pattern. Solomon Islands needs to step up surveillance to include molecular tools, increase regional communication, and perform timely interventions.","Darcy, Andrew Waleluma; Kanda, Seiji; Dalipanda, Tenneth; Joshua, Cynthia; Shimono, Takaki; Lamaningao, Pheophet; Mishima, Nobuyuki; Nishiyama, Toshimasa",Trop Med Health,35,1

Current diagnostic methods have low sensitivities for detection of latent forms of MAP infection, defined by focal granulomatous lesions and scarce humoral response or MAP presence. In contrast, patent infections correspond to multifocal and diffuse types of enteritis where there is increased antibody production, and substantial mycobacterial load. Our previous RNA-Seq analysis allowed the selection of five candidate biomarkers overexpressed in peripheral blood of MAP infected Holstein cows with focal (ABCA13 and MMP8) and diffuse (FAM84A, SPARC and DES) lesions vs. control animals with no detectable PTB-associated lesions in intestine and regional lymph nodes. The aim of the current study was to assess the PTB diagnostic potential of commercial ELISAs designed for the specific detection of these biomarkers. The ability of these ELISAs to identify animals with latent and/or patent forms of MAP infection was investigated using serum from naturally infected cattle (n = 88) and non-infected control animals (n = 67). ROC analysis revealed that the ABCA13-based ELISA showed the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of infected animals with focal lesions (AUC 0.837, sensitivity 79.25% and specificity 88.06%) and with any type of histological lesion (AUC 0.793, sensitivity 69.41% and specificity 86.57%) improving on the diagnostic performance of the popular IDEXX ELISA and other conventional diagnostic methods. SPARC and MMP8 showed the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of animals with multifocal (AUC 0.852) and diffuse lesions (AUC 0.831), respectively. In conclusion, our results suggest that quantification of ABCA13, SPARC and MMP8 by ELISA has the potential for implementation as a diagnostic tool to reliably identify MAP infection, greatly improving early detection of MAP latent infections when antibody responses and fecal shedding are undetectable using conventional diagnostic methods.","Blanco Vázquez, Cristina; Alonso-Hearn, Marta; Juste, Ramón A.; Canive, María; Iglesias, Tania; Iglesias, Natalia; Amado, Javier; Vicente, Fernando; Balseiro, Ana; Casais, Rosa",PLoS One,35,1

Although many fungal adhesion proteins have been identified, less is known about the temporal development of cell adhesion and biofilm growth in a flow environment. In this study, we use a flow system with real-time imaging of C. albicans cells as they adhere and grow. Rates of cell attachment and dispersion of C. albicans knockout strains of putative adhesins, transcription factors, and deletions with a hyperfilamentous phenotype were quantified during 18 h of biofilm development. Cell adhesion under flow is a multi-phase process initiated with cell rolling, then an initial firm attachment to the substrate occurs. After attachment, cells enter a growth phase where cells either commit to adherence or disperse. C. albicans Δeap1, Δhwp2, Δhyr1, and Δihd1 cells had significantly reduced initial attachment and subsequent adhesion, while Δals1/Δals3 had no change in initial attachment but reduced adhesion maintenance. WT cells had increased adhesion during the late growth phase when hyphae were more highly expressed. Hyperfilamentous strains had 10-fold higher total biofilm growth, a result of significantly reduced detachment rates, showing that hyphal morphogenesis is important for adhesion maintenance in the developing biofilm. The rate of C. albicans biomass dispersion was most important for determining the density of the mature biomass. Adhesion maintenance was mediated in part by Ywp1, a protein previously thought to regulate dispersion, thus it functions as an adhesion maintenance protein in C. albicans.","McCall, Andrew D.; Pathirana, Ruvini U.; Prabhakar, Aditi; Cullen, Paul J.; Edgerton, Mira",NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes,35,13

Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) is an essential protein recruited after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin (IL)-1β stimulation, a process that converges in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation, as well as a transcription of several genes of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The inhibition of MyD88 has shown efficacy by decrease inflammatory response, and has demonstrated potential application as a therapeutic target in chronic diseases. In this study, we investigate the effect of MyD88 dimerisation inhibitor ST2825 on cytokine production from rhIL-1β and LPS-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy blood donors (HBD). ST2825 significantly downregulates the production of IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-12, IL-2, IL-15, IL-7, VEGF, IL-1Ra, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-9 (p < 0.05) in LPS-stimulated PBMC. Moreover, ST2825 had a relatively low impact on IL-1β signalling pathway inhibition, showing that only a few specific cytokines, such as IFN-γ and IL-1Ra, are inhibited in rhIL-1β-stimulated PBMC (p < 0.01). In conclusion, MyD88 dimerisation inhibitor ST2825 showed high efficacy by inhibiting pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production in LPS-stimulated PBMC. Moreover, although rhIL-1β induced a sustained cytokine production (p < 0.05), ST2825 did not show a significant effect in the secretion of neither pro- nor anti-inflammatory cytokines in rhIL-1β-stimulated PBMC.","Ramírez-Pérez, Sergio; Hernández-Palma, Luis Alexis; Oregon-Romero, Edith; Anaya-Macías, Brian Uriel; García-Arellano, Samuel; González-Estevez, Guillermo; Muñoz-Valle, José Francisco",Molecules,35,1

In this study we investigated what role RIP1 plays in human ovarian cancer cells. We showed that knockout (KO) of RIP1 substantially suppressed cell proliferation, accompanied by the G2/M checkpoint arrest in two human ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and A2780. On the other hand, RIP1 KO remarkably attenuated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, which was associated with reduction of the apoptosis markers PARP cleavage and the necroptosis marker phospho-MLKL. We found that RIP1 KO suppressed cisplatin-induced ROS accumulation in both SKOV3 and A2780 cells. ROS scavenger BHA, apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD or necroptosis inhibitor NSA could effectively suppress cisplatin’s cytotoxicity in the control cells, suggesting that ROS-mediated apoptosis and necroptosis were involved in cisplatin-induced cell death. In addition, blocking necroptosis with MLKL siRNA effectively attenuated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. In human ovarian cancer A2780 cell line xenograft nude mice, RIP1 KO not only significantly suppressed the tumor growth but also greatly attenuated cisplatin’s anticancer activity. Our results demonstrate a dual role of RIP1 in human ovarian cancer: it acts as either a tumor-promoting factor to promote cancer cell proliferation or a tumor-suppressing factor to facilitate anticancer effects of chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin.","Zheng, Xue-lian; Yang, Jiao-jiao; Wang, Yan-yun; Li, Qin; Song, Ya-ping; Su, Min; Li, Jin-ke; Zhang, Lin; Li, Zhi-ping; Zhou, Bin; Lin, Yong",Acta Pharmacol Sin,35,1

Mutations in genes encoding components of the Z-disk or Z-disk-associated proteins occur in some patients whereas in most of the cases, the causative gene defect is still unknown. We aimed to search for pathogenic mutations in genes not previously associated with MFM phenotype. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing in four patients from three unrelated families who were diagnosed with PAM without aberrations in causative genes for MFM. RESULTS: In the first patient and her affected daughter, we identified a heterozygous p.(Arg89Cys) missense mutation in LMNA gene which has not been linked with PAM pathology before. In the second patient, a heterozygous p.(Asn4807Phe) mutation in RYR1 not previously described in PAM represents a novel, candidate gene with a possible causative role in the disease. Finally, in the third patient and his symptomatic daughter, we found a previously reported heterozygous p.(Cys30071Arg) mutation in TTN gene that was clinically associated with cardiac involvement.

Although intravenous iron is now considered standard treatment for IBD patients in Europe, oral iron still appears to be the preferred option. Advantages of oral iron include greater availability, lower costs and ease of applicability. However, its multitude of side effects, impact on the microbiome and further exacerbating IBD activity can have consequences on patient compliance. The newer oral iron formulations show promising safety and efficacy data with a good side effect profile. Intravenous iron formulations bypass the gastrointestinal tract absorption thereby leading to less side effects. Multiple studies have shown its superiority compared to oral formulations although its risk for hypersensitivity reactions continue to lead to clinician hesitancy in prescribing this formulation. This article provides an updated review on diagnosis and management of IDA in IBD patients, discussing the newer oral and intravenous formulations.","Kumar, Aditi; Brookes, Matthew J.",Nutrients,35,1

In this work the significance of calcination temperature on the thermal, electronic, structural and surface properties of a nano catalyst produced by sol–gel method using ultrasonic radiation against the disposal of toxic textile pollutants is studied in detail. The extract of tea leaves has been used as a bio-template during the synthesis to revise the crystallite size, surface area, optical absorption potential, and rate of agglomeration of nano sized grains by regulating their physico-chemical and surface properties. The influence of calcination in the transformation of single phased anatase titania to mixed phase anatase–rutile titania and the corresponding outcome in its photocatalytic activity employed in water treatment applications have been verified. The nano catalyst obtained is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transition electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunaueur Emmett Teller (BET) analysis, UV–Vis diffused reflectance spectroscopy (DRS-UV–Vis) etc. The mesoporosity of the particle was examined using Barrett Joyner Halenda (BJH) model. The enhanced photo catalytic efficiency (about 97.7%) of templated nano titania due to calcination is verified against Congo red, a textile dye under optimized conditions. The nano catalyst produced can be easily separated, recycled to support its economic feasibility.","Saikumari, N.; Dev, S. Monish; Dev, S. Avinaash",Sci Rep,35,1

This label-free biosensor employs low-cost components and simple fabrication processes to lower the overall cost while achieving high sensitivity using a differential detection method. To experimentally demonstrate its limit of detection (LOD), we conducted biosensing experiments with streptavidin and C-reactive protein (CRP). The optical cavity structure was optimized further for better sensitivity and easier fluid control. We utilized the polymer swelling property to fine-tune the optical cavity width, which significantly improved the success rate to produce measurable samples. Four different concentrations of streptavidin were tested in triplicate, and the LOD of the OCB was determined to be 1.35 nM. The OCB also successfully detected three different concentrations of human CRP using biotinylated CRP antibody. The LOD for CRP detection was 377 pM. All measurements were done using a small sample volume of 15 µL within 30 min. By reducing the sensing area, improving the functionalization and passivation processes, and increasing the sample volume, the LOD of the OCB are estimated to be reduced further to the femto-molar range. Overall, the demonstrated capability of the OCB in the present work shows great potential to be used as a promising POC biosensor.","Rho, Donggee; Kim, Seunghyun",Biosensors (Basel),35,1

This difference in the QT interval between men and women has led to the understanding of the influence of sex hormones on the role of gender-specific channelopathies and development of ventricular arrhythmias. The QT interval, which represents the duration of ventricular repolarization of the heart, can be affected by androgen levels, resulting in a sex-specific predilection for acquired and inherited channelopathies such as acquired long QT syndrome in women and Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome in men. Manipulation of the homeostasis of these sex hormones as either hormonal therapy for certain cancers, recreational therapy or family planning and in transgender treatment has also been shown to affect QT interval duration and increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias. In this review, we highlight the effects of endogenous and exogenous sex hormones in the physiological and pathological states on QTc variation and predisposition to gender-specific pro-arrhythmias.","Grouthier, Virginie; Moey, Melissa Y.

The specificity of such antibody responses was compared among a cohort of toddlers to identify differences between seropositive versus seronegative responses. METHODS: An assessment of the serum IgM and IgG antibody reactivities in 197 toddlers of 1- and 2-years of age was performed with a microfluidic array containing 110 distinct antigens. Longitudinal profiling was done from years 1 to 2. Seropositivity to RNA and DNA viruses; bacteria; live attenuated, inactive, and subunit vaccines; and autoantigens was compared. A stratification was developed based on quantitative variations in the IgG responses. Clinical presentations and previously known genetic risk alleles for various immune system conditions were investigated in relation to IgG responses. RESULTS: IgG reactivities stratified toddlers into low, moderate, and high responder groups. The high group (17%) had elevated IgG responses to multiple RNA and DNA viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, Coxsackievirus) and this correlated with increased responses to live attenuated viral vaccines and certain autoantigens. This high group was more likely to be associated with gestational diabetes and an older age. Genetic analyses identified polymorphisms in the IL2RB, TNFSF4, and INS genes in two high responder individuals that were associated with their elevated cytokine levels and clinical history of eczema and asthma. CONCLUSION: Serum IgG profiling of toddlers reveals correlations between the magnitude of the antibody responses towards viruses, live attenuated vaccines, and certain autoantigens. A low responder group had much weaker responses overall, including against vaccines. The serum antibody screen also identifies individuals with IgG responses to less common infections (West Nile virus, parvovirus, tuberculosis). The characterization of the antibody responses in combination with the identification of genetic risk alleles provides an opportunity to identify children with increased risk of clinical disease.

Raters (n = 5/group) scored 100 images using the FGS (ear position, orbital tightening, muzzle tension, whiskers position and head position). Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess inter- and intra-rater reliability. Agreement between each group and the veterinarian group (gold-standard) was calculated using the Bland–Altman method. Effects of gender, age and number of cats owned on FGS scores were assessed using linear mixed models. Inter-rater reliability was good for FGS final scores (ICC > 0.8). The muzzle and whiskers yielded lower reliability (ICC = 0.39 to 0.74). Intra-rater reliability was excellent for students and veterinarians (ICC = 0.91), and good for owners and nurses (ICC = 0.87 and 0.81, respectively). A very good agreement between all groups and veterinarians (bias < 0.1 and narrow limits of agreement) was observed. Female raters assigned higher FGS scores than males (p = 0.006); however, male raters were underrepresented in this study. Scores were not affected by age or number of cats owned.

METHODS: The present investigation was conducted between April 2019 and July 2019. Participants were healthy adults recruited from the central blood bank Al Madinah Al Munawarah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels against influenza A and B were measured in serum samples using ELISA. RESULTS: The results showed that 29.2% of the sample had significant concentrations of influenza A IgG antibody, whereas 38.6% had significant concentrations of influenza B IgG antibody. A strong correlation was found between the levels of influenza A and influenza B antibodies (r=0.708, p<0.001).

We investigated the genetic cause of RPA in a family consisting of two affected Egyptian brothers with healthy consanguineous parents. Methods: Mutational analysis of four RPA causative genes was realized by Sanger sequencing on both probands, and detected variants were subsequently genotyped in their parents. Afterwards, found variants were deeply, statistically, and in silico characterized to determine their possible effects and association with RPA. Results: Both brothers carry three missense PRPH2 variants in a homozygous condition (c.910C > A, c.929G > A, and c.1013A > C) and two promoter variants in RHO (c.-26A > G) and RLBP1 (c.-70G > A) genes, respectively. Haplotype analyses highlighted a PRPH2 rare haplotype variant (GAG), determining a possible alteration of PRPH2 binding with melanoregulin and other outer segment proteins, followed by photoreceptor outer segment instability. Furthermore, an altered balance of transcription factor binding sites, due to the presence of RHO and RLBP1 promoter variants, might determine a comprehensive downregulation of both genes, possibly altering the PRPH2 shared visual-related pathway.

Allied health professionals (AHPs) are defined as individuals who work collaboratively to deliver routine and essential healthcare services, excluding physicians and nurses. There is a lack of studies on burnout among AHPs in Singapore. This study explored factors associated with a self-reported burnout level and barriers to seeking psychological help among AHPs in Singapore. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a sample of AHPs in a tertiary hospital from October to December 2019. We emailed a four-component survey to 1127 eligible participants. The survey comprised four components: (1) sociodemographic characteristics, (2) Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS), (3) Areas of Worklife Survey, and (4) Perceived Barriers to Psychological Treatment (PBPT). We performed a multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with burnout. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. RESULTS: In total, 328 participants completed the questionnaire. The self-reported burnout level (emotional exhaustion>27 and/or depersonalization>10) was 67.4%. The majority of the respondents were female (83.9%), Singaporean (73.5%), aged 40 years and below (84.2%), and Chinese ethnicity (79.9%). In the multiple logistic regression model, high burnout level was negatively associated with being in the age groups of 31 to 40 (AOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16–0.93) and 40 years and older (AOR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10–0.87) and a low self-reported workload (AOR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23–0.52). High burnout level was positively associated with a work experience of three to five years (AOR 5.27, 95% CI 1.44–20.93) and more than five years (AOR 4.24; 95% CI 1.16–16.79. One hundred and ninety participants completed the PBPT component. The most frequently cited barriers to seeking psychological help by participants with burnout (n = 130) were ‘negative evaluation of therapy’ and ‘time constraints.’ CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high self-reported burnout level and identifies its associated factors among AHPs in a tertiary hospital. The findings revealed the urgency of addressing burnout in AHPs and the need for effective interventions to reduce burnout. Concurrently, proper consideration of the barriers to seeking help is warranted to improve AHPs' mental well-being.","Teo, Yao Hao; Xu, Jordan Thet Ke; Ho, Cowan; Leong, Jui Min; Tan, Benjamin Kye Jyn; Tan, Elisabeth Ker Hsuen; Goh, Wei-An; Neo, Elson; Chua, Jonathan Yu Jing; Ng, Sean Jun Yi; Cheong, Julia Jie Yi; Hwang, Jeff Yi-Fu; Lim, See Ming; Soo, Thomas; Sng, Judy Gek Khim; Yi, Siyan",PLoS One,35,11

Beyond the social determinants of health that shape inequities across all of our systems, the cancer care system involves a pattern of prioritizing biomedicine, evidence-based options, and care standardization. We learned that these lead to system rigidities that not only compromise the individualization essential to person-centered care but also obscure the attention to group differences that becomes indispensable to responsiveness to inequities. On the basis of these insights, we reflect on what may be required to begin to redress the current and projected inequities with respect to access to appropriate cancer survivorship supports and services.","Truant, Tracy L.O.; Lambert, Leah K.; Thorne, Sally",Glob Qual Nurs Res,35,11

Studies have shown high mortality in Tanzanian children with ESBL-E infections. Gut colonization of ESBL-E, which is a potential risk factor of ESBL-E infections, is reported to be very high among children in Tanzania. Probiotics may potentially reduce gut colonization of multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, there is limited data on whether probiotics may reduce ESBL-E carriage in infants. The ProRIDE Trial aims to evaluate whether the use of probiotics can reduce morbidity and mortality among infants in Haydom, Tanzania, and whether this effect is associated with a reduction in ESBL-E colonization and/or infections. METHODS/DESIGN: This large randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial aims to recruit 2000 newborn infants at Haydom Lutheran Hospital and the surrounding area in the period of November 2020 to November 2021. Participants will be enrolled from days 0 to 3 after birth and randomized to receive probiotics or placebo for 4 weeks. Participants will be followed-up for 6 months, during which three visits will be made to collect clinical and demographic information, as well as rectal swabs and fecal samples which will be subjected to laboratory analysis. The primary composite outcome is the prevalence of death and/or hospitalization at 6 months of age. DISCUSSION: As the use of probiotics may give a more favorable gut composition, and thereby improve health and reduce morbidity and mortality, the results may have implications for future therapy guidelines in Africa and internationally.

From this altered position, my body and lifeworld were a nexus point for a range of ongoing challenges around staying as well as possible, and the struggle to get my healthcare needs met. There is a gap between the support provided for some ill and disabled people, and the help that they actually require. This is particularly so for conditions that are not well understood, that have a low public profile, limited funding, and/or are in some way stigmatised due to perceived differences to social norms. Hepatitis C is one such condition, it is a viral disease that is transmitted through blood-to-blood contact and it causes ongoing damage to the liver. Because of the systemic nature of the disease, individuals may struggle to cope with the demands of work and daily living, and their lifeworld and opportunities are frequently limited. It can be challenging for the patient to advocate for themselves due to low energy levels, self-blame for getting ill, and the stigma associated with the condition.

We show that, although dispensable for adult homeostasis, Fgfr2 restricts AT2 cell fate during postnatal lung development. Using an unbiased computational imaging approach, we demonstrate that Fgfr2 promotes AT2 cell proliferation and restrains differentiation in actively regenerating areas after injury. Organoid assays reveal that Fgfr2-deficient AT2 cells remain competent to respond to multiple parallel proliferative inputs. Moreover, genetic blockade of AT2 cell cytokinesis demonstrates that cell division and differentiation are uncoupled during alveolar regeneration.

Tools that automate some parts of the process of phylogenetic reconstruction, mainly molecular character matrix assembly, have been developed for the advantage of both specialists in the field of phylogenetics and non-specialists. However, interpretation of results, comparison with previously available phylogenetic hypotheses, and selection of one phylogeny for downstream analyses and discussion still impose difficulties to one that is not a specialist either on phylogenetic methods or on a particular group of study. RESULTS: Physcraper is a command-line Python program that automates the update of published phylogenies by adding public DNA sequences to underlying alignments of previously published phylogenies. It also provides a framework for straightforward comparison of published phylogenies with their updated versions, by leveraging upon tools from the Open Tree of Life project to link taxonomic information across databases. The program can be used by the nonspecialist, as a tool to generate phylogenetic hypotheses based on publicly available expert phylogenetic knowledge. Phylogeneticists and taxonomic group specialists will find it useful as a tool to facilitate molecular dataset gathering and comparison of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses (topologies).

As lung inflammation plays an important role in pathogenesis, antileukotrienes have been explored in both clinical and animal studies. We aimed to assess the benefits and harms of antileukotrienes for the prevention and treatment of respiratory morbidity and mortality in very preterm newborns. METHODS: In this systematic review, we included randomized trials and non-randomized studies in humans and animals reporting the effects of antileukotrienes in very preterm infants or other mammals within 10 days of birth. Our pre-specified primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and any harm, and, for the clinical studies, incidence of chronic lung disease. Included studies underwent risk of bias-assessment and data extraction performed by two authors independently. There were no language restrictions. RESULTS: Fifteen studies totally met our inclusion criteria: one randomized trial and four non-randomized studies in humans and 10 animal studies (five in rodents, two in lambs and one in either guinea pigs, rabbits or caprinae). All five clinical studies used montelukast and had a small sample size, ranging from 4 to 77 infants. The randomized trial (n = 60) found no difference in the incidence of chronic lung disease between the groups. Only one clinical study, which enrolled four very preterm infants and had a critical overall risk of bias, reported long-term outcomes. All other studies had unclear or greater overall risk of bias and meta-analyses were therefore deemed unfeasible. Eight of ten animal studies used leukotriene receptor antagonists as antileukotriene (montelukast in three of ten studies) and seven had an experimental study design (i.e. some animals were not exposed to antileukotrienes but no randomization). Three of the ten animal studies assessed different doses. Animal studies found no effect on the outcomes mortality, growth, or lung function related surrogate outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Use of antileukotrienes in very preterm infants to prevent or treat chronic lung disease is not supported by the available evidence. Large randomized trials focusing on outcomes relevant to patients, including long-term outcomes, are needed. Studies should also minimize risk of bias.","Jukema, Marlide; Borys, Franciszek; Sibrecht, Greta; Jørgensen, Karsten Juhl; Bruschettini, Matteo",Respir Res,35,7

Probiotics have shown beneficial effects on fish growth, nutrient metabolism, immune responses, disease prevention and control, and gut microbiota with higher water quality. However, the identification and characterization of the molecules and mechanisms associated with probiotics is a challenge that requires investigation. To address this challenge, herein we used the zebrafish model for the study of the efficacy and mechanisms of probiotic interventions against tuberculosis. First, bacteria from fish gut microbiota were identified with high content of the surface glycotope Galα1-3Galβ1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (α-Gal) that has been shown to induce protective immune responses. The results showed that probiotics of selected bacteria with high α-Gal content, namely Aeromonas veronii and Pseudomonas entomophila, were biosafe and effective for the control of Mycobacterium marinum. Protective mechanisms regulating immunity and metabolism activated in response to α-Gal and probiotics with high α-Gal content included modification of gut microbiota composition, B-cell maturation, anti-α-Gal antibodies-mediated control of mycobacteria, induced innate immune responses, beneficial effects on nutrient metabolism and reduced oxidative stress. These results support the potential of probiotics with high α-Gal content for the control of fish mycobacteriosis and suggested the possibility of exploring the development of combined probiotic treatments alone and in combination with α-Gal for the control of infectious diseases.","Pacheco, Iván; Díaz-Sánchez, Sandra; Contreras, Marinela; Villar, Margarita; Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro; Gortázar, Christian; de la Fuente, José",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),35,1

We included interventions to improve well-being across 5 wellness domains (i.e., social, mental, physical, intellectual, occupational) for medical learners in Canada, grouped as undergraduate or graduate nonmedical (i.e., health sciences) students, undergraduate medical students or postgraduate medical students (i.e., residents). We categorized interventions as targeting the individual (learner), program (i.e., in which learners are enrolled) or system (i.e., higher education or health care) levels. RESULTS: Of 1753 studies identified, we included 65 interventions that aimed to improve well-being in 10 202 medical learners, published from 1972 through 2020; 52 (80%) were uncontrolled trials. The median year for intervention implementation was 2010 (range 1971–2018) and the median length was 3 months (range 1 h–48 mo). Most (n = 34, 52%) interventions were implemented with undergraduate medical students. Two interventions included only undergraduate, nonmedical students; none included graduate nonmedical students. Most studies (n = 51, 78%) targeted intellectual well-being, followed by occupational (n = 32, 49%) and social (n = 17, 26%) well-being. Among 19 interventions implemented for individuals, 14 (74%) were for medical students; of the 27 program-level interventions, 17 (63%) were for resident physicians. Most (n = 58, 89%) interventions reported positive well-being outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Many Canadian medical schools address intellectual, occupational and social well-being by targeting interventions at medical learners. Important emphasis on the mental and physical well-being of medical learners in Canada warrants further exploration.","Moss, Stephana J.; Wollny, Krista; Amarbayan, Mungunzul; Lorenzetti, Diane L.; Kassam, Aliya",CMAJ Open,35,17

The CuO/Mn(3)O(4)/ZnO nanohybrid has been characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy high resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. UV–visible spectrophotometry and photoluminescence techniques allowed evaluation of optical properties that additionally suggested the prevalence of strong interfacial interaction between the three moieties of the nanohybrid and suppressed electron–hole recombination. The hybrid photocatalyst brought on ~ 97.02 ± 1.15% disintegration of rabeprazole when illuminated with visible light. The progress of the photodegradation was in conformity with pseudo-first order kinetic model and had a velocity constant of 0.07773 min(−1). Additionally, ~ 84.45% of total organic carbon removal was achieved while chemical oxygen demand was reduced by ~ 73.01%. Using high resolution liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry technique, identification of the degraded products was made and accordingly the mechanistic route of the aforesaid degradation was proposed.","Raha, Sauvik; Mohanta, Dipyaman; Ahmaruzzaman, Md.",Sci Rep,35,1

The collected data are analyzed to generate moment-by-moment quantification of a person’s mental state and potentially predict future mental states. Digital phenotyping projects incorporate data from multiple sources, such as electronic health records, biometric scans, or genetic testing. As digital phenotyping tools can be used to study and predict behavior, they are of increasing interest for a range of consumer, government, and health care applications. In clinical care, digital phenotyping is expected to improve mental health diagnoses and treatment. At the same time, mental health applications of digital phenotyping present significant areas of ethical concern, particularly in terms of privacy and data protection, consent, bias, and accountability. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop consensus statements regarding key areas of ethical guidance for mental health applications of digital phenotyping in the United States. METHODS: We used a modified Delphi technique to identify the emerging ethical challenges posed by digital phenotyping for mental health applications and to formulate guidance for addressing these challenges. Experts in digital phenotyping, data science, mental health, law, and ethics participated as panelists in the study. The panel arrived at consensus recommendations through an iterative process involving interviews and surveys. The panelists focused primarily on clinical applications for digital phenotyping for mental health but also included recommendations regarding transparency and data protection to address potential areas of misuse of digital phenotyping data outside of the health care domain. RESULTS: The findings of this study showed strong agreement related to these ethical issues in the development of mental health applications of digital phenotyping: privacy, transparency, consent, accountability, and fairness. Consensus regarding the recommendation statements was strongest when the guidance was stated broadly enough to accommodate a range of potential applications. The privacy and data protection issues that the Delphi participants found particularly critical to address related to the perceived inadequacies of current regulations and frameworks for protecting sensitive personal information and the potential for sale and analysis of personal data outside of health systems. CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi study found agreement on a number of ethical issues to prioritize in the development of digital phenotyping for mental health applications. The Delphi consensus statements identified general recommendations and principles regarding the ethical application of digital phenotyping to mental health. As digital phenotyping for mental health is implemented in clinical care, there remains a need for empirical research and consultation with relevant stakeholders to further understand and address relevant ethical issues.","Martinez-Martin, Nicole; Greely, Henry T; Cho, Mildred K",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,35,1

First detected in Senegal in the nineteenth century, and despite its growing incidence this last decade, significant knowledge gaps exist in our knowledge of genetic diversity of circulating strains. This study highlights the circulating serotypes and genotypes between January 2017 and December 2018 and their spatial and temporal distribution throughout all regions of Senegal. METHODS: We used 56 dengue virus (DENV) strains for the analysis collected from 11 sampling areas: 39 from all regions of Senegal, and 17 isolates from Thiès, a particular area of the country. Two real time RT-qPCR systems were used to confirm dengue infection and corresponding serotypes. For molecular characterization, CprM gene was sequenced and submitted to phylogenetic analysis for serotypes and genotypes assignment. RESULTS: Three dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1–3) were detected by all used methods. DENV-3 was detected in 50% (28/56) of the isolates, followed by DENV-1 and DENV-2, each representing 25% (14/56) of the isolates. DENV-3 belongs to genotype III, DENV-1 to genotype V and DENV-2 to Cosmopolitan genotype. Serotype 3 was detected in 7 sampling locations and a co-circulation of different serotypes was observed in Thiès, Fatick and Richard-toll. CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the need of continuous DENV surveillance in Senegal to detect DENV cases, to define circulating serotypes/genotypes and to prevent the spread and the occurrence of severe cases.

As data about the in vitro killing activity of AMB against C. auris clades are lacking, we determined MICs, minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs), and killing activity of AMB against 22 isolates representing the 4 major C. auris clades (South Asian n = 6; East Asian n = 4; South African n = 6, and South American n = 6). MIC values were ≤1 mg/L regardless of clades; MFC ranges were, 1–4 mg/L, 2–4 mg/L, 2 mg/L, and 2–8 mg/L for South Asian, East Asian, South African, and South American clades, respectively. AMB showed concentration-, clade-, and isolate-dependent killing activity. AMB was fungicidal at 1 mg/L against two of six, two of four, three of six, and one of six isolates from the South Asian, East Asian, South African, and South American clades, respectively. Widefield fluorescence microscopy showed cell number decreases at 1 mg/L AMB in cases of the South Asian, East Asian, and South African clades. These data draw attention to the weak killing activity of AMB against C. auris regardless of clades, even when MICs are low (≤1 mg/L).

It was found that the (002) diffraction peak of the thin film increased monotonously with the increase in annealing temperature and annealing time. This phenomenon is ascribed to the evolution of defects in the lattice of the AlN film. Therefore, the relationship between defects and annealing can be expressed by the offset of (002) diffraction peak, which can be used for temperature measurement. Furthermore, a temperature interpretation algorithm Equation based on the lattice parameter (2θ), annealing temperature and annealing time was established, and a temperature interpretation software was built with MATLAB. Visual temperature interpretation is realized by the software, and the relative error is less than 7%. This study is of great significance for promoting the accurate temperature measurement on the surface of high temperature component.","Dong, Ling; Li, Yang; Lv, Jingwen; Jiang, Hongchuan; Zhang, Wanli",Sensors (Basel),35,1

The clinical data and vitamin D indices, including total, free, bioavailable 25-(OH)D, and vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) genotyping, were measured at baseline and six months after enrollment. An external dataset of 226 healthy controls was compared with the NTM-PD group. The mean age of subjects was 53 years; 54.5% were male. The NTM-PD group was older, predominantly female, and had a lower body mass index (BMI) than the controls. The proportion of patients with vitamin D concentration <50 nmol/L was 52.8% in the NTM-PD group and 54.9% in the control group (p = 0.789).

The paper uses data from the Growing Up in Ireland National survey dataset for nine year olds. It is the first study to empirically investigate the impact of child chronic illness/disability on earnings, standard of living and the extra cost of disability together. It is also the first study to explicitly address endogeneity in the standard of living model by using a two-stage process where residuals were harvested to provide efficient estimates. The findings show that families experience significant disadvantage and economic hardship due to reduced household income and a lower standard of living due to the extra cost of disability that would require considerable income to compensate. Policy implications of these findings suggest that a tiered approach to disability support payments which encompass broader criteria for inclusion based on varying severity levels be introduced to alleviate the financial hardship and compromised economic wellbeing of families affected. In addition, more innovative policies are required to implement appropriate timely access to health and social care services and flexi parental employment, which in turn requires the provision of adequate access to high quality educational and care facilities.

Here, we used a multi-omics approach (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics) to detect active DNA viruses and RNA viruses in a native prairie soil and to determine their responses to extremes in soil moisture. The majority of transcribed DNA viruses were bacteriophage, but some were assigned to eukaryotic hosts, mainly insects. We also demonstrated that higher soil moisture increased transcription of a subset of DNA viruses. Metaproteome data validated that the specific viral transcripts were translated into proteins, including chaperonins known to be essential for virion replication and assembly. The soil viral chaperonins were phylogenetically distinct from previously described marine viral chaperonins. The soil also had a high abundance of RNA viruses, with highest representation of Reoviridae. Leviviridae were the most diverse RNA viruses in the samples, with higher amounts in wet soil. This study demonstrates that extreme shifts in soil moisture have dramatic impacts on the composition, activity and potential functions of both DNA and RNA soil viruses.","Wu, Ruonan; Davison, Michelle R.; Gao, Yuqian; Nicora, Carrie D.; Mcdermott, Jason E.; Burnum-Johnson, Kristin E.; Hofmockel, Kirsten S.; Jansson, Janet K.",Commun Biol,35,1

The control programs are mainly based on the use of synthetic acaricides that are often administered indiscriminately. All this has led to drug resistance that now represent a great concern for honey bee farming. The research for alternative products/methods for mites’ control is now mandatory. The aim of this study was to test whether Citrus spp. essential oils could diminish the growth of the V. destructor mite. In Calabria (southern Italy), plants of the Citrus genus are very common and grow both spontaneously and cultured. The essential oils used in this study were extracted from bergamot (Citrus bergamia), grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), lemon (Citrus limon), orange (Citrus sinensis), and mandarin (Citrus reticulata) by hydrodistillation. Every EO was in vitro tested against V. destructor. Each experimental replicate was performed using 35 viable adult female mites (5 for each EO) collected the same day from the same apiary and included negative controls (5 individuals exposed to acetone only) and positive controls (5 individuals exposed to Amitraz diluted in acetone). The essential oils (Eos) were diluted (0.5 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 2 mg/mL) in HPLC grade acetone to obtain the working solution to be tested (50 µL/tube). Mite mortality was manually assessed after 1 h exposure under controlled conditions. The essential oils that showed the best effectiveness at 0.5 mg/mL were bergamot, which neutralized (dead + inactivated) 80% (p ≤ 0.001) of the parasites; grapefruit, which neutralized 70% (p ≤ 0.001); and lemon, which neutralized 69% of them. Interestingly, the positive control (Amitraz) at the same concentration neutralized 60% of the parasites. These results demonstrate that Calabrian bergamot, grapefruit, and lemon Eos consistently reduced V. destructor viability and open the possibility for their utilization to control this parasite in honey bee farming.","Bava, Roberto; Castagna, Fabio; Piras, Cristian; Palma, Ernesto; Cringoli, Giuseppe; Musolino, Vincenzo; Lupia, Carmine; Perri, Maria Rosaria; Statti, Giancarlo; Britti, Domenico; Musella, Vincenzo",Pathogens,35,1

Dairy cows are often culled at quite young ages due to an inability to cope adequately with metabolic and infectious diseases, resulting in reduced milk production and infertility. Improved longevity is therefore a desirable trait which would benefit both farmers and their cows. This study analysed the transcriptome derived from RNA-seq data of leukocytes obtained from Holstein cows in early lactation with respect to lactation number. RESULTS: Samples were divided into three lactation groups for analysis: i) primiparous (PP, n = 53), ii) multiparous in lactations 2–3 (MP 2–3, n = 121), and iii) MP in lactations 4–7 (MP > 3, n = 55). Leukocyte expression was compared between PP vs MP > 3 cows with MP 2–3 as background using DESeq2 followed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Seven modules were significantly correlated (r ≥ 0.25) to the trait lactation number. Genes from the modules which were more highly expressed in either the PP or MP > 3 cows were pooled, and the gene lists subjected to David functional annotation cluster analysis. The top three clusters from modules more highly expressed in the PP cows all involved regulation of gene transcription, particularly zinc fingers. Another cluster included genes encoding enzymes in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway. Top clusters up-regulated in MP > 3 cows included the terms Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, C-type lectin, and Immunity. Differentially expressed candidate genes for ageing previously identified in the human blood transcriptome up-regulated in PP cows were mainly associated with T-cell function (CCR7, CD27, IL7R, CAMK4, CD28), mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS27, MRPS9, MRPS31), and DNA replication and repair (WRN). Those up-regulated in MP > 3 cows encoded immune defence proteins (LYZ, CTSZ, SREBF1, GRN, ANXA5, ADARB1). CONCLUSIONS: Genes and pathways associated with lactation number in cows were identified for the first time to date, and we found that many were comparable to those known to be associated with ageing in humans and model organisms.

Herein, we describe the characterization of both untranslated regions, frameshifting signal, putative genome-linked virus protein (VPg) and conserved antigenic epitopes of several novel PoAstV3 genomes. Twenty complete coding sequences (CDS) were obtained from 32 diagnostic cases originating from 11 individual farms/systems sharing a nucleotide (amino acid) percent identity of 89.74–100% (94.79–100%), 91.9–100% (96.3–100%) and 90.71–100% (93.51–100%) for ORF1a, ORF1ab and ORF2, respectively. Our results indicate that the 5′UTR of PoAstV3 is highly conserved highlighting the importance of this region in translation initiation while their 3′UTR is moderately conserved among strains, presenting alternative configurations including multiple putative protein binding sites and pseudoknots. Moreover, two predicted conserved antigenic epitopes were identified matching the 3′ termini of VP27 of PoAstV3 USA strains. These epitopes may aid in the design and development of vaccine components and diagnostic assays useful to control outbreaks of PoAstV3-associated CNS disease.

Ample evidence suggests a bidirectional interaction between the microbiome and RAS. On the one hand, gut bacteria and their metabolites may modulate GI and systemic RAS. On the other hand, changes in the intestinal habitat caused by alterations in RAS may shape microbiota metabolic activity and composition. Notably, the pharmacodynamic effects of the RAS-targeted therapies may be in part mediated by the intestinal RAS and changes in the microbiome.

Methods: A real patient with en plaque cranial vault meningioma with diffuse and extensive dural involvement, extracranial extension into the calvarium, and homogeneous contrast enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, was selected for this case study. A patient-specific manikin was designed starting with the segmentation of the patient’s preoperative MRI images to simulate a craniotomy procedure. Surgical planning was performed according to the segmented anatomy, and customized bone flaps were designed accordingly. During the surgical simulation stage, the VOSTARS head-mounted display was used to accurately display the planned craniotomy trajectory over the manikin skull. The precision of the craniotomy was assessed based on the evaluation of previously prepared custom-made bone flaps. Results: A bone flap with a radius 0.5 mm smaller than the radius of an ideal craniotomy fitted perfectly over the performed craniotomy, demonstrating an error of less than ±1 mm in the task execution.

Phylogenetic analysis showed Nigeria camel-HKU23 is distinct from those previously identified in Saudi Arabia, while still genetically similar, as they share a monophyletic origin. Recombination analysis of Nigeria camel-HKU23 revealed two recombination breakpoints at positions of 22774–24100 base pairs (bp) and 28224–29362 bp. Recombination breakpoint at position 22774, encoding the Group 2a CoV-specific hemagglutinin esterase gene, exhibited high bootstrap support for clustering with RbCoV HKU14, which was previously detected in domestic rabbits in China. The recombination signal is only observed in Nigeria camel-HKU23, suggesting a regional varied evolutionary history of camel-HKU23. Our findings extended the knowledge of the evolutionary relationship among Group 2a CoVs. Further surveillance in other African camels will be important to elucidate the evolution of camel-HKU23.","So, R T Y; Oladipo, J O; Chu, D K W; Peiris, M",Virus Evol,35,1

It rapidly identifies these pathogens in addition to 7 antibiotic resistance genes on sputum and bronchioalveolar lavage samples in 1 hour. As one of the test centers for this panel, our institution utilized this panel for clinical and laboratory use. We reviewed the impact of BFPP on antimicrobial stewardship, particularly its role in early discontinuation of empiric antibiotics and prompt initiation of optimized targeted therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all cases by which BFPP was ordered. We reviewed medical records of each case to identify the results of the panel, culture data, antibiotics used, and subsequent clinical intervention. RESULTS: 43 tests were ordered in total. 17 were for clinical use by an infectious disease specialist and 26 were randomly obtained by the microbiology lab. All 17 clinical cases were intervened upon with the following interventions: discontinuation of anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (8 cases), discontinuation of anti-MRSA antibiotics (5 cases), discontinuation of azithromycin (4 cases), discontinuation of carbapenem (1 case), prevention of inappropriate antibiotic escalation or initiation of inappropriate antibiotics (2 cases), and early IV to PO transition (3 cases). Of the random 26 samples ordered by lab, 13 had opportunities for antibiotic de-escalation if a physician were notified of the results. Viruses were identified in 15 samples with coronavirus being the most common. Virus was the sole pathogen in 9 of the 15 samples. Bacterial pathogens were identified in 20 samples that were reported as normal flora by conventional culture; none of these cases led to or potentially could have led to antibiotic escalation as the sole intervention. CONCLUSION: Clinical use of BFPP had 100% intervention rate with all interventions leading to de-escalation of antibiotics or prevention of inappropriate antibiotics use. Though over-identification of colonizers is a potential limitation, BFPP is a powerful tool for antibiotic stewardship that results in rapid interventions to achieve optimal targeted therapy.

However, these tests are expensive, and the clinical significance of a positive result is often unclear. Positive viral results have the potential to decrease antibiotic use and length of stay, but their actual impact is unknown. METHODS: We completed a retrospective review of all adult patients with positive respiratory viral panel (RVP; GenMark) and/or rapid RSV/influenza PCR tests (Cepheid Xpert) collected within 48 hours of admission to the general inpatient or stepdown units of an academic tertiary care hospital between September 1, 2015 and March 15, 2016. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, time of test collection and result, additional diagnostic evaluation, and antibiotic use. RESULTS: A total of 221 positive respiratory viral tests were collected on 215 patients during the study period. The median age at time of testing was 56.8 years; 48% were female. Respiratory symptoms were documented in 92.8% of cases. COPD was the most common respiratory co-morbidity (20.2%), while 30% of patients had cancer, and 3.2% were HIV-infected. Respiratory support on admission was common (51.6%). A rapid PCR and RVP were performed in 58.8% of cases, while 28.5% had only an RVP and 12.7% had only a rapid PCR. Of the patients who had a positive rapid PCR, 17.6% also had an RVP done. Antibiotics were started within 24 hours of presentation in 87.4% of all cases and 70.6% of patients who had a positive rapid PCR. Rhinovirus was the most frequently isolated pathogen (44.6% of positive tests) followed by metapneumovirus (14%), respiratory syncytial virus (13.5%), and coronavirus (13.5%). Median time from specimen collection to result was 38.8 hours for RVP, and 15.3% were resulted after patient discharge. For those who had a rapid PCR alone, median time from collection to result was 1.5 hours. CONCLUSION: In this non-critically ill cohort, most patients with positive viral assays received antibiotics, and a substantial number of RVPs were resulted after discharge. This suggests that there are many lost opportunities to impact clinical management with respiratory viral testing. DISCLOSURES: M.

Molecular methods such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) rapidly are being developed and introduced in the clinical laboratory setting. Indeed, every section of the clinical microbiology laboratory, including bacteriology, mycology, mycobacteriology, parasitology, and virology, have benefited from these advanced techniques. Because of the rapid development and adaptation of these molecular techniques, the interpretation and relevance of the results produced by such molecular methods has lagged somewhat behind.

In severe or unclear situations, a chest X-ray is done and analysis is frequently done by interns. Radiologists frequently see those patients that suffer from recurrent, nosocomial pneumonia, or an additional predisposing disease. The appropriate investigational technique, frequently targeted differential diagnosis, and the special needs of these patients need to be understood by radiologists. Early detection of a focus of infection is the major goal in immunocompromised patients. As pneumonia is the most common focus, chest imaging is to be done at the beginning. The sensitivity of chest X-rays, especially in the supine position, is known to be low. Therefore the very sensitive high-resolution CT (HRCT) became the gold standard in neutropenic hosts and is widely replaced by thin-section multi-detector-row-CT (MDCT). Underlying diseases such as pulmonary embolism or bronchial carcinoma might also be depicted. Furthermore, the costs of CT are low in comparison to antibiotics. The infiltrate needs to be localised, so that a physician can utilise this information as a guidance for invasive procedures for further microbiological work-up. The radiological characterisation of infiltrates gives a first and rapid hint to differentiate between different sorts of infectious (typical bacterial, atypical bacterial, fungal) and non-infectious aetiologies. Follow-up investigations need careful interpretation according to disease and concomitant treatment. Temporary exclusion of infectious involvement of the lung with high accuracy is, besides of pneumonia management, a hot topic for clinicians.","Heussel, Claus Peter",Multislice CT,35,1

The Justinian pandemic arose in northern Africa in the mid-6th century, and by the 7th century had spread throughout the Mediterranean and near-eastern regions—severely impacting both the Roman and Byzantine empires. The second pandemic, the Black Death or great pestilence, originated in Central Asia, was carried to Sicily in 1347 via ships from the Crimea, and rapidly swept through medieval Europe. By 1352, it had killed 30% or more of afflicted populations, slowly playing itself out in successive epidemics, including the Great Plague of London in 1665 (Perry and Fetherston, 1997). The third (Modern) pandemic began in southwestern China in the mid-19th, struck Hong Kong in 1894, and was soon carried by rat-infested steamships to port cities on all inhabited continents, including several in the United States (US) (Link, 1955; Pollitzer, 1954). By 1930, the third pandemic had caused more than 26 million cases and 12 million deaths. Plague in these three pandemics was predominantly the bubonic form, emanating from Yersinia pestis-infected rats and fleas, although terrifying outbreaks of the more virulent person-to-person spreading pneumonic form were recorded during the course of each. The explosive contagiousness and severity of pneumonic plague was most completely documented in Manchurian epidemics in the early 20th century, which involved tens of thousands of cases, virtually all of them fatal (Wu, 1926).","Dennis, David T.",Bioterrorism and Infectious Agents: A New Dilemma for the 21st Century,35,1

As a result of a wider analysis of past crisis-management feedback, we define the term crisis and propose a crisis-management cycle, along with a set of decision support activities. From a system point of view, crisis management functionalities are structured along three crucial steps: information gathering, situation understanding, and decision making. For each step, the processes involved are described and for each one some relevant techniques are proposed to implement the processes. For the information-gathering step, the use of ontology allows the building and structuring of a coherent ­situation model. The initial overall picture of the situation, obtained by some on-line ­information extraction and fusion, is then consolidated in the situation understanding step to provide meaningful real-time situation awareness. This provides the essential base to derive the final decision-making step. In the decision phase, the context has a dual impact on the decision-making process; the context first constrains the resolution of the resource allocation problem, but it also contributes to discriminate between several resource allocation solutions. It is thus shown that each step of the crisis management process relies on the availability and quality of the crisis context, and that this in-time contextualisation is required to enhance the overall process of crisis management. To summarise, this chapter highlights the key role of situation understanding for crisis management and reveals the crucial necessity of in-time contextualisation at each step of the crisis management process.","Aligne, Florence; Mattioli, Juliette",Supporting Real Time Decision-Making,35,19

However, there was little scholarly attention paid to stigma while the outbreak was still active. This chapter explores the effects of stigmatization on the health care services that pregnant women, both with and without Ebola, were able to access and receive during the outbreak. We propose three primary ways in which stigma operated to reduce pregnant women’s access to health care services during the outbreak: (1) Women and their relatives were afraid to go to health facilities for fear of being infected with Ebola while there, i.e., stigmatization of health care facilities; (2) Health care workers frequently died due to their occupational exposure to EVD while caring for others, i.e., they were stigmatized as carriers or transmitters of Ebola; and (3) Pregnant women themselves were refused services at health facilities due to fears that they were infected with Ebola, i.e., the physiological processes of birth, which involve high levels of potential for exposure to bodily fluids, led to health care workers’ stigmatization of these women when they sought services during pregnancy or, particularly, at the time of giving birth. In several of the countries that experienced the worst of the outbreak, women already faced some of the world’s highest rates of pregnancy-related death even prior to the advent of the epidemic. We argue that the high fatality rate for pregnant women with Ebola, the drastic effects of the epidemic on countries’ health care workforce, and the inherent messiness of birth, all coalesced to create heightened discrimination and stigma around seeking care during pregnancy and birth.","Strong, Adrienne E.; Schwartz, David A.",Pregnant in the Time of Ebola,35,1

Therefore this chapter starts with a detailed discussion of shear stress effects on mammalian cells (anchorage-dependent and suspendable cells) in model systems and bioreactors, respectively, and consequences for reactor design. Appropriate oxygen supply is another critical issue, as adapted oxygen supply systems are required. Techniques for immobilization of cells, either grown on microcarriers in suspension culture or within macroporous carriers in fixed bed or fluidized bed reactors, are discussed as well. With respect to the operation of bioreactors, the characteristics of different culture modes (batch, fed-batch, chemostat, perfusion) are introduced and practical examples are given.

Climate changes and human mobility contribute to increase the number of cases and to spread the disease all around the world. In this work, the influence of human mobility is evaluated by analyzing a sequence of correlations of dengue incidence between cities in southeastern Brazil. The methodology initially identifies the cities were the epidemy begins, considered as focus for that epidemic year. The strength of the linear association between all pairs of cities were calculated identifying the cities which have high correlations with the focus-cities. The correlations are also calculated between all pairs considering a time lag of 1, 2 or 3 weeks ahead for all cities except the focus ones. Centred differences of the notification number are used to detect the outbreaks. The tests were made with DATASUS-SINAN data of the state of Rio de Janeiro, from January 2008 to December 2013. Preliminary results indicate that the spread of dengue from one city to another can be characterized by the development of the sequence of shifted correlations. The proposal may be useful to consider control strategies against disease transmission.","dos Santos, Bruna C.; Sartori, Larissa M.; Peixoto, Claudia; Bevilacqua, Joyce S.; Oliva, Sergio M.","Modeling, Dynamics, Optimization and Bioeconomics III",35,1

In order to protect patients, staff, and facilities it is essential that healthcare facilities be prepared for such emergency events. Ambulatory surgery centers (ASC) and Office Based Anesthesia (OBA) practices are unique healthcare settings that necessitate specific emergency planning since they typically do not have rapid response or code teams on site. In addition, they typically operate with fewer personnel and have staff members who often perform multiple functions. Previously there has been variability in the emergency preparedness amongst ASCs and OBA practices. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has recently identified three requirements for maintaining healthcare services during an emergency. These are 1) safeguarding human resources, 2) maintaining business operations, and 3) protecting physical resources. In 2016 CMS issued new rules establishing national emergency preparedness requirements for Medicare and Medicaid participating providers in the United States. In addition there are requirements specifically for ASCs and OBAs. The first step in emergency preparedness is performing a risk assessment for a practice using an “all-hazards” approach. In this approach, the practice attempts to identify all hazards that could potentially affect the practice as well as evaluating the likelihood of such hazards. This risk assessment is then incorporated into an emergency plan for the facility. In addition to reviewing specific components of an emergency plan for ASCs and OBAs, the need to test the plan and create a subsequent corrective action plan is reviewed. It is important that healthcare providers at all ambulatory surgery centers and office based anesthesia practices are aware of regulations for emergency preparedness and work to ensure that patients, staff and physical resources are protected during natural disasters and other emergencies.","Drummond, Shaina; O’Rourke, Michael",Manual of Practice Management for Ambulatory Surgery Centers,35,1

We incorporate the generated schema labels into a mixed ranking model which not only considers the relevance between the query and dataset metadata but also the similarity between the query and generated schema labels. To evaluate our method on real-world datasets, we create a new benchmark specifically for the dataset retrieval task. Experiments show that our approach can effectively improve the precision and NDCG scores of the dataset retrieval task compared with baseline methods. We also test on a collection of Wikipedia tables to show that the features generated from schema labels can improve the unsupervised and supervised web table retrieval task as well.","Chen, Zhiyu; Jia, Haiyan; Heflin, Jeff; Davison, Brian D.",Advances in Information Retrieval,35,1

Two ordination techniques, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), were used. The values of slope, aspect, altitude and lithology information were provided by Geographic Information System (GIS), and geomorphological land units were determined by intersection of overlaid data layers. Plant sampling was undertaken within nine land units with similar lithology and altitude but which differed in slope and aspect, using 30 randomly selected 1 m(2) plots per land unit. Soil samples were taken from two depths (0–20 and 20–50 cm) in each plot. Organic matter, bulk density, texture, calcium carbonate, total nitrogen and available phosphorus and potassium contents were determined. The results indicated that plant species have different responses to edaphical and topographical parameters. The invader species group had a balanced amount of influence from all soil components and topographic factors, whereas the native grasses were located in productive soils, which typically have a low grazing intensity, such as the north facing slopes. Coniferous bushy trees, cushion plants and some shrub plant groups were found on steep slopes with alkaline soils. The broad‐leaved bushy trees plant group was abundant in fine texture soils on low and humid slopes.","Tatian, Mohammadreza; Arzani, Hossein; Reihan, Majid Karimpour; Bahmanyar, Mohammad Ali; Jalilvand, Hamid",Grassl,35,19

A chip can be printed with thousands of protein probes (e.g. antibodies), the biological sample added (e.g. a proteome) and any binding detected. We aim to develop protein microarrays based on human recombinant scFv antibody fragments for global proteome analysis. The concept of comparing proteomic maps of healthy versus diseased samples will allow disease‐specific proteins to be detected. In fact, antibody microarrays will allow us to perform comparative proteome analysis on any sample format in a species‐independent manner, as long as a proteome can be isolated. However, the complexity of proteomes, containing several thousands of different proteins, is a problem. Here, we have designed antibody microarrays targeting the water‐soluble fraction of a proteome. To this end, an anticytokine antibody array was developed and human dendritic cells (±activation) was used as model system. The results showed that our antibody microarrays could be used to examine the cytokine profile in complex samples. Furthermore, we have taken the first steps towards comparing our results with those of other technologies on both the protein and gene level. Due to the complexity of the model proteome, we also examined the possibility to prefractionate the proteome in a simple one‐step procedure (based on size) prior to the labelling step. In more detail, the sample proteome was fractionated into two fractions using membrane devices with different molecular weight cut‐offs. The results showed that the fractionation considerably enhanced the assay sensitivity allowing cytokines in the pg/ml range to be readily detectable.","Ingvarsson, J.; Lindstedt, M.; Borrebaeck, C.

Reconsideration of strategic and risk‐management approaches have become necessary. Supply‐chain management and corporate strategy require a fundamental rethink to balance the pursuit of efficiency with increased responsiveness and flexibility. Unpredictability and turbulence in the international business environment suggest that traditional planning approaches that assume linear growth may give way to more scenario‐based planning.

Research and development (R&D) for new vaccines for EIDs faces two major challenges. The first is R&D preparedness: that is, to advance EID vaccine candidates to the latest R&D stage possible during non-epidemic times, on the basis of any feasible safety or efficacy data. The second is R&D response: that is, to test the clinical efficacy of vaccine candidates rapidly once an outbreak erupts. To overcome these challenges, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was established in August 2016. Here, we explore why the realisation of CEPI’s mission—preventing outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases from becoming humanitarian crises—is a global public good, and the crucial role R&D preparedness and R&D response play in providing this good. We next examine why providing this global public good requires incentivising involvement and sharing risks with the private sector. Finally, we explore the potential for CEPI to be an agent mobilising shared responsibilities, including key factors that must be addressed in order for CEPI to demonstrate to governments that collective action is the preferred strategy for preventing future epidemics and strengthening global health security.","Gopinathan, Unni; Peacocke, Elizabeth; Gouglas, Dimitrios; Ottersen, Trygve; Røttingen, John-Arne",Infectious Diseases in the New Millennium,35,1

It achieves good detection results for rocks with clear clusters of colored objects. For the analyzed data set, the method finds in the rock image sets with high visual similarity, which translates into the geological classification of rocks at a level of above 78%. Considering the fact that the proposed method is based on segmentation that does not require any input parameters, this result should be considered satisfactory.

To this end, we introduce EdNet, a large-scale hierarchical dataset of diverse student activities collected by Santa, a multi-platform self-study solution equipped with an artificial intelligence tutoring system. EdNet contains 131,417,236 interactions from 784,309 students collected over more than 2 years, making it the largest public IES dataset released to date. Unlike existing datasets, EdNet records a wide variety of student actions ranging from question-solving to lecture consumption to item purchasing. Also, EdNet has a hierarchical structure which divides the student actions into 4 different levels of abstractions. The features of EdNet are domain-agnostic, allowing EdNet to be easily extended to different domains. The dataset is publicly released for research purposes. We plan to host challenges in multiple AIEd tasks with EdNet to provide a common ground for the fair comparison between different state-of-the-art models and to encourage the development of practical and effective methods.","Choi, Youngduck; Lee, Youngnam; Shin, Dongmin; Cho, Junghyun; Park, Seoyon; Lee, Seewoo; Baek, Jineon; Bae, Chan; Kim, Byungsoo; Heo, Jaewe",Artificial Intelligence in Education,35,1

In indeterminacy and inconsistent environment, a neutrosophic set is described by the truth, falsity, and indeterminacy degrees, but they lack measures related to reliability. To describe the hybrid information of combining the truth, falsity and indeterminacy degrees with their corresponding reliability degrees, this paper first proposes the concept of a neutrosophic Z-number (NZN) set, which is a new framework of neutrosophic values combined with the neutrosophic measures of reliability, as the generalization of the Z-number and the neutrosophic set. Then, we define the operations of neutrosophic Z-numbers (NZNs) and a score function for ranking NZNs. Next, we present NZN weighted arithmetic averaging (NZNWAA) and NZN weighted geometric averaging (NZNWGA) operators to aggregate NZN information and investigate their properties. Regarding the NZNWAA and NZNWGA operators and the score function, a multicriteria decision making (MDM) approach is developed in the NZN environment.

This shift in practice has provided an opportunity to reconsider how technology use in mathematics education can be utilised to improve student engagement. In this study, we explore four case studies of Australian secondary mathematics classrooms conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to examine how teachers are using blended learning approaches and how their students perceive these pedagogical practices. Findings across all four sites indicate that technology use expands student opportunities to engage with mathematics learning through the provision of multiple pathways and methods of access. Specifically, we find evidence supporting the use of blended classroom teaching strategies to provide differentiation and personalised learning approaches; visualisation and dynamic manipulation of mathematics concepts; and alternative methods for teacher-student feedback and communication. We argue that the student learning experience in mathematics can be enhanced through a variety of blended learning approaches by allowing for diverse points of access to learning opportunities which are more closely aligned to individual learning needs and free from the temporal constraints of the classroom.","Attard, Catherine; Holmes, Kathryn",Math Ed Res J,35,22

The risk factors and characteristics of these strokes have yet to be defined. One large barrier to this type of analysis is the ability of physicians and researchers to separate strokes secondary to COVID-19 from primary stroke syndromes in the setting of asymptomatic and potentially non-contributory COVID-19 infection. Delineating between these two patient populations is essential both to defining and treating COVID-19 related stroke. METHODS: Patients at 4 medical centers in NYC who tested positive for COVID-19 and had brain imaging consistent with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) were identified from the first 4 weeks of the city-wide lockdown. Symptomatic patients were defined based on symptoms and vital signs on admission. Baseline characteristics, risk factors, outcomes, stroke-subtypes, and imaging characteristics were all collected by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: We identified 27 symptomatic and 14 non-symptomatic COVID-19 patients with AIS. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. The only difference in risk factors was that COVID-19 asymptomatic patients were more likely to be active smokers than COVID-19 symptomatic patients (P < .05). There were also no differences in stroke sub-type or stroke location between COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Finally, there were no differences in mortality or functional outcomes between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that there are no clear differences between the characteristics and outcomes of AIS in patients who are COVID-19 symptomatic vs asymptomatic. Larger studies are needed to determine if these similarities hold true. Additionally, better markers of systemic COVID-19 infection are needed to help delineate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related strokes.","Dardick, Joseph; Altschul, David J",Neurosurgery,35,1

OBJECTIVE: This study is a clinical and economic analysis of morphine monotherapy versus morphine plus midazolam in ventilated infants with RDS. METHODS: A decision-analytic model from the hospital perspective was developed to follow the consequences of the use of the study drugs. Clinical and resource utilization data were extracted based on a retrospective cohort study of 104 neonates with RDS receiving morphine alone versus in combination with midazolam at the main neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Qatar, from 2014 to 2019. Primary outcome measures were the analgesia success rate, via the Premature Infant Pain Profile scale, and overall costs of therapies. Multivariate statistical analyses confirmed no significant variations in baseline characteristics between study groups. RESULTS: With 0.05 significance and 80% power, morphine had a higher rate of successful analgesia (65.4 vs. 34.6%; risk ratio 1.91; 95% confidence interval 1.11–3.28; p = 0.019). Overall costs were also in favor of morphine compared with its combination with midazolam, with cost savings of 40,959 Qatari Riyal ($US11,222), year 2019/20 values. The Monte Carlo analyses confirmed the economic advantage of morphine alone in 100% of cases and demonstrated that it is not sensitive to uncertainties in study model inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Morphine monotherapy enabled enhanced pain relief over its combination with midazolam in the NICU, at a reduced overall cost. Morphine alone, therefore, seems to be a dominant analgesia strategy.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review study. Patients with penoscrotal defects admitted to our level I trauma center from 2017 to 2019 were evaluated. The Braden scale score was used for wound evaluation and the Korean patient classification system (KPCS) was used for assessment of severity. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for potential risk factors associated with early surgical management. RESULTS: In total, there were 58 male patients, and the average Braden scale score was 12.08 ± 2.54, with the scrotum (36.20%), and the penile shaft (32.76%) being popular sites for injuries. The wounds requiring surgical treatment were 20.68% (n = 12), with local flaps (33.33%) being most commonly used. The significant predictors of advanced wounds which required surgical treatment were old age (p = 0.026, odds ratio [OR] 8.238), orthopedic combined injuries (p = 0.044, OR 1.088), intubation (p = 0.018, OR 9.625), restraint (p = 0.036, OR 0.157) and blood transfusion (p < 0.001, OR 2.462). CONCLUSION: In multiple trauma patients, penoscrotal defects caused by high-speed trauma are an important matter of concern. Specifically, patients with combined skeletal injuries or requiring respiratory care were prone to advanced wounds. We proposed a five-category algorithm to manage such patients, which included severity of the patient’s condition, respiration, hemodynamic status, comorbidity, and immobilization.

CIs produce and distribute essential goods or services, as for power transmission systems, water treatment and distribution infrastructures, transportation systems, communication networks, nuclear power plants, and information technologies. Being resilient becomes a key property for CIs, which are constantly exposed to threats that can undermine safety, security, and business continuity. Nowadays, a variety of approaches exist in the context of CIs’ resilience research. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review on the approaches that have a complete qualitative dimension, or that can be used as entry points for semi-quantitative analyses. The study aims to uncover the usage of qualitative research methods through a systematic review based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The paper identifies four principal dimensions of resilience referred to CIs (i.e., techno-centric, organisational, community, and urban) and discusses the related qualitative methods. Besides many studies being focused on energy and transportation systems, the literature review allows to observe that interviews and questionnaires are most frequently used to gather qualitative data, besides a high percentage of mixed-method research. The article aims to provide a synthesis of literature on qualitative methods used for resilience research in the domain of CIs, detailing lessons learned from such approaches to shed lights on best practices and identify possible future research directions.","Cantelmi, R.; Di Gravio, G.; Patriarca, R.",Environ Syst Decis,35,26

Although many studies have been conducted on the Ganga basin, however, trend observed in flow and sediment yield in Ganga River has been scarcely studied. Alteration in flow pattern and sediment transport in rivers brings remarkable impact on river geomorphology and entire ecosystem of the region. The present paper attempts to identify trends observed in Ganga River in terms of annual maximum and annual minimum discharges, water and sediment yield during monsoon season. The trend analysis was accomplished by performing the Mann-Kendall (M-K), Sen’s slope, and innovative trend analysis at various gauging sites along the river for the monsoon months. Significance of trend tests were tested at 5% significance level. Innovative trend analysis (ITA) revealed non-monotonicity within the time series and provided more detailed understanding of changes in hydrological changes. While observed annual maximum discharge showed a negative trend at almost all the sites, annual minimum discharge showed positive trend at gauging sites upstream of confluence of Yamuna River. Data of discharge and sediment load for monsoon months also revealed declining trends at most of the gauging sites. Water and sediment yields at all sites except Gandhighat showed a negative trend. Decline in trend of sediment and water yield is more pronounced in Western Ganga Plain (WGP) as compared to Eastern Ganga Plain (EGP). Incorporating these trends can be helpful for various water management projects in the future. Both climatic factors and human intervention appear to be responsible for the alteration in flow pattern of Ganga River.","Zakwan, Mohammad; Ahmad, Zulfequar",Arab J Geosci,35,1

The limited number of PCR kits in the country and the increment in the number of new COVID-19 cases makes the role of CT scan examinations rising and becoming essential in aiding the health institutions in diagnosing and isolating infected patients and those in close contacts. This study will review the spectrum of CT pulmonary changes due to COVID-19 infection and estimate the CT severity score index and its relation to age, sex, and PCR test results. RESULTS: The ground glass opacities were the most common encountered pattern of pulmonary changes and were seen in (79%). There was strong positive correlation between higher CT severity score and male gender (p value = 0.0002, R(2) = 0.9). Also, there was significant correlation of CT severity score and increasing age (p value less than 0.00018). Significant correlation was seen between CT scan percentage of lung involvement and positive PCR test results (p value = 0.001917), as the CT severity index is increasing, the PCR test is more likely to be positive. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT is an important and fast imaging tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19-infected patients especially in developing countries. In addition, chest CT can predict the disease severity by showing the percentage of lung involvement and hence give an idea about the prognosis of the disease. Higher CT severity score is significantly correlated with male gender, older age group patients and likely positive PCR test.","Al-Mosawe, Ammar Mosa; Abdulwahid, Hiba mohammed; Fayadh, Noor Abbas Hummadi",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,35,13

(CCS 2016). Our protocol is based on a new approach for two-party PSI, which can be instantiated to provide security against either malicious or semi-honest adversaries. The protocol is unique in that the only difference between the semi-honest and malicious versions is an instantiation with different parameters for a linear error-correction code. It is also the first PSI protocol which is concretely efficient while having linear communication and security against malicious adversaries, while running in the OT-hybrid model (assuming a non-programmable random oracle). State of the art semi-honest PSI protocols take advantage of cuckoo hashing, but it has proven a challenge to use cuckoo hashing for malicious security. Our protocol is the first to use cuckoo hashing for malicious-secure PSI. We do so via a new data structure, called a probe-and-XOR of strings ([Formula: see text] ), which may be of independent interest. This abstraction captures important properties of previous data structures, most notably garbled Bloom filters.

We give a definition of what is an “oracle cloning method” and what it means for such a method to “work,” in a framework we call read-only indifferentiability, a simple variant of classical indifferentiability that yields security not only for usage in single-stage games but also in multi-stage ones. We formalize domain separation, and specify and study many oracle cloning methods, including common domain-separating ones, giving some general results to justify (prove read-only indifferentiability of) certain classes of methods. We are not only able to validate the oracle cloning methods used in many of the unbroken NIST PQC KEMs, but also able to specify and validate oracle cloning methods that may be useful beyond that.","Bellare, Mihir; Davis, Hannah; Günther, Felix",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,35,1

We reviewed the recent literature on cross-cultural studies on online behavior and building on Hofstede’s theory of cultural dimensions and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), we developed a conceptual model exploring how the dimensions of national culture influence perceptions of website usability, trust, and perceived risk, which in turn impact on intention to use and online purchase behavior. A web-based questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 350 European and Asian consumers actively using Alibaba e-commerce platforms. The conceptual model was validated through a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), while structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to empirically test the hypothesized relationships among variables. Results showed how culture significantly influenced website usability and perceived risk in European consumers and, in turn, their intention and behavior. Differently, culture significantly influenced trust of Asian consumers, as well as their intention and online behavior. With this study, we contribute to the literature on consumer online purchase behavior from a cross-cultural perspective. As culture emerged among the significant antecedents of mechanisms explaining online purchase behavior, e-tailers should tailor digital marketing strategies according to consumer cultural differences.","Faraoni, Monica; Hu, Lala; Rialti, Riccardo; Zollo, Lamberto",Ital,35,1

Weight gain during COVID-19 may be, in part, be due to changes in the home food environment and child feeding practices; yet longitudinal studies have not examined these relations. This study describes patterns of child weight change, the home food environment, and child feeding practices across two timepoints during COVID-19. METHODS: Parents (N = 433; 95% female) in the US with a child aged 5–18 years completed two online surveys in May (T1) and September (T2) 2020. Parents reported on child feeding practices (e.g., concern for child overweight, restriction, pressure, monitoring) using the Child Feeding Questionnaire, perceived child weight status, and the home food environment before COVID-19 (i.e., baseline; retrospective report) and at twice during COVID-19 (T1 and T2). Child weight change was categorized as having gained weight vs. not. Repeated measures and chi square analyses examined differences in changes in child feeding practices and the home food environment by child weight change. RESULTS: About 30% of parents reported child weight gain from T1 to T2 (average +9.6 ± 7.1 lbs). Interactions between parents’ concern for child overweight, monitoring, and restriction, by child weight change, were observed (ps ≤ 0.02): families with child weight gain reported baseline to T1 increases in these feeding practices, that were sustained at T2; for families without child weight gain, concern, monitoring, and restriction increased at T1, but returned to baseline at T2. Overall, pressure feeding practices increased from baseline to T1, and returned to baseline at T2. No clear patterns regarding home food environment changes and child weight change were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Almost one-third of parents reported child weight gain during COVID-19, which was related to sustained concern for overweight and some feeding practices, yet not home food environment changes. Further research is needed to investigate different behavioral, societal, environmental, and psychosocial factors contributing to child weight gain during COVID-19, in order to identify the most salient intervention targets to mitigate the potential long-term health consequences.

Further, understanding the challenges faced by teachers empowers the profession to make agricultural education more resilient to broader, social forces in the future. In this study, a national sample of agriculture teachers were asked to identify the three most pressing challenges they experienced during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Using qualitative research methods, eight challenge themes emerged: (a) Communication, (b) FFA (National FFA Organization, a student leadership organization previously named the “Future Farmers of America”), (c) Instructional Quality, (d) Program Facilities and Activities, (e) Supervised Agricultural Experiences (SAE), (f) Student Motivation, (g) Technology and the Internet, and (h) Work‐Life Balance. Using quasi‐statistical methods, the most commonly reported challenges were identified ‐ Instructional Quality, FFA, and Student Motivation. Analysis of all the challenges suggested permeation across each aspect of the three‐component model of agricultural education. Furthermore, many challenges appeared to be related to each other. Finally, analysis of the results illuminated responding teachers, and their students, each experienced the challenges brought about by COVID‐19 differently, including evidence of exacerbated educational inequality for students from lower income households.","McKim, Aaron J.; Sorensen, Tyson J.; Burrows, Michelle",,35,8

We have developed a mobile application for a smartphone and a smartwatch to collect beacon signals from BLE beacon sensors as well as to store information about the participants’ household rooms. Our goal is to collect beacon information about the time the participants spent in different rooms of their household to infer sociability information. We applied the same technology and setup in an internal experiment with healthy volunteers to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm in 10 different home setups, and we observed an average accuracy of 97.2%. Moreover, we show that it is feasible for the clinical study participants/caregivers to set up the BLE beacon sensors in their homes without any technical help, with 96% of them setting up the technology on the first day of data collection. Next, we present results from one-week location data from study participants collected through the proposed technology. Finally, we provide a list of good practice guidelines for optimally applying beacon technology for indoor location monitoring. The proposed algorithm enables us to estimate time spent in different rooms of a household that can pave the development of objective sociability features and eventually support decisions regarding drug efficacy in ASD.","Kriara, Lito; Hipp, Joerg; Chatham, Christopher; Nobbs, David; Slater, David; Lipsmeier, Florian; Lindemann, Michael",Sensors (Basel),35,1

Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the 5Cs can be used to identify positive development in the under-researched Asian contexts, such as Malaysia. Thus, this study examined the 5Cs of PYD (competence, confidence, character, connection, and caring) and their importance to purpose in life, hope, and well-being in a sample of emerging adult undergraduate university students in Malaysia. Data were collected from 400 participants from 15 Malaysian universities (132 males, 268 females; ages ranged from 18 to 26 years old, M = 22). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that two of the 5Cs of PYD (confidence and connection) as well as hope were important to explaining variation in well-being. The findings imply that there are strong links between PYD, especially confidence and connection, and well-being, while purpose in life and hope were indirectly related to the 2Cs (confidence and connection) of PYD and well-being. Therefore, mental health professionals are encouraged to review and redefine their treatment design to include confidence, connection, purpose in life and hope when working with Malaysian emerging adult university students.","Abdul Kadir, Nor Ba’yah; Mohd, Rusyda Helma",Front Psychol,35,1

Rapid solidification brings about much more homogenous amorphous and/or nanocrystalline structure with reduced density of primary particles. Rapidly solidified thin ribbons obtained by melt spinning are usually considered as intrinsically homogenous. However, due to different cooling conditions at the wheel surface and on the side exposed to the ambient environment, structure of such ribbons may vary significantly across its thickness. The materials studied in this study were 30–40 μm thickness ribbons of nanocrystalline hyper- and hypo-eutectic Al–Si–Zr alloys produced by melt-spinning method. Transmission electron microscopy and high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the structure homogeneity across the ribbons. Thin foils for transmission observations were prepared by focused ion beam system. Microstructural observations confirmed nanocrystalline character of Al–Si–Zr alloys. However, these observations revealed inhomogeneity of the structure across the ribbon width.","Andrzejczuk, Mariusz; Lewandowska, Małgorzata; Latuch, Jerzy; Kurzydłowski, Krzysztof Jan",J Mater Sci,35,1

U of T FASE was compelled to develop and/or enhance such initiatives after an anti-Black racist incident between students was mishandled and criticized by Black student groups. Using critical race theory (CRT) and personal reflection, this paper highlighted several barriers to the implementation and/or success of these initiatives such as time, financial security, perception of institutional policy and/or provincial law, engineering culture and whiteness and/or colour evasiveness. While definitive solutions to these barriers may not be clear, having a designated champion for specific initiatives, addressing discomfort in differentiating race, consistent advocacy to senior administration and the self-empowerment to resource time and effort to such work were identified as key elements to drive initiatives within the context of U of T FASE.","Burke, Mikhail; Hanson, Cori; Abraham, Cassandra",Can,35,1

However, neurological complications, which are the most feared and difficult to manage, require long-term follow-up, and increase hospital costs remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in this cohort. RESULTS: We evaluated the neurological physical examination, cranial computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MRI) records of 162 pediatric patients with neurological symptoms lasting more than 24 h after undergoing heart surgery in our clinic between June 2012 and May 2020. The patients’ ages ranged from 0 to 205 months, with a mean of 60.59 ± 46.44 months. Of the 3849 pediatric cardiac surgery patients we screened, 162 had neurological complications in the early period (the first 10 days after surgery). The incidence was calculated as 4.2%; 69 patients (42.6%) experienced seizures, 17 (10.5%) experienced confusion, 39 (24.1%) had stupor, and 37 (22.8%) had hemiparesis. Of the patients who developed neurological complications, 54 (33.3%) died. Patients with neurological complications were divided into 3 groups: strokes (n = 90), intracranial bleeding (n = 37), and no radiological results (n = 35). Thirty-four patients (37.8%) in the stroke group died, as did 15 (40%) in the bleeding group, and 5 (14.3%) in the no radiological results group. CONCLUSIONS: Studies on neurological complications after pediatric heart surgery in the literature are currently insufficient. We think that this study will contribute to a more detailed discussion of the issue. Responses to neurological events and treatment in the pediatric group may differ compared to the adult age group. Primary prevention methods should be the main approach in combating neurological complications; their formation mechanisms should be carefully monitored and preventive treatment strategies should be developed.","Arslanoğlu, Ergin; Kara, Kenan Abdurrahman; Yiğit, Fatih; Arkan, Cüneyt; Uslu, Ufuk; Şavluk, Ömer Faruk; Yılmaz, Abdullah Arif; Tunçer, Eylem; Çine, Nihat; Ceyran, Hakan",Cardiothorac Surg,35,1

METHODS: Of 209 enrolled subjects, 155 patients were confirmed by PCR and/or serology as having coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Blood samples were obtained at a median of 2.8 (interquartile, 2.1–3.7) and 6.1 (5.3–7.2) months after baseline (symptom onset and/or first positive virus detection). The immune profiles of activation, senescence, exhaustion, and regulatory cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were detected by a plaque reduction neutralization test. In available nasopharyngeal swabs at baseline, SARS-CoV-2 levels were quantified by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). RESULTS: Overall, COVID-19 patients had higher levels of immune activation, exhaustion, and regulatory cells compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Within the COVID-19 group, activated and senescent cells were higher in adults than in children and inversely correlated with the nAbs levels. Conversely, Tregs and Bregs regulatory cells were higher in COVID-19 children compared to adults and positively correlated with nAbs. Higher immune activation still persisted in adults after 6 months of infection, while children maintained higher levels of regulatory cells. SARS-CoV-2 levels did not differ among age classes. CONCLUSIONS: Adults displayed higher immune activation and lower production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs than children. The different immune response was not related to different viral load. The higher expression of regulatory cells in children may contribute to reduce the immune activation, thus leading to a greater specific response against the virus.","Petrara, Maria Raffaella; Bonfante, Francesco; Costenaro, Paola; Cantarutti, Anna; Carmona, Francesco; Ruffoni, Elena; Di Chiara, Costanza; Zanchetta, Marisa; Barzon, Luisa; Donà, Daniele; Da Dalt, Liviana; Bortolami, Alessio; Pagliari, Matteo; Plebani, Mario; Rossi, Paolo; Cotugno, Nicola; Palma, Paolo; Giaquinto, Carlo; De Rossi, Anita",Front Immunol,35,17

This is crucial in the central nervous system to maintain neuroimmune homeostasis. IL-8 a chemoattractant, which recruits neutrophils, T cells, and basophils into the brain in response to inflammation and/or injury is secreted predominantly by neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which astrocytes regulate IL-8 expression. We demonstrate that while β-catenin negatively regulated IL-8 transcription, its canonical transcriptional partners, members of the TCF/LEF transcription factors (TCF1, TCF3, TCF4 and LEF1) and Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) positively regulated IL-8 transcription. We further identified a putative TCF/LEF binding site at -175nt close to the minimal transcription region on the IL-8 promoter, mutation of which caused a significant reduction in IL-8 promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated binding of TCF1, TCF4, LEF1 and ATF2 on the IL-8 promoter suggesting that TCFs/LEF partner with ATF2 to induce IL-8 transcription. These findings demonstrate a novel role for β-catenin in suppression of IL-8 expression and for TCFs/LEF/ATF2 in inducing IL-8. These findings reveal a unique mechanism by which astrocytes tightly regulate IL-8 expression.","Robinson, KaReisha F; Narasipura, Srinivas D; Wallace, Jennillee; Ritz, Ethan M; Al-Harthi, Lena",Cytokine,35,1

When MTX cannot be used, other conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) can be proposed. We aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of MTX and non-MTX csDMARDs in combination with advanced therapies. METHODS We systematically searched the literature for studies comparing the effectiveness, retention rate and safety of MTX versus non-MTX csDMARDs (leflunomide or others) in combination with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, and JAK inhibitors (JAKi). Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan using an inverse variance approach with fixed or random effects models. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS The literature search revealed 3842 articles; 41 studies were included for the systematic literature review and 21 for the meta-analysis: 13 were of TNFi, 3 of abatacept, 5 of rituximab. For TNFi, EULAR response at 6 months was lower for patients receiving non-MTX csDMARDs than MTX (RR=0.93 [95% CI 0.87;1.0], p=0.04, n=3843, I2 =28%), with lower retention rate at 12 months. For abatacept, effectiveness and safety were similar between the 2 groups. For rituximab, good EULAR response was higher with leflunomide than MTX (RR=1.38 [95% CI 1.13;1.68], p=0.001, n=2078, I2 =0%), with similar adverse event rates. Meta-analysis for tocilizumab or JAKi could not be performed. CONCLUSION The different csDMARDs seem safe and efficient to combine with advanced therapies in RA patients. Although MTX seems slightly superior to other csDMARDs in combination with TNFi, leflunomide might be superior to MTX in combination with rituximab.","Decarriere, Guillaume; Barnetche, Thomas; Combe, Bernard; Gaujoux-Viala, Cécile; Lukas, Cédric; Morel, Jacques; Daien, Claire",Arthritis care & research,35,1

Our purpose in this report is to collect, summarize, and articulate all essential information about antiviral drugs that may or may not be efficient for treating COVID-19. Clinical evidence about these drugs and their possible mechanisms of action are also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS To conduct a comprehensive review, different keywords in various databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar, were searched relevant articles, especially the most recent ones, were selected and studied. These selected original research articles, review papers, systematic reviews, and even letters to the editors were then carefully reviewed for data collection. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of the coronavirus family, and there are still no promising therapies or particular antiviral compounds to fight it. After entering the body, SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the cells by attaching to specific lung cell receptors, called angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Then, by employing cell division machinery, it replicates through a complex mechanism and spreads throughout the patient's body. Various antiviral drugs, including anti-influenza/HIV/HCV drugs, have been applied for treating COVID-19 patients. Due to the similarity of the structure and transcriptional mechanism of COVID-19 to a number of viruses, some of the listed drugs have been beneficial against SARS-CoV-2. However, the effectiveness of others is in an aura of ambiguity and doubt. CONCLUSIONS Some of the antiviral medications listed and discussed in this article have been effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients or preventing the virus from spreading further. However, other drugs have to be investigated to reach a reliable conclusion about their effectiveness or ineffectiveness.","Rommasi, F; Nasiri, M J; Mirsaiedi, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,35,1

Through a literature review and the perspective of members of a national TB Think Tank task team, we describe the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on TB patients and services as well as the potential long-term setback to TB control in South Africa (SA). Strategies to mitigate risk and impact are explored, together with opportunities to leverage synergies from both diseases to the benefit of the National TB Programme (NTP). With the emergence of COVID-19, activities to address this new pandemic have been prioritised across all sectors. Within the health system, the health workforce and resources have been redirected away from routine services towards the new disease priority. The social determinants of health have deteriorated during the lockdown, potentially increasing progression to TB disease and impacting negatively on people with TB and their households, resulting in additional barriers to accessing TB care, with early reports of a decline in TB testing rates. Fewer TB diagnoses, less attention to adherence and support during TB treatment, poorer treatment outcomes and consequent increased transmission will increase the TB burden and TB-related mortality. People with TB or a history of TB are likely to be vulnerable to COVID-19. Modifications to current treatment practices are suggested to reduce visits to health facilities and minimise the risks of COVID-19 exposure. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to negatively impact on TB control in TB-endemic settings such as SA. However, there are COVID-19-related health systems-strengthening developments that may help the NTP mitigate the impact of the pandemic on TB control. By integrating TB case finding into the advanced screening, testing, tracing and monitoring systems established for COVID-19, TB case finding and linkage to care could increase, with many more TB patients starting treatment. Similarly, integrating knowledge and awareness of TB into the increased healthcare worker and community education on infectious respiratory diseases, behavioural practices around infection prevention and control, and cough etiquette, including destigmatisation of mask use, may contribute to reducing TB transmission. However, these potential gains could be overwhelmed by the impact of increasing poverty and other social determinants of health on the burden of TB.","Loveday, M; Cox, H; Evans, D; Furin, J; Ndjeka, N; Osman, M; Naidoo For The National Tb Think Tank 'Optimising Tb Treatment Outcomes' Task Team, K",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,35,16

Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries, which are still struggling to eradicate wild poliovirus. All vaccination campaigns in Pakistan were suspended in April due to the COVID-19 outbreak, leading 40 million children to miss out on polio vaccination. Like the climate crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic could be regarded as a child-rights crisis because it could have life-threatening impact over children, who need immunization, now and in the long-term. Delays in polio vaccination programs might not have immediate impact but, in the long-term, the increase in polio cases in Pakistan could result in the global export of infections. Therefore, healthcare authorities must intensify their efforts to track and vaccinate unvaccinated children in countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan. Polio vaccination campaigns need to resume immediately, so we suggest applying social distancing measures along with standard operating procedure to flatten the transmission curve of COVID-19.

A regular pathobiological hallmark of CP is oligodendrocyte maturation impairment resulting in white matter (WM) injury and reduced axonal myelination. Regeneration therapies based on cell replacement are currently limited, but neural precursor cells (NPCs), as cellular support for myelination, represent a promising regeneration strategy to treat CP, although the transplantation parameters (e.g., timing, dosage, mechanism) remain to be determined. We optimized a hemiplegic mouse model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia that mirrors the pathobiological hallmarks of CP and transplanted NPCs into the corpus callosum (CC), a major white matter structure impacted in CP patients. The NPCs survived, engrafted, and differentiated morphologically in male and female mice. Histology and MRI showed repair of lesioned structures. Furthermore, electrophysiology revealed functional myelination of the CC (e.g., restoration of conduction velocity), while cylinder and CatWalk tests demonstrated motor recovery of the affected forelimb. Endogenous oligodendrocytes, recruited in the CC following transplantation of exogenous NPCs, are the principal actors in this recovery process. The lack of differentiation of the transplanted NPCs is consistent with enhanced recovery due to an indirect mechanism, such as a trophic and/or ""bio-bridge"" support mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes. Our work establishes that transplantation of NPCs represents a viable therapeutic strategy for CP treatment, and that the enhanced recovery is mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes. This will further our understanding and contribute to the improvement of cellular therapeutic strategies.","Rumajogee, Prakasham; Altamentova, Svetlana; Li, Lijun; Li, Junyi; Wang, Jian; Kuurstra, Alan; Khazaei, Mohamad; Beldick, Stephanie; Menon, Ravi S; van der Kooy, Derek; Fehlings, Michael G",eNeuro,35,1

The aim of the study was to evaluate perioperative complications and the safety of STB in a tertiary care university hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Intra- and postoperative complications were retrospectively recorded and associations based on the evaluation of clinical and laboratory parameters were studied using regression analyses. RESULTS A total of 562 patients were included. Early tracheotomy shortened ventilation time after tracheotomy (ventilation before STB ≤ 5 days: mean 9.2 ± 9.1 days; ventilation before STB ≥ 6 days: mean 11.5 ± 10.5 days, p = 0.0001). Overall complications were found in 30/562 cases (5.3%), major complications in 12/562 cases (2.1%). Significant risk factors for overall tracheotomy related complications were higher body mass index (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.07, p = 0.02), lower CRP (OR 0.99, CI 0.99-1.00, p = 0.03), higher INR (OR 5.67, CI 1.27-25.34, p = 0.02), longer duration of operation (OR 1.03, CI 1.00-1.06, p = 0.04) and tracheotomy during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support (OR 6.26, CI 1.21-32.44, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION STB represents a safe surgical procedure, also suitable for patients with an increased risk profile. Careful evaluation of individual risk factors should be favored to reduce procedure related complications.","Riekert, Maximilian; Kreppel, Matthias; Schminke, Philipp; Weckx, Annelies; Zöller, Joachim E; Schick, Volker C",Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery,35,16

While didactic courses moved online, laboratory courses were not amenable to this shift. In particular, assessment of clinical skills courses through common methods including objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) became inadvisable. This article describes decisions made for first-, second-, and third-year veterinary students (n = 368) with respect to clinical skills at one US college. This includes the remote completion of a surgical skills curriculum using instructional videos and models and the delaying of laboratory sessions deemed impossible to deliver remotely. First- and third-year students were subsequently assessed using modified remote OSCEs. Second-year students were assessed using the standard surgical skills examination, video-recorded. All first- and third-year students successfully passed their OSCE upon either first attempt or remediation. Two second-year students failed their remediation examination and were offered additional faculty tutoring and another remediation attempt at the start of the fall semester. The remediation rate on the surgical skills examination was not different from that of previous years. One incident of suspected academic dishonesty occurred in the first-year OSCE. Students learned surgical skills successfully at home by practicing on models and receiving feedback of their skills on video recordings. While disappointing, one case of academic dishonesty among the 368 total students tested was not surprising. Remote assessment using modified OSCEs and surgical skills exams appears feasible and fair when in-person testing is not possible.","Hunt, Julie A; Anderson, Stacy L",Journal of veterinary medical education,35,1

Methods Agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) from cats with FIP and healthy cats recorded in the periods 2004-2009 and 2013-2014 were retrospectively analysed. Relative and absolute values of each electrophoretic fraction were recorded and the number of cats showing single or combined electrophoretic changes consistent with FIP (hypoalbuminaemia, inverted albumin to globulin [A:G] ratio, increased total protein, total globulin, alpha [α]2-globulin and gamma [γ]-globulin concentration) were counted. Additionally, a visual analysis of electrophoretograms was also performed. Results for the two time periods were statistically compared. Results The details of 91 AGE procedures (41 from cats with FIP and 50 from healthy cats) and 45 CZE procedures (26 from cats with FIP and 19 from healthy cats) were obtained from the database. No significant differences between the two time periods were found both in FIP and in healthy cats analysed with CZE and in healthy cats analysed with AGE. Compared with 2004-2009, cats with FIP sampled in 2013-2014 with AGE showed a significantly lower concentration of total protein, γ-globulins and total globulins, and a significantly higher A:G ratio and percentage of albumin and α2-globulins. Using both AGE and CZE, in recent years the proportion of cats with high α2-globulins without gammopathy and the proportion of cats with gammopathy alone decreased. With a visual approach, the number of patterns considered as dubious increased in the second period with AGE (non-statistically significant). Conclusions and relevance The frequency of electrophoretic abnormalities in cats with FIP decreased in recent years, independently of the technique employed. Although the mechanism responsible for this change was not investigated in this study, this altered frequency may decrease the diagnostic accuracy of serum protein electrophoresis for FIP.","Stranieri, Angelica; Giordano, Alessia; Bo, Stefano; Braghiroli, Chiara; Paltrinieri, Saverio",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,35,31

Such outcomes include low mood, suicide, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Studies have mostly looked at the mental health of general citizens, healthcare workers, or infected survivors, with limited research targeting university students. This study aimed to understand the psychological distress experienced by self-quarantined undergraduate university students in Lebanon during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS Undergraduate students enrolled at the American University of Beirut were invited to participate in a 47-item online questionnaire. 73 participants completed the questionnaire. Demographic data, data about COVID-19 exposure, stressors during quarantine, understanding the rationale, compliance, and difficulties associated with quarantine, and levels of psychological distress were analysed. RESULTS 75.3% of the participants were considered as having a high risk of developing acute stress. Undergoing quarantine for more than 14 days, having a chronic medical illness, inadequate access to supplies, and fear of infection were all significantly associated with an increased risk of acute stress. CONCLUSION Despite being a necessary preventive measure during infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine can be associated with negative psychological effects, particularly in undergraduate students. Providing preventive and effective interventions is of utmost necessity.KEY POINTSDuring COVID-19, three-quarter of students had high risk for acute stress.Females had higher odds of high-risk acute stress compared to males.Having a chronic medical condition was associated with high risk acute stress.Long quarantine and lack of supplies were associated with high risk acute stress.Providing interventions to protect the mental health of students is necessary.","Kassir, Ghida; El Hayek, Samer; Zalzale, Hussein; Orsolini, Laura; Bizri, Maya",International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,35,1

A total of 119 articles published between 1968 and 2020 have been reviewed, using scientific search engines such as ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Twenty-seven medicinal plant species that belong to eighteen families are documented along with their botanical sources, potential active constituents, and in vitro and in vivo activities against various cancer cells. The review is compiled and discusses the potential anticancer, antiproliferative, and cytotoxic agents based on the types of secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, steroids, and lignans. Among the anticancer secondary metabolites reported in this review, only few have been isolated from plants that are originated and collected in Ethiopia, and the majority of compounds are reported from plants belonging to different areas of the world. Thus, based on the available bioactivity reports, extensive and more elaborate ethnopharmacology-based bioassay-guided studies have to be conducted on selected traditionally claimed Ethiopian anticancer plants, which inherited from a unique and diverse landscape, with the aim of opening a way forward to conduct anticancer drug discovery program.","Tesfaye, Solomon; Asres, Kaleab; Lulekal, Ermias; Alebachew, Yonatan; Tewelde, Eyael; Kumarihamy, Mallika; Muhammad, Ilias",Molecules,35,7

For vulnerable groups of CYP, who already experience poorer health and well-being, these impacts are amplified. Challenges include reduced access to usual services, reduced community supports, financial instability, unemployment and other life circumstances that threaten to widen pre-existing inequities. This article aims to present the reasons for vulnerability of CYP during the pandemic, and to focus on actions by health professionals that mitigate additional challenges to their health and well-being. Using a rapid review of the literature and team-based discussions, eight vulnerable groups were identified: CYP with disabilities, mental health conditions and chronic diseases; CYP facing financial hardship; within the child protection system; Aboriginal; migrant and refugee; in residential care; rural; and isolated CYP. Recommendations for action are required at the level of governments, health professionals and researchers and include enhancing access to health and social supports, prioritising vulnerable CYP in resuming health activity and elevating the voice of CYP in designing the response. The pandemic can be conceptualised as an opportunity to create a more equitable society as we document the inequities that have been exacerbated. Vulnerable groups of CYP must be recognised and heard, and targeted actions must focus on improving their health outcomes during the pandemic and beyond.","Jones, Benjamin; Woolfenden, Susan; Pengilly, Sandra; Breen, Christie; Cohn, Richard; Biviano, Lyn; Johns, Adam; Worth, Andrea; Lamb, Robyn; Lingam, Raghu; Silove, Natalie; Marks, Susan; Tzioumi, Dimitra; Zwi, Karen",Journal of paediatrics and child health,35,31

Difficulty, safety, and accuracy of LAG were compared between patients with PIS and with no previous intra-abdominal surgery. An independent group of 11 cases with open remnant gastrectomy (ORG) was used for comparing with LARG. RESULTS No significant difference was observed in conversion rate, intraoperative complication, operation time, blood loss, dissected lymph nodes, postoperative complications and hospital stay between PIS, and no PIS. There was no significant difference in operative time, dissected lymph nodes, and postoperative complications between LARG and ORG. Blood loss was lesser and postoperative hospital stay was shorter in LARG than in ORG.

Globally, perceptions and experiences of best practice vary due to the limited evidence in this area. AIM To identify, appraise and synthesise the latest evidence around terminal withdrawal of mechanical ventilation in adult intensive care units specific to perceptions, experiences and practices. DESIGN Mixed methods systematic review and narrative synthesis. A review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018086495). DATA SOURCES Four electronic databases were systematically searched (Medline, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL). Obtained articles published between January 2008 and January 2020 were screened for eligibility. All included papers were appraised using relevant appraisal tools. RESULTS Twenty-five papers were included in the review. Findings from the included papers were synthesised into four themes: 'clinicians' perceptions and practices'; 'time to death and predictors'; 'analgesia and sedation practices'; 'physiological and psychological impact'. CONCLUSIONS Perceptions, experiences and practices of terminal withdrawal of mechanical ventilation vary significantly across the globe. Current knowledge highlights that the time to death after withdrawal of mechanical ventilation is very short. Predictors for shorter duration could be considered by clinicians and guide the choice of pharmacological interventions to address distressing symptoms that patients may experience. Clinicians ought to prepare patients, families and relatives for the withdrawal process and the expected progression and provide them with immediate and long-term support following withdrawal. Further research is needed to improve current evidence and better inform practice guidelines.","Efstathiou, Nikolaos; Vanderspank-Wright, Brandi; Vandyk, Amanda; Al-Janabi, Mustafa; Daham, Zeinab; Sarti, Aimee; Delaney, Jesse W; Downar, James",Palliative medicine,35,20

For those patients who are ready to embrace nutrition as an essential part of the healing process, however, it is oftentimes difficult to find healthy menus at hospitals. Meat-based entrées, sugar-sweetened beverages and candy appear to be omnipresent in cafeterias and restaurants at U.S. hospitals. On the other hand, healthy plant-based menus are still the exception rather than the rule. Some states undertook considerable efforts to change this and made plant-based meals the law. Upon request by a patient, hospitals in New York are now required by law to provide plant-based options at every meal. This recent development triggered a controversial discussion within the medical community whether other states should follow this example and make plant-based hospital menus the law as well. This editorial illuminates why mandatory plant-based hospital menus could be a win-win situation for many involved stakeholders, including patients, hospitals and food services. This step is not a loss-marking venture for hospitals but rather a chance to save money and to improve corporate brand marketing at the same time. The introduction of mandatory plant-based menus in hospitals at a large scale represents a unique opportunity at the nexus of health, innovative corporate strategies and economics. Adequate framework conditions are necessary to ensure that all individuals can make healthy and affordable dietary choices while being hospitalized.","Storz, Maximilian Andreas",Hospital practice,35,1

When close others misbehave, it generates a powerful conflict between observers' moral values and their cherished relationships. Previous research has almost exclusively studied moral perception in a social vacuum by investigating responses to the transgressions of strangers; therefore, little is known about how these responses unfold in the context of intimate bonds. Here we systematically examine the impact of having a close relationship with a transgressor on perceptions of that transgressor, the relationship, and the self. We predicted less negative emotional and evaluative responses to transgressors and smaller consequences for the relationship, yet more negative emotional and evaluative responses to the self when close others, compared with strangers or acquaintances, transgress. Participants read hypothetical wrongdoings (Study 1), recalled unethical events (Study 2), reported daily transgressions (Study 3; preregistered), and learned of novel immoral behavior (Study 4) committed by close others or comparison groups. Participants reported less other-critical emotions, more lenient moral evaluations, a reduced desire to punish/criticize, and a smaller impact on the relationship (compared with acquaintances) when close others versus strangers or acquaintances transgressed. Simultaneously, participants reported more self-conscious emotions and showed some evidence of harsher moral self-evaluations when close others transgressed. Underlying mechanisms of this process were examined. Our findings demonstrate the deep ambivalence in reacting to close others' unethical behaviors, revealing a surprising irony-in protecting close others, the self may bear some of the burden of their misbehavior.

Aim of this work is to evaluate the incidence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection on the postoperative outcome of patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS Between January 2008 and December 2013, 184 patients (65 males, 119 females), mean age 35.8 ± 5.7 years, affected with morbid obesity, mean BMI 46.6 ± 6.7, underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. All the specimens at the end of the operation were analysed by the same pathologist. Histological grading was based on the Sidney classification. RESULTS Seventy-two of the patients (39.1%) were HP positive, while 112 (60.9%) were negative. No significant differences were observed between the HP+ and HP- group in terms of age, sex, weight, BMI, incidence of comorbidities and duration of follow-up. All the operations were completed via laparoscopic approach. No mortality was observed. Postoperative complications occurred in 5 patients (2.7%): three leaks (1.6%), all in the HP- group and two bleedings (1.1%), one in the HP+ and one in the HP- group. In two cases a reintervention was necessary. No significant differences were observed in the morbidity rates between the two groups.

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were left intact (sham) or ovariectomized (OVX) and implanted with pumps delivering vehicle or E2 (0.5 mg/kg/day). Two weeks following surgery, the rats were exposed to room air (RA) or CIH for 7 days (10% O2, 10 cycles/hour, 8 hours/day). Lung samples were used to measure the activities of pro- (NADPH and xanthine oxidases) and antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) enzymes, and concentrations of advanced oxidation of protein products (AOPP). We determined gene expression with an RNA microarray and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes. In rats exposed to RA, OVX and E2 supplementation increased pro- and antioxidant activities and AOPP concentration. In rats exposed to CIH, AOPP pro- and antoxidant enzymes activities increased in sham, did not changed in OVX-Veh rats, and were reduced in OVX-E2 rats. In rats exposed to RA, genes involved in extracellular matrix were up-regulated by OVX and down-regulated by E2, while E2 up-regulated genes involved in cell mobility/adherence and leukocytes migration. OVX downregulated expression of roughly 200 olfactory receptor genes without effect of E2. CIH altered gene expression in sham and OVX-E2, but not in OVX-Veh rats.

METHODS The Teen Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study (NCT00474318) prospectively collected data on 242 adolescents undergoing MBS at 5 centers over a 3-year follow-up. Joint pain and physical function outcomes were assessed by using the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life - Kids, and the Short Form 36 Health Survey. Adolescents with Blount disease (n = 9) were excluded. RESULTS Prevalent musculoskeletal and LE pain were reduced by 40% within 12 months and persisted over 3 years. Adjusted models revealed a 6% lower odds of having musculoskeletal pain (odds ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.99) and a 10% lower odds of having LE pain (odds ratio = 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.86-0.95) per 10% reduction of BMI. The prevalence of poor physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score >0) declined from 49% to <20% at 6 months (P < .05), Physical comfort and the physical component scores, measured by the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life - Kids and the Short Form 36 Health Survey, improved at 6 months postsurgery and beyond (P < .01). Poor physical function predicted persistent joint pain after MBS. CONCLUSIONS Joint pain, impaired physical function, and impaired health-related quality of life significantly improve after MBS. These benefits in patient-reported outcomes support the use of MBS in adolescents with severe obesity and musculoskeletal pain and suggest that MBS in adolescence may reverse and reduce multiple risk factors for future joint disease.","Bout-Tabaku, Sharon; Gupta, Resmi; Jenkins, Todd M; Ryder, Justin R; Baughcum, Amy E; Jackson, Rebecca D; Inge, Thomas H; Dixon, John B; Helmrath, Michael A; Courcoulas, Anita P; Mitchell, James E; Harmon, Carroll M; Xie, Changchun; Michalsky, Marc P",Pediatrics,35,5

It can lead to activity limitations and participation restrictions that may include lost duty or work days. The objective of this systematic review is to determine which interventions are most effective in decreasing dizziness or vertigo and neck pain in military-aged adults with traumatic cervicogenic dizziness. METHODS The literature will be systematically searched using the following online databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, Cochrane Methodology Register), CINAHL, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and J-STAGE. The review will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster RCTs and controlled (non-randomized) clinical trials or cluster trials, and observational studies (including prospective and retrospective comparative cohort and case-control or nested case-control studies) and determine the effectiveness of physical therapy interventions for the treatment of traumatic cervicogenic dizziness in military-aged adults. Assessment of methodological quality will be performed by two independent, blinded reviewers using the PEDro scale. The level of evidence will be determined using the GRADE scale. The primary outcome measures will be change in dizziness and neck pain and disability from baseline to the last available follow-up, measured using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and Neck Disability Index. Other relevant outcome measures will include self-reported change in symptoms, time to return to duty or work, and quality of life. DISCUSSION This systematic review will identify, evaluate, and integrate the evidence on the effectiveness of physical therapy interventions for cervicogenic dizziness in a military-aged population. We anticipate our findings may inform individual treatment and future research. Clinical recommendations generated from this systematic review may inform military physical therapy treatment of individuals with cervicogenic dizziness.

RECENT FINDINGS Large contemporary data base studies show that preoperative thrombocytopenia is present in about 8% of asymptomatic patients, and is associated with increased risks for bleeding and 30-day mortality. Traditionally specific threshold platelet counts were recommended for specific procedures. However, the risk of bleeding may not correlate well with platelet counts and varies with platelet function depending on the underlying etiology. Evidence to support prophylactic platelet transfusion is limited and refractoriness to platelet transfusion is common. A number of options exist to optimize platelet counts prior to procedures, which include steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, and monoclonal antibodies. In addition, intraoperative alternatives and adjuncts to transfusion should be considered. It appears reasonable to use prophylactic desmopressin and antifibrinolytic agents, whereas activated recombinant factor VII could be considered in severe bleeding. Other options include enhancing thrombin generation with prothrombin complex concentrate or increasing fibrinogen levels with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate. SUMMARY Given the lack of good quality evidence, much research remains to be done. However, with a multidisciplinary multimodal perioperative strategy, the risk of bleeding can be decreased effectively.","Lombard, Frederick W; Popescu, Wanda M; Oprea, Adriana D; Kertai, Miklos D",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,35,16

OBJECTIVE To measure the inspiratory pressure in mechanically ventilated patients suitable for weaning to determine the point at which the P(Imax) is achieved within 60 seconds of observation, and analyze factors associated with P(Imax) values. METHODS Measurement of P(Imax) was accomplished with a digital vacuometer with a unidirectional valve, which allows only exhalation (P(ImaxUV)). With this technique, values are registered and stored, remaining accessible whenever necessary. All patients were on mechanical ventilation, and met the criteria recommended by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society in 2007 to undergo weaning trial. RESULTS Eighty-four from the 87 enrolled patients completed the test. No patients reached the P(ImaxUV) in the first 20 seconds of observation. P(ImaxUV) was achieved between 20.1 and 40 seconds in 12 patients (14.0%), and between 40.1 and 60 seconds in 72 cases (86.0%). In a multivariate analysis model in which age, sex, days of mechanical ventilation, APACHE score, and respiratory drive (measured as airway-occlusion pressure 0.1 s after the start of inspiratory flow [P(0.1)]) were included, only age (P = .006) and P(0.1) (P = .003) were significantly associated with the values of P(ImaxUV). CONCLUSIONS Within an observation period of 60 seconds, the majority of patients reached the maximal inspiratory peak between 40.1 and 60 seconds. Older patients were found to have lower P(ImaxUV) values, whereas higher values for P(0.1) strongly correlated with higher P(ImaxUV) values. These findings are potentially useful to improve successful weaning prediction in the future, but further studies are needed to better clarify this issue.","de Souza, Leonardo Cordeiro; da Silva, Cyro Teixeira; Lugon, Jocemir Ronaldo",Respiratory care,35,2

METHODS A structured 27-item online survey was sent via social media messaging to obstetricians and pediatricians from public, academic, and private sectors in Jordan between March 23-30, 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to represent numbers and percentages of participants' responses to survey items. RESULTS A total of 147 physicians participated (107 obstetricians, 40 pediatricians). Participants were well informed about the symptoms, diagnosis, modes of transmission, and methods of prevention. Participants had variable perceptions about COVID-19 risk during pregnancy, including potential vertical transmission, preferred route of delivery, and safety of breastfeeding. Most participants felt that pregnant women should be prioritized for testing and medical care provision. CONCLUSION While evidence-based strategies to reduce the risks of COVID-19 in pregnant women and newborns are evolving, healthcare providers showed excellent knowledge of the infection and were vigilant regarding its complications for mothers and newborns. To ensure safe pregnancy, physicians must keep informed of developing guidance on best and safest prenatal and perinatal health services.

Paradoxically, the need for health professionals has increased. Online methods are being widely used, but its efficacy is rarely measured. Objectives This study was conducted to find the efficacy of an online course in developing competency among medical students to prescribe balanced diet. Methods An online module was hosted at https://drzinia.moodlecloud.com/. A noninferiority trial was conducted among voluntary participants of the third MBBS students, in 2019. Stratified block randomization was done, so that ten students were allocated to the intervention arm of online sessions and ten students were allocated to the control arm of classroom sessions. Pretest assessments, seven assessments related to sessions conducted, and a postassessment were done. Generalized estimating equations were done to adjust for the effects of other confounders and see whether the intervention was a significant determinant of ability to prescribe balanced diet. Results Baseline variables were comparable in the two groups. The pretest scores were not significantly different in the two groups. The mean total marks scored by the online group (47.33/70) was not significantly different (t=0.68; p=0.50) from that of the class room group (45.70/70). The posttest scores were significantly higher than the pretest scores. Ninety-percent of students in the online course agreed that they could effectively learn through an online course. Conclusion Online teaching is effective to learn the prescription of balanced diet.

At the stage when the spread of the epidemic is not completely controlled, the business activities will surely cause employees to worry and produce a work stress reaction. OBJECTIVE This study explores the impact of psychosocial stress caused by the COVID-19 epidemic on the work stress of returned workers. Furthermore, we explore the boundary conditions for reducing work stress from the perspectives of perceived organizational support, perceived social support and epidemic awareness. METHODS Data were collected within two weeks after the Chinese government announced the work resumption of industrial enterprises. During this period, 526 returned workers participated in the study. RESULTS The results showed that the psychosocial stress caused by the epidemic had a positive impact on work stress. Both perceived organizational support and perceived that social support can alleviate the impact of psychosocial stress on work stress. The moderating effect of epidemic awareness was only established in non-severe epidemic areas.

Melatonin exhibits innate immunomodulation by communicating with immune system, and influencing neutrophils to fight infections and inflammation. However, sustaining redox homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in neutrophils are critical during chemotaxis, oxidative burst, phagocytosis, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation. Therefore, endogenous antioxidant glutathione (GSH) redox cycle is highly vital in regulating neutrophil functions. Reduced intracellular GSH levels and glutathione reductase (GR) activity in the neutrophils during clinical conditions like autoimmune disorders, neurological disorders, diabetes and microbial infections lead to dysfunctional neutrophils. Therefore, we hypothesized that redox modulators like melatonin can protect neutrophil health and functions under GSH and GR activity deficient conditions. We demonstrate the dual role of melatonin wherein, it protects neutrophils from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by reducing ROS generation, in contrast, it restores neutrophil functions like phagocytosis, degranulation and NETosis in GSH and GR activity deficient neutrophils by regulating ROS levels both in vitro and in vivo. Melatonin mitigates LPS-induced neutrophil dysfunctions by rejuvenating GSH redox system, specifically GR activity by acting as a parallel redox system. Our results indicate that melatonin could be a potential auxiliary therapy to treat immune dysfunction and microbial infections, including virus, under chronic disease conditions by restoring neutrophil functions. Further, melatonin could be a promising immune system booster to fight unprecedented pandemics like the current COVID-19. However, further studies are indispensable to address the clinical usage of melatonin.","NaveenKumar, Somanathapura K; Hemshekhar, Mahadevappa; Jagadish, Swamy; Manikanta, Kurnegala; Vishalakshi, Gopalapura J; Kemparaju, Kempaiah; Girish, Kesturu S",Journal of pineal research,35,1

These effects and the established safety of DF present DF as a strong candidate to treat viral and post-infectious syndromes involving endothelial dysfunction. AREAS COVERED We discuss DF and other therapeutic agents that have the potential to target endothelial components of pathogenesis in viral and post-infectious syndromes. We introduce defibrotide (DF), describe its mechanisms of action, and explore its established pleiotropic effects on the endothelium. We describe the established pathophysiology of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and highlight the processes specific to COVID-19 potentially modulated by DF. We also present influenza A and viral hemorrhagic fevers, especially those caused by hantavirus, Ebola virus, and dengue virus, as viral syndromes in which DF might serve therapeutic benefit. Finally, we offer our opinion on novel treatment strategies targeting endothelial dysfunction in viral infections and their severe manifestations. EXPERT OPINION Given the critical role of endothelial dysfunction in numerous infectious syndromes, in particular COVID-19, therapeutic pharmacology for these conditions should increasingly prioritize endothelial stabilization.

Extended follow-up after the scheduled closure of the trial allows detection of both persistent or enhanced beneficial effects following cessation of study treatment (i.e. a legacy effect) and the emergence of possible adverse effects (e.g. development of cancer). METHODS A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines to qualitatively compare post-trial follow-up methods used in large randomised controlled trials. Five bibliographic databases, including Medline and the Cochrane Library, and one trial registry were searched. All large randomised controlled trials (more than 1000 adult participants) published from March 2006 to April 2017 were evaluated. Two reviewers screened and extracted data attaining > 95% concordance of papers checked. Assessment of bias in the trials was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS Fifty-seven thousand three hundred and fifty-two papers were identified and 65 trials which had post-trial follow-up (PTFU) were included in the analysis. The majority of trials used more than one type of follow-up. There was no evidence of an association between the retention rates of participants in the PTFU period and the type of follow-up used. Costs of PTFU varied widely with data linkage being the most economical. It was not possible to assess associations between risk of bias during the in-trial period and proportions lost to follow-up during the PTFU period.

Given the robust behavioral association between DRD and addictive behavior, there is an expanding literature investigating the differences in the functional and structural correlates of DRD in the brain between addicted and healthy individuals. However, there has yet to be a systematic review which characterizes differences in regional brain activation, functional connectivity, and structure and places them in the larger context of the DRD literature. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize and critically appraise the existing literature examining differences between addicted and healthy individuals in the neural correlates of DRD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS A systematic search strategy will be implemented that uses Boolean search terms in PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO, as well as manual search methods, to identify the studies comprehensively. This review will include studies using MRI or fMRI in humans to directly compare brain activation, functional connectivity, or structure in relation to DRD between addicted and healthy individuals or continuously assess addiction severity in the context of DRD. Two independent reviewers will determine studies that meet the inclusion criteria for this review, extract data from included studies, and assess the quality of included studies using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Then, narrative review will be used to explicate the differences in structural and functional correlates of DRD implicated by the literature and assess the strength of evidence for this conclusion. DISCUSSION This review will provide a needed critical exegesis of the MRI studies that have been conducted investigating brain differences in addictive behavior in relation to healthy samples in the context of DRD.

We have determined the impact of three flow rates on the work of breathing (WOB) assessed by transcutaneous diaphragm electromyography (EMG) amplitude in infants with respiratory distress or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Flow rates of 4, 6 and 8 L/min were delivered in random order. The mean amplitude of the EMG trace and mean area under the EMG curve (AEMGC) were calculated and the occurrence of bradycardias and desaturations recorded. Eighteen infants were studied with a median gestational age of 27.8 (range 23.9-33.5) weeks and postnatal age of 54 (range 3-122) days. The median flow rate prior to the study was 5 (range 3-8) L/min and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was 0.29 (range 0.21-0.50). There were no significant differences between the mean amplitude of the diaphragm EMG and the AEGMC and the number of bradycardias or desaturations between the three flow rates.Conclusions: In infants with respiratory distress or BPD, there was no advantage of using high (8 L/min) compared with lower flow rates (4 or 6 L/min) during support by HHHFNC. What is known: • Humidified high flow nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) is increasingly being used as a non-invasive form of respiratory support for prematurely born infants. • There is a paucity of evidence regarding the optimum flow rate with 1 to 8 L/min being used. What is new: • We have assessed the work of breathing using the amplitude of the electromyogram of the diaphragm at three HHHFNC flow rates in infants with respiratory distress or BPD. • No significant differences were found in the EMG amplitude results or the numbers of bradycardias or desaturations at 4, 6 and 8 L/min.","Jeffreys, Eleanor; Hunt, Katie A; Dassios, Theodore; Greenough, Anne",European journal of pediatrics,35,1

Methods We conducted a retrospective observational trial, collecting data from patients who underwent laparoscopic repair of a primary abdominal wall or an incisional hernia using the laparoscopic Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh technique and a single mesh type, i.e., a composite polyester mesh with a hydrophilic film (Parietex CompositeTM mesh - Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN - USA). All patients signed an informed consent. Results One thousand seven hundred seventy-seven patients were enrolled. The median surgery time was 50 minutes and the median length of hospital stay was 2 days. Intraoperative complications occurred in 12 patients (0.7%), while early postoperative surgical complications occurred in 115 (6.5%); during follow-up, bulging mesh was diagnosed in 4.5% of cases and hernia recurred in 4.3% of patients. An overlap equal or greater than 4 cm resulted as a significant protective factor, while the use of absorbable fixing devices was a risk factor for recurrence (odds ration: 9.06, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval: 4.19 - 19.57). Conclusions Minimally invasive treatment of primary and postincisional abdominal wall hernias is a safe, effective, and reproducible procedure. An overlap equal or greater than 4 cm, the use of nonabsorbable fixing devices and a postoperative care and follow-up regime are crucial in order to obtain good results and low recurrence rates.","Olmi, Stefano; Millo, Paolo; Piccoli, Micaela; Garulli, Gianluca; Junior Nardi, Mario; Pecchini, Francesca; Oldani, Alberto; Pirrera, Basilio",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,35,1

METHODS Healthy pigs were randomized into three groups (standard therapy (ST) alone, ST+No-cell device, ST+SRBAL device) before placement of an implantable intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor and a tunneled central venous catheter. One week later, pigs received bolus infusion of the hepatotoxin D-galactosamine and were followed for up to 90h. RESULTS At 48h, all animals had developed encephalopathy and biochemical changes confirming ALF; extracorporeal treatment was initiated and pigs were observed up to 90h after drug infusion. Pigs treated with the SRBAL, loaded with porcine hepatocyte spheroids, had improved survival (83%, n=6) compared to ST alone (0%, n=6, p=0.003) and No-cell device therapy (17%, n=6, p=0.02). Ammonia detoxification, peak levels of serum ammonia and peak ICP, and pig survival were influenced by hepatocyte cell dose, membrane pore size and duration of SRBAL treatment. Hepatocyte spheroids remained highly functional with no decline in mean oxygen consumption from initiation to completion of treatment. CONCLUSIONS The SRBAL improved survival in an allogeneic model of drug-overdose ALF. Survival correlated with ammonia detoxification and ICP lowering indicating that hepatocyte spheroids prevented the cerebral manifestations of ALF (brain swelling, herniation, death).

METHODS Clinical data of 12 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Shantou Central Hospital from January 23 to February 5 in 2020 were retrospectively analyzed, including gender, age, symptoms, lab test and clinical outcomes, to analyze the change trend of blood Na+ level in the patients with COVID-19. RESULTS Among the 12 patients with COVID-19, there were 8 males and 4 females with the mean age of (38.0±16.3) years old, most of them were admitted to the hospital with cough and/or fever. All patients had a positive nucleic acid test for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and were discharged after clinical treatment with oxygen therapy, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and nutritional support. All patients were of ordinary type when they were admitted to the hospital. Among them, 1 patient turned into a severe case during the course of the disease, and 1 patient showed a tendency to become severe case. It was found that 10 patients without severe conversion had an average blood Na+ of (138.3±1.3) mmol/L at admission, and the lowest blood Na+ during the course of disease was (135.9±3.1) mmol/L. However, 2 patients who became severe and had a tendency to become severe disease (Na+ levels at admission were 140.0 mmol/L and 138.0 mmol/L, respectively) experienced hyponatremia during the course of the disease (the lowest blood Na+ levels were 129.0 mmol/L and 122.0 mmol/L). Further analysis showed that the lower serum Na+ level, the higher level of white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), but serum Na+ level was consistent with the change trend of lymphocytes, suggesting that hyponatremia was closely correlated with severe inflammation reaction. CONCLUSIONS Serum Na+ showed decreasing tendency during the development of COVID-19, and hyponatremia was closely related to the severity of COVID-19. It was necessary to pay great attention to the change trend of blood Na+ level. However, further research was needed to obtain more reliable conclusions and explorer the pathophysiological mechanisms.","Zhang, Weidai; Lu, Senrong; Zhang, Mianfeng; Zheng, Hongbin; Huang, Yuhan; Chen, Suzhi; Kang, Huizhong; Wu, Suwu",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,35,5

Few existing targeted medications are available. Lianhuaqingwen (LH) capsule, a repurposed marketed Chinese herb product, has been proven effective for influenza. PURPOSE To determine the safety and efficacy of LH capsule in patients with Covid-19. METHODS We did a prospective multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial on LH capsule in confirmed cases with Covid-19. Patients were randomized to receive usual treatment alone or in combination with LH capsules (4 capsules, thrice daily) for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of symptom (fever, fatigue, coughing) recovery. RESULTS We included 284 patients (142 each in treatment and control group) in the full-analysis set. The recovery rate was significantly higher in treatment group as compared with control group (91.5% vs. 82.4%, p = 0.022). The median time to symptom recovery was markedly shorter in treatment group (median: 7 vs. 10 days, p < 0.001). Time to recovery of fever (2 vs. 3 days), fatigue (3 vs. 6 days) and coughing (7 vs. 10 days) was also significantly shorter in treatment group (all p < 0.001). The rate of improvement in chest computed tomographic manifestations (83.8% vs. 64.1%, p < 0.001) and clinical cure (78.9% vs. 66.2%, p = 0.017) was also higher in treatment group. However, both groups did not differ in the rate of conversion to severe cases or viral assay findings (both p > 0.05). No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION In light of the safety and effectiveness profiles, LH capsules could be considered to ameliorate clinical symptoms of Covid-19.","Hu, Ke; Guan, Wei-Jie; Bi, Ying; Zhang, Wei; Li, Lanjuan; Zhang, Boli; Liu, Qingquan; Song, Yuanlin; Li, Xingwang; Duan, Zhongping; Zheng, Qingshan; Yang, Zifeng; Liang, Jingyi; Han, Mingfeng; Ruan, Lianguo; Wu, Chaomin; Zhang, Yunting; Jia, Zhen-Hua; Zhong, Nan-Shan",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,35,8

However, concerns have been raised by investigators in areas where gastric cancer is prevalent regarding the inaccessibility of the excluded stomach to regular surveillance. This study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility and short-term surgical outcomes of resectional RYGB. METHODS Sixteen consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass with distal gastric resection for the primary purpose of weight loss between January 2011 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The perioperative outcomes and weight loss results of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS All procedures were successfully performed laparoscopically. The mean length of the operation and the mean hospital stay were 170 min (range 110-225) and 4 days (range 2-7), respectively. The prevalence of early postoperative complications reached 18.7% after resectional RYGB, but a severe complication requiring reoperation occurred in only one patient (6.3%). The percent of excess weight loss was 78.9% over a mean follow-up period of 14 months. Obesity-related comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia resolved or improved after surgery in most patients. CONCLUSION Resectional RYGB is technically feasible and can be a viable option in countries with a high risk of gastric cancer, where surgeons are already well trained in laparoscopic gastrectomy.","Park, Ji Yeon; Kim, Yong Jin",Surgery today,35,27

The main reasons for that are the fact that AMI is rarely taken into consideration by the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, the time-consuming diagnostic process, and the lack of a standardized therapeutic concept. The present interdisciplinary review aims to increase awareness among physicians and to help improve clinical outcomes. Methods This clinical therapeutic review is based on author expertise as well as a selective literature survey in PubMed based on the term 'mesenteric ischemia', combined with the terms 'arterial', 'clinical presentation', 'diagnosis', 'therapy', 'surgery', and 'interventional radiology'. Based on these search results as well as on the guidelines of the German Society of Vascular Surgery, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association, we present an interdisciplinary treatment concept. Results AMI is a vascular emergency that can be successfully treated only within the first hours after the onset of symptoms. Computed tomography angiography is the diagnostic method of choice. Intensive care unit treatment can prevent the occurrence of multiple organ failure. Treatment primarily consists of the revascularization of the mesenteric arteries. Endovascular techniques should be given priority, whereas signs of peritonitis or a central arterial occlusion with high thrombus load primarily require a surgical approach in order to save time and increase patient safety. Additional bowel resections can play a significant role in the treatment of intestinal sepsis. Conclusion Prompt and goal-oriented diagnosis and consistent treatment of AMI within 4-6 h from the onset of symptoms can be decisive for the reduction of AMI-associated lethality. In order for this to happen, a standardized concept of emergency treatment needs to be implemented.","Luther, Bernd; Mamopoulos, Apostolos; Lehmann, Christian; Klar, Ernst",Visceral medicine,35,31

With an increase in the number of bariatric procedures performed in recent years, it is important to be cognizant of the frequency, presentation, and management of this complication. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the incidence and management of bleeding complications after gastric bypass surgery. METHODS A review of prospectively maintained bariatric surgery databases was conducted at 2 tertiary bariatric units. All patients who presented with gastrointestinal and intra-abdominal bleeding after gastric bypass during a 10-year period were identified, and their charts were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 4466 patients who underwent gastric bypass during the 10-year period had reliable morbidity data available and were included in the present study. Of the 4466 patients, 42 (.94%) experienced a bleeding complication postoperatively. Of these patients, 20 (47.6%) had undergone previous abdominal surgery. Bleeding occurred in the early postoperative period (<30 d) in 30 (71%); the etiology of which included bleeding from the staple lines, iatrogenic visceral injury, or mesenteric vessel bleeding. Early postoperative bleeding required operative intervention to achieve hemostasis in 43%. Late postoperative bleeding (n = 12) were usually secondary to marginal ulceration and warranted surgical intervention in 33.3%. Previously undiagnosed bleeding diatheses were identified in 14.3%. CONCLUSION Gastrointestinal bleeding after gastric bypass, although infrequent, is a difficult clinical scenario. Nonoperative management is feasible for hemodynamically stable patients. Surgical intervention is merited for patients with hemodynamic compromise, those who do not respond to transfusion, and those in whom the bleeding source cannot be adequately identified nonoperatively.","Heneghan, Helen M; Meron-Eldar, Shai; Yenumula, Panduranga; Rogula, Tomasz; Brethauer, Stacy A; Schauer, Philip R",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,35,16

Seventeen randomized-controlled trials were included with a total of 1,477 participants. Results indicated small effects of home-based training on muscle strength (between-study standardised-mean-difference [SMD] = 0.30), muscle power (SMD = 0.43), muscular endurance (SMD = 0.28), and balance (SMD = 0.28). We found no statistically significant effects for single-mode strength vs. multimodal training (e.g., combined balance, strength, and flexibility exercises) on measures of muscle strength and balance. Single-mode strength training had moderate effects on muscle strength (SMD = 0.51) and balance (SMD = 0.65) while multimodal training had no statistically significant effects on muscle strength and balance. Irrespective of the training type, >3 weekly sessions produced larger effects on muscle strength (SMD = 0.45) and balance (SMD = 0.37) compared with ≤3 weekly sessions (muscle strength: SMD = 0.28; balance: SMD = 0.24). For session-duration, only ≤30 min per-session produced small effects on muscle strength (SMD = 0.35) and balance (SMD = 0.34). No statistically significant differences were observed between all independently-computed single-training factors. Home-based exercise appears effective to improve components of health- (i.e., muscle strength and muscular endurance) and skill-related (i.e., muscle power, balance) physical-fitness. Therefore, in times of restricted physical activity due to pandemics, home-based exercises constitute an alternative to counteract physical inactivity and preserve/improve the health and fitness of healthy older adults aged 65-to-83 years.","Chaabene, H; Prieske, O; Herz, M; Moran, J; Höhne, J; Kliegl, R; Ramirez-Campillo, R; Behm, D G; Hortobágyi, T; Granacher, U",Ageing research reviews,35,24

However, in Asian countries, the mean body mass index (BMI) of T2DM patients is about 25 kg/m(2). Various data on patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery suggest that the control of T2DM after surgery occurs rapidly. We hypothesized that even in nonobese patients with T2DM, the levels of incretin and insulin changed along with the improvement of T2DM as a consequence of the gastric bypass. MATERIALS AND METHODS From March to December 2011, 12 nonobese patients (mean BMI; 26.2 kg/m(2)) with poorly-controlled [mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C); 9.5%] diabetes underwent gastric bypass surgery. Values related to diabetes, including incretin [gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)] levels were measured before and 1 month after surgery. All values were measured in response to a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). RESULTS On average, the BMI decreased by 2.1 ± 0.7 kg/m(2). Mean HbA1C level decreased by 1.6 ± 2%. Oral glucose-stimulated insulin levels increased and GLP-1 levels also increased significantly. Oral glucose-stimulated GIP levels decreased sharply. CONCLUSION Soon after gastric bypass in nonobese T2DM patients, control of T2DM is achieved. The incretin release after oral glucose is improved. This could be a consequence of changes of the enteroinsular axis, particularly in the incretins.","Kim, Myung Jin; Park, Hyeong Kyu; Byun, Dong Won; Suh, Kyo Il; Hur, Kyung Yul",Asian journal of surgery,35,1

It is based on the utilization of unbiased computational systems free of the traditional experimental approaches based on personal choices of what is important and what select experiments should be performed to obtain the expected results. METHODS Systems biology can be applied to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by learning basic concepts of omes and omics and how omics-derived ""big data"" can be integrated to discover the biological networks underlying highly complex diseases like IBD. Once these biological networks (interactomes) are identified, then the molecules controlling the disease network can be singled out and specific blockers developed. RESULTS The field of systems biology in IBD is just emerging, and there is still limited information on how to best utilize its power to advance our understanding of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Few centers have embraced systems biology in IBD, but the creation of international consortia and large biobanks will make biosamples available to basic and clinical IBD investigators for further research studies.

All mosquito-borne pathogens must traverse the salivary glands (SGs) to be transmitted to the next host, making this organ an ideal target for interventions. The adult SG develops from precursor cells located in the larval SG duct bud. Characterization of the larval SG has been limited. We sought to better understand larval SG architecture, secretion, and gene expression. We developed an optimized method for larval SG staining and surveyed hundreds of larval stage 4 (L4) SGs using fluorescence confocal microscopy. Remarkable variation in SG cell and chromatin organization differed among individuals and across the L4 stage. Lumen formation occurred during L4 stage through secretion likely involving a coincident cellular apical lipid enrichment and extracellular vesicle-like structures. Meta-analysis of microarray data showed that larval SG gene expression is divergent from adult SGs, more similar to larval gastric cecae, but different from other larval gut compartments. This work highlights the variable cell architecture of larval Anopheles gambiae SGs and provides candidate targets for genetic strategies aiming to disrupt SGs and transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens.","Chiu, M; Trigg, B; Taracena, M; Wells, M",Insect molecular biology,35,12

Recently, Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) have been developed as the next generation technique of minimally invasive surgery. SILS advantages include reduced surgical trauma due to reduction in the number of surgical incisions, faster recovery times, and reduced hospitalization. However, the use of SILS in colorectal surgery is technically demanding and requires expert surgeons, which has hampered the reproducibility and the diffusion of this technique. METHODS Between October 2009 and August 2013, 488 consecutive patients were referred to Evangelisches Hochstift Hospital (Worms, Germany) and/or Stadt Klinikum Frankental Hospital (Frankenthal, Germany) for sigmoidectomy for diverticular disease. SILS sigmoidectomy via the umbilicus was performed in 484/488 cases. Clinical outcomes such as the rate of conversion to standard laparoscopy and/or to open surgery, operation time, post-operative complications and hospitalization time were recorded. RESULTS SILS sigmoidectomy was successfully completed for 484 out of 488 patients. SILS was converted to standard laparoscopy in 3 patients (0.6%) and to an open procedure in 1 patient (0.2%). Median time for the procedures was 103.26 min (range, 52-156 min). No mortalities or major complications were noted. The average hospitalization period was of 5 days. CONCLUSION Our work demonstrates that SILS sigmoidectomy via the umbilicus is effective in the treatment of patients affected by diverticular disease on a routine basis and, moreover, is technically feasible also in patients who have been subjected to previous abdominal surgery, with high Body Mass Index and/or patients with perforation at presentation. Thus this procedure represents a valid alternative to standard laparoscopy.","Rizzuto, Antonia; Lacamera, Ugo; Zittel, Franz Ulrich; Sacco, Rosario",International journal of surgery,35,24

Patient demographics, indications for surgery, graft size, degree of postoperative lid advancement, and complications were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 12 patients (16 eyelids) received Permacol implants for correction of lower eyelid retraction during the study period of 18 months (January 2015 to July 2017). Ten procedures were related to thyroid eye disease, 3 for reconstruction, 2 postcosmetic lower lid blepharoplasty, and one acquired anophthalmic socket. The average preoperative inferior scleral show (ISS) was 1.74 mm, and the average postoperative ISS was 0.82 mm. There was a mean lower eyelid elevation of 0.91 mm (p < 0.005, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and mean ratio of graft height:preoperative ISS was 3.8:1 over a median of 8 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Permacol is a safe and effective alternative to autologous tissues for use as a spacer in patients with lower eyelid retraction of varying etiologies. It does undergo some resorption with time, however this can be predicted and incorporated into surgical planning; we recommend an implant height:ISS ratio of 4:1.","McGrath, Lindsay A; Hardy, Thomas G; McNab, Alan A",Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,35,5

DESIGN An online survey consisting of closed-set and open-ended questions distributed within the UK to gain insights into experiences of interactions involving face coverings, and of the impact of face coverings on communication. SAMPLE Four hundred and sixty members of the general public were recruited via snowball sampling. People with hearing loss were intentionally oversampled to more thoroughly assess the effect of face coverings in this group. RESULTS With few exceptions, participants reported that face coverings negatively impacted hearing, understanding, engagement, and feelings of connection with the speaker. Impacts were greatest when communicating in medical situations. People with hearing loss were significantly more impacted than those without hearing loss. Face coverings impacted communication content, interpersonal connectedness, and willingness to engage in conversation; they increased anxiety and stress, and made communication fatiguing, frustrating and embarrassing - both as a speaker wearing a face covering, and when listening to someone else who is wearing one. CONCLUSIONS Face coverings have far-reaching impacts on communication for everyone, but especially for people with hearing loss. These findings illustrate the need for communication-friendly face-coverings, and emphasise the need to be communication-aware when wearing a face covering.","Saunders, Gabrielle H; Jackson, Iain R; Visram, Anisa S",International journal of audiology,35,5

To our knowledge, there are no treatments for COVID-19-related olfactory disorder. Here, we report five olfactory disorder cases in COVID-19, treated using the Japanese traditional (Kampo) medicine, kakkontokasenkyushin'i. We treated five patients with mild COVID-19 at an isolation facility using Kampo medicine, depending on their symptoms. Patients with the olfactory disorder presented with a blocked nose, nasal discharge or taste impairment. Physical examination using Kampo medicine showed similar findings, such as a red tongue with red spots and sublingual vein congestion, which presented as blood stasis and inflammation; thus, we prescribed the Kampo medicine, kakkontokasenkyushin'i. After administration, the numeric rating scale scores of the smell impairment improved within 3 days from 9 to 3 in case 1, from 10 to 0 in case 2, from 9 to 0 in case 3, from 5 to 0 in case 4, and from 9 to 0 within 5 days in case 5. Following the treatment, other common cold symptoms were also alleviated. Kakkontokasenkyushin'i can be used for treating nasal congestion, rhinitis, and inflammation in the nasal mucosa. The olfactory disorder in COVID-19 has been reportedly associated with inflammation and congestion, especially in the olfactory bulb and olfactory cleft. Kakkontokasenkyushin'i may be one of the treatment alternatives for the olfactory disorder with rhinitis in patients with COVID-19.","Takayama, Shin; Arita, Ryutaro; Ono, Rie; Saito, Natsumi; Suzuki, Satoko; Kikuchi, Akiko; Ohsawa, Minoru; Tadano, Yasunori; Akaishi, Tetsuya; Tanaka, Junichi; Kanno, Takeshi; Abe, Michiaki; Onodera, Ko; Ishii, Tadashi",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,35,1

We evaluate the potential of targeting CD38 to ameliorate NAD-related metabolic imbalance and tissue dysfunction in the treatment of systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RECENT FINDINGS In this review, we will discuss emerging basic, preclinical, and human data that point to the novel role of CD38 in dysregulated NAD-homeostasis in SSc, SLE, and RA. In particular, recent studies implicate increased activity of CD38, one of the main enzymes in NAD catabolism, in the pathogenesis of persistent systemic fibrosis in SSc, and increased susceptibility of SLE patients to infections. We will also discuss recent studies that demonstrate that a cytotoxic CD38 antibody can promote clearance of plasma cells involved in the generation of RA antibodies. SUMMARY Recent studies identify potential therapeutic approaches for boosting NAD to treat rheumatologic diseases including SSc, RA, and SLE, with particular attention to inhibition of CD38 enzymatic activity as a target. Key future directions in the field include the determination of the cell-type specificity and role of CD38 enzymatic activity versus CD38 structural roles in human diseases, as well as the indicators and potential side effects of CD38-targeted treatments.","Peclat, Thais Ribeiro; Shi, Bo; Varga, John; Chini, Eduardo Nunes",Current opinion in rheumatology,35,24

Since degradation of attention can sometimes have dire consequences, various brain activity measurement devices such as electroencephalography (EEG) systems have been used to monitor attention states in individuals. However, conventional EEG instruments have limited utility in daily life because they are uncomfortable to wear. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the possibility of discriminating between the attentive and resting states using in-ear EEG signals for potential application via portable, convenient earphone-shaped EEG instruments. We recorded both on-scalp and in-ear EEG signals from 6 subjects in a state of attentiveness during the performance of a visual vigilance task. We have designed and developed in-ear EEG electrodes customized by modelling both the left and right ear canals of the subjects. We use an echo state network (ESN), a powerful type of machine learning algorithm, to discriminate attention states on the basis of in-ear EEGs. We have found that the maximum average accuracy of the ESN method in discriminating between attentive and resting states is approximately 81.16% with optimal network parameters. This study suggests that portable in-ear EEG devices and an ESN can be used to monitor attention states during significant tasks to enhance safety and efficiency.","Jeong, Dong-Hwa; Jeong, Jaeseung",Brain sciences,35,4

Our objective was therefore to review systematically studies that have assessed the association between sodium intake and BP in children with various clinical conditions. A systematic search of several databases was conducted and supplemented by a manual search of bibliographies and unpublished studies. Experimental and observational studies assessing the association between sodium intake and BP and involving children or adolescents between 0 and 18 years of age with any clinical condition were included. Out of the 6861 records identified, 51 full texts were reviewed, and 16 studies (10 experimental and 6 observational), involving overall 2902 children and adolescents, were included. Ten studies were conducted in children with elevated BP without identifiable cause, two in children with familial hypertension, one in children with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, one in children with chronic renal insufficiency, one in children with urolithiasis, and one in premature infants. A positive association between sodium intake and BP was found in all studies, except one. The meta-analysis of six studies among children with elevated BP without identifiable cause revealed a difference of 6.3 mm Hg (95% CI 2.9-9.6) and 3.5 mm Hg (95% CI 1.2-5.7) in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, for every additional gram of sodium intake per day. In conclusion, our results indicate that the BP response to salt is greater in children with clinical conditions, mainly hypertension, than in those without associated clinical conditions.","Rios-Leyvraz, Magali; Bloetzer, Clemens; Chatelan, Angeline; Bochud, Murielle; Burnier, Michel; Santschi, Valérie; Paradis, Gilles; Tabin, René; Bovet, Pascal; Chiolero, Arnaud",Journal of clinical hypertension,35,24

The purpose of this study was to evaluate imaging characteristics and artifact production of polymeric coils compared with standard platinum coils in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS Polymeric coils and standard platinum coils were evaluated in vitro with the use of 2 identical silicon aneurysm models coiled with a packing attenuation of 20% each. DSA, flat panel CT, CT, and MR imaging were performed. In vivo evaluation of imaging characteristics of polymeric coils was performed in experimentally created rabbit carotid bifurcation aneurysms. DSA, CT/CTA, and MR imaging were performed after endovascular treatment of the aneurysms. Images were evaluated regarding visibility of individual coils, coil mass, artifact production, and visibility of residual flow within the aneurysm. RESULTS Overall, in vitro and in vivo imaging showed relevantly reduced artifact production of polymeric coils in all imaging modalities compared with standard platinum coils. Image quality of CT and MR imaging was improved with the use of polymeric coils, which permitted enhanced depiction of individual coil loops and residual aneurysm lumen as well as the peri-aneurysmal area. Remarkably, CT images demonstrated considerably improved image quality with only minor artifacts compared with standard coils. On DSA, polymeric coils showed transparency and allowed visualization of superimposed vessel structures. CONCLUSIONS This initial experimental study showed improved imaging quality with the use of polymeric coils compared with standard platinum coils in all imaging modalities. This might be advantageous for improved intraprocedural imaging for the detection of complications and posttreatment noninvasive follow-up imaging.","Mordasini, P; Kraehenbuehl, A K; Byrne, J V; Vandenberghe, S; Reinert, M; Hoppe, H; Gralla, J",AJNR.

OBJECTIVE This study aims to statistically compare the outcomes of the two strategies, represented by data from Thailand and Sweden, respectively. METHODS Data for COVID-19 pandemic control from Thailand, representing social restriction, versus data from Sweden, representing the herd immunity plan, collected from January 13 to May 31, 2020, were analyzed by using the SIR (susceptible, infectious, recovered) model. RESULTS The SIR model analysis demonstrated a beneficial effect of each model on the attenuation of the mortality rate, with lower mortality in social restriction and shorter overall pandemic duration in the herd immunity plan. However, the herd immunity plan demonstrated a higher mortality rate than social restriction (46.9% versus 1.9%) despite the later entry of the virus in Sweden. When the SIR model was used for predicting the COVID-19 status, Sweden was shown to likely end its COVID-19 epidemic earlier than Thailand (268 vs. 368 days). With the nonlinear estimation, at least one log difference between total confirmed cases versus active cases could be used as an indicator for relaxation of the lockdown policy in Thailand. CONCLUSIONS Both the social restriction and herd immunity plans are beneficial for COVID-19 pandemic control in terms of the amelioration of pandemic mortality. The cumulative number of total recovered cases might be a potential parameter that could be used for determining the policy direction for COVID-19 control.","Chancharoenthana, Wiwat; Leelahavanichkul, Asada; Chinpraditsuk, Sutatip; Pongpirul, Krit; Kamolratanakul, Supitcha; Phumratanaprapin, Weerapong; Wilairatana, Polrat; Pitisuttithum, Punnee",Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology,35,23

METHODS For 28 patients who received RFA and subsequent surgical therapies for early breast cancer treatment, the effect of RFA was evaluated by both histopathological examination and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-diaphorase staining of resected tumor specimens according to the criteria described by Seki et al. (this issue). The correlation of 100% RFA effect with tumor parameters including tumor size and the presence of extensive intraductal component (EIC) was examined. RESULTS The mean size and invasive size of the primary tumors were 2.21 cm (ranging from 0.6 to 5.0 cm) and 1.44 cm (ranging from 0 to 5.0 cm), respectively. By examining hematoxylin-eosin (HE) sections, the effectiveness of RFA was found to be 100% in 16 tumors (57%). However, the effectiveness of RFA was found to be 100% in 22 cases (79%) examined by NADH-diaphorase staining of frozen sections containing part of tumorous and nontumorous tissues. The accuracy of diagnosis of complete RFA effect using NADH-diaphorase staining with reference to HE was 79% (22 of 28) with 100% (16 of 16) sensitivity and 50% (6 of 12) specificity. The rate of 100% RFA effect by HE examination was higher in EIC(-) tumors (13 of 17, 76%) than in EIC(+) tumors (1 of 9, 11%) (P = 0.0022), and was higher in tumors of ≤ 1.5 cm (10 of 11, 91%) than in tumors of >1.5 cm (6 of 17, 35%; P = 0.0034). All five tumors of ≤ 1.0 cm showed 100% RFA effect, but 3 (27%) of 11 tumors of >1.0 and ≤ 2.0 cm and 9 (75%) of 12 tumors of > 2.0 cm showed suboptimal RFA effect by HE. CONCLUSIONS Tumor size of ≤ 1.5 cm, strictly ≤ 1.0 cm, could be an indication for RFA if a complete histological therapeutic effect is mandatory.","Tsuda, Hitoshi; Seki, Kunihiko; Hasebe, Takahiro; Sasajima, Yuko; Shibata, Tatsuhiro; Iwamoto, Eriko; Kinoshita, Takayuki",Breast cancer,35,1

Little is known, however, about the frequency of respiratory viral testing and its associations with antimicrobial utilization. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING The study included 179 US hospitals. PATIENTS Adults admitted with pneumonia between July 2010 and June 2015. METHODS We assessed the frequency of respiratory virus testing and compared antimicrobial utilization, mortality, length of stay, and costs between tested versus untested patients, and between virus-positive versus virus-negative patients. RESULTS Among 166,273 patients with pneumonia on admission, 40,787 patients (24.5%) were tested for respiratory viruses, 94.8% were tested for influenza, and 20.7% were tested for other viruses. Viral assays were positive in 5,133 of 40,787 tested patients (12.6%), typically for influenza and rhinovirus. Tested patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities than untested patients, but patients with positive viral assays were older and had more comorbidities than those with negative assays. Blood cultures were positive for bacterial pathogens in 2.7% of patients with positive viral assays versus 5.3% of patients with negative viral tests (P < .001). Antibacterial courses were shorter for virus-positive versus -negative patients overall (mean 5.5 vs 6.4 days; P < .001) but varied by bacterial testing: 8.1 versus 8.0 days (P = .60) if bacterial tests were positive; 5.3 versus 6.1 days (P < .001) if bacterial tests were negative; and 3.3 versus 5.2 days (P < .001) if bacterial tests were not obtained (interaction P < .001). CONCLUSIONS A minority of patients hospitalized with pneumonia were tested for respiratory viruses; only a fraction of potential viral pathogens were assayed; and patients with positive viral tests often received long antibacterial courses.","Klompas, Michael; Imrey, Peter B; Yu, Pei-Chun; Rhee, Chanu; Deshpande, Abhishek; Haessler, Sarah; Zilberberg, Marya D; Rothberg, Michael B",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,35,1

This paper employs ARDL-ECM and Toda-Yamamoto causality to investigate the relationship between renewable energy, non-renewable energy, carbon emissions, economic growth, gross fixed capital formation, and urban population spanning the period 1960-2019 in China. The examined results of ARDL-ECM indicate that renewable energy both have positive impact on GDP in the short term and long term but non-renewable energy only have positive impact on GDP in the short term. Additionally, based on Toda-Yamamoto causality, this paper finds a unidirectional Granger causality running from economic growth to energy consumption and from energy consumption to carbon emissions. And there is a unidirectional Granger causality running from GDP to non-renewable energy consumption. It is worth noting that renewable energy consumption and economic growth have positive bidirectional influence on each other.

In this work, we evaluate the speed-accuracy tradeoff of three popular deep-learning-based face detectors on the WIDER Face and UFDD data sets in several CPUs and GPUs. We also develop a regression model capable to estimate the performance, both in terms of processing time and accuracy. We expect this to become a very useful tool for the end user in forensic laboratories in order to estimate the performance for different face detection options. Experimental results showed that the best speed-accuracy tradeoff is achieved with images resized to 50% of the original size in GPUs and images resized to 25% of the original size in CPUs. Moreover, performance can be estimated using multiple linear regression models with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.113, which is very promising for the forensic field.","Chaves, Deisy; Fidalgo, Eduardo; Alegre, Enrique; Alaiz-Rodríguez, Rocío; Jáñez-Martino, Francisco; Azzopardi, George",Sensors,35,16

Following the Cochrane Collaboration Methodology, we will start by conducting the literature searches on Medline (via PubMed), Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, in addition to sources of gray literature, to retrieve all the available relevant studies. We will include randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies with a control group, where participants are pregnant women taking any micronutrient supplements in the context of antenatal care globally. We will include studies with targeted interventions designed to improve adherence to micronutrient supplementation in pregnant women compared with (1) usual care or no intervention or (2) other targeted micronutrient adherence intervention.

For short range jumps, we show that low angled trajectories are used that minimise flight time. For longer jumps, take-off angles are steeper and closer to the optimum for minimum energy cost of transport. Comparison of jump performance against other arthropods shows that Phidippus regius is firmly in the group of animals that use dynamic muscle contraction for actuation as opposed to a stored energy catapult system.

Insufficient control of neuroinflammation leads to enhanced or prolonged pathology in various neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) plays critical roles in cellular energy metabolism and calcium homeostasis. Our previous study demonstrated that deletion of CD38, which consumes NAD+ , suppressed cuprizone-induced demyelination, neuroinflammation and glial activation. However, it is still unknown whether CD38 directly affects neuroinflammation through regulating brain NAD+ level. In this study, we investigated the effect of CD38 deletion and inhibition and supplementation of NAD+ on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in mice. First, intracerebroventricular injection of LPS significantly increased CD38 expression especially in the hippocampus. Deletion of CD38 decreased LPS-induced inflammatory responses and glial activation. Pre-administration of apigenin, a flavonoid with CD38 inhibitory activity, or nicotinamide riboside (NR), an NAD+ precursor, increased NAD+ level, and significantly suppressed induction of cytokines and chemokines, glial activation and subsequent neurodegeneration after LPS administration. In cell culture, LPS-induced inflammatory responses were suppressed by treatment of primary astrocytes or microglia with apigenin, NAD+ , NR or 78c, the latter a specific CD38 inhibitor.

The speed and scope of the spread of COVID-19 makes it urgent to define clinical characteristics, serological and radiological changes of the affected patients. METHODS Seven patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University Yuedong Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and their clinical features, serological and radiological longitudinal changes were analyzed. RESULTS Among the 7 patients, all (100%) had a clear epidemiological history. The most common symptoms were respiratory symptoms 6 (85.7%), and only 2 (28.6%) of the patients had fever at their first visit. The cohort included 4 (57.1%) common types and 3 (42.9%) severe types. Two (28.6%) common type patients developed to severe type in a short time. All of the 7 patients (100%) had abnormal liver function, normal renal function, and normal procalcitonin. The detection time of specific antibody in 7 patients was 5 - 13 days after symptoms. Before the specific antibody could be detected, the absolute value of lymphocytes decreased in 2 (28.6%) common type cases transferred to severe type cases accompanied with obvious progress in pulmonary imaging. The phenomenon of decreased albumin and elevated globulin occurred in 6 patients (85.7%). The predominant pattern of lung lesions observed was bilateral (71.4%) and mainly near the pleura at the first diagnosis. Bilateral pulmonary involvement occurred in 6 cases (85.7%) during the course of disease. In 4 cases (57.1%) with obvious pulmonary lesions, the absolute value of lymphocytes decreased, albumin decreased, and globulin increased during the course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS Serum specific antibodies can be detected within 2 weeks of onset. Close observation of the dynamic changes of absolute value of blood lymphocytes, serum albumin, and globulin which were related to pulmonary imaging changes in patients will contribute to assessment of COVID-19.","Yang, Zhiwei; Yu, Mingxue; Li, Ganwen; Liu, Guirong; Xie, Jinjun; Song, Hongzhong; Li, Gang; Jie, Yusheng",Clinical laboratory,35,12

Therefore, the accuracy of these results cannot be undervalued. When false positive cannabinoid (THC) screening results for this population were suspected at our institution, a multidisciplinary approach was initiated to evaluate the screening process for any pre-analytical or analytical sources of error or interference. DESIGN AND METHODS Mixtures of drug-free urine with various commercial products and materials that commonly contact newborns in our nursery were prepared and tested using the immunoassay screening methods in our laboratory. Additional commercial products were similarly tested; and when available, individual surfactants common to the interfering products were also evaluated. RESULTS Addition of Head-to-Toe Baby Wash to drug-free urine produced a dose dependent measureable response in the THC immunoassay. Addition of other commercially available baby soaps gave similar results, and subsequent testing identified specific chemical surfactants that reacted with the THC immunoassay. CONCLUSION We have identified commonly used soap and wash products used for newborn and infant care as potential causes of false positive THC screening results. Such results in this population can lead to involvement by social services or false child abuse allegations. Given these consequences, it is important for laboratories and providers to be aware of this potential source for false positive screening results and to consider confirmation before initiating interventions. Most importantly, we demonstrate the need for active involvement in the ""total testing process,"" as sources of error are not confined to the laboratory walls.","Cotten, Steven W; Duncan, Daniel L; Burch, Elizabeth A; Seashore, Carl J; Hammett-Stabler, Catherine A",Clinical biochemistry,35,16

Specifically, it is unclear whether anesthesia primarily disrupts thalamocortical relay or intercortical signaling. Here we recorded intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG), local field potentials (LFPs), and single-unit activity in patients during wakefulness and light anesthesia. Propofol infusion was gradually increased while auditory stimuli were presented and patients responded to a target stimulus until they became unresponsive. We found widespread iEEG responses in association cortices during wakefulness, which were attenuated and restricted to auditory regions upon LOC. Neuronal spiking and LFP responses in primary auditory cortex (PAC) persisted after LOC, while responses in higher-order auditory regions were variable, with neuronal spiking largely attenuated. Gamma power induced by word stimuli increased after LOC while its frequency profile slowed, thus differing from local spiking activity. In summary, anesthesia-induced LOC disrupts auditory processing in association cortices while relatively sparing responses in PAC, opening new avenues for future research into mechanisms of LOC and the design of anesthetic monitoring devices.","Krom, Aaron J; Marmelshtein, Amit; Gelbard-Sagiv, Hagar; Tankus, Ariel; Hayat, Hanna; Hayat, Daniel; Matot, Idit; Strauss, Ido; Fahoum, Firas; Soehle, Martin; Boström, Jan; Mormann, Florian; Fried, Itzhak; Nir, Yuval",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,35,31

Fluorine introduction can be used for both purposes. Insights into how fluorine introduction affects lipophilicity are thus of importance, and systematic series of fluorinated compounds with measured octanol-water partition coefficients are a powerful way to enhance our qualitative understanding in this regard and are essential as input for computational log P estimation programs. Here, we report a detailed comparison of all possible vicinal and skipped (1,3-substituted) fluorination motifs when embedded in structurally equivalent environments (X-CFnH2-n-CFmH2-m-X versus X-CFnH2-n-CH2-CFmH2-m-X, with n,m ≠ 0 and X = CH2OH) to compounds with isolated fluorination (n ≠ 0; m = 0, and including X-CH2-CFnH2-n-CH2-X, n = 0-2). It is shown that skipped fluorination is more powerful for log P reduction purposes compared to single or vicinal fluorination. Efficient stereoselective syntheses of the compounds with skipped fluorination motifs are reported, which where relevant can be made enantioselective using known chiral building blocks. These compounds, and some intermediates, will be of interest as advanced fluorinated building blocks.","Troup, Robert I; Jeffries, Benjamin; Saudain, Raphael El-Bekri; Georgiou, Eleni; Fish, Johanna; Scott, James S; Chiarparin, Elisabetta; Fallan, Charlene; Linclau, Bruno",The Journal of organic chemistry,35,19

This article aims to examine the relevance of conspiracy beliefs for psychiatry in the context of the dynamics of trust and mistrust. CONCLUSIONS Conspiracy beliefs may be situated on a spectrum of mistrust-related phenomena, which extends from healthy scepticism to persecutory delusions. They can be conceptualised as unfounded and fixed beliefs held with strong conviction about harm inflicted by powerful groups on the community or another group of people, usually with preserved insight that these beliefs differ from those that most people have and with reasons for having such beliefs not necessarily being implausible.

It is unclear whether e-cigarette users will switch to disposable vaping products with a variety of kids-appealing flavours available. METHODS We performed piece-wise regression and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithms to compare the relative search volume (RSV) of JUUL and Puff Bar (a disposable vaping product) using the 1-year Google Trends data from 24 February 2019 to 20 February 2020, separated by three events that may have spurred changes in RSV for each product. RESULTS The RSV for JUUL was relatively stable before Trump Administration announced plans to ban flavoured e-cigarettes. After that, the RSV for JUUL dropped sharply (rate of change=-8.8 per week) from 11 September 2019 to 17 October 2019 when JUUL Labs announced to halt online sales of some flavoured products, and the RSV resumed the decreasing trend after FDA announced enforcement policy of cartridge-based e-cigarettes on 2 January 2020. In comparison, the RSV for Puff Bar started to increase after 11 September 2019 with a low rate of change (0.6) until 17 October 2019. After that, the increase in RSV for Puff Bar accelerated. The RSV of puff bars surpassed that of JUUL during the week of 2 February 2020. CONCLUSION The popularity of Puff Bar on Google Search suggests that users may replace cartridge-based vaping products with disposable e-cigarettes in the circumvention of the partial flavour ban. Continuous surveillance and further assessment are needed to prevent potential loopholes in tobacco regulation.","Dai, Hongying; Hao, Jianqiang",Tobacco control,35,11

Recently an attachment-based coding system for family drawings was developed by attachment researchers and it was used both with clinical and nonclinical samples, but it has never been used with adoptees. METHOD This study examined the differences between attachment representations of 29 late-adopted children aged 5-7 years (M = 6.35, 51.7% girls) and 12 non-adopted peers as assessed by family drawings, controlling for demographic variables and children's cognitive status. The attachment-based coding system of family drawings included three levels: (1) 24 individual markers, (2) eight global rating scales (1-7 points), and (3) four attachment categories (secure, avoidant, resistant, and disorganized). RESULTS Late-adopted children assessed with the family drawings were more insecure on the attachment categories and achieved lower scores on positive global ratings such as the Vitality/Creativity and Family Pride/Happiness scales, higher scores on the Role Reversal scale, and a tendency toward higher scores on the Bizarreness/Dissociation scale. No difference emerged between the two groups regarding the individual markers. CONCLUSIONS Family drawing seemed to be a useful tool for classifying attachment representations, and able to capture underlying mental states that it was hard for late-adopted children to express in words.","Pace, Cecilia Serena; Zavattini, Giulio Cesare; Tambelli, Renata",Child and adolescent mental health,35,1

CR2 genetic variants are associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus as well as to HIV-1 infection. Additionally, CR2 function can be subverted by HIV-1 for an efficient entry into target cells; in a process known as antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection. We sought to determine the association between CR2 gene variants with HIV-1 acquisition after vaccination with recombinant gp120 protein (Vax004 clinical trial). DESIGN AND METHODS This is a retrospective cross-sectional study, comprising male subjects of European ancestry including infected (n = 273) and uninfected (n = 402) vaccinees and placebo, who were genotyped for 3 SNPs in the CR2 gene region. RESULTS An interaction was observed between the baseline sexual behaviour and the SNP rs3813946 for higher risk of infection in vacinees (interaction term p = 0.02). This SNP was associated with increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection after vaccination in subjects with low behavioral risk OR [95%CI]: 5.5 [1.4-21.7], p = 0.006 but not vaccinees with high behavioral risk or subjects given placebo (p = 0.7). Moreover, CR2 genotype was strongly associated with the rate of HIV-1 acquisition after vaccination in low risk subjects (Hazard odds ratio [95%CI]: 3.3 [1.6-7.0], p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that CR2 may play a role in HIV-1 acquisition after vaccination with rgp120 proteins.","Meza, Giovanna; Expósito, Almudena; Royo, José Luis; Ruiz-García, Celia; Sánchez-Arcas, Beatriz; Marquez, Francisco J; Gómez-Vidal, María Amparo; Omar, Mohamed; Sinangil, Faruk; Higgins, Keith; Forthal, Donald; Real, Luis Miguel; Caruz, Antonio",AIDS,35,15

METHODS This is a retrospective study of patients presenting with clinical left varicocele to the male infertility unit at a teaching hospital in Qatar. Files of all patients who underwent sub-inguinal microsurgical varicocelectomy were retrieved and categorized into three groups indicating the number of spermatic veins ligated during varicocelectomy. The presence of pain was assessed during pre- and post-operation (at 3 and 6 months). Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis test (K) and Chi-square test (C). RESULTS Out of 675 records, 207 (30.7%) patients did left varicocelectomy for pain. Their mean age was 35.3±9.2 years. Pain was assessed in 106/207 (51.2%) patients post operatively, of whom 89 (84%) reported complete resolution of symptoms. This improvement was maintained irrespective of the number of veins ligated during surgery (<5 veins: 90.0%, 5-10 veins: 81.5%, and >10 veins: 85.7%). CONCLUSIONS Microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy is a valid treatment method for patients with a symptomatic clinical varicocele. While a significant post-surgical (at 6 months) reduction of pain was detected, the number of veins ligated intraoperatively was not predictive of post-operative improvement of pain in this study population.","Elbardisi, Haitham; Agarwal, Ashok; Majzoub, Ahmad; Al Said, Sami; Alnawasra, Hossameldin; Khalafalla, Kareim; Al Rumaihi, Khalid; Al Ansari, Abdulla; Durairaganayagam, Damayanthi; Arafa, Mohamed",Translational andrology and urology,35,1

METHODS The insertion site of the cuff inflation lines and the lengths of four different brands and nine sizes of commonly used cuffed pediatric tracheal tubes were measured and compared in vitro with oral and nasotracheal intubation depths as calculated by different formulas for pediatric patients aged from birth to 16 years. Motoyama's recommendation was used for age-related size selection of cuffed pediatric tracheal tubes. RESULTS The proportion of the distance from the tracheal tube tip to the insertion site of the cuff inflation line varied considerably between the tracheal tubes (Microcuff: 48.5-60.7%; Parker 48.7-73.02%; Ruesch 59.1-77.8%; Shiley: 46.0-60.3%). Using different formulas for oral or nasotracheal intubation depth, the insertion site of the cuff inflation line was placed within the oral or nasal cavity or within an area 1 cm beyond the teeth or the nostrils in almost all tracheal tubes tested. Positioning the insertion site 2 cm from the proximal end of the tracheal tubes resulted in a cuff line-free tube area of ≥ 1 cm in all orally and almost in all nasally inserted tracheal tubes, considering maximum recommended tracheal intubation depths. CONCLUSION The cuff inflation line in almost all commonly used cuffed pediatric tracheal tubes interferes with securing the tracheal tube due to its insertion site into the tracheal tube. This potentially carries the risk of kinking, obstruction or damage to the cuff inflation line with ensuing failure to deflate or inflate the cuff. The proposed position of the insertion of the cuff inflation line 2 cm from the proximal end of the tracheal tube would ensure a 1 cm wide cuff line-free circular area beyond the oral or nasal cavity in nearly all assessed tracheal tube sizes.","Kemper, Michael; Fischer, Martina; Grass, Beate; Dave, Mital H; Weiss, Markus",Paediatric anaesthesia,35,15

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of cut umbilical cord milking (C-UCM), which permits resuscitation during immediate transition period (ITP). Methods: Sixty-two healthy term infants were randomly divided into C-UCM and I-UCM groups at birth. Approximately 30-cm length of cord was milked towards the baby 2-4 times within 20 seconds after birth in both C-UCM and I-UCM groups while the umbilical cord was cut in the former, and intact in the latter. Heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), cerebral regional oxygen saturation (crSO2) (2nd-15th min), blood pressure (BP) (within 15-30 min), residual placental blood volume (RPBV), and hemoglobin levels (at the sixth hour) were monitored during ITP. Results: There were no significant differences in terms of mean gestational age (w) [(39.0 ± 1.2) versus (38.8 ± 1.1)], birth weight (g) [(3351.45 ± 254.30) versus (3256.94 ± 285.52)], Apgar scores at the 5th min (10 ± 0 versus 10 ± 0), first breathing time (sec) (5,4 ± 3,8 versus 5,7 ± 4,1), SpO2, crSO2, BP (mmHg) [(52.9 ± 6.9) versus (51.8 ± 5.7)], hemoglobin levels (g/dl) [(17.7 ± 1.8) versus (18.4 ± 1.4)], and RPBV (ml/kg) [(23.9 ± 4.7) versus (22.9 ± 5.4)] between C-UCM and I-UCM groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: This study showed that C-UCM is as effective as I-UCM on cerebral oxygenation, hemodynamic and hematological adaptation of term infants in ITP. We suggest that C-UCM can provide additional placental transfusion in term neonates exposed to early cord clamping.","Orpak, Ümmühan Seda; Ergin, Hacer; Çıralı, Ceren; Özdemir, Özmert M A; Koşar Can, Özlem; Çelik, Ülker","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",35,1

However, the effect of SBP change (∆SBP) during the first 24 hour on thrombectomy outcomes remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between ∆SBP at different time intervals and thrombectomy outcomes. METHODS We analyzed thrombectomy treated patients registered in the SITS International Stroke Thrombectomy Registry from 01-01-2014 to 03-09-2019. Primary outcome was 3-month unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin scale scores 3-6). We defined ∆SBP as the mean SBP of a given time interval after MT (0-2h, 2-4h, 4-12h, 12-24h) minus admission SBP. Multivariable mixed logistic regression models were used to adjust for known confounders and center as random effect. Subgroups analyses were included to contrast specific subpopulations. Restricted cubic splines were used to model the associations. RESULTS The study population consisted of 5835 patients (mean age 70 years, 51% male, median NIHSS 16). Mean ∆SBP was -12.3, -15.7, -17.2, and -16.9 mmHg for the time intervals 0-2h, 2-4h, 4-12h, 12-24h, respectively. Higher ∆SBP was associated with unfavorable outcome at 0-2h (Odds ratio 1.065, 95% confidence interval 1.014-1.118), 2-4h (1.140, 1.081-1.203), 4-12h (1.145, 1.087-1.203), and 12-24h (1.145, 1.089-1.203), for every increase of 10 mmHg. Restricted cubic spline models suggested that increasing ∆SBP was associated with unfavorable outcome, with higher values showing increased risk of unfavorable outcome.

These results, typically seen at dose rates exceeding 40 Gy/s (or 2,400 Gy/min), have been widely reported in studies utilizing photon or electron radiation as well as in some proton radiation studies. Here, we report the development of a proton irradiation platform in a clinical proton facility and the dosimetry methods developed. The target is placed in the entry plateau region of a proton beam with a specifically designed double-scattering system. The energy after the double-scattering system is 227.5 MeV for protons that pass through only the first scatterer, and 225.5 MeV for those that also pass through the second scatterer. The double-scattering system was optimized to deliver a homogeneous dose distribution to a field size as large as possible while keeping the dose rate >100 Gy/s and not exceeding a cyclotron current of 300 nA. We were able to obtain a collimated pencil beam (1.6 × 1.2 cm2 ellipse) at a dose rate of ∼120 Gy/s. This beam was used for dose-response studies of partial abdominal irradiation of mice.

In this study, we report that interferon-α (IFN-α) induced the transfer of resistance to hepatitis B virus (HBV) from nonpermissive liver nonparenchymal cells (LNPCs) to permissive hepatocytes via exosomes. Exosomes from IFN-α-treated LNPCs were rich in molecules with antiviral activity. Moreover, exosomes from LNPCs were internalized by hepatocytes, which mediated the intercellular transfer of antiviral molecules. Finally, we found that exosomes also contributed to the antiviral response of IFN-α to mouse hepatitis virus A59 and adenovirus in mice. Thus, we propose an antiviral mechanism of IFN-α activity that involves the induction and intercellular transfer of antiviral molecules via exosomes.","Li, Jianhua; Liu, Kuancheng; Liu, Yang; Xu, Yan; Zhang, Fei; Yang, Huijuan; Liu, Jiangxia; Pan, Tingting; Chen, Jieliang; Wu, Min; Zhou, Xiaohui; Yuan, Zhenghong",Nature immunology,35,1

The aim of the current study was to compare the all-inside and inside-out techniques with regard to retear rate, functional outcomes, and perioperative complications in patients who had undergone arthroscopic meniscus repair. We hypothesized that there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of postoperative outcomes after arthroscopic meniscus repair. METHODS This study was a prospective randomized blinded study, with a parallel design and an allocation ratio of 1:1 for the treatment groups. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board in our hospital and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating in the trial. It was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. A total of 70 patients who meet inclusion criteria are randomized to either all-inside or inside-out group. The primary outcome measure was retear rate. Retear was determined by repeat arthroscopic evaluation of patients with follow-up for symptoms of persistent or new pain, catching, or locking that was possibly related to the meniscal repair. Secondary outcomes included disease-specific quality of life measurement with the Western Ontario Meniscal Evaluation Tool, range of motion, operative time, and adverse events at surgery or throughout the follow-up period.

However, little is known about how alterations to the intestinal immune system and sphingolipids contribute to pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). We used WT mice, RORγt-deficient mice, sphingosine kinase-deficient mice and local gut anti-inflammatory, 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA)-treated mice in a chronic-binge ethanol feeding model. Targeted lipidomics assessed the sphingolipids in gut and liver samples. Gut immune cell populations, the amounts of sphingolipids, and the level of liver injury were examined. Results: Alcohol intake induces a pro-inflammatory shift in immune cell populations in the gut, including an increase in Th17 cells. Using RORγt-deficient mice, we found that Th17 cells are required for alcohol-associated gut inflammation and the development of ALD. Treatment with 5-ASA decreases alcohol-induced liver injury and reverses gut inflammation by the suppression of CD4+ /RORγt+ /IL-17A+ cells. Increased Th17 cells were due to upregulation of SK1 activity and RORγt activation. We found that S1P/S1PR1 signaling are required for the development of Th17 cell-mediated ALD. Importantly, in vivo intervention blocking of S1P/S1PR1 signaling markedly attenuated alcohol-induced liver inflammation, steatosis, and damage. Conclusion: Gut inflammation is a functional alteration of immune cells in ALD. Reducing gut Th17 cells leads to reduced liver damage. S1P signaling was crucial in the pathogenesis of ALD in a Th17 cell dependent manner. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compounds that reduce gut inflammation locally may represent a unique targeted approach in the treatment of ALD.","Chu, Shenghui; Sun, Rui; Gu, Xuemei; Chen, Liang; Liu, Min; Guo, HaiXun; Ju, Songwen; Vatsalya, Vatsalya; Feng, Wenke; McClain, Craig J; Deng, Zhongbin",Hepatology,35,16

Herein, we describe our initial experience performing complex abdominal wall repair (CAWR) utilizing component separation and P4HB mesh as onlay reinforcement. METHODS All patients undergoing CAWR between June 2014 and May 2017 were followed prospectively for postoperative outcomes. Only those patients who underwent components separation with primary repair of the fascial edges followed by onlay of P4HB mesh were included in this study. RESULTS 105 patients (52 male, 53 female; mean age 59.2 years, range 22-84) met inclusion criteria. Mean BMI was 29.1 (range 16-48); 52% patients had prior attempted hernia repair, most with multiple medical comorbidities (71% of patients with ASA 3 or greater). 30% of cases were not clean at the time of repair (CDC class 2 or greater). Median follow-up was 36 months (range 9-63). Eighteen patients (17%) developed a hernia recurrence ranging from 2 to 36 months postoperatively. Five (5%) patients developed a localized superficial infection treated with antibiotics, three (2.8%) required re-operation for non-healing wounds, and six (6%) patients developed seroma. CONCLUSIONS These data demonstrate a relatively low rate of hernia recurrence, seroma, and other common complications of CAWR in a highly morbid patient population. Importantly, the rate of mesh infection was low and no patients required complete mesh removal, even when placed into a contaminated or infected surgical field.","Levy, Adam S; Bernstein, Jaime L; Premaratne, Ishani D; Rohde, Christine H; Otterburn, David M; Morrison, Kerry A; Lieberman, Michael; Pomp, Alfons; Spector, Jason A",Surgical endoscopy,35,1

The objectives of this survey were to evaluate the progress in the infrastructure of the training systems in Europe over the past decade. We also evaluated training and assessment techniques, the perceived relevance of ENYGO (European Network of Young Gynaecological Oncologists) initiatives, and unmet needs of trainees. METHODOLOGY National representatives of ENYGO from 39 countries were contacted with an electronic survey. A graduation in well/moderately/loosely-structured training systems was performed. Descriptive statistical analysis and frequency tables, as well as two-sided Fisher's exact test, were used. RESULTS National representatives from 33 countries answered our survey questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 85%. A national fellowship is offered in 22 countries (66.7%). A logbook to document progress during training is mandatory in 24 (72.7%) countries. A logbook of experience is only utilized in a minority of nations (18%) for assessment purposes. In 42.4% of countries, objective assessments are recognized.

In this study, we evaluate the impact that 4 different cryopreservation protocols have on porcine urethral tissue, to identify a protocol that best preserves the native properties of the tissue. The cryopreservation protocols include storage in cryoprotective agents at -20 °C and -80 °C with a slow, gradual, and fast reduction in temperature. To evaluate the effects of cryopreservation, the tissue is mechanically characterised in uniaxial tension and the mechanical properties, failure mechanics, and tissue dimensions are compared fresh and following cryopreservation. The mechanical response of the tissue is altered following cryopreservation, yet the elastic modulus from the high stress, linear region of the Cauchy stress - stretch curves is unaffected by the freezing process. To further investigate the change in mechanical response following cryopreservation, the stretch at different tensile stress values was evaluated, which revealed that storage at -20 °C is the only protocol that does not significantly alter the mechanical properties of the tissue compared to the fresh samples. Conversely, the ultimate tensile strength and the stretch at failure were relatively unaffected by the freezing process, regardless of the cryopreservation protocol. However, there were alterations to the tissue dimensions following cryopreservation that were significantly different from the fresh samples for the tissue stored at -80 °C. Therefore, any study intent on preserving the mechanical, failure, and geometric properties of urethral tissue during cryopreservation should do so by freezing samples at -20 °C, as storage at -80 °C is shown here to significantly alter the tissue properties.","Cunnane, Connor V; Croghan, Stephanie M; Walsh, Michael T; Cunnane, Eoghan M; Davis, Niall F; Flood, Hugh D; Mulvihill, John J E",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,35,1

Differentiating between medullary thyroid carcinoma and an ectopic source of calcitonin secretion can represent a complex diagnostic conundrum for managing physicians, with cases of unnecessary thyroidectomy reported in the literature. This manuscript reports a case of ectopic hypercalcitonaemia from a metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm of the lung with concurrent thyroid pathology and summarises the results of a systematic review of the literature. Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov and SCOPUS databases were systematically and critically appraised for all peer reviewed manuscripts that suitably fulfilled the inclusion criteria established a priori. The protocol for this systematic review was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols, and followed methods outlined in The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO. It is vital to consider diagnoses other than medullary thyroid carcinoma when presented with a patient with raised calcitonin, as it is not pathognomonic of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Lung neuroendocrine neoplasms can appear similar to medullary thyroid carcinoma histologically, they can secrete calcitonin and metastasize to the thyroid. Patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma may show stimulated calcitonin values over two or more times above the basal values, whereas calcitonin-secreting neuroendocrine neoplasms may or may not show response to stimulation tests. The present review summarises existing evidence from cases of ectopic hypercalcitonaemia to lung neuroendocrine neoplasms.","Llewellyn, David; Srirajaskanthan, Rajaventhan; Vincent, Royce; Guy, Catherine; Drakou, Eftychia E; Aylwin, Simon; Grossman, Ashley; Ramage, John K; Dimitriadis, Georgios K",Endocrine connections,35,12

The aim of this study was to develop an optimal microwave precoagulation technique in a porcine model and then validate the technique during hepatic resection in patients. METHODS Institutional Animal Care and Use and Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocols were utilized for hepatic resection in a porcine model and validation in patients using microwave energy for precoagulation. Different numbers of antennas (one, two or three; spaced 5 mm apart) and ablation times (20, 30, 40, and 60 s) were evaluated to identify an optimal technique that effectively provided precoagulation. RESULTS Animal studies: Two antennas for 30 s provided the optimal ablation time, ablation width, mean size of largest vessel coagulated, and minimal bleeding when compared with other techniques. However, given that this is not an optimal technique for laparoscopic precoagulation, one antenna for 60 s was found to provide similar precoagulation success. Patient validation: To validate these techniques, three patients underwent open hepatectomy using two antennas with 5 mm spacing for 30 s, demonstrating successful precoagulation up to inflow/outflow vessels of 10 mm size or greater, which were controlled with a vascular stapler. In addition three patients underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy using one antenna for 60 s and demonstrated successful precoagulation up to inflow/outflow vessels of 8 mm or greater, which were controlled with a vascular stapler.

METHODS A retrospective study of 3 patients experienced the tumor excision and tissue regeneration healing in situ from January 2019 to January 2020. In this group, the nasal sidewall defect was treated with wound moist theory, preventing infection, to promote the wound regeneration and repair.

However, it is unclear whether pre-injury OAC status and its associated operative delay are associated with worsening of peri-operative hemostasis or an increased risk of post-operative thromboembolism. METHODS We performed a systematic review to identify studies that directly compared hemostatic and thromboembolic outcomes among hip fracture patients on an OAC prior to admission with those not on anticoagulants. Random effects meta-analyses were used to pool all outcomes of interest (estimated blood loss, transfusion requirements and post-operative thromboembolism). RESULTS Twenty-one studies involving 21,417 patients were included. Estimated blood loss was higher among patients presenting with OACs compared to those not anticoagulated (mean difference 31.0 mL, 95% CI 6.2 - 55.7). Anticoagulated patients also had a 1.3-fold higher risk of receiving red blood cell transfusions (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.20 - 1.51); however, rates of post-operative thromboembolism were similar regardless of anticoagulation status (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.40 - 2.79 for venous thromboembolism; OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.25 - 1.36 for arterial thromboembolism). No subgroup effect was found based on anticoagulant type or degree of surgical delay. CONCLUSION Hip fracture patients on OACs experience increased surgical blood loss and higher risk of red blood cell transfusions. However, the degree of surgical delay did not mitigate this risk, and there was no difference in post-operative thromboembolism. The impact of appropriate, timely OAC reversal on blood conservation and expedited surgery in anticoagulated hip fracture patients warrants urgent evaluation.","Xu, Yan; You, Daniel; Krzyzaniak, Halli; Ponich, Brett; Ronksley, Paul; Skeith, Leslie; Salo, Paul; Korley, Robert; Schneider, Prism; Carrier, Marc",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,35,17

The goal of this study is to determine the appropriate angle (60° vs 90°) of the stylet when using the McGrath VL by comparing the time to intubation (TTI). METHODS One hundred and forty patients aged 19 to 70 years (American Society of Anesthesiologists classification I or II) who required tracheal intubation for elective surgery were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups, at the 60° angle (n = 70) or the 90° angle (n = 70). Anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium. The primary outcome was TTI assessed by a blind observer. Glottic grade, use of optimal external laryngeal manipulation, failed intubation at first attempt, ease of intubation, and severity of oropharyngeal bleeding were also recorded. RESULTS The mean TTI was significantly shorter in the 60° group than in the 90° group (29.3 ± 6.4 vs 32.5 ± 9.4 s, P = 0.022). The glottic grade and degree of intubation difficulty were not significantly different between the 2 groups.

A set of terms and definitions for hemostats, sealants, and adhesives based on group, category, and class will be employed to highlight the specific capabilities of fibrin sealant. Fibrin sealant has now emerged as an example of maximizing the usefulness of a surgical agent and is the only product with Food and Drug Administration approval in all three groupings: hemostats; sealants; and adhesives. A variety of manufacturers' fibrin sealant products are available including multiple liquids and one patch. A single liquid product is now specifically indicated for skin flap adherence during rhytidectomy. The unique characteristic of this particular two component fibrin sealant adhesive agent is its slower polymerization rate as a result of a low thrombin concentration which when combined with fibrinogen permits adequate time for manipulation of flaps and tissues prior to final fixation. In addition to its flap adherence and potential space elimination capability, fibrin sealant is also an excellent blood clotting agent and can seal tissues to prevent lymphatic leak or serous fluid accumulation.

The sequence was in chromosome 1p within an intronic region of the netrin G1 (NTNG1) gene. The sequence matched a sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 Orf1b gene in non-structural protein 14 (NSP14), which is an exonuclease and NSP15, an endoribonuclease. In the current study we compared the human genome with other viral genomes to determine some of the characteristics of human sequences found in the latter. Most of the viruses had human sequences, but they were short. Hepatitis A and St Louis encephalitis had human sequences that were longer than the 117 base SARS-Cov-2 sequence, but they were in non-coding regions of the human genome. The SARS-Cov-2 sequence was the only long sequence found in a human gene (NTNG1). The related coronaviruses SARS-Cov had a 41 BP human sequence on chromosome 3 that was not part of a human gene, and MERS had no human sequence. The 117 base SARS-CoV-2 human sequence is relatively close to the viral spike sequence, separated only by NSP16, a 904 base sequence. The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the virus spike protein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. We have no explanation for the NSP14 and NSP15 SARS-Cov-2 sequences we observed here or how they might relate to infectiousness. Further studies are warranted.","Lehrer, Steven; Rheinstein, Peter H",In vivo,35,19

MRI contrast agents are designed to improve the contrast and sensitivity of MRI. However, current clinically used MRI contrast agents have relaxivities far below the theoretical upper limit, which largely prevent advancing molecular imaging of biomarkers with desired sensitivity and specificity. This review describes current progress in the development of a new class of protein-based MRI contrast agents (ProCAs) with high relaxivity using protein design to optimize the parameters that govern relaxivity. Further, engineering with targeting moiety allows these contrast agents to be applicable for molecular imaging of prostate cancer biomarkers by MRI. The developed protein-based contrast agents also exhibit additional in vitro and in vivo advantages for molecular imaging of disease biomarkers, such as high metal-binding stability and selectivity, reduced toxicity, proper blood circulation time, and higher permeability in tumor tissue in addition to improved relaxivities.","Xue, Shenghui; Qiao, Jingjuan; Jiang, Jie; Hubbard, Kendra; White, Natalie; Wei, Lixia; Li, Shunyi; Liu, Zhi-Ren; Yang, Jenny J",Medicinal research reviews,35,19

This paper reports on the perceived environmental barriers of the German study population and their associations with quality of life. DESIGN Cross-sectional explorative observational study using survey data. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1,479 persons with spinal cord injury aged 18 years and older. METHODS After descriptive analyses, exploratory factor analysis was used to build groups of environmental barriers. Logistic regressions were performed to assess correlates of perceived environmental barriers. Spearman's correlations were used to analyse the association between perceived barriers and quality of life. RESULTS Barriers regarding infrastructure had a relatively large impact. Barriers in relation to people's attitudes towards spinal cord injury and the equipment of people with spinal cord injury had a relatively small impact on the lives of people with spinal cord injury. Several subpopulations showed a higher risk in experiencing barriers. Quality of life decreased with increasing experience of barriers. CONCLUSION The most life-hardening barriers were identified related to infrastructure, a category in which most barriers are modifiable, for example, buildings or transportation.","Bökel, Andrea; Dierks, Marie-Luise; Gutenbrunner, Christoph; Weidner, Norbert; Geng, Veronika; Kalke, Yorck-Bernhard; Liebscher, Thomas; Abel, Frank-Rainer; Sturm, Christian",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,35,1

The nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of SARS-CoV plays an important role in inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) production via an unknown mechanism. In this study, the SARS-CoV N protein was found to bind to the SPRY domain of the tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby interfering with the association between TRIM25 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and inhibiting TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination and activation. Type I IFN production induced by poly I·C or Sendai virus (SeV) was suppressed by the SARS-CoV N protein. SARS-CoV replication was increased by overexpression of the full-length N protein but not N amino acids 1 to 361, which could not interact with TRIM25. These findings provide an insightful interpretation of the SARS-CoV-mediated host innate immune suppression caused by the N protein.IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV N protein is essential for the viral life cycle and plays a key role in the virus-host interaction. We demonstrated that the interaction between the C terminus of the N protein and the SPRY domain of TRIM25 inhibited TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination, which resulted in the inhibition of IFN production. We also found that the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) N protein interacted with TRIM25 and inhibited RIG-I signaling. The outcomes of these findings indicate the function of the coronavirus N protein in modulating the host's initial innate immune response.","Hu, Yong; Li, Wei; Gao, Ting; Cui, Yan; Jin, Yanwen; Li, Ping; Ma, Qingjun; Liu, Xuan; Cao, Cheng",Journal of virology,35,23

Although LCT is relatively straightforward to diagnose in lymph nodes, a marrow biopsy is often obtained first given its ease of procedure, low cost, and low morbidity. However, consensus criteria for LCT in bone marrow have not been established. OBJECTIVE.— To study the accuracy and reproducibility of a trained convolutional neural network in identifying LCT, in light of promising machine learning tools that may introduce greater objectivity to morphologic analysis. DESIGN.— We retrospectively identified patients who had a diagnosis of FL or CLL who had undergone bone marrow biopsy for the clinical question of LCT. We scored morphologic criteria and correlated results with clinical disease progression. In addition, whole slide scans were annotated into patches to train convolutional neural networks to discriminate between small and large tumor cells and to predict the patient's probability of transformation. RESULTS.— Using morphologic examination, the proportion of large lymphoma cells (≥10% in FL and ≥30% in CLL), chromatin pattern, distinct nucleoli, and proliferation index were significantly correlated with LCT in FL and CLL. Compared to pathologist-derived estimates, machine generated quantification demonstrated better reproducibility and stronger correlation with final outcome data. CONCLUSIONS.— These histologic findings may serve as indications of LCT in bone marrow biopsies. The pathologist-augmented with machine system appeared to be the most predictive, arguing for greater efforts to validate and implement these tools to further enhance physician practice.","Irshaid, Lina; Bleiberg, Jonathan; Weinberger, Ethan; Garritano, James; Shallis, Rory M; Patsenker, Jonathan; Lindenbaum, Ofir; Kluger, Yuval; Katz, Samuel G; Xu, Mina L",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,35,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the imaging findings of all patients with adrenal tumors treated with radiofrequency ablation in our department from January 2001 through August 2009. The studies were reviewed in consensus by two attending abdominal imaging radiologists and an abdominal imaging fellow. Imaging findings before, immediately after, and at short- and long-term follow-up after ablation were recorded. RESULTS Fourteen patients (seven men, seven women; mean age, 56 ± 8.4 years) underwent radiofrequency ablation of adrenal tumors. One case of small pneumothorax and one case of small hemothorax were the only minor complications (complication rate, 14%). The expected side effects of radiofrequency ablation were found in 35% of patients: in two patients adjacent liver parenchyma was ablated, in two patients the diaphragmatic crus was injured, and in two patients local hematoma occurred (in one patient, both adjacent liver and diaphragmatic crus were ablated). Immediate soft-tissue findings after radiofrequency ablation included air bubbles in 12 patients (86%) and fat stranding around the adrenal gland in 13 patients (93%). A fat rim sign was found in 60% of patients at long-term follow-up. The attenuation of the tumor immediately after the procedure increased an average of 7 HU (median, 5 HU; range, -2 to 18 HU) and tended to decrease in long-term follow-up. At long-term follow-up, most (75%) of the tumors had decreased in size and attenuation. CONCLUSION Air bubbles and fat stranding are frequently seen immediately after radiofrequency ablation of adrenal tumors. A fat rim sign is a common finding at long-term follow-up. Attenuation of the ablated zone increases immediately after the procedure and decreases in long-term follow-up. The volume of the ablated zone has a variable size response, suggesting the need for baseline imaging.","Brook, Olga R; Mendiratta-Lala, Mishal; Brennan, Darren; Siewert, Bettina; Faintuch, Salomao; Goldberg, S Nahum",AJR.

Recently, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was shown to exhibit broad host-cell range mediated by surface expression of aminopeptidase N (APN), and humans have been reported to be at risk of PDCoV infection. In the present study, we first demonstrated that overexpression of APN orthologues from various species including mice and felines in the APN-deficient swine small intestine epithelial cells permitted PDCoV infection, confirming that APN broadly facilitates PDCoV cellular entry and perhaps subsequent interspecies transmission. PDCoV was able to limitedly infect mice in vivo, distributing mainly in enteric and lymphoid tissues, suggesting that mice may serve as a susceptible reservoir of PDCoV. Furthermore, elements (two glycosylation sites and four aromatic amino acids) on the surface of domain B (S1B) of the PDCoV spike glycoprotein S1 subunit were identified to be critical for cellular surface binding of APN orthologues. However, both the domain A (S1A) and S1B were able to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies against PDCoV infection. The antibodies against S1A inhibited the hemagglutination activity of PDCoV using erythrocytes from various species, which might account for the neutralizing capacity of S1A antibodies partially through a blockage of sialic acid binding. The study reveals the tremendous potential of PDCoV for interspecies transmission and the role of two major PDCoV S1 domains in receptor binding and neutralization, providing a theoretical basis for development of intervention strategies. Importance Coronaviruses exhibit a tendency for recombination and mutation, which enables them to quickly adapt to various novel hosts. Previously, orthologues of aminopeptidase N (APN) from mammalian and avian species were found to be associated with porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) cellular entry in vitro. Here we provide in vivo evidence that mice are susceptible to PDCoV limited infection. We also show that two major domains (S1A and S1B) of the PDCoV spike glycoprotein involved in APN receptor binding can elicit neutralizing antibodies, identifying two glycosylation sites and four aromatic amino acids on the surface of the S1B domain critical for APN binding, and demonstrating neutralization activity of S1A antibodies is partially attributed to blockage of sugar binding activity. Our findings further implicate PDCoV's great potential for interspecies transmission, and the data of receptor binding and neutralization may provide a basis for development of future intervention strategies.","Liu, Yan; Wang, Bin; Liang, Qi-Zhang; Shi, Fang-Shu; Ji, Chun-Miao; Yang, Xiao-Lian; Yang, Yong-Le; Qin, Pan; Chen, Ruiai; Huang, Yao-Wei",Journal of virology,35,19

It is used as a screening tool for colorectal cancer (CRC) and increasingly to triage patients presenting with symptoms of CRC. A number of quantitative point-of-care (POC) FIT systems marketed for professional use and intended for use in a clinical setting are available. Here we reviewed the POC FIT systems available; three (Eurolyser Cube, OC-Sensor iO and QuikRead go) were evaluated to assess their performance against manufacturersâ claims and suitability for use in a clinical setting.Methods The analytical evaluation of the POC FIT systems was undertaken using Hb lysates, patient samples and an external quality assessment sample. The evaluation focused on linearity, recovery, imprecision, prozone effect, Hb variant detection and suitability for use in a clinical setting. RESULTS All three POC FIT systems performed to their manufacturerâs claims and demonstrated good analytical performance with acceptable linearity, recovery, within- and between-run imprecision. The QuikRead go and OC-Sensor iO were able to accurately detect samples with results above their measuring range. However, because of a prozone effect the Eurolyser Cube gave falsely low results when using high concentrations of Hb. The QuikRead go performed best in the usability assessment due to portability and timeliness of result. CONCLUSION Each system performed according to their manufacturersâ claims. The QuikRead go and OC-Sensor iO are suitable for use. The Eurolyser Cube is not recommended because of the risk of falsely low results.","O'Driscoll, Shane; Carroll, Magdalen; Maclean, William; Piggott, Carolyn J; Benton, Sally C; Jourdan, Iain",Annals of clinical biochemistry,35,1

Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that two commonly cited factors in disease transmission, connectivity among populations and abundant resources, would increase the likelihood of exposure to both pseudorabies virus (PrV) and Brucella spp. (bacterial agent of brucellosis) in wild pigs across the Kissimmee Valley of Florida. Using DNA from 348 wild pigs and sera from 320 individuals at 24 sites, we employed population genetic techniques to infer individual dispersal, and an Akaike information criterion framework to compare candidate logistic regression models that incorporated both dispersal and land cover composition. Our findings suggested that recent dispersal conferred higher odds of exposure to PrV, but not Brucella spp., among wild pigs throughout the Kissimmee Valley region. Odds of exposure also increased in association with agriculture and open canopy pine, prairie, and scrub habitats, likely because of highly localized resources within those land cover types. Because the effect of open canopy on PrV exposure reversed when agricultural cover was available, we suggest that small-scale resource distribution may be more important than overall resource abundance. Our results underscore the importance of studying and managing disease dynamics through multiple processes and spatial scales, particularly for non-native pathogens that threaten wildlife conservation, economy, and public health.","Hernández, Felipe A; Carr, Amanda N; Milleson, Michael P; Merrill, Hunter R; Avery, Michael L; Parker, Brandon M; Pylant, Cortney L; Austin, James D; Wisely, Samantha M",EcoHealth,35,17

There is concern that this technique may not provide an adequate pathway for the bougie and subsequently the tracheal tube, especially in obese patients with deeper airway structures. This could lead to the formation of a false passage, trauma and failure. A novel cricothyroidotomy introducer, 8 mm wide and 170 mm long, with a sharp leading edge and guiding channel to pass a bougie into the trachea, has been designed to complement the scalpel cricothyroidotomy technique. A comparison study of the use of this novel introducer with the scalpel technique in a simulated obese porcine laryngeal model demonstrated shorter insertion times (median (IQR [range]) 85 (65-123 [48-224]) s vs. 84 (72-184 [46-377]) s, p = 0.030). All 26 (100%) participants successfully performed cricothyroidotomy in the introducer group, whereas only 24 (92%) participants were successful in the scalpel group. The introducer group required fewer attempts to access the trachea compared with the scalpel group (p = 0.046). False passages occurred eight (31%) times in the introducer group compared with 17 (65%) times in the scalpel group (p = 0.022). There were no statistical differences in tracheal trauma (p = 0.490), ease of use (p = 0.220) and device preference (p = 0.240).

We report a single surgeon experience using both the MS and VATS approaches to provide additional information on this issue in a setting of uniform patient selection and perioperative management. Our hypothesis was that a VATS approach would provide equivalent or less morbidity than MS despite being applied to a group of patients subjectively selected to be higher risk than those undergoing MS. METHODS : Consecutive patients over a 9-year period underwent LVRS by one surgeon by either MS or VATS in a nonrandomized fashion. Thoracoscopy was selected over MS primarily when the surgeon estimated a greater overall risk profile and thus a greater chance of morbidity/mortality in a particular patient. RESULTS : There were 15 patients in the VATS group and 35 in the MS group. In terms of measures of risk profile, there were no differences between the groups that met statistical significance, but several values trended toward higher risk within the VATS group (eg, age, 63 VATS vs. 59 MS, P = 0.08; moderate pulmonary hypertension, 38% VATS vs. 14% MS, P = 0.11; and residual volume, 241% VATS vs. 226% MS, P = 0.32). With regard to outcomes, operative time was significantly longer in the VATS group (VATS = 155 minutes vs. MS=129 minutes, P = 0.01). All other outcomes, including the incidence of major complications (13.3% VATS vs. 17.1% MS, P = 0.39), were similar between the groups. There was a single death within 90 days (1.9% of entire series; 2.9% of MS group). CONCLUSIONS : In this series, although patients undergoing LVRS by VATS tended to have a higher risk profile, their outcomes were no worse than in those undergoing LVRS by MS. This suggests that the VATS approach to bilateral LVRS may incur slightly less morbidity and thus may be the best option in the most compromised patients who is nonetheless felt will benefit from LVRS.","Puc, Matthew M; Sonnad, Seema S; Shrager, Joseph B",Innovations,35,12

The expected daily incidence rate of heat-related illnesses increased significantly with UTCI temperature (0.12 more illnesses per 1000 registered athletes/°C; 95%CI 0.08-0.16), and was found to double from 25 to 35˚C UTCI. Race walkers (RR=45.5, 95%CI 21.6-96.0) and marathon runners (RR=47.7, 95%CI 23.0-98.8) had higher heat-related illness rates than athletes competing in short-duration disciplines. Higher UTCI temperatures were associated with more heat-related illnesses, with marathon and race walking athletes having higher risk than athletes competing in short-duration disciplines. Heat-related illness prevention strategies should predominantly focus on marathon and race walking events of outdoor athletics championships when high temperatures are forecast.","Hollander, Karsten; Klöwer, Milan; Richardson, Andy; Navarro, Laurent; Racinais, Sébastien; Scheer, Volker; Murray, Andrew; Branco, Pedro; Timpka, Toomas; Junge, Astrid; Edouard, Pascal",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,35,16

Our patients can expect natural and long-lasting results as a direct outcome of our improved understanding and applications of surgical facial anatomy. Rhytidectomy, once an operation of simple well-placed elliptical skin excisions, evolved to include longer skin flaps, skin and platysma flaps with various superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS) manipulations, and various deep plane techniques involving the skin and SMAS as a single unit composite flap. Extended deep plane rhytidectomy and vertical vector neck and SMAS lifting have emerged in recent years as techniques that extend the traditional deep plane dissection into the neck in a subplatysmal plane to allow for release of the platysma from the cervical retaining ligaments. This, ultimately, allows for the creation of a dramatically more youthful appearing face, neck, and jawline.","Luu, Neil N; Friedman, Oren",Facial plastic surgery : FPS,35,17

AIM To assess how obesity affects prognosis in patients with or without inducible ischemic regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) and/or abnormal coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) during stress echocardiography (SE). METHODS In an observational retrospective two- center study design, we analyzed 3249 consecutive patients (1907 men; age 66 ± 12 years; body mass index, BMI, 26.9 ± 4.1 kg/m2) with known (n = 1306) or suspected (n = 1943) CAD who underwent dipyridamole SE with simultaneous evaluation of RWMA and CFVR. All-cause death was the outcome end-point. RESULTS 1075 patients were lean (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), 1523 overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2), and 651 obese (≥30.0 kg/m2). Ischemic test result for RWMA occurred in 28 (3%) lean, 69 (4%) overweight, and 28 (4%) obese patients (p = 0.03). An abnormal CFVR (≤2.0) was found in 281 (26%) lean, 402 (26%) overweight and 170 (26%) obese patients (p = 0.99). During 68 ± 44 months of follow-up, 496 (15%) patients died. At multivariable Cox analysis, BMI ≥ 30 was an independent predictor of reduced mortality in the 878 patients with stress-induced (≥2 segments) RWMA and/or CFVR abnormality (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.84; p = 0.003), while showed no effect at univariate analysis in the 2371 patients with no RWMA and normal CFVR (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.74-1.46; p = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS Obesity exerts a ""paradoxical"" protective effect in patients with stress-induced ischemia and/ or coronary microvascular dysfunction, and shows a neutral effect in patients with normal CFVR and no stress-induced RWMA.","Cortigiani, Lauro; Haberka, Maciej; Ciampi, Quirino; Bovenzi, Francesco; Villari, Bruno; Picano, Eugenio",International journal of obesity,35,16

As the Aedes mosquito predominately lives and breeds in and around people's homes, community participation in MBD management is an important part of preventing MBD outbreaks. Historically, government-led strategies have dominated community participation efforts as opposed to strategies co-designed or led by the community. A scoping review was conducted to describe the community participation and empowering approaches used in Aedes mosquito management specifically in HICs, and to identify any reported outcomes of these methods. A systematic search of peer-reviewed literature using electronic databases Medline (OVID), Web of Science, Scopus and ProQuest-Science and Technology as well as grey literature, found 19 studies that matched the review criteria. The review findings highlight a lack of empirical evidence to inform participatory and empowering approaches to mosquito management in HICs.

In keeping with popular public health discourse of the time, the movement had employed rhetoric associated with sanitary science and liberalism. In the early twentieth century new discoveries in bacteriology were fuelling advances in vaccination and the medical establishment was increasingly pushing for public health to move towards more interventionist medical approaches. With the onset of war in 1914, the medical establishment hoped to persuade the government to introduce compulsory typhoid inoculation for soldiers. This article analyses antivaccination literature, mainstream newspapers and medical press along with parliamentary debates to examine how the British antivaccination movement engaged with this new threat of compulsion by expanding the rhetoric of 'conscience' and emphasising medical freedom while also asserting scientific critique concerning the effectiveness of vaccines and the new laboratory based diagnostic practices. In spite of 'conscience' fitting well with an emerging public health discourse of individual subjectivity, the mainstream press ridiculed the idea of working-class soldiers having a conscience, coalescing around the idea that 'conscientious objection' be reserved for spiritual, philosophical and educated men who objected to military service. Moreover, in spite of engaging in reasoned scientific critique, parliament and press consorted in the demarcation of scientific knowledge as exclusive to medical scientists, reflecting a growing allegiance between the state and the medical establishment during the war. Any scientific arguments critical of medical orthodoxy were subjugated, labelled as 'crank' or 'faddist' as well as unpatriotic. The antivaccination narratives around conscience contributed to or were part of an evolving discourse on consent and ethics in medicine. Potential parallels are drawn with current and likely future debates around vaccination and counterhegemonic scientific approaches.","McPherson, Susan",Medical humanities,35,31

The present study was conducted to investigate effects of gargling with dexamethasone, intravenous dexamethasone injection and the combination of the two on the incidence and severity of POST. Methods Study participants were 96 patients who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy, randomly allocated into three groups. Group G gargled with 0.05% dexamethasone solution and were infused intravenous 0.9% normal saline before general anesthesia; group I gargled with 0.9% normal saline and were infused intravenous 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone; group GI gargled with 0.05% dexamethasone solution and were infused intravenous 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone. The incidence and severity of POST, hoarseness and cough were evaluated and recorded at 1, 6, and 24 h after the surgery. Results There were no significant differences in the total incidence of POST up to 24 postoperative hours among Group G, Group I and Group GI (P = 0.367, Group G incidence = 34.38%, [95% confidence interval, 95% CI = 17.92-50.83], Group I incidence = 18.75%, [95% CI = 5.23-32.27], Group GI incidence = 28.13%, [95% CI = 12.55-43.70]). The other outcomes were comparable among the groups. Conclusions In patients who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy, gargling with 0.05% dexamethasone solution demonstrated the same POST prevention effect as intravenous injection of 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone. The incidence and severity of POST were not significantly different between the combination of gargling with 0.05% dexamethasone solution and intravenous injection of 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone and use of each of the preventive methods alone.","Ki, Seunghee; Myoung, Inwook; Cheong, Soonho; Lim, Sehun; Cho, Kwangrae; Kim, Myoung-Hun; Han, Yongjae; Oh, Minkyung; Park, Yohan; Kim, Kwanghee; Lee, Jeonghan",Anesthesia and pain medicine,35,16

A comprehensive screening tool is therefore necessary to identify these needs. To date, no data exist on satisfaction with medical and therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 in terms of quality and quantity. The aim of this study is to develop a survey for use with COVID-19 patients during and after the end of the acute phase of the disease. METHODS Following the definition of dimensions by a group of experts, and a literature search, proven survey instruments were searched for suitable items. In addition, specific questions were developed based on symptoms, and answer options were created with regard to to the complexity of the questions. RESULTS The COVID-19 Rehabilitation Needs Survey (C19-RehabNeS) consists of the established 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) together with the newly developed COVID-19-Rehabilitation Needs Questionnaire (C19-RehabNeQ) (11 further dimensions, respectively 57 items). CONCLUSION C19-RehabNeS is a comprehensive survey to assess functional limitations and rehabilitation needs during and after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). The strength of this survey is that it combines the assessment of important rehabilitation needs with assessment of satisfaction with the health services, treatment and therapy during the pandemic (C19-RehabNeQ) and assessment of patients' quality of life (SF-36). The C19-RehabNeS survey also enables collection of systematic information on patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome (Long COVID).","Lemhöfer, Christina; Gutenbrunner, Christoph; Schiller, Jörg; Loudovici-Krug, Dana; Best, Norman; Bökel, Andrea; Sturm, Christian",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,35,22

PATIENTS AND METHODS TRPP2 levels in NPC patients with different T stages were detected. Correlation between TRPP2 level and clinical features of NPC patients was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier curves were depicted for assessing the prognostic value of TRPP2 in NPC. Subsequently, regulatory effects of TRPP2 on viability and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU)-positive ratio were determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and EdU assay, respectively. Relative levels of Skp2 and c-Myc in NPC cells transfected with si-TRPP2 were examined. At last, the involvement of c-Myc in TRPP2-regulated proliferative ability of NPC was evaluated by performing rescue experiments. RESULTS TRPP2 was upregulated in NPC tissues. TRPP2 level was higher in NPC patients with T3+T4 than those with T1+T2. Worse survival was observed in NPC patients expressing high level of TRPP2. TRPP2 level was correlated to T stage, N stage, M stage, and locoregional failure of NPC patients. Knockdown of TRPP2 reduced viability and EdU-positive ratio in NPC cells. In addition, relative levels of Skp2 and c-Myc in NPC cells transfected with si-TRPP2 were downregulated. Overexpression of c-Myc could partially reverse the regulatory effects of TRPP2 on NPC proliferation. CONCLUSIONS TRPP2 stimulates NPC cells to proliferate by upregulating expressions of Skp2/c-Myc, thus deteriorating the development of NPC.","Zhang, T; Yu, G-D; Ye, H-P; Jin, Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,35,1

Although mesh erosion appears to be less associated with an abdominal approach, the long-term outcome has not been studied intensively. This study was set up to determine the long-term mesh erosion rate following abdominal pelvic reconstructive surgery. METHODS A prospective, observational cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care setting. All consecutive female patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy and sacrocolporectopexy in 2011 and 2012 were included. Primary outcome was mesh erosion. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation (6 weeks, 1 year, 5 years) with a clinical examination and questionnaire regarding pelvic floor symptoms was performed. Mesh-related complications were assessed using a transparent vaginal speculum, proctoscopy, and digital vaginal and rectal examination. Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated for mesh erosion. A review of the literature on mesh exposure after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy was performed (≥12 months' follow-up). RESULTS Ninety-six of the 130 patients included (73.8%) were clinically examined. Median follow-up time was 48.1 months (range 36.0-62.1). Three mesh erosions were diagnosed (3.1%; Kaplan-Meier 4.9%, 95% confidence interval 0-11.0): one bladder erosion for which mesh resection and an omental patch interposition were performed, and two asymptomatic vaginal erosions (at 42.7 and 42.3 months) treated with estrogen cream in one. Additionally, 22 patients responded solely by questionnaire and/or telephone; none reported mesh-related complaints. The literature, mostly based on retrospective studies, described a median mesh erosion rate of 1.9% (range 0-13.3%). CONCLUSIONS The long-term rate of mesh erosion following an abdominally placed synthetic graft is low.","van Zanten, Femke; van Iersel, Jan J; Paulides, Tim J C; Verheijen, Paul M; Broeders, Ivo A M J; Consten, Esther C J; Lenters, Egbert; Schraffordt Koops, Steven E",International urogynecology journal,35,1

Such characteristics are also observed between different regions of the same country. Herewith, we introduce a general method that allows us to compare the pandemic evolution in different localities inside a large territorial country. To evaluate our method, we study the heterogeneous spreading of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil and its 27 states. Each one of the states may be considered a cluster of interacting people with similar habits and distributed to a highly heterogeneous demographic density over the entire country. Our first set of results regarding the time-series analysis shows that: (i) a power-law growth of the cumulative number of infected people is observed for states of the five regions of Brazil; and (ii) the Distance Correlation (DC) calculated between the time series of the most affected states and the curve that describes the evolution of the pandemic in Brazil remains about 1 over most of the time, while such quantity calculated for the states with a low incidence of newly infected people remains about 0.95. By applying the epidemiological SIRD model we estimated the Effective Reproduction Number (ERN) Reand found that: (i) the mean value of Refor the eight most affected states in Brazil is about 2, and (ii) the current value of Refor Brazil is greater than 1, which indicates that the epidemic peak is far off. Based on these findings, we projected the effects of increase/decrease of the ERN and concluded that if the value of Reincreases 20%, not only the peak might grow at least 40% but also its occurrence might be anticipated, which hastens the collapse of the public health-care system.","Da Silva, Rafael Marques; Mendes, Carlos Fabio; Manchein, Cesar",Physical biology,35,24

Bariatric surgery patients are potentially at a higher risk for sedation-related complications due to co-morbidities including obstructive sleep apnea. The outcomes of NAAP in bariatric patients have not been previously reported. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, severely obese patients undergoing pre-surgical outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) were compared to non-obese control patients (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2) undergoing diagnostic EGD at our institution from March 2011-September 2015 using our endoscopy database. Patients' demographics and procedural and recovery data, including any airway interventions, were statistically analyzed. RESULTS We included 130 consecutive pre-operative bariatric surgical patients with average BMI 45.8 kg/m2 (range 34-80) and 265 control patients with average BMI 21.9 kg/m2 (range 14-25). The severely obese group had a higher prevalence of sleep apnea (62 vs 8%; p < 0.001), experienced more oxygen desaturations (22 vs 7%; p < 0.001), and received more chin lift maneuvers (20 vs 6%; p < 0.001). Advanced airway interventions were rarely required in either group and were not more frequent in the bariatric group.

As a source, contaminants are derived from both 'geogenic' and 'anthropogenic' origins. Typically, while some of the inorganic contaminants including potentially toxic elements are derived from geogenic origin (e.g. arsenic and selenium) through weathering of parent materials, the majority of organic (e.g. pesticides and microplastics) as well as inorganic (e.g. lead, cadmium) contaminants are derived from anthropogenic origin. As a sink, soil plays a critical role in the transformation of these contaminants and their subsequent transfer to environmental compartments, including groundwater (e.g. pesticides), surface water (phosphate and nitrate), ocean (e.g. microplastics) and atmosphere (e.g. nitrous oxide emission). A complex transformation process of contaminants in soil involving adsorption, precipitation, redox reactions and biodegradation control the mobility, bioavailability and environmental toxicity of these contaminants. Soil also plays a major role in the decontamination of contaminants, and the 'cleaning' action of soil is controlled primarily by the physico-chemical interactions of contaminants with various soil components, and the biochemical transformations facilitated by soil microorganisms. In this article, we examine the geogenic and anthropogenic sources of contaminants reaching the soil, and discuss the role of soil in the sequestration and decontamination of contaminants in relation to various physico-chemical and microbial transformation reactions of contaminants with various soil components. Finally, we propose future actions that would help to maintain the role of soils in protecting the environment from contaminants and delivering sustainable development goals.

We studied the impact of several key parameters to image retrieval, including image pixel count, fiber core diameter and numerical aperture. We further demonstrated with experiments and numerical simulations that a wide variety of input binary and gray scale images could be faithfully retrieved from the corresponding output speckle patterns.

METHODS In 46 patients, hyperfibrinolysis was diagnosed immediately upon emergency department admission using rotational thromboelastometry and defined as a lysis more than 15%. Simultaneously, initial cerebral tissue oxygenation was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy, and oxygen desaturation was defined as a tissue oxygenation index (TOI) of 50% or less. Blood sample analysis included markers for hypoperfusion and fibrinolysis. RESULTS There was no difference in prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration between patients with or without hyperfibrinolysis. An initial TOI of 50% or less was associated with more clot lysis (91% [17 to 100%; n = 16]) compared with patients with a normal TOI (6% [4 to 11%]; n = 30; P < 0.001), with lower levels of plasminogen (151.6 ± 61.0 vs. 225.3 ± 47.0 μg/ml; P < 0.001) and higher levels of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA; 18.3 ± 7.4 vs. 7.9 ± 4.7 ng/ml; P < 0.001) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (19.3 ± 8.9 vs. 12.1 ± 6.1 ng/ml; P = 0.013). There were no differences in (activated) protein C levels among groups. The initial TOI was negatively correlated with t-PA (r = -0.69; P < 0001). Mortality rates were highest in patients with hyperfibrinolysis. CONCLUSION Activation of the fibrinolytic system is more common in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with an initial cerebral tissue oxygenation value of 50% or less during resuscitation and is linked to increased levels of t-PA rather than involvement of protein C.","Duvekot, Anne; Viersen, Victor A; Dekker, Simone E; Geeraedts, Leo M G; Schwarte, Lothar A; Spoelstra-Man, Angelique M E; van de Ven, Peter M; van den Brom, Charissa E; de Waard, Monique C; Loer, Stephan A; Boer, Christa",Anesthesiology,35,16

The aim of this survival study is to evaluate pure (totally) transvaginal NOTES bacterial contamination compared with laparoscopy in pigs. METHODS Twelve adult female pigs underwent peritoneoscopy with liver and peritoneal biopsies, using either laparoscopy (Glap, six animals) or pure transvaginal (GNOTES) access, and were maintained alive for 7 days. In all animals, blood cultures were taken at baseline, and after 24 h and 7 days postoperatively. Swab cultures from vagina (GNOTES) and skin (Glap) were obtained pre- and post-antisepsis. Peritoneal fluid culture was obtained at necropsy. For statistical analysis, Glap and GNOTES were compared for presence of positive bacterial cultures (qualitative bacterial analysis) using Fisher's test, with level of significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS All animals had good postoperative outcome. One animal had transient perioperative bleeding from a transvaginal access. Two animals in Glap and one in GNOTES had positive blood cultures after the procedure. All animals from GNOTES and Glap presented with mixed flora pre-antisepsis. After antisepsis, one animal (GNOTES) presented with a positive vaginal swab culture (a single bacterial strain was identified). There was no positive skin swab culture in Glap. There were no signs of intra-abdominal infection at necropsy. In two animals, one from Glap and another from GNOTES, intra-abdominal culture was positive for Corynebacterium spp. and Escherichia coli, respectively. There was no correlation between the bacterial flora found at the access site and in the peritoneal cultures. CONCLUSIONS Pure transvaginal peritoneoscopy with liver and peritoneal biopsy in swine is feasible and associated with bacterial contamination comparable to laparoscopy. Peritoneal bacterial contamination was clinically insignificant after 1 week postoperatively. Preoperative antisepsis provided significant reduction of bacterial load prior to transvaginal and laparoscopic procedures.","Aimore Bonin, Eduardo; Claus, Christiano Marlo Paggi; Torres, Maria Fernanda; Campos, Antonio Carlos Ligocki; Cavazzola, Leandro Totti; de Paula Loureiro, Marcelo",Surgical endoscopy,35,1

The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between oversize and treatment outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS The DynaCT images of 14 aneurysms treated by a single Pipeline Embolization Device were retrospectively analyzed. 3D images of the deployed device were compared with those acquired at the 6-month follow-up for qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The diameter and length of the Pipeline Embolization Device were measured at both time points and compared for determination of the device changes. RESULTS Structural changes of the device have been observed, and it was found that the Pipeline Embolization Device influences the vessel curvature in some cases. On average, it increases its diameter by 0.23 mm and decreases its length by 2.88 mm within 6 months of initial deployment. Excessive elongation beyond its nominal length is correlated with a lower aneurysm occlusion rate at the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Not only does a Pipeline Embolization Device reconstruct the aneurysm and parent artery, but its entire structure goes through a gradual remodeling process. The relative deformation between the device and the artery indicates suboptimal wall apposition. Device oversizing does not have a direct effect on shortening or recoil. The aneurysm occlusion rate, however, is lowered by overelongation of the Pipeline Embolization Device.","Jou, L-D; Mitchell, B D; Shaltoni, H M; Mawad, M E",AJNR.

Prior to the introduction of this scheme, the government's main measure for giving financial protection to retirees was the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) scheme, which is a noncontributory, means-tested financial assistance scheme. This paper studies the government's attempt to introduce the MPF on top of the CSSA scheme as a means to illustrate how governments might address their financial responsibilities in providing pension schemes by adopting both the residual strategy-centered reform approach and the collaborative strategy-centered reform approach. The former approach is concerned with developing noncontributory schemes using residual strategies, and the latter is concerned with developing contributory schemes using collaborative strategies. The paper shows the difficulties involved in carrying out these two reform approaches simultaneously.","Yu, Sam Wai-Kam",Journal of aging & social policy,35,27

The title compound in centrosymmetric space group Cmcm contains dimers of two ScO6 octahedra sharing corners with three bridging WO4 tetrahedra. Three pairs of opposite terminal WO4 tetrahedra are additionally linked by AgO2 dumbbells to form {Ag3[Sc2(WO4)9]}9- groups, which together with some rubidium ions are packed in pseudohexagonal glaserite-like layers parallel to (001), but stacking of the layers is different in these three structures.

Little is known about this storage because geochemical and geophysical observations are limited to pits, boreholes, or outcrops or to inferences based on indirect measurements between these sites. We trained a rock physics model to borehole observations in a well-constrained ridge and valley landscape and then interpreted spatial variations in seismic refraction velocities. We discovered that P-wave velocities track where a porosity-generating reaction initiates in shale in three boreholes across the landscape. Specifically, velocities of 2.7 ± 0.2 km/s correspond with growth of porosity from dissolution of chlorite, the most reactive of the abundant minerals in the shale. In addition, sonic velocities are consistent with the presence of gas bubbles beneath the water table under valley and ridge. We attribute this gas largely to CO2 produced by 1) microbial respiration in soils as meteoric waters recharge into the subsurface and 2) the coupled carbonate dissolution and pyrite oxidation at depth in the rock. Bubbles may nucleate below the water table because waters depressurize as they flow from ridge to valley and because pores have dilated as the deep rock has been exhumed by erosion. Many of these observations are likely to also describe the weathering and flow path patterns in other headwater landscapes. Such combined geophysical and geochemical observations will help constrain models predicting flow, storage, and reaction of groundwater in bedrock systems.","Gu, Xin; Mavko, Gary; Ma, Lisa; Oakley, David; Accardo, Natalie; Carr, Bradley J; Nyblade, Andrew A; Brantley, Susan L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,35,7

We described how the pandemic affected a tertiary care children hospital with a dedicated COVID-19 regional center. METHODS We analyzed the characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits, urgent hospitalizations and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-COV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, and COVID-19 patients across 3 response phases: before the first Italian case, before national lockdown and during lockdown. RESULTS ED visits decreased from a daily mean of 239.1 before the first COVID-19 Italian case, to 79.6 during lockdown; urgent hospitalizations decreased from 30.6 to 21.2. As of April 20, 2020, 1970 persons were tested for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 2.6% were positive. Positive rates were 1.2% in the ED, 21.1% in the COVID center and 0.5% in other wards. The median age of COVID-19 patients (N = 33) was 6.7 years, 27% had coexisting conditions and 79% were related to family clusters. CONCLUSIONS The pandemic strongly impacted on the use of hospital services, with a 67% reduction in ED visits and a 31% reduction in urgent hospitalizations. Separating the flows of suspected patients from all other patients, and centralization of suspected and confirmed cases in the COVID center enabled to control the risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Delay in hospital use for urgent care must be avoided, and clear communication on infection prevention and control must be provided to families. Further studies are needed to assess how the reduction in hospital use affected children healthcare needs during the pandemic.","Ciofi Degli Atti, Marta Luisa; Campana, Andrea; Muda, Andrea Onetti; Concato, Carlo; Ravà, Lucilla; Ricotta, Lara; Reale, Antonino; Barbieri, Maria; D'Argenio, Patrizia; Lancella, Laura; Villani, Alberto; Raponi, Massimiliano",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,35,16

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can repress inflammatory cytokines and show great potential for ischemic stroke therapy. However, the effect of MSCs regarding the protection of ischemia-induced BBB break down is unknown. OBJECTIVE We test whether MSCs therapy protects BBB integrity and explore the molecular mechanisms of aquaporin-4 on BBB integrity. METHODS AND RESULTS Two hundred and twenty-eight adult CD1 male mice underwent 90 minutes transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and received 2 × 10(5) MSCs intracranial transplantation. The neurological severity score was improved and both ischemia-induced brain edema and BBB leakage were reduced in MSC-treated mice. MSCs therapy reduced astrocyte apoptosis and inhibited ischemia-induced aquaporin-4 upregulation. In addition, small-interfering RNA knockdown of aquaporin-4 after cerebral ischemia effectively reduced aquaporin-4 expression, brain edema, BBB leakage, and astrocyte apoptosis. Conditional medium from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia enhanced aquaporin-4 expression, p38 and JNK phosphorylation, and apoptosis of cultured astrocytes. MSC treatment reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-activated microglia, and subsequently reduced aquaporin-4 expression and apoptosis of astrocytes. Knockdown of aquaporin-4 in cultured astrocytes also reduced apoptosis. Treatment with p38 and JNK inhibitors showed that p38, but not the JNK signaling pathway, was responsible for the aquaporin-4 upregulation. CONCLUSION MSCs protected BBB integrity by reducing the apoptosis of astrocytes after ischemic attack, which was due to the attenuation of inflammatory response and downregulation of aquaporin-4 expression via p38 signaling pathway.","Tang, Guanghui; Liu, Yanqun; Zhang, Zhijun; Lu, Yifan; Wang, Yang; Huang, Jun; Li, Yaning; Chen, Xiaoyan; Gu, Xiang; Wang, Yongting; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Stem cells,35,2

We collected 92 sera specimens from patients with non-A-E hepatitis in Chongqing, China between 1999 and 2007. Ten sera pools were screened by Solexa deep sequencing. We discovered a 3,780-bp contig present in all 10 pools that yielded BLASTx E scores of 7e-05-0.008 against parvoviruses. The complete sequence of the in silico-assembled 3,780-bp contig was confirmed by gene amplification of overlapping regions over almost the entire genome, and the virus was provisionally designated NIH-CQV. Further analysis revealed that the contig was composed of two major ORFs. By protein BLAST, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to the replication-associated protein of bat circovirus and the capsid protein of porcine parvovirus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NIH-CQV is located at the interface of Parvoviridae and Circoviridae. Prevalence of NIH-CQV in patients was determined by quantitative PCR. Sixty-three of 90 patient samples (70%) were positive, but all those from 45 healthy controls were negative. Average virus titer in the patient specimens was 1.05 e4 copies/µL.

Damage to healthy tissue in the radiation field can cause undesirable toxic effects leading to gastrointestinal complications called pelvic radiation disease. A change in the composition and/or function of the microbiota could contribute to radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. In this study, we tested the prophylactic effect of a new generation of probiotic like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) on acute radiation-induced colonic lesions. Experiments were carried out in a preclinical model of pelvic radiation disease. Rats were locally irradiated at 29 Gray in the colon resulting in colonic epithelial barrier rupture. Three days before the irradiation and up to 3 d after the irradiation, the F. prausnitzii A2-165 strain was administered daily (intragastrically) to test its putative protective effects. Results showed that prophylactic F. prausnitzii treatment limits radiation-induced para-cellular hyperpermeability, as well as the infiltration of neutrophils (MPO+ cells) in the colonic mucosa. Moreover, F. prausnitzii treatment reduced the severity of the morphological change of crypts, but also preserved the pool of Sox-9+ stem/progenitor cells, the proliferating epithelial PCNA+ crypt cells and the Dclk1+/IL-25+ differentiated epithelial tuft cells. The benefit of F. prausnitzii was associated with increased production of IL-18 by colonic crypt epithelial cells. Thus, F. prausnitzii treatment protected the epithelial colonic barrier from colorectal irradiation. New-generation probiotics may be promising prophylactic treatments to reduce acute side effects in patients treated with radiation therapy and may improve their quality of life.","Lapiere, Alexia; Geiger, Mallia; Robert, Véronique; Demarquay, Christelle; Auger, Sandrine; Chadi, Sead; Benadjaoud, Mohamedamine; Fernandes, Gabriel; Milliat, Fabien; Langella, Philippe; Benderitter, Marc; Chatel, Jean-Marc; Sémont, Alexandra",Gut microbes,35,31

Of particular interest is in situ persistence of eDNA signals in dynamic marine environments, as eDNA degradation rates have predominantly been quantified through mesocosm studies. To determine in situ eDNA residence times, we introduced an eDNA signal from a non-native fish into a protected bay of a Southern California rocky reef ecosystem, and then measured changes in both introduced and background eDNA signals across a fixed transect over 96 hours. Foreign eDNA signal was no longer detected only 7.5 hours after introduction, a time substantially shorter than the multi-day persistence times in laboratory studies. Moreover, the foreign eDNA signal spread along the entire 38 m transect within 1.5 hours after introduction, indicating that transport and diffusion play a role in eDNA detectability even in protected low energy marine environments. Similarly, native vertebrate eDNA signals varied greatly over the 96 hours of observation as well as within two additional nearby fixed transects sampled over 120 hours. While community structure did significantly change across time of day and tidal direction, neither accounted for the majority of observed variation. Combined, results show that both foreign and native eDNA signatures can exhibit substantial temporal heterogeneity, even on hourly time scales. Further work exploring eDNA decay from lagrangian perspective and quantifying effects of sample and technical replication are needed to better understand temporal variation of eDNA signatures in nearshore marine environments.","Ely, Taylor; Barber, Paul H; Man, Lauren; Gold, Zachary",PloS one,35,1

METHODS Six patients, considered high risk for open surgery, were treated with a custom-made branched stent-graft. Two patients had aortic arch aneurysms, three had descending thoracic aortic aneurysms involving the distal arch, and one had a saccular aneurysm of the arch adjacent to the origin of the innominate artery. All patients had undergone a staged left carotid subclavian bypass before the endovascular procedure. Each branched graft had a 12-mm side branch for the innominate artery and an 8-mm side branch for the left common carotid artery. The branches were extended into their respective target arteries with covered self-expanding stents. RESULTS Aneurysm exclusion without endoleak was successful in 5 of the 6 patients, and 11 of the 12 target vessels were successfully cannulated and preserved. Patient 1 developed a type I endoleak that was managed successfully with coiling and gluing of the aneurysm sac. Patients 2, 3, 5, and 6 had uneventful placement of the prostheses, with successful exclusion of the aneurysm sac. In patient 4, cannulation of the innominate branch was unsuccessful, and an extra-anatomic bypass was necessary to perfuse the right carotid and vertebral arteries. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated the technical feasibility of a modular transfemoral branched stent-graft for treatment of aortic arch aneurysms.

METHODS A detailed review of the literature is done on the technologies of Industry 4.0 and their applications in the COVID-19 pandemic, using appropriate search words on the databases of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate. RESULTS We found several useful technologies of Industry 4.0 which help for proper control and management of COVID-19 pandemic and these have been discussed in this paper. The available technologies of Industry 4.0 could also help the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 and other related problems and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Industry 4.0 can fulfil the requirements of customised face masks, gloves, and collect information for healthcare systems for proper controlling and treating of COVID-19 patients. We have discussed ten major technologies of Industry 4.0 which help to solve the problems of this virus.

In general the essential objectives for thyroidectomy are: sparing the parathyroid glands, avoidance of injury to the laryngeal nerves, an accurate hemostasis and an excellent cosmesis. In the last 10 years, major improvements and new technologies have been proposed and applied in thyroid surgery. These include mini-invasive thyroidectomy, new devices for achieving hemostasis and dissection, regional anesthesia, intraoperative neuromonitoring, parathyroid hormone assay technology and genetic screening. This paper reviews the relevant medical literature published on the influence of these new technologies on the quality of thyroid surgery, as well as prevention of postoperative morbidity and mortality.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the risk factors for acute UD after laparoscopic low anterior resection (LALAR) for rectal cancer in patients receiving epidural analgesia. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted on 131 patients who underwent LALAR among those receiving epidural analgesia in a single institution between October 2008 and December 2019. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the clinicopathological factors associated with acute UD. RESULTS The overall incidence of acute UD was 16.0% (21/131). Univariate analysis showed that older age (P = 0.016) and earlier urinary catheter removal (P = 0.036) were associated with acute UD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that older age (10-year increments; odds ratio (OR) 2.046, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.171-3.543, P = 0.011), urinary catheter removal before epidural analgesia discontinuation (OR 6.393, 95% CI 1.540-26.534, P = 0.011), and a large tumor circumference rate (10% increments; OR 1.263, 95% CI 1.043-1.530, P = 0.017) were independent risk factors for acute UD. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that older age, early removal of urinal catheter before epidural analgesia discontinuation, and large tumor circumference rate are risk factors of acute UD after LALAR for rectal cancer in patients receiving epidural analgesia.","Hiraki, Masatsugu; Tanaka, Toshiya; Sadashima, Eiji; Sato, Hirofumi; Kitahara, Kenji",International journal of colorectal disease,35,7

RIN13 (RPM1-interacting protein 13) was previously reported to enhance disease resistance, and suppress RPM1 (a CNL type NLR)-mediated hypersensitive response in Arabidopsis via a yet unknown mechanism. Here, we show that RIN13 is a nucleus-localized protein, and functions in the nucleus. Overexpression of RIN13 leads to autoimmunity with high accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), constitutive expressions of pathogenesis-related genes, enhanced resistance to virulent pathogen, and dwarfism. In addition, genetic and transcriptome analysis show that SA-dependent and SA-independent pathways are both required for RIN13-mediated disease resistance with EDS1/PAD4 complex as an integration point. RIN13-induced dwarfism was rescued completely by either mutant pad4-1 or eds1-2 but partially by snc1-r1, a mutant of the TNL gene SNC1, suggesting the involvement of EDS1/PAD4 and SNC1 in RIN13 functioning. Furthermore, transient expression assays indicated that RIN13 promotes the nuclear accumulation of PAD4. Collectively, our study uncovered a signalling pathway whereby SNC1 and EDS1/PAD4 act together to modulate RIN13-triggered plant defense responses.","Liu, Xiaoxiao; Liu, Hui; He, Jingjing; Zhang, Siyuan; Han, Hui; Wang, Zhangying; Liu, Wen-Cheng; Liang, Yun-Kuan; Gao, Zhiyong",Journal of experimental botany,35,1

Tissue engineering holds great promise as a potential solution with its ability to integrate cells and signaling molecules into a 3-dimensional scaffold. Recent work with tissue engineered tracheal grafts (TETGs) has seen some success but their translation has been limited by graft stenosis, graft collapse, and delayed epithelialization. In order to investigate the mechanisms driving these issues, we have developed a mouse model for tissue engineered tracheal graft implantation. TETGs were constructed using electrospun polymers polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyurethane (PU) in a mixture of PET and PU (20:80 percent weight). Scaffolds were then seeded using bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from 6-8 week-old C57BL/6 mice by gradient centrifugation. Ten million cells per graft were seeded onto the lumen of the scaffold and allowed to incubate overnight before implantation between the third and seventh tracheal rings. These grafts were able to recapitulate the findings of stenosis and delayed epithelialization as demonstrated by histological analysis and lack of Keratin 5 and Keratin 14 basal epithelial cells on immunofluorescence. This model will serve as a tool for investigating cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in host remodeling.","Wiet, Matthew G; Dharmadhikari, Sayali; White, Audrey; Reynolds, Susan D; Johnson, Jed; Breuer, Christopher K; Chiang, Tendy",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,35,1

There are significant differences in therapeutic strategies of the different NEN subtypes, and therefore, precise classification of pulmonary NENs is critical. However, challenges in pulmonary NEN classification include overlap of diagnostic histological features among the subtypes and reduced or negative expression of neuroendocrine markers in poorly differentiated pulmonary NECs. Recently, transcription factor insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) was identified as a sensitive marker of neuroendocrine and neuroepithelial differentiation. In this study, INSM1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in greater than 94% of pulmonary NENs, indicating that it is a highly sensitive marker of pulmonary NENs and is useful to detect poorly differentiated pulmonary NECs. Although there are well-established morphological and immunohistologic criteria to diagnose pulmonary NENs, there is no universal consensus regarding prognostic markers of pulmonary NENs. Studies have shown that non-small cell lung cancers express long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which regulate gene expression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and carcinogenesis. We characterized expression and function of lncRNAs, including HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), maternally expressed 3 (MEG3), and prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) in pulmonary NENs, including typical carcinoid tumors, atypical carcinoid tumors, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC/NEC), and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC/NEC). In situ hybridization and real-time polymerase chain reaction studies showed higher expression (p < 0.01) of all lncRNAs in SCLC/NEC. Small interfering RNA studies indicated a role for MEG3 and PCA3 in tumor proliferation. Therefore, these lncRNAs may serve as prognostic indicators of pulmonary NEN aggressiveness and as possible therapeutic targets.","Narayanan, Damodaran; Mandal, Rakesh; Hardin, Heather; Chanana, Vishal; Schwalbe, Michael; Rosenbaum, Jason; Buehler, Darya; Lloyd, Ricardo V",Endocrine pathology,35,1

Restoration of biomechanics such as leg length, femoral und acetabular offset is crucial in THA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative differences of these parameters after THA and to analyze their association to greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of trochanteric pain syndrome compared to patient reported outcome measures. 3D-CT scans of 90 patients were analyzed after minimalinvasive total hip arthroplasty and leg length, femoral and acetabular offset differences were measured. Clinical evaluation was performed three years after THA regarding the presence of trochanteric pain syndrome and using outcome measures. Furthermore, the patients' expectation were evaluated. Patients with trochanteric pain syndrome showed a higher absolute discrepancy of combined leg length, femoral and acetabular offset restoration compared to the non-operated contralateral side with 11.8 ± 6.0 mm than patients without symptoms in the trochanteric region with 7.8 ± 5.3 mm (p = 0.01). Patients with an absolute deviation of the combined parameters of more than 5 mm complained more frequently about trochanteric symptoms (29.2%, 19/65) than patients with a biomechanical restoration within 5 mm compared to the non-affected contralateral side (8.0%, 2/25, p = 0.03). Clinical outcome measured three years after THA was significantly lower in patients with trochanteric symptoms than without trochanteric pain (p < 0.03). Similarly, fulfillment of patient expectations as measured by THR-Survey was lower in the patients with trochanteric pain (p < 0.005). An exact combined restoration of leg length, acetabular and femoral offset reduces significantly postoperative trochanteric pain syndrome and improves the clinical outcome of the patients.","Worlicek, Michael; Messmer, Benedikt; Grifka, Joachim; Renkawitz, Tobias; Weber, Markus",Scientific reports,35,27

Historically, the assessment of postoperative pain in rodents has relied on evoked withdrawal or reflexive measures. Using a recently developed, anatomically relevant rat model of acute postoperative pain (J Pain, 16, 2015, 421), the present experiments sought to investigate the affective component of acute postoperative pain associated with inguinal hernia repair. METHODS Male Lister hooded rats underwent surgery to model Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair (without hernia induction), or a sham procedure. Postsurgical characterization involved a modified place escape/avoidance paradigm (mPEAP), as well as home cage and open field locomotor activity monitoring. In pharmacological validation studies, rats received either morphine or carprofen prior to mPEAP testing. RESULTS Surgery was associated with a significantly increased proportion of the trial duration in the light compartment of the mPEAP arena, in avoidance of the noxious stimulus, compared with sham animals. When retested in the mPEAP at day 7 postsurgery, there was no difference between sham and surgery animals for time spent in either compartment, but surgery animals displayed a persistent increase in the percentage response to noxious stimulation. Morphine and carprofen treatment in surgery animals reduced escape/avoidance behavior at discrete time points over the trial. Surgery-induced reductions in home cage and open field locomotor activity were also observed. CONCLUSION The present studies report for the first time the characterization of the affective component of acute postoperative pain using the mPEAP in a rodent model, which may facilitate development of improved understanding and treatment of postoperative pain.","Bree, Dara; Moriarty, Orla; Broom, Daniel C; Kelly, John P; Roche, Michelle; Finn, David P",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,35,1

METHODS Between November 2010 and December 2013, 30 male patients had undergone laparoscopic radical cystectomy with bilateral standard pelvic lymphadenectomy and pure laparoscopic orthotopic ileal U-shaped neobladder diversion. The demographic data were as follows: median age, 67 years (range, 62-79); body mass index, 22.3 kg/m(2) (range, 16-26.1 kg/m(2)); and mean American Society of Anesthesiologists score 2.2 (range, 1-3). Functional outcomes were assessed performing a standard VUDM study combined with perineal floor electromyography 180 days postoperatively. RESULTS VUDM evaluations showed good functional outcomes of the reservoirs. Mean maximal neobladder capacity was 287 mL (range, 210-335 mL). Residual peristaltic activity was observed in all the individuals evaluated; however, only 9 of 30 individuals (30%) displayed severe peristaltic activity. Six of these 9 individuals (66.6%) experienced urinary leakage during these contractions. Mean postvoid residual volume was 44 mL (range, 0-105 mL), and peak flow rate was 13.9 mL/s (range, 9.7-29.2 mL/s). The Valsalva maneuver was positive in 5 of 30 subjects (17%). Bladder morphology assessed during contrast cystography showed the desired U-shape in all cases. Ureteral reflux was observed in 7 of 30 individuals (23.3%). CONCLUSION Based on VUDM, our study shows that U-shaped ileal neobladders achieved by a totally laparoscopic approach obtained good functional outcomes. These findings support the evidence that a minimally invasive approach does not impose technical limitations that negatively impact the surgical results.","Palleschi, Giovanni; Pastore, Antonio Luigi; Ripoli, Andrea; Silvestri, Luigi; Petrozza, Vincenzo; Carbone, Antonio",Urology,35,1

However, MPV carries a risk of underventilation. Our purpose here was to evaluate the effectiveness of daytime MPV under real-life conditions. Eight wheelchair-bound patients who used MPV underwent daytime polygraphy at home with recordings of airflow, mouthpiece pressure, thoracic and abdominal movements, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), and transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PtcCO2). Times and durations of tasks and activities were recorded. The Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) was computed. Patient-ventilator disconnections ≥3 minutes and episodes of hypoventilation defined as PtcCO2>45 mmHg were counted. Patient-ventilator asynchrony events were analyzed. The AHI was >5 hour(-1) in two patients. Another patient experienced unexplained 3% drops in arterial oxygen saturations at a frequency of 70 hour(-1). Patient-ventilator disconnections ≥3 minutes occurred in seven of eight patients and were consistently associated with decreases in SpO2 and ≥5-mmHg increases in PtcCO2; PtcCO2 rose above 45 mmHg in two patients during these disconnections. The most common type of patient-ventilator asynchrony was ineffective effort. This study confirms that MPV can be effective as long as the patient remains connected to the mouthpiece. However, transient arterial oxygen desaturation and hypercapnia due to disconnection from the ventilator may occur, without inducing unpleasant sensations in the patients. Therefore, an external warning system based on a minimal acceptable value of minute ventilation would probably be useful.","Nardi, Julie; Leroux, Karl; Orlikowski, David; Prigent, Hélène; Lofaso, Frédéric",Chronic respiratory disease,35,7

Eukaryotes use a series of complementary pathways to efficiently recognize and dispose of these terminally misfolded proteins. In this process, collectively termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD), misfolded proteins are retrotranslocated to the cytosol, polyubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome. Although there has been great progress in identifying ERAD components, how these factors accurately identify substrates remains poorly understood. The targeting of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER lumen for ERAD requires the lectin Yos9, which recognizes the glycan species found on terminally misfolded proteins. In a role that remains poorly characterized, Yos9 also binds the protein component of ERAD substrates. Here, we identified a 45-kDa domain of Yos9, consisting of residues 22-421, that is proteolytically stable, highly structured, and able to fully support ERAD in vivo. In vitro binding studies show that Yos9(22-421) exhibits sequence-specific recognition of linear peptides from the ERAD substrate, carboxypeptidase Y G255R (CPY*), and binds a model unfolded peptide ΔEspP and protein Δ131Δ in solution. Binding of Yos9 to these substrates results in their cooperative aggregation. Although the physiological consequences of this substrate-induced aggregation remain to be seen, it has the potential to play a role in the regulation of ERAD.","Smith, Melanie H; Rodriguez, Edwin H; Weissman, Jonathan S",The Journal of biological chemistry,35,1

METHODS Peripheral blood samples of the child and his parents were collected for the extraction of genomic DNA. The 5 exons and exon/intronic boundaries of the CD40L gene were subjected to PCR amplification and sequencing. Suspected variants were analyzed by using bioinformatic software. The JCV gene was amplified from genomic DNA by nested PCR and sequenced. RESULTS The child was found to harbor a hemizygous c.506 A>C (p.Y169S) missense variant in exon 5 of the CD40L gene. The variant may affect the TNFH domain of the CD40L protein and result in structural instability and loss of hydrophobic interaction between CD40L and CD40. As predicted by PolyPhen2 and SIFT software, the variant was probably damaging (score = 1.00) and deleterious (score= -8.868). His mother was found to be a heterozygous carrier, while the same variant was not found in his father. Gel electrophoresis of the nested PCR product revealed presence of target JCV band, which was confirmed to be 99% identical with the JCV gene by sequencing.

METHODS A comprehensive literature search was undertaken in the databases MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid CENTRAL) and Scopus. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that assessed adverse events (AEs) with COX-2 inhibitors in patients with OA were eligible for inclusion. Two authors appraised titles, abstracts and full-text papers for suitability and then assessed the studies for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data and selective outcomes reporting. The primary outcomes of interest were gastrointestinal disorders, cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, nervous system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, hepatobiliary disorders, renal and urinary disorders, as well as overall severe and serious AEs, drug-related AEs and mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to AEs (i.e. the number of participants who stopped the treatment due to an AE) and total number of AEs (i.e. the number of patients who experienced any AE at least once). RESULTS Database searches identified 2149 records from which, after exclusions, 40 trials were included in the meta-analysis. The use of COX-2 inhibitors in OA was associated with a significant increased risk of drug-related AEs compared with placebo (relative risk (RR) 1.26, 95% CI 1.09-1.46; I2 = 24%). The risk of upper gastrointestinal complications (including dyspepsia, gastritis and heartburn) was significantly increased with COX-2 inhibitors versus placebo (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.38; I2 = 0%), particularly for abdominal pain, which increased by 40% with COX-2 inhibitors (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.08-1.80; I2 = 0%). The risk of hypertension increased by 45% overall (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.01-2.10; I2 = 25%); however, when rofecoxib was removed from the analysis the risk of hypertension in the COX-2 inhibitor group was no longer significant (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.80-1.83; I2 = 20%). The overall risk of heart failure and edema was increased by nearly 70% with COX-2 inhibitors versus placebo (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.22-2.31; 0%) and this level of risk did not change appreciably when rofecoxib was excluded (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.21-2.29; 0%). CONCLUSIONS In our analysis, COX-2 inhibitors were associated with an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal AEs, especially abdominal pain. We also found an increased risk of cardiovascular AEs with COX-2 inhibitors, namely hypertension, heart failure and edema.","Curtis, Elizabeth; Fuggle, Nicholas; Shaw, Sarah; Spooner, Laura; Ntani, Georgia; Parsons, Camille; Corp, Nadia; Honvo, Germain; Baird, Janis; Maggi, Stefania; Dennison, Elaine; Bruyère, Olivier; Reginster, Jean-Yves; Cooper, Cyrus",Drugs & aging,35,1

Here, using an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), PLX5622, and mice infected with a neurotropic coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV], strain JHMV), we show that depletion of microglia during the time of JHMV clearance resulted in impaired myelin repair and prolonged clinical disease without affecting the kinetics of virus clearance. Microglia were required only during the early stages of remyelination. Notably, large deposits of extracellular vesiculated myelin and cellular debris were detected in the spinal cords of PLX5622-treated and not control mice, which correlated with decreased numbers of oligodendrocytes in demyelinating lesions in drug-treated mice. Furthermore, gene expression analyses demonstrated differential expression of genes involved in myelin debris clearance, lipid and cholesterol recycling, and promotion of oligodendrocyte function. The results also demonstrate that microglial functions affected by depletion could not be compensated by infiltrating macrophages. Together, these results demonstrate that microglia play key roles in debris clearance and in the initiation of remyelination following infection with a neurotropic coronavirus but are not necessary during later stages of remyelination.","Sariol, Alan; Mackin, Samantha; Allred, Merri-Grace; Ma, Chen; Zhou, Yu; Zhang, Qinran; Zou, Xiufen; Abrahante, Juan E; Meyerholz, David K; Perlman, Stanley",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,35,25

Membrane transporters, both at the plasma and intracellular membranes, are key players in maintaining a finely tuned pH balance between intra- and extracellular spaces, and therefore in cellular homeostasis. V-ATPase is a housekeeping ATP-driven proton pump highly conserved among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This proton pump, which exhibits a complex multisubunit structure based on cell type-specific isoforms, is essential for pH regulation and for a multitude of ubiquitous and specialized functions. Thus, it is not surprising that V-ATPase aberrant overexpression, mislocalization, and mutations in V-ATPase subunit-encoding genes have been associated with several human diseases. However, the ubiquitous expression of this transporter and the high toxicity driven by its off-target inhibition, renders V-ATPase-directed therapies very challenging and increases the need for selective strategies. Here we review emerging evidence linking V-ATPase and both inherited and acquired human diseases, explore the therapeutic challenges and opportunities envisaged from recent data, and advance future research avenues. We highlight the importance of V-ATPases with unique subunit isoform molecular signatures and disease-associated isoforms to design selective V-ATPase-directed therapies. We also discuss the rational design of drug development pipelines and cutting-edge methodological approaches toward V-ATPase-centered drug discovery. Diseases like cancer, osteoporosis, and even fungal infections can benefit from V-ATPase-directed therapies.","Santos-Pereira, Cátia; Rodrigues, Lígia R; Côrte-Real, Manuela",Medicinal research reviews,35,1

It is believed that treatment is indicated if medical therapy fails or even as prophylaxis in high-risk patients. Direct surgical repair with carotid endarterectomy has a considerable failure rate and significant associated risks. Indirect repair with an extracranial-to-intracranial bypass has become the mainstay of surgical treatment. In this case study, the authors assess the feasibility of direct endovascular recanalization in the setting of chronic carotid occlusion, and discuss technical nuances and indications in comparison with the world literature and alternative options. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Two patients presented with symptomatic, chronic, complete occlusion of the proximal carotid artery. The duration of documented occlusion exceeded 3 years in one patient and 6 months in the other. METHODS Endovascular recanalization was attempted using extracranial and intracranial stenting with proximal protection (flow arrest/reversal). Both patients had an excellent radiographic result, improving from Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grade 0 (no perfusion) to grade 3 (complete perfusion). The first patient's clinical symptoms resolved. The second patient remained unchanged with a mild facial droop. CONCLUSION These preliminary results show potential for the endovascular management of this complicated disease. Long-term results and more data will determine the ultimate place of endovascular recanalization for symptomatic chronic carotid occlusion among other therapies.","Hauck, Erik F; Ogilvy, Christopher S; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I",Neurosurgery,35,1

METHODS Imaging data of the first chest CT examination and clinical data (age, sex, clinical history, epidemiological history, and laboratory tests) of 163 patients with COVID-19 from 2 hospitals were collected for retrospective analysis. Imaging features of the first chest CT examination and the correspondence between CT manifestations and the nucleic acid test results of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were analyzed. RESULTS The first chest CT images of 163 COVID-19 patients showed that 92.02% of lesions were ground-glass opacity (GGO), 76.69% were consolidation, and 73.62% were GGO together with consolidation. Multiple lesions were found in 71.17% patients and multiple lobules in 86.50% patients. Lesions in 53.37% patients were found with bronchial inflation signs and those in 36.20% patients presented with ""crazy paving"" pattern, while only 7.36% were found with hilar node enlargement and pleural effusion. First CT findings of 18 patients were found to be inconsistent with the results of pathogen examination. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients showed specific features in the first chest CT examination. The combination of the first chest CT imaging features and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results as well as reexamination if necessary can help to make the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection accurately.","Nie, Wei; Feng, Zhichao; Mao, Xiaowen; Rong, Pengfei; Wang, Wei; Liang, Qi",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Descriptive survey-based study applied to current Portuguese ophthalmology residents (n = 80 eligible). RESULTS Seventy-five residents participated (94% response rate). All except one (99%) admitted a change in their routine clinical practice during the pandemic, and most (89%) continued to be engaged in ophthalmology department duties. Twenty-five percent were deployed to COVID-19 units, which was combined with ophthalmological activities in about half of them (47%). A significant proportion of participants stated that they were enrolled in the following ophthalmological activities: emergency/inpatient care (87%), outpatient visits (73%; general 70% vs subspecialty 29%), and surgical procedures (64%). Twenty-five percent did not assist in any outpatient visits and 36% did not participate in any surgical procedures. On a scale from 1 (no impact) to 5 (maximum impact), most participants classified their perceived negative impact of the pandemic on the training program as 3 (24%), 4 (40%), or 5 (27%). Participants highly agreed with the extension of the residency program (80%) in order to to make up for training disruption. DISCUSSION Most trainees provided ophthalmological care during the pandemic. However, those clinical activities were essentially related to general and emergency care. Surgical experience was significantly curtailed. As such, strategies are needed to guarantee a high-quality learning process. Further studies are required to develop an international perspective on how ophthalmology training programs have been affected so that educational organizations can make recommendations regarding standardized adjustments to training programs. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the training of ophthalmology residents nationwide.","Silva, Nisa; Laiginhas, Rita; Meireles, Angelina; Barbosa Breda, João",Acta medica portuguesa,35,1

We describe two cases of an OLTP that were treated with retrograde osteochondral autograft. Case Reports The first case was a 27-year-old basketball player and the second case was a 38-year-old soccer player. We harvested osteochondral autografts from the nonweight-bearing area of the lateral femoral condyle of the patient's ipsilateral knees. The grafts were reversed and inserted into the bone tunnel reaching the OLTPs starting proximally and moving distally. The first patient was able to play professional basketball 14 months after the procedure and continues to play 5 years and 6 months later. The second patient was able to play recreational soccer 9 months after the procedure and continues to play 4 years later. Conclusion Use of the retrograde osteochondral autograft produced satisfactory results including the return to sports.

METHODS Patients over 18 who were evaluated for COVID-19 during the period from April 1, to April 30, 2020 were retrospectively scanned. Patients with at least 1 positive PCR test result were as assigned to Group 1 while patients with negative test results were assigned to Group 2. The LMR ratio was calculated by dividing the lymphocyte value by that of MPV. The relationship between LMR, severity of patients' CT findings and 28-day mortality was evaluated. RESULTS A total of 938 patients were included in the study. It was observed that the lymphocyte and LMR levels were significantly different in those who died within 28 days (p < 0.001, p ≤ 0.001). In the ROC analysis for the LMR level, the area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.737 (95% CI 0.639‒0.834). When the cut‑off value of LMR was 0.045, the sensitivity was found to be 99.0 % and specificity was 15.2 %.

Injection of bulking agents has been used to treat passive fecal incontinence. However, no long-term results are available. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the long-term clinical effectiveness of intra-anal injection of collagen for passive fecal incontinence. DESIGN This research is a retrospective cohort study from a prospectively collected database SETTING This investigation took place in a high-volume tertiary colorectal department. PATIENTS All patients who underwent intra-anal injection of collagen for passive fecal incontinence with internal sphincter dysfunction between January 2006 and December 2009 were included in the study. Data including demographic details, preoperative anorectal physiology, and outcome measures were collected prospectively and maintained in a database MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes measured were the Cleveland Clinic Florida incontinence score and the responses to a subjective patient satisfaction questionnaire before the procedure and at subsequent follow-up visits. Data were analyzed by using SPSS v19.0. RESULTS One hundred patients (70 female; mean age, 61 years (range, 36-82)) were followed up for a minimum duration of 36 months. Fifty-six patients (56%) had an improvement in fecal incontinence score from a mean of 14 (range, 9-18) to a mean of 8 (range, 5-14). A total of 68% reported subjective improvement in symptoms. Thirty-eight patients (38%) required a repeat injection of collagen, and a further 15 patients required a third injection. The median interval between the first and final injection was 12 months (range, 4-16 months). Age was the only independent predictor of successful outcome (p = 0.032). There was no morbidity. LIMITATIONS This study was limited by its nonrandomized retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS Injection of collagen into the internal anal sphincter is simple, safe, and effective in patients with passive fecal incontinence, although repeat injections are necessary in approximately half of the patients.","Maslekar, S; Smith, K; Harji, D; Griffiths, B; Sagar, P M",Diseases of the colon and rectum,35,1

All patients successfully underwent transoral laryngeal closure without significant perioperative complication. Four patients resumed oral feeding for effective nutrition and two patients for pleasure. One patient developed a small fistula with a leak that warranted secondary closure by a follow-up R-TLM procedure and subsequently held to protect his airway.

Median age was 11.3 years (interquartile range [IQR], 7.0-15.0); 37 patients (51%) were boys, and 36 patients (49%) were girls. Sixty-three children (86%) received treatment for anterior circulation occlusion and 10 patients (14%) received treatment for posterior circulation occlusion; 16 patients (22%) received concomitant intravenous thrombolysis. Neurologic outcome improved from a median PedNIHSS score of 14.0 (IQR, 9.2-20.0) at admission to 4.0 (IQR, 2.0-7.3) at day 7. Median mRS score was 1.0 (IQR, 0-1.6) at 6 months and 1.0 (IQR, 0-1.0) at 24 months. One patient (1%) developed a postinterventional bleeding complication and 4 patients (5%) developed transient peri-interventional vasospasm. The proportion of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage events in the HERMES meta-analysis of trials with adults was 2.79 (95% CI, 0.42-6.66) and in Save ChildS was 1.37 (95% CI, 0.03-7.40). Conclusions and Relevance The results of this study suggest that the safety profile of thrombectomy in childhood stroke does not differ from the safety profile in randomized clinical trials for adults; most of the treated children had favorable neurologic outcomes. This study may support clinicians' practice of off-label thrombectomy in childhood stroke in the absence of high-level evidence.","Sporns, Peter B; Sträter, Ronald; Minnerup, Jens; Wiendl, Heinz; Hanning, Uta; Chapot, René; Henkes, Hans; Henkes, Elina; Grams, Astrid; Dorn, Franziska; Nikoubashman, Omid; Wiesmann, Martin; Bier, Georg; Weber, Anushe; Broocks, Gabriel; Fiehler, Jens; Brehm, Alex; Psychogios, Marios; Kaiser, Daniel; Yilmaz, Umut; Morotti, Andrea; Marik, Wolfgang; Nolz, Richard; Jensen-Kondering, Ulf; Schmitz, Bernd; Schob, Stefan; Beuing, Oliver; Götz, Friedrich; Trenkler, Johannes; Turowski, Bernd; Möhlenbruch, Markus; Wendl, Christina; Schramm, Peter; Musolino, Patricia; Lee, Sarah; Schlamann, Marc; Radbruch, Alexander; Rübsamen, Nicole; Karch, André; Heindel, Walter; Wildgruber, Moritz; Kemmling, André",JAMA neurology,35,16

Under these conditions, a new decay channel into bound photon pairs emerges, through which spatial correlations between emitters are established by regular interference as well as interactions between the photons. We derive an effective Markovian theory to model the resulting decay dynamics of an arbitrary distribution of emitters and identify collective effects beyond the usual phenomena of super- and subradiance. Specifically, in the limit of many close-by emitters, we find that the system undergoes a supercorrelated decay process where all the emitters are either in the excited state or in the ground state but not in any of the intermediate states. The predicted effects can be probed in state-of-the-art waveguide QED experiments and provide a striking example of how the dynamics of open quantum systems can be modified by many-body effects in a nonharmonic environment.","Wang, Zhihai; Jaako, Tuomas; Kirton, Peter; Rabl, Peter",Physical review letters,35,5

This study aimed to develop and evaluate the discriminative accuracy of a clinical prediction model for ambulatory ability outcomes 3 months after surgery for trochanteric fractures. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 346 patients treated with intramedullary nailing for trochanteric fractures who had independent ambulatory ability before their injury. Multiple regression models with preoperative and postoperative factors were used to predict ambulatory ability outcomes at 3 months. A clinical prediction model (CPM) was created based on a decision tree developed using a chi-square automatic interaction detector technique. RESULTS Three months after surgery, 263 (76.0%) and 83 (24.0%) patients regained and lost independent ambulatory ability, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the Barthel index (BI) total score at 2 weeks predicted the ambulatory ability outcome at 3 months with good discriminative accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]: 0.819; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.769, 0.868], cut-off value: 22.5; sensitivity: 69.5%; specificity: 82.3%). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative factors (residence before injury, diagnosis of dementia, and serum albumin at admission) and postoperative factors (BI total score at 2 weeks) predicted ambulatory ability outcomes at 3 months (AUROC: 0.710; 95%CI: [0.636, 0.783]; sensitivity: 91.3%; specificity: 41.8%). The CPM with the BI total score at 2 weeks (≤10; 10<, ≤50; >50 points) and dementia status (present; absent) had a moderate discriminative accuracy (AUROC: 0.676; 95%CI: [0.600, 0.752]; sensitivity: 94.7%; specificity: 40.5%). CONCLUSIONS We developed a CPM with moderate accuracy to predict ambulatory ability outcomes in patients 3 months after surgery for trochanteric fractures. Our results demonstrate the importance of the BI score measured soon after surgery and dementia status for the prediction of postoperative ambulation.","Tomita, Yosuke; Yamamoto, Norio; Inoue, Tomoo; Noda, Tomoyuki; Kawasaki, Keisuke; Ozaki, Toshifumi",Injury,35,24

AIMS To assess the presence of emotional disorders in Spain and the association to sociodemographic characteristics and CERS during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD Cross-sectional survey administered through an online platform. Sociodemographic variables and CERS (CERQ-Short) were collected and possible diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD, GAD-7), major depression disorder (MDD; Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), panic attacks (PA; PHQ-PD), and panic disorders (PD; PHQ-PD) were assessed. Sociodemographic risk factors and CERS association to the possible diagnosis of emotional disorders were reported with hierarchical multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS A total of 1,753 respondents completed the questionnaire in Spain. Of these, most (76.8%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 40.4 years (12.9). A high proportion of participants met diagnostic criteria for emotional disorders: 15.3% for GAD, 12.2% for MDD, 17.2% for PD, and 25.7% had experienced a PA. The contribution of sociodemographic variables to diagnoses of emotional disorders was modest, explaining from 3.1% to 5.7% of the variance; however, when CERS were added, the combination of sociodemographic and CERS explained from 15% to 29% of the variance. Rumination and catastrophizing were the most transdiagnostic maladaptive strategies and positive refocusing was another adaptive strategy. DISCUSSION Although results from convenience samples should be handled with caution, the high prevalence of emotional disorders in this study suggests that the demand of mental health interventions will probably increase in Spain. Also, CERS play a clear role in the presence of these disorders. CONCLUSION Intervention programs should focus on training CERS in populations at high risk, focusing on the reduction of maladaptive CERS and the reinforce of other more adaptive CERS.","Muñoz-Navarro, Roger; Cano Vindel, Antonio; Schmitz, Florian; Cabello, Rosario; Fernández-Berrocal, Pablo",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,35,29

This study aimed to describe the sense of professional identity among Chinese nursing students during the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore the relationship between psychological resilience and the sense of professional identity in this cohort. A nationwide online cross-sectional survey was conducted. Nursing students were recruited from 18 Chinese universities. The 10-item Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC-10) evaluated psychological resilience and professional identity was assessed by the Professional Identity Questionnaire for Nursing Students (PIQNS). A total of 6348 respondents had a moderate level of professional identity to nursing (average PIQNS score at 62.02 ± 12.02). About 86% of respondents attributed the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in elevating the nursing image. Psychological resilience was the strongest contributor to professional identity (β = 0.371, P < 0.001). There was a high level of professional identity among Chinese nursing students during the COVID-19 crisis.

Only one third of patients respond to treatment and experience remission. Pharmacogenetics is a relatively young field which focusses on genetic analyses in the context of the metabolism and outcome of drug treatment. These genetic factors can, among other things, lead to differences in the activity of enzymes that metabolize drugs. Recently, a clinical guideline was authorized by the Dutch Clinical Psychiatric Association (NVvP) on the clinical use of pharmacogenetics in psychiatry. The main goal was to provide guidance, based on current evidence, on how to best use genotyping in clinical psychiatric practice. A systematic literature search was performed, and available publications were assessed using the GRADE methodology. General recommendations for psychiatric clinical practice were provided, and specific recommendations per medication were made available. This clinical guideline for caregivers prescribing psychotropic drugs is the product of a broad collaboration of professionals from different disciplines, making use of the information available at the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) so far.

METHODS A online questionnaire-based survey was conducted from March 11st to March 15th, 2020.The questionnaire consisted of 4 parts to survey the participants'basic information, understanding of COVID-19 outbreak-associated information, cognition of COVID-19 pandemic and status of anxiety and depression.A total of 1433 valid responses were collected, including 706 from the general population and 727 from healthcare professionals.Cronbach's α coefficient and exploratory factor analysis were used for reliability and validity assessment.Chi-square, Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for univariate analysis and ordinal or nominal logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis of the data. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the general population and the healthcare professionals in terms of anxiety, depression and cognition of COVID-19 outbreak after adjustment for demographic variables, but the levels of anxiety and depression of these participants were both higher than those before the pandemic.In the participants from the general population, multivariate logistic regressions showed an OR for anxiety of 1.93(1.18, 3.17) among those who spent 1-2 h a day in reading COVID-19-related news, while those who spent over 3 h had an OR value for anxiety of 1.88(1.14, 3.11);the unmarried individuals had a depression OR of 2.19(1.51, 3.18). Inaccurate cognition of COVID-19 outbreak was positive correlated with the occurrence of anxiety and depression.Unmarried individuals and those with higher educational levels had better cognition of COVID-19 outbreak.Among the healthcare professionals, multivariate logistic regressions suggested that insufficient rest time and worries about contracting the virus contributed to the occurrence of anxiety and depression.Among the nursing staff, the OR of obvious depression was 2.99(1.45, 6.18).Compared to healthcare professionals not working in designated hospital for COVID-19, those who work in the designated hospitals had ORs for obvious and severe depression of 0.48(0.25, 0.93) and 0.39(0.17, 0.89), respectively.Concerns over contracting the virus increased the possibility of incorrect cognition of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Psychological interventions are essential for both the general population and healthcare professionals, especially for unmarried individuals in the general population and the nursing staff.An excessive exposure to COVID-19-related information may have detrimental effects on the mental health.For healthcare professionals, sufficient rest needs to be ensured, and education programs on COVID-19 should be implemented among both residents and healthcare professionals to improve their mental health.","Liu, Zhengrong; Zhang, Xudong; Lü, Zhihan; Liang, Jie; Deng, Yudi; Feng, Linfei",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,35,31

These viruses are known to be able to infect a wide range of tissues and are believed to establish persistent infections. Enteroviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses whose replication involves the synthesis of negative strand intermediates. Therefore, the specific detection of negatively stranded viral RNA in tissues or cells is a reliable marker of active enteroviral replication. The present report presents the development of a real-time RT-PCR allowing the specific detection and quantification of negatively stranded viral RNA. Since it was known that specific amplification of single-stranded RNA can be made difficult by false-priming events leading to false-positive or overestimated results, the assay was developed by using a tagged RT primer. This tagged RT-PCR was shown to be able to amplify specifically negative RNA of enteroviruses grown in cell cultures by preventing the amplification of cDNAs generated by false-priming.","Bessaud, Maël; Autret, Arnaud; Jegouic, Sophie; Balanant, Jean; Joffret, Marie-Line; Delpeyroux, Francis",Journal of virological methods,35,0

In this comprehensive review, the authors outline the irrigation fluids and delivery methods used in the identified studies, analyze reported treatment outcomes, summarize irrigation effectiveness, and propose evidence-based guidelines to improve wound healing outcomes and enhance the consistency of wound irrigation. Thirty-one high-quality studies with a combined total of 61,808 patients were included. Based on the current evidence provided by this review, the authors propose the following guidelines: (1) acute soft-tissue wounds should receive continuous gravity flow irrigation with polyhexanide; (2) complex wounds should receive continuous negative-pressure wound therapy with instillation with polyhexanide; (3) infected wounds should receive continuous negative-pressure wound therapy with instillation with silver nitrate, polyhexanide, acetic acid, or povidone-iodine; (4) breast implant wounds should receive gravity lavage with povidone-iodine or antibiotics; and (5) surgical-site infection rates can be reduced with intraoperative povidone-iodine irrigation.","Saeg, Fouad; Schoenbrunner, Anna R; Janis, Jeffrey E",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,35,1

METHODS A prospective randomized study was conducted on patients who underwent robot-assisted ventral mesh rectopexy (RVMR) or laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR) for internal or external rectal prolapse at Oulu University Hospital, Finland, recruited in February-May 2012. The primary outcomes were health care costs from the hospital perspective and HRQoL measured by the 15D-instrument. Secondary outcomes included anatomical outcome assessed by pelvic organ prolapse quantification method and functional outcome by symptom questionnaires at 24 months follow-up. RESULTS There were 30 females (mean age 62.5 years, SD 11.2), 16 in the RVMR group and 14 in the LVMR group. The surgery-related costs of the RVMR were 1.5 times higher than the cost of the LVMR. At 3 months the changes in HRQoL were 'much better' (RVMR) and 'slightly better' (LVMR) but declined in both groups at 2 years (RVMR vs. LVMR, p > 0.05). The cost-effectiveness was poor at 2 years for both techniques, but if the outcomes were assumed to last for 5 years, it improved significantly. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the RVMR compared to LVMR was €39,982/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at 2 years and improved to €16,707/QALYs at 5 years. Posterior wall anatomy was restored similarly in both groups. The subjective satisfaction rate was 87% in the RVMR group and 69% in the LVMR group (p = 0.83). CONCLUSIONS Although more expensive than LVMR in the short term, RVMR is cost-effective in long-term. The minimally invasive VMR improves pelvic floor function, sexual function and restores posterior compartment anatomy. The effect on HRQoL is minor, with no differences between techniques.","Mäkelä-Kaikkonen, J; Rautio, T; Ohinmaa, A; Koivurova, S; Ohtonen, P; Sintonen, H; Mäkelä, J",Techniques in coloproctology,35,31

Most patients present to the healthcare facility beyond that window. Autologous stem cells have shown some promise for this group of patients. This study was performed to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of intra-arterial infusion of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells in patients with middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-end point study was performed from July 2015 to June 2016. Of 229 patients with acute stroke who presented to the hospital during this period, 20 patients who satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria were included and randomized into the control and intervention groups. Intra-arterial stem cell infusion into the ipsilateral MCA was performed in the patients in the intervention group at 8-15 days post-stroke ictus. Final analysis at 6 months was performed for primary (safety) and secondary outcomes (efficacy). RESULTS When we compared the primary end point of the study, no procedure-related mortality, complication, new infarct, or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was seen in the intervention group. When we compared the secondary end point of good clinical outcome, 8 (80%) patients in the intervention group showed good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score < 2) with 4 (40%) patients in the control group achieving this (95% confidence interval for good outcome in patients with stem cell infusion, 49.03-94.3, and without stem cell infusion, 16.82-68.73; P = .068). CONCLUSIONS Intra-arterial infusion of stem cells can be carried out safely in the subacute stage of ischemic stroke. Improved clinical outcomes were observed with intra-arterial stem cell therapy; however, studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate the results.","Bhatia, V; Gupta, V; Khurana, D; Sharma, R R; Khandelwal, N",AJNR.

RECENT FINDINGS In the last decades, knowledge about the relevance of physical exercise training in preventing and treating chronic diseases and improving quality of life has grown. Following the global trend exemplified by the expression 'exercise is medicine', the importance of exercise/physical training has also grown in myopathies. However, the science of exercise has a lot to collaborate on and improve patients' quality of life with myopathies by appropriating new technological tools, including accessible and low-cost devices and smartphone apps. SUMMARY Physical exercise, as already consolidated in the literature, is an effective, well tolerated, and low-cost strategy for patients with myopathies. The use of wearable devices, smartphone apps, and online training prescriptions must accompany the global scenario, bringing new research fields and expanding the options for access to training for the individualized basis, and prescribed by qualified professionals.","Dos Santos, Alexandre Moura; Misse, Rafael Giovani; Borges, Isabela Bruna Pires; Perandini, Luiz Augusto Buoro; Shinjo, Samuel Katsuyuki",Current opinion in rheumatology,35,1

Given language barriers, patients with limited English proficiency present a unique set of challenges in integrating telehealth and ensuring equity. Using data from 84,419 respondents in the 2015-18 California Health Interview Survey, we assessed the association between limited English proficiency and telehealth use (telephone and video visits) and evaluated the impact of telehealth use on health care access and use. We found that patients with limited English proficiency had lower rates of telehealth use (4.8 percent versus 12.3 percent) compared with proficient English speakers. In weighted multivariable logistic regression, patients with limited English proficiency still had about half the odds of using telehealth.

OBJECTIVES we investigated serum levels of a panel of key cytokines in children and adolescent with COVID-19 pneumonia with a primary focus on ""cytokine storm"" cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and two chemokines interferon inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and IL-8]. We also studied whether these cytokines could be potential markers for illness severity in COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS Ninety-two symptomatic patients aged less than 18 years with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 100 well-matched healthy controls were included in this multi-center study. For all patients, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory fluid specimens was detected by real-time reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). We measured serum concentrations of studied cytokines by using flow cytometry. RESULTS Patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher median IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α and IP-10 serum levels than did control children (all P < 0.01). Patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had significantly higher median IL-1β, IL-6 and IP-10 serum levels as compared with those with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia; all P < 0.01. ROC analysis revealed that three of the studied markers (IL-6, IL-1β and IP-10) could predict severe COVID-19 pneumonia cases with the largest AUC for IL-6 of 0.893 (95% CI: 0.84-0.98; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Our study shows that pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have markedly elevated serum IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α and IP-10 levels at the initial phase of the illness indicating a cytokine storm following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, serum IL-6, IL-1β, and IP-10 concentrations were independent predictors for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This article is protected by copyright.

The data were acquired and analysed in cooperation with the Institute for Quality Assurance in Surgical Medicine at the Otto-von-Guericke University. METHODS Data acquisition was done with the help of an online database. On a voluntary basis, all obesity and metabolic surgical interventions since 2005 have been recorded. In addition to the surgical data, the findings of the yearly follow-up investigations were recorded. RESULTS Since 2005 there have been 1,263 gastric balloon procedures, 11,840 sleeve gastrectomies, 13,722 Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses and 3999 gastric banding operations. The average age of the male patients in all interventions was significantly higher. The average BMI of female patients who received a gastric banding or a gastric balloon procedure was significantly lower than that of the male patients. Men exhibited a higher incidence of comorbidities than women. CONCLUSION The number of obesity and metabolic surgical interventions in Germany is continuously increasing. The results of the study on surgical therapy for obesity (GBSR) reveal significant differences in the gender-specific incidence of preoperative comorbidities. postoperative complications and mortality. Further studies on gender-specific aspects are necessary in order to optimise patient selection and reduce the incidence of postoperative complications.","Stroh, C; Weiner, R; Wolff, S; Knoll, C; de Zwaan, M; Manger, T; Adipositas, Kompetenzzentrum",Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie,35,5

The presence of this group of viruses in bats and humans has been well documented in areas where their biological reservoirs - fruit bats (family Pteropodidae) - live densely. In the present study, a serum neutralization (SN) assay to detect neutralizing antibodies against PRV Indonesia/2010 isolate was set up and used to assess the seroprevalence of this virus in Italian domestic animals. The new developed assay was able of detecting PRV neutralizing antibodies in the hyper-immune polyclonal serum produced in rabbits (titer of 1:160).

Eight hundred and fifty-three serum samples collected from 524 bovines, 271 small ruminants, and 58 horses (all used as sentinel animals in the Bluetongue and West Nile disease National surveillance program) were also tested with the new developed SN assay. According to the results of this survey, neither PRV nor PRV cross- reacting viruses antibodies have been demonstrated in Italian domestic animals.

In June 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued warnings about methanol or 1-propanol contaminated brands of hand sanitizer. Exposure to methanol, including dermally, can cause kidney damage, blindness and death. Exposure to 1-propanol can cause severe acidosis and death. Chronic exposure may be more likely due to increased hand sanitizer use in 2020. METHODS We used generic codes for ABHS to characterize exposures reported to the Texas Poison Control Network in 2019 and 2020. For 2020 cases, we also used case narratives to identify cases considered COVID-19 -related and cases where the caller reported exposure to unknown ABHS with safety concerns, specifically identified brands on the FDA warning list or before that warning was made in June 2020. RESULTS Reported exposures to ABHS increased 72.5% between 2019 and 2020. In 2020, 10% of the cases were COVID-19 -related. COVID-19 -related cases in 2020 were likely to be older, to have a lower portion of young children exposed and to report chronic use of hand sanitizer. Similar trends were reported among cases who reported possible exposures to potentially unsafe ABHS products, including products on the FDA list. Most exposures were not referred for medical attention, and no deaths were reported among the Texas cases. DISCUSSION Callers reporting exposures to ABHS related to use prompted by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) and specific exposure to unsafe products differ from the traditional callers in being older, reporting chronic use and in healthcare facility (HCF) referral. The 72.5% increase in 2020 calls compared to 2019 cases differ from typical exposures, which often involve young children. Changes in manufacturing processes by additional manufacturers have produced potential exposure to toxic alcohol-containing products and others in Texas.","Phillips, Todd; Schulte, Joann M; Smith, Eric Anthony; Roth, Brett; Kleinschmidt, Kurt C",Clinical toxicology,35,31

CENP-A defines the loci by serving as an epigenetic marker that recruits other centromere components for a functional structure. However, the mechanism that controls CENP-A regulation of centromeric chromatin integrity remains to be explored. Separate studies have shown that loss of CENP-A or the Cdk5 regulatory subunit associated protein 2 (Cdk5rap2), a key player in mitotic progression, triggers the occurrence of lagging chromosomes. This prompted us to investigate a potential link between CENP-A and Cdk5rap2 in the maintenance of centromeric chromatin integrity. Here, we demonstrate that loss of Cdk5rap2 causes reduced CENP-A expression while exogenous Cdk5rap2 expression in cells depleted of endogenous Cdk5rap2 restores CENP-A expression. Indeed, we show that Cdk5rap2 is a nuclear protein that acts as a positive transcriptional regulator of CENP-A. Cdk5rap2 interacts with the CENP-A promoter and upregulates CENP-A transcription. Accordingly, loss of Cdk5rap2 causes reduced level of centromeric CENP-A. Exogenous CENP-A expression partially inhibits the occurrence of lagging chromosomes in Cdk5rap2 knockdown cells, indicating that lagging chromosomes induced by loss of Cdk5rap2 is due, in part, to loss of CENP-A. Aside from manifesting lagging chromosomes, cells depleted of Cdk5rap2, and thus CENP-A, show increased micronuclei and chromatin bridge formation. Altogether, our findings indicate that Cdk5rap2 serves to maintain centromeric chromatin integrity partly through CENP-A.","Wang, Xidi; Rosales, Jesusa L; Gao, Xu; Lee, Ki-Young",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,35,16

DESIGN Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING A discrete choice experiment was conducted. Patients chose between two hypothetical non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) treatments defined by six attributes: risk of fatigue, falls or fracture, cognitive impairment, hypertension, rashes as side effects to treatment and extension of time until cancer-related pain occurs. PARTICIPANTS A total of 137 adult male patients with CRPC with no prior experience with chemotherapy and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0-1 were recruited. Patients were excluded if they participated in an investigational programme outside of routine clinical practice, had a clinically relevant medical or psychiatric condition, or diagnosis of visceral/other metastases not related to the prostate, or were otherwise deemed ineligible by the referring physician. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES Relative preference weights and relative importance of the attributes was estimated by hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression. RESULTS Among the treatment attributes, 'risk of cognitive impairment as a side effect of treatment' was the most important attribute (relative importance (RI) (95% CI): 27.47% (24.80% to 30.14%)), followed by 'extension of time until cancer-related pain occurs' (RI (95% CI): 17.87% (15.49% to 20.25%)) and the 'risk of falls or fracture' (RI (95% CI): 15.99% (14.73% to 17.25%)). The 'risk of hypertension as a side effect of treatment' (RI (95% CI): 13.77% (12.73% to 14.81%)) had similar RI as 'risk of rashes as a side effect of treatment' (RI (95% CI): 13.17% (12.15% to 14.19%)), followed by the 'risk of fatigue as a side effect of treatment' (RI (95% CI): 11.74% (10.75% to 12.73%)). CONCLUSIONS Patients consider the risk of cognitive impairment as a side effect of treatment as the most important attribute in nmCRPC, followed by the extension of time until cancer-related pain occurs, and the risk of falls and fracture. These features should be considered in treatment decision making for nmCRPC in Japan.","Uemura, Hiroji; Matsushima, Hisashi; Yokomizo, Akira; Kobayashi, Kazuki; Arai, Gaku; Satoh, Takefumi; Grillo, Vince; Chen, Yirong; Singh, Shikha; Ledesma, Dianne Athene",BMJ open,35,19

To attempt to improve outcome, several trials have assessed a variety of potential adjunctive therapeutics, however none to date has been shown to be beneficial. This may be due, at least partly, to the therapeutics chosen and clinical trial design used. Here, we highlight three themes that could facilitate the choice and evaluation of putative adjuvant interventions for severe malaria, paving the way for their assessment in randomized controlled trials. Most clinical trials of adjunctive therapeutics to date have been underpowered due to the large number of participants required to reach mortality endpoints, rendering these study designs challenging and expensive to conduct. These limitations may be mitigated by the use of risk-stratification of participants and application of surrogate endpoints. Appropriate surrogate endpoints include direct measures of pathways causally involved in the pathobiology of severe and fatal malaria, including markers of host immune and endothelial activation and microcirculatory dysfunction. We propose using circulating markers of these pathways to identify high-risk participants that would be most likely to benefit from adjunctive therapy, and further by adopting these biomarkers as surrogate endpoints; moreover, choosing interventions that target deleterious host immune responses that directly contribute to microcirculatory dysfunction, multi-organ dysfunction and death; and, finally, prioritizing where possible, drugs that act on these pathways that are already approved by the FDA, or other regulators, for other indications, and are known to be safe in target populations, including children. An emerging understanding of the critical role of the host response in severe malaria pathogenesis may facilitate both clinical trial design and the search of effective adjunctive therapeutics.","Varo, Rosauro; Erice, Clara; Johnson, Sydney; Bassat, Quique; Kain, Kevin C",Malaria journal,35,26

As these viruses are highly diverse, evaluating the threat that they pose remains a major challenge, and efficient approaches are needed to rapidly predict virus-host compatibility. Here, we develop a combined computational and experimental approach to assess the compatibility of New World arenaviruses, endemic in rodents, with the host TfR1 entry receptors of different potential new host species. Using signatures of positive selection, we identify a small motif on rodent TfR1 that conveys species specificity to the entry of viruses into cells. However, we show that mutations in this region affect the entry of each arenavirus differently. For example, a human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this region, L212V, makes human TfR1 a weaker receptor for one arenavirus, Machupo virus, but a stronger receptor for two other arenaviruses, Junin and Sabia viruses. Collectively, these findings set the stage for potential evolutionary trade-offs, where natural selection for resistance to one virus may make humans or rodents susceptible to other arenavirus species. Given the complexity of this host-virus interplay, we propose a computational method to predict these interactions, based on homology modeling and computational docking of the virus-receptor protein-protein interaction. We demonstrate the utility of this model for Machupo virus, for which a suitable cocrystal structural template exists. Our model effectively predicts whether the TfR1 receptors of different species will be functional receptors for Machupo virus entry. Approaches such at this could provide a first step toward computationally predicting the ""host jumping"" potential of a virus into a new host species. IMPORTANCE We demonstrate how evolutionary trade-offs may exist in the dynamic evolutionary interplay between viruses and their hosts, where natural selection for resistance to one virus could make humans or rodents susceptible to other virus species. We present an algorithm that predicts which species have cell surface receptors that make them susceptible to Machupo virus, based on computational docking of protein structures. Few molecular models exist for predicting the risk of spillover of a particular animal virus into humans or new animal populations. Our results suggest that a combination of evolutionary analysis, structural modeling, and experimental verification may provide an efficient approach for screening and assessing the potential spillover risks of viruses circulating in animal populations.","Kerr, Scott A; Jackson, Eleisha L; Lungu, Oana I; Meyer, Austin G; Demogines, Ann; Ellington, Andrew D; Georgiou, George; Wilke, Claus O; Sawyer, Sara L",Journal of virology,35,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic transperitoneal radical nephrectomies for suspected renal tumors were randomized for intact renal specimen extraction via a PFN or EPS incision. Operative, perioperative, 1 week, 6 weeks, and 6 months postoperative parameters were prospectively recorded and analyzed including specimen weight, size in maximum diameter, incision length, total operative time, extraction time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, pain score in the postoperative holding area and on the first post operative day, narcotic consumption, time to fluid intake/full diet intake, unassisted ambulation, cosmesis, and wound-related complications. A postoperative quality-of-life questionnaire was also filled out by all the patients. RESULTS Our series included 51 patients: 26 in the PFN group and 25 in the EPS group. The two groups were similar in demographic characteristics and intraoperative and postoperative parameters apart from a longer PFN incision (P<0.00). First postoperative day pain score was significantly less in the PFN group than in the EPS group (P=0.023). Complication rate was less in the PFN group, although not statistically significant. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the PFN than in the EPS group (P=0.01). Mean cosmesis and operative satisfaction scores at week 1, week 6, and 6 month visits were not significantly different between both groups. Compared with the EPS group, PFN group patients significantly will choose the same operation if they would do it again (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS PFN incision has less morbidity, pain score, and hospital stay compared with EPS incision for intact specimen extraction after transperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. Both incisions are associated with high operative satisfaction, good cosmesis, and a low rate of wound complications.","Binsaleh, Saleh; Madbouly, Khaled; Matsumoto, Edward D; Kapoor, Anil",Journal of endourology,35,1

A recent study demonstrated that this type of children's interstitial lung disease (chILD) is associated with humidifier disinfectant use. OBJECTIVES To determine the clinical characteristics of this type of chILD and to assess whether the nationwide suspension of humidifier disinfectant sales in the autumn of 2011 affected its incidence. METHODS The clinical characteristics of suspected cases between 2006 and 2011 were determined by a nationwide retrospective study. The potential causal relationship with humidifier disinfectants was examined by a prospective surveillance study after humidifier disinfectant sales were suspended. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS In total, 138 children were diagnosed with this type of chILD, which was characterized by rapid progression, high mortality, predominance in the spring season, and a familial tendency. The annual incidence increased in 2011 and then dropped to zero in 2012. The children were on average 30.4 months old. The most frequent symptoms at admission were cough and dyspnea. As the disease progressed, the typical complication was spontaneous air leak. Eighty children (58%) died. Two years after humidifier disinfectant-sale suspension, no more new cases were found. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that humidifier disinfectant inhalation causes an idiopathic type of chILD that is characterized by spontaneous air leak, rapid progression, lack of response to treatment, and high mortality. Further safety studies must be performed on common environmental compounds, particularly those that enter the human body by an unusual route.","Kim, Kyung Won; Ahn, Kangmo; Yang, Hyeon Jong; Lee, Sooyoung; Park, June Dong; Kim, Woo Kyung; Kim, Jin-Tack; Kim, Hyun Hee; Rha, Yeong Ho; Park, Yong Mean; Sohn, Myung Hyun; Oh, Jae-Won; Lee, Hae Ran; Lim, Dae Hyun; Choung, Ji Tae; Han, Man Yong; Lee, Eun; Kim, Hyung-Young; Seo, Ju-Hee; Kim, Byoung-Ju; Cho, Young Ah; Do, Kyung-Hyun; Kim, Sun-A; Jang, Se-Jin; Lee, Moo-Song; Kim, Hwa-Jung; Kwon, Geun-Yong; Park, Ji-Hyuk; Gwack, Jin; Youn, Seung-Ki; Kwon, Jun-Wook; Jun, Byung-Yool; Pyun, Bok Yang; Hong, Soo-Jong",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,35,24

Methods: A total of 24 patients with influenza pneumonia treated with ECMO in respiratory intensive-care unit (ICU) of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital from March 2016 to December 2019 and 12 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized from February 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020 in 5 government designated infectious hospitals of Beijing and Hebei Province that applied with ECMO were enrolled. The demographic data, clinical manifestations, and ECMO related information were described and analyzed and all numerical variables are described as M (P25, P75). Results: The age of COVID-19 patients was 77 (66, 79) years old, which was older than influenza pneumonia patients [46 (32, 62) years old], P<0.05; acute lung injury score and respiratory ECMO survival prediction (RESP) score before ECMO application were 3.3 (3.0, 3.5) and 1 (0, 2), respectively, which were lower than influenza pneumonia patients [3.8 (3.5, 4.0) and 4 (2, 6), respectively], all P values<0.05. Thrombotic complications, bleeding complications, and ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in ECMO applied COVID-19 patients were 4, 10 and 5 cases, respectively, which were more than that among influenza pneumonia patients (1, 9, and 2 cases, respectively), all P values<0.05. The length of ICU stay of COVID-19 patients was 31 (28, 75) d, which was longer than that of influenza pneumonia patients [27 (18, 39) d], P<0.05. The cases with successful decannulation of ECMO among COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia patients were 6 and 14 cases, respectively and mortality during ICU stay were 8 cases and 11 cases, respectively, and the difference were not statistically significant (all P values>0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients applied with ECMO have more ECMO-related complications and a longer stay in the ICU than patients with influenza pneumonia.","Tang, X; Pu, L; Zhang, J Y; Chao, L S; Wang, R; Guo, D; Qi, H S; Wang, W S; Yin, F Z; Li, X Y; Li, Y; Yuan, X; Du, Z T; Xu, B; Liu, J Y; Yan, X X; Sun, B",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,35,1

OBJECTIVES To assess whole-body patterns of photodamage in an Australian population. METHODS A random sample of adult residents of Queensland underwent imaging across 10 body sites. Photodamage was graded from images using an ordinal photo-numeric scale. We used cluster analysis to identify whole-body photodamage patterns and prevalence proportion ratios (PPRs) to assess associated factors. RESULTS Of 190 adults (median age 52; 58% males), 58% showed severe or moderate-to-severe photodamage on most body sites. A higher proportion of woman had severe photodamage on the arms (upper: p=0.002, lower: p=0.034). A higher proportion of men had moderate or severe photodamage on the lower back (p=0.004). We identified four photodamage patterns: 'severe general' (n=24, 13%), 'moderate-severe general' (n=86, 45%), 'moderate-severe head, neck, décolletage' (n=40, 21%), and 'mild-moderate upper body' (n=12, 6%). All participants with 'severe-general' photodamage were > 50 years, and more likely to have past skin cancer (PPR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.44-4.49) than those with moderate-severe head, neck, décolletage photodamage. Those with 'moderate-severe general' photodamage showed similar associations, and were more likely female (PPR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04-1.69). Past or current smoking was associated with having higher levels of photodamage, with no smokers in those with 'mild-moderate upper body' photodamage. CONCLUSIONS Moderate to severe photodamage across much of the body is common in Queensland adults and associated with age, sex, past skin cancer and smoking. Assuming a universal pattern of site-specific sun-exposure could lead to spurious correlations, while accurate and objective assessment of site-specific photodamage can add to understanding of the development of sun-associated skin cancers, in particular site-specific skin carcinogenesis. Additionally, degree of site-specific photodamage has the potential to assist skin cancer screening.","Betz-Stablein, B; Llewellyn, S; Bearzi, P; Grochulska, K; Rutjes, C; Aitken, J F; Janda, M; O'Rouke, P; Soyer, H P; Green, A C",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,35,7

During 2013-2014, approximately one third of children and adolescents (persons aged ≤19 years) in the United States were reported to use a dietary supplement in the past 30 days, and use varied by demographic characteristics (1,2). Dietary supplements can contribute substantially to overall nutrient intake, having the potential to both mitigate nutrient shortfalls as well as to lead to nutrient intake above recommended upper limits (3). However, because nutritional needs should generally be met through food consumption according to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, only a few dietary supplements are specifically recommended for use among children and adolescents and only under particular conditions (4). The most recently released data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during 2017-2018 were used to estimate the prevalence of use among U.S. children and adolescents of any dietary supplement, two or more dietary supplements, and specific dietary supplement product types. Trends were calculated for dietary supplement use from 2009-2010 to 2017-2018. During 2017-2018, 34.0% of children and adolescents used any dietary supplement in the past 30 days, with no significant change since 2009-2010. Use of two or more dietary supplements increased from 4.3% during 2009-2010 to 7.1% during 2017-2018. Multivitamin-mineral products were used by 23.8% of children and adolescents, making these the products most commonly used. Because dietary supplement use is common, surveillance of dietary supplement use, combined with nutrient intake from diet, will remain an important component of monitoring nutritional intake in children and adolescents to inform clinical practice and dietary recommendations.","Stierman, Bryan; Mishra, Suruchi; Gahche, Jaime J; Potischman, Nancy; Hales, Craig M",MMWR.

Features of the pathophysiology and clinical presentation partially distinguish it from 'classical' ARDS. A Research and Development (RAND) analysis gauged the opinion of an expert panel about the management of ARDS with and without COVID-19 as the precipitating cause, using recent UK guidelines as a template. METHODS An 11-person panel comprising intensive care practitioners rated the appropriateness of ARDS management options at different times during hospital admission, in the presence or absence of, or varying severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection on a scale of 1-9 (where 1-3 is inappropriate, 4-6 is uncertain and 7-9 is appropriate). A summary of the anonymised results was discussed at an online meeting moderated by an expert in RAND methodology. The modified online survey comprising 76 questions, subdivided into investigations (16), non-invasive respiratory support (18), basic intensive care unit management of ARDS (20), management of refractory hypoxaemia (8), pharmacotherapy (7) and anticoagulation (7), was completed again. RESULTS Disagreement between experts was significant only when addressing the appropriateness of diagnostic bronchoscopy in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Adherence to existing published guidelines for the management of ARDS for relevant evidence-based interventions was recommended. Responses of the experts to the final survey suggested that the supportive management of ARDS should be the same, regardless of a COVID-19 diagnosis. For patients with ARDS with COVID-19, the panel recommended routine treatment with corticosteroids and a lower threshold for full anticoagulation based on a high index of suspicion for venous thromboembolic disease. CONCLUSION The expert panel found no reason to deviate from the evidence-based supportive strategies for managing ARDS outlined in recent guidelines.","Griffiths, Mark; Meade, Susanna; Summers, Charlotte; McAuley, Daniel Francis; Proudfoot, Alastair; Baladia, Marta Montero; Dark, Paul M; Diomede, Kate; Finney, Simon J; Forni, Lui G; Meadows, Chris; Naldrett, Ian A; Patel, Brijesh; Perkins, Gavin D; Samaan, Mark A; Sharifi, Laurence; Suntharalingam, Ganesh; Tarmey, Nicholas T; Young, Harriet F; Wise, Matt P; Irving, Peter M",Thorax,35,31

BACKGROUND Diabetes affects both large and small vessels in the brain, but the dynamic process and mechanism are unclear. METHODS We investigated the structural and functional changes of brain vasculature in living hyperglycemic rats and their impact on stroke outcomes via a novel technique: synchrotron radiation angiography. We also examined the effect of prolonged fasudil treatment on arterial reactivity and hemorrhagic transformation. Adult Sprague Dawley rats were treated by streptozotocin to induce type 1 diabetes. These hyperglycemic rats received fasudil pretreatment and then underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. RESULTS We found that diabetes caused arteries narrowing in the circus Willis as early as 2 weeks after streptozotocin injection (P < 0.05). These vessels were further constricted after middle cerebral artery occlusion. L-NAME could induce regional constrictions and impaired relaxation in hyperglycemic animals. Furthermore, hemorrhagic transformation was also increased in the hyperglycemic rats compared to the control (P < 0.05). In fasudil-treated rats, the internal carotid artery narrowing was ameliorated and L-NAME-induced regional constriction was abolished. Importantly, stroke prognosis was improved in fasudil-treated rats compared to the control (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our dynamic angiographic data demonstrated that diabetes could impair the cerebral arterial reactivity. Prolonged fasudil treatment could attenuate arterial dysfunction and improve the prognosis of ischemic stroke by affecting both the large and small vasculature.","Mu, Zhi-Hao; Jiang, Zhen; Lin, Xiao-Jie; Wang, Li-Ping; Xi, Yan; Zhang, Zhi-Jun; Wang, Yong-Ting; Yang, Guo-Yuan",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,35,1

Despite the large variety of mesh prosthesis, little is known about their in vivo behavior. Biological meshes are considered to have many advantages, but due to their price they are rarely used. A rat model was used to assess biological and conventional synthetic meshes on their in vivo characteristics. DESIGN One-hundred twenty male Wistar rats were randomized into five groups of 24 rats. A mesh was implanted intraperitoneally and fixated with nonresorbable sutures. The following five meshes were implanted: Parietene (polypropylene), Permacol (cross-linked porcine acellular dermal matrix), Strattice (non-cross-linked porcine acellular dermal matrix), XCM Biologic (non-cross-linked porcine acellular dermal matrix), and Omyra Mesh (condensed polytetrafluoroethylene). The rats were sacrificed after 30, 90, or 180 days. Incorporation, shrinkage, adhesions, abscess formation, and histology were assessed for all meshes. RESULTS All animals thrived postoperatively. After 180 days, Permacol, Parietene, and Omyra Mesh had a significantly better incorporation than Strattice ( P = .001, P = .019, and P = .037 respectively). After 180 days, Strattice had significantly fewer adhesions on the surface of the mesh than Parietene ( P < .001), Omyra Mesh ( P = .011), and Permacol ( P = .027). After 30 days, Permacol had significantly stronger adhesions than Strattice ( P = .030). However, this difference was not significant anymore after 180 days. After 180 days, there was significantly less shrinkage in Permacol than in Strattice ( P = .001) and Omyra Mesh ( P = .050). CONCLUSION Based on incorporation, adhesions, mesh shrinkage, and histologic parameters, Strattice performed best in this experimental rat model.","Kaufmann, Ruth; Jairam, An P; Mulder, Irene M; Wu, Zhouqiao; Verhelst, Joost; Vennix, Sandra; Giesen, Louis J X; Clahsen-van Groningen, Marian C; Jeekel, Johannes; Lange, Johan F",Surgical innovation,35,1

Emerging evidence indicates a role for miRNAs in AAA pathogenesis, therefore we aimed to identify miRNAs that differently expressed in exosomes from AAA patients and explore the underlying mechanisms of how miR-106a plays its role in this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS Exosomes were isolated from plasma of AAA patients, as well as from the tissue-conditioned culture medium. The exosomal expression profiles of several miRNAs including miR-106a were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. To determine the potential role of miR-106a in the pathogenesis of AAA, miR-106a was overexpressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and then cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by performing CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Afterwards, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to assess the expression levels of some proteins involved in the modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. Furthermore, the target gene of miR-106a was predicted and verified through Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS MiR-106a was up-regulated in exosomes from plasma of those patients with AAA as compared with healthy peers. Likely, increased level of miR-106a was observed in exosomes released from AAA tissue in comparison to those from adjacent normal tissues. Enhanced expression of miR-106a in VSMCs suppressed cell viability but promoted cellular apoptosis, whereas inhibition of miR-106a in VSMCs resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of apoptotic cells compared to the control group. In addition, the protein levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-12) secreted from VSMCs were significantly up-regulated, while their inhibitor TIMP-2 was down-regulated due to miR-106a overexpression. Finally, TIMP-2 was validated subsequently as the direct target of miR-106a through Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. CONCLUSIONS In aggregate, our results suggest that increased expression of miR-106a promotes VSMC cell apoptosis and down-regulates TIMP-2 through directly targeting its 3'-UTR, which in turn restores MMP production and ultimately accelerates ECM degradation. Therefore miR-106a is proposed to play a crucial role in AAA development and this will provide an update on the understanding of the clinical value of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease.","Han, Z-L; Wang, H-Q; Zhang, T-S; He, Y-X; Zhou, H",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,35,5

MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a cross-sectional observational study of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19. A control group was used to compare the cumulative incidence and case fatality rate (CFR). The main outcomes of the study were cumulative incidence, defined as number of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19 admitted in emergency department divided by the total number of patients with epilepsy at risk; and CFR based on the number of deaths during the enrolment period. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for fatality in patients with active epilepsy. RESULTS Of the 1537 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 21 (1.3%) had active epilepsy. The cumulative incidence (95% CI) of COVID-19 in epilepsy patients was higher (1.2% [0.6-2.4]) compared to population without epilepsy (0.5% [0.5-0.5]). In RT-PCR positive patients there were no significant differences in CFR in patients with active epilepsy compared to patients without epilepsy (33.3% vs. 8.3%; p =0.266). Of the 21 active epilepsy patients, 5 (23%) died. In multivariate analysis, the factor associated with fatality in patients with active epilepsy was hypertension (OR [95%CI], 2.8 [1.3-21.6]). In other model age (OR [95%CI], 1.0 [1.0-1.1]) and epilepsy (OR [95%CI], 5.1 [1.3-24.0]) were associated with fatality during hospitalization. CONCLUSION COVID-19 cumulative incidence were higher in patients with active epilepsy. Epilepsy was associated with fatality during hospitalization. Hypertension was associated with fatality in patients with epilepsy.","Cabezudo-García, Pablo; Ciano-Petersen, Nicolás Lundahl; Mena-Vázquez, Natalia; Pons-Pons, Gracia; Castro-Sánchez, María Victoria; Serrano-Castro, Pedro J",Neurology,35,5

Incisional, excisional, and ischemia/reperfusion wound models were established on mice of each strain. Wound healing parameters including tensile strength, epithelial gap, and wound necrosis were evaluated.

The diagnosis of this tumor is difficult due to the nonspecific and highly variable morphology, yet it is of clinical relevance because of the availability of highly effective TRK inhibitors. In this article, we report the case of a 40-year-old female who presented with a mass in the left calf. Histologic examination revealed a low-grade sarcoma consisting of monomorphic spindle cells accompanied by abundant myxoid stroma, a feature that had not been emphasized in the reported cases of NTRK-rearranged tumors. The tumor cells expressed CD34 and S100 but not SOX10, and they showed positive staining for pan-TRK. Next-generation sequencing showed the presence of LMNA-NTRK1 fusion. The patient developed several episodes of lung metastases that eventually became unresectable.

Perceptions of risk can modify behaviors, influencing actual exposure. However, greater hazard is not necessarily followed by perception of greater risk and more precautionary behavior because self-serving cognitive biases modulate precautionary and hazardous behaviors. We examined risk perception associated with avian influenza. A total of 1,550 face-to-face within-household interviews and 1,760 telephone interviews were derived to study avian influenza risk perception and live poultry use in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, respectively. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests assessed bivariate associations and risk distributions, respectively, and fully adjusted multivariate logistic models determined independent risk associations. Relative to Hong Kong, perceived ""generalized"" risk from buying live poultry (GZ, 58%, 95% confidence interval 55-60% vs. HK, 41%, 39-43%; chi(2)= 86.95, df = 1, p < 0.001) and perceived self/family risk from buying (z =-2.092, p = 0.036) were higher in Guangzhou. Higher perceived ""generalized"" risk was associated with not buying live poultry (OR = 0.65, 0.49-0.85), consistent with the pattern seen in Hong Kong, while perceived higher self/family risk was associated with buying (""likely/very likely/certain"" OR = 1.74, 1.18-2.59); no such association was seen in Hong Kong. Multivariate adjustment indicated older age was associated with buying live poultry in Guangzhou (OR = 2.91, 1.36-6.25). Guangzhou respondents perceived greater risk relative to Hong Kong. Buying live poultry was associated with perceptions of less ""generalized"" risk but more self/family risk. Higher generalized risk was associated with fewer live poultry purchases, suggesting generalized risk may be a useful indicator of precautionary HPAI risk behavior.","Liao, Qiuyan; Lam, Wendy Wing Tak; Jiang, Chao Qiang; Ho, Ella Yuk Yi; Liu, Yi Min; Zhang, Wei Sen; Richard, Fielding",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,35,24

This study aims to characterize the appearance on MR imaging of 3 commonly employed dural sealants: fibrin glue, PEGH, and BSAG. To this end, patients who underwent spinal intradural procedures that included the use of dural sealant during closure were identified retrospectively. Post-operative data on 15 patients, including complications such as pseudomeningocele formation and infection, were gathered. The appearance of dural sealants on follow-up MR imaging scans within 3 days of surgery was analyzed. Fifteen patients were identified (5 with fibrin glue, 5 with PEGH, and 5 with BSAG applied during closure) with appropriately timed post-operative MR imaging scans. All 3 substances were identifiable based on anatomic location and imaging characteristics on post-operative MR imaging in standard T1, T1 PGFS, and T2 FSE. Definite differentiation between CSF and fibrin glue or PEGH was not possible with the T1 or T1 PGFS, or with the T2 FSE. Differences in intensity between CSF and BSAG were also not significant on either T1 sequence, but they were statistically significant on the T2 FSE. All patients had an uneventful post-operative course, and no patients developed post-operative pseudomeningocele at 30 days. This study concludes that water-based dural sealants such as fibrin glue and PEGH are difficult to differentiate from CSF on standard T1, T1 PGFS and T2 FSE, while BSAG is easily recognized on the T2 FSE. Recognition of water-based sealants therefore requires communication between the neurosurgeon and the neuroradiologist to avoid post-operative misidentification.","Tarapore, P E; Mukherjee, P; Mummaneni, P V; Ames, C P",AJNR.

This study explored the role of oxidative stress and the Nrf2 signaling pathway in mediating the reproductive toxicity of 1-BP using the ovarian carcinoma cell line OVCAR-3 as an in vitro model of the human ovary. OVCAR-3 cells were treated with 1, 5, 10 and 15 mM 1-BP. After 24 h, the cellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde concentrations significantly increased, while the superoxide dismutase activity decreased; translocation of Nrf2 from the cytosol to the nucleus as well as downstream protein expression of Nrf2-regulated genes heme oxygenase-1 and Bcl-2 was inhibited. Apoptosis was also observed, accompanied by increased caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity. The antioxidant vitamin C alleviated 1-BP-induced apoptosis by inhibiting caspase activity activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. These findings suggested that 1-BP induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in OVCAR-3 cells through inactivation of Nrf2 signaling.","Yang, Guangtao; Xiang, Yingping; Zhou, Wei; Zhong, Xiaohuan; Zhang, Yanfang; Lin, Dafeng; Huang, Xianqing",Toxicology and industrial health,35,1

Mediastinal chest tubes are considered to be a significant factor causing postoperative pain after cardiac surgery. The aim of the study was to ascertain whether the duration of mediastinal drainage is associated with postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Design. A total of 468 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the Tampere University Hospital between December 2015 and August 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The first 252 patients were treated according to short and the following 216 patients according to extended drainage protocol, in which the mediastinal chest tubes were habitually removed on the first and second postoperative day, respectively. The oxycodone hydrochloride consumption, as well as daily mean pain scores assessed by numeric/visual rating scales, were compared between the groups. Results. The mean daily pain scores and cumulative opioid consumption were similar in both groups. Patients with reduced ejection fraction, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease reported lower initial pain scores. The median cumulative oxycodone hydrochloride consumption did not differ according to the drainage protocol but was higher in males, smokers, and after aortic surgery. In contrast, patients with advanced age, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease had lower consumption. In multivariable analysis, male sex and aortic surgery were associated with higher and advanced age with lower opioid use. Conclusions. The length of mediastinal chest tube drainage is not associated with the amount of postoperative pain or need for opioids after cardiac surgery. Male sex and aortic surgery were associated with higher and advanced age with lower overall opioid consumption.","Kalli, Antti-Johannes; Järvelä, Kati; Khan, Niina; Mennander, Ari; Khan, Jahangir",Scandinavian cardiovascular journal : SCJ,35,26

A CT-based lung dystrophy severity score (DSS) has recently been proposed to predict recurrence following conservative therapy. This study compares the DSS in surgically and conservatively treated patients. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of first episode PSP patients, comparing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS; group A) to conservative treatment with or without chest drainage (group B). CT scans were reviewed for blebs or bullae, and patients were assigned DSS values and stratified into risk groups (low and high-grade). Primary end point was ipsilateral or contralateral recurrence. RESULTS Fifty-six patients were included, 33 received VATS and 23 conservative treatment. In total, 37.5 % experienced recurrence, with a 5-year estimated recurrence rate of 40.7 % (group A: 13.3 %; group B: 73.9 %; p < 0.001). In group B, detection of any dystrophic lesions resulted in significantly higher 5-year recurrence rates (86.7 vs. 50.0 %; p = 0.03), there was no significant difference in group A (17.7 vs. 7.7 %; p = 0.50). Greater DSS values correlated with higher 5-year recurrence rates in group B (p = 0.02), but not in group A (p = 0.90). Comparing low- and high-grade patients in group B resulted in a significant 5-year recurrence rate of 53.8 versus 100 % (p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS The DSS is useful to indicate VATS after the first episode. For routine application, assigning patients to low- and high-grade groups seems most practical. We recommend CT-evaluation for every PSP patient and early surgery for those with lesions exceeding one bleb. After VATS, the preoperative DSS is not beneficial in predicting recurrence.","Primavesi, Florian; Jäger, Tarkan; Meissnitzer, Thomas; Buchner, Selina; Reich-Weinberger, Silvia; Öfner, Dietmar; Hutter, Jörg; Aspalter, Manuela",World journal of surgery,35,27

We aimed to determine whether a titrated oxygen requirement (TOR) predicted mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We examined 104 adults with IPF enrolled in a prospective cohort study and a validation cohort of 151 adults with a variety of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). The TOR was defined as the lowest oxygen flow rate required to maintain an oxyhaemoglobin saturation of 96% while standing. Cox proportional hazards models and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves were used to examine survival time. A higher TOR was associated with a greater mortality rate independent of forced vital capacity and 6-min walk test results in IPF (adjusted hazard ratio (per 1 L·min(-1)) 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.27). The TOR was at least as accurate as pulmonary function and 6-min walk testing at predicting 1-yr mortality. Findings were similar in other ILDs.

It was noted that AiV differs from other picornaviruses in its unusually high C content and a very high degree of genome-ordered RNA secondary structures. However, the genetic variability and mutational restrictions on a full-genome scale have not been studied. In addition to the available five complete AiV genomes, we determined here another five complete coding sequences of AiV sampled in Germany, 2004. Distinctive AiV genetic features included a low incidence of recombination along the genome without obvious hotspots or spared regions and very low rates of synonymous and non-synonymous variation, supporting an absence of AiV serotypes. In addition, the absence of recombination between AiV genotypes A and B suggested the existence of reproductive isolation between taxonomic units below the species level. In contrast to most other picornaviruses, AiV genomes strongly avoided the UpA dinucleotide, while there was no obvious selection against the CpG dinucleotide. AiV genomes also appeared to contain a codon usage bias (CUB) apparent as an effective number of codons of 39.5, which was amongst the most extreme among RNA viruses. A set of sequence scrambling algorithms was developed to determine the origin of CUB in AiV. While in most picornaviruses the genomic dinucleotide content contributed significantly to CUB, in AiV its extreme nucleotide content, i.e. 57 % third codon position C, was the main driving force behind the apparent CUB.","Lukashev, Alexander N; Drexler, Jan Felix; Belalov, Ilya S; Eschbach-Bludau, Monika; Baumgarte, Sigrid; Drosten, Christian",The Journal of general virology,35,33

DESIGN Qualitative comparison group study using in-depth, semi-structured individual interviews that were thematically analysed. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS This study took place in Scotland. Fifty women were purposively sampled from four ethnic minority groups: South Asian; East European; Chinese; and Black African or Caribbean. White Scottish women were also interviewed. RESULTS Many experiences described were common regardless of ethnicity, such as difficulties managing competing priorities, including work and care responsibilities. However, important differences existed across the groups. These included going abroad for more frequent screening, delayed introduction to screening and not accessing primary care services, language difficulties in health-care settings despite proficiency in English and not being sexually active at screening commencement. Experiences of racism, ignorance and feeling shamed were also reported. CONCLUSIONS Key differences exist in the experience of minority ethnic groups in Scotland. These offer potential opportunities to reduce disparity and support screening participation including maximizing co-incidental interactions and developing outreach work.","Nelson, Mia; Patton, Andrea; Robb, Katie; Weller, David; Sheikh, Aziz; Ragupathy, Kalpana; Morrison, David; Campbell, Christine",Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,35,16

This includes the spread of misinformation, which has been documented within the context of the emerging COVID-19 crisis. Understanding the creation, spread and uptake of social media misinformation is of critical importance to public safety. In this descriptive study, we detail Twitter activity regarding spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and claims it increases, or ""boosts"", immunity. Spinal manipulation is a common intervention used by many health professions, most commonly by chiropractors. There is no clinical evidence that SMT improves human immunity. Methods Social media searching software (Talkwalker Quick Search) was used to describe Twitter activity regarding SMT and improving or boosting immunity. Searches were performed for the 3 months and 12 months before March 31, 2020 using terms related to 1) SMT, 2) the professions that most often provide SMT and 3) immunity. From these searches, we determined the magnitude and time course of Twitter activity then coded this activity into content that promoted or refuted a SMT/immunity link. Content themes, high-influence users and user demographics were then stratified as either promoting or refuting this linkage. Results Twitter misinformation regarding a SMT/immunity link increased dramatically during the onset of the COVID crisis. Activity levels (number of tweets) and engagement scores (likes + retweets) were roughly equal between content promoting or refuting a SMT/immunity link, however, the potential reach (audience) of tweets refuting a SMT/immunity link was 3 times higher than those promoting a link. Users with the greatest influence on Twitter, as either promoters or refuters, were individuals, not institutions or organizations. The majority of tweets promoting a SMT/immunity link were generated in the USA while the majority of refuting tweets originated from Canada. Conclusion Twitter activity about SMT and immunity increased during the COVID-19 crisis. Results from this work have the potential to help policy makers and others understand the impact of SMT misinformation and devise strategies to mitigate its impact.","Kawchuk, Greg; Hartvigsen, Jan; Harsted, Steen; Nim, Casper Glissmann; Nyirö, Luana",Chiropractic & manual therapies,35,1

Nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) have been put forward as potential regulators of inflammation and of ACE2 expression. As vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) activates nAChRs, we aimed to investigate whether VNS can be instrumental in affecting intestinal epithelial ACE2 expression. Methods By using publicly available datasets we qualified epithelial ACE2 expression in human intestine, and assessed gene co-expression of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 priming Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with nAChRs in intestinal epithelial cells. Next, we investigated mouse and human ACE2 expression in intestinal tissues after chronic VNS via implanted devices. Results We show co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with nAChRs and α7 nAChR in particular in intestinal stem cells, goblet cells, and enterocytes. However, VNS did not affect ACE2 expression in murine or human intestinal tissue, albeit in colitis setting. Conclusions ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are specifically expressed in epithelial cells of human intestine, and both are co-expressed with nAChRs. However, no evidence for regulation of ACE2 expression through VNS could be found. Hence, a therapeutic value of VNS with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection risk through ACE2 receptor modulation in intestinal epithelia could not be established.","Ten Hove, Anne S; Brinkman, David J; Li Yim, Andrew Y F; Verseijden, Caroline; Hakvoort, Theo B M; Admiraal, Iris; Welting, Olaf; van Hamersveld, Patricia H P; Sinniger, Valérie; Bonaz, Bruno; Luyer, Misha D; de Jonge, Wouter J",Bioelectronic medicine,35,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective, international multicenter study, we reviewed the electronic medical records and imaging of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 3, 2020, to June 25, 2020. Our inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with acute neurologic manifestations and available chest CT and brain imaging. The 5 lobes of the lungs were individually scored on a scale of 0-5 (0 corresponded to no involvement and 5 corresponded to >75% involvement). A CT lung severity score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). RESULTS A total of 135 patients met the inclusion criteria with 132 brain CT, 36 brain MR imaging, 7 MRA of the head and neck, and 135 chest CT studies. Compared with 86 (64%) patients without acute abnormal findings on neuroimaging, 49 (36%) patients with these findings had a significantly higher mean CT lung severity score (9.9 versus 5.8, P < .001). These patients were more likely to present with ischemic stroke (40 [82%] versus 11 [13%], P < .0001) and were more likely to have either ground-glass opacities or consolidation (46 [94%] versus 73 [84%], P = .01) in the lungs. A threshold of the CT lung severity score of >8 was found to be 74% sensitive and 65% specific for acute abnormal findings on neuroimaging. The neuroimaging hallmarks of these patients were acute ischemic infarct (28%), intracranial hemorrhage (10%) including microhemorrhages (19%), and leukoencephalopathy with and/or without restricted diffusion (11%). The predominant CT chest findings were peripheral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation. CONCLUSIONS The CT lung disease severity score may be predictive of acute abnormalities on neuroimaging in patients with COVID-19 with neurologic manifestations. This can be used as a predictive tool in patient management to improve clinical outcome.","Mahammedi, A; Ramos, A; Bargalló, N; Gaskill, M; Kapur, S; Saba, L; Carrete, H; Sengupta, S; Salvador, E; Hilario, A; Revilla, Y; Sanchez, M; Perez-Nuñez, M; Bachir, S; Zhang, B; Oleaga, L; Sergio, J; Koren, L; Martin-Medina, P; Wang, L; Benegas, M; Ostos, F; Gonzalez-Ortega, G; Calleja, P; Udstuen, G; Williamson, B; Khandwala, V; Chadalavada, S; Woo, D; Vagal, A",AJNR.

A group of experts recently proposed strategies that have compelling rationales and are well grounded in behavioral science. However, their approaches may sometimes be unacceptable, impractical, and/or unsuccessful. Therefore, other strategies will be greatly needed to address vaccine hesitancy. The present commentary offers 8 additional promising approaches forming a framework known as PANDEMIC. This acronym stands for the following strategies: presumptive language, asking for advice, norms on an anonymous level, description of favorable attributes, emphasizing clinicians' own experiences, mandated choice, images, and communication of risk. Each of the strategies is discussed in turn. Many of the proposed strategies have empirical support for achieving desired outcomes in other domains. However, the PANDEMIC framework is untested in regard to increasing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations. Therefore, the strategies should be carefully evaluated before they are widely disseminated through public health announcements, email distribution lists, electronic health record messages, and other outlets.","Stevens, Jack",The American journal of managed care,35,31

As of 19 June 2020 data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 8457305 confirmed cases have been identified in more than 200 countries, with the number of cases cutting across all continents. On 30th January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. Genomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses; therefore, bats could be the possible primary reservoir. The intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known, however, the rapid human-to-human transfer has been confirmed widely via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.","Adetuyi, Babatunde O; Olajide, Peace A; Awoyelu, Elukunbi H; Adetuyi, Oluwatosin A; Adebisi, Oluwaseun A; Oloke, Julius K",African journal of reproductive health,35,1

A proactive solution that may minimize this risk is to regraft that donor site using otherwise discarded skin graft remnants. METHODS A prospective, nonrandomized, consecutive study was designed to compare the time to healing of the commonly used anterior thigh STSG donor site in patients who had routine dressings (n = 113) versus those with comorbidities known to adversely affect wound healing and had planned regrafting (n = 204). Those comorbidities included age (≥65 years), diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal disease, and chronic steroid use. RESULTS The average number of comorbidities in the regrafted subgroup versus those not regrafted was 1.41 and 0.31, respectively. This was considered to be a significant difference (P < 0.0001) confirming the validity in predicting patients at risk for adverse donor-site healing that would benefit by regrafting. The mean time required for donor-site reepithelialization of those regrafted was 17.2 days compared with 17.8 days for those not regrafted (P = 0.2395), which was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS Regrafting the STSG donor site of patients with known comorbidities, that is, those expected to have delayed healing in general, had a mean time to reepithelialization comparable with conventionally treated individuals. This was considered a direct consequence of recycling rather than discarding any excess skin graft materials when so indicated and can be a proactive solution to a potentially cumbersome dilemma.","Bradow, Brian P; Hallock, Geoffrey G; Wilcock, Samuel P",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

The error-prone activity of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) is predicted to be the most influential mechanism for generating mutations. The low fidelity of RT has been successfully exploited by nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that halt viral replication upon incorporation. Consequently, drug-resistant strains have arisen in which the viral RT has an increased fidelity of replication, thus reducing analogue incorporation. Higher fidelity, however, impacts on viral fitness. The appearance of compensatory mutations in combination with higher fidelity NRTI resistance mutations and the subsequent reversion of NRTI-resistant mutations upon cessation of antiretroviral treatment lend support to the notion that higher fidelity exacts a fitness cost. Potential mechanisms for reduced viral fitness are a smaller pool of mutant strains available to respond to immune or drug pressure, slower rates of replication, and a limitation to the dNTP tropism of the virus. Unraveling the relationship between replication fidelity and fitness should lead to a greater understanding of the evolution and control of HIV.","Lloyd, Sarah B; Kent, Stephen J; Winnall, Wendy R",AIDS research and human retroviruses,35,7

This study aimed to identify the challenges that dental hygienists (DHs) encountered when working with other professionals in a multidisciplinary team approach in palliative care for advanced cancer patients. METHODS We conducted the following two studies: (1) a questionnaire-based survey for DHs who belong to Japanese Society for Oral Care (JSOC) on oral care in palliative care settings (n = 1,290), and (2) surveys on education for DHs in universities. Items in this study included the following: 1) a cross-sectional analysis of the curriculum on palliative care at 10 universities and 2) a questionnaire-based survey on palliative care education at 1 of the 10 universities (n = 75). RESULTS (1) Seventy-three percent had experience in oral care in palliative care settings. The number of DHs with ≥20 years' experience was significantly higher than those with <10 years' experience (76% vs 66%, p = 0.042). Further, 92% received no formal palliative care education, and 94% perceived a lack of knowledge on palliative care. These data did not differ based on the years of experience. (2) (a) There was no specific curriculum on the subject of palliative care in 10 universities. Lectures on palliative care were provided at 3 universities. (b) Fifty-five percent of students attended lectures on palliative care. However, 88% of them experienced anxiety, and 78% perceived few classes on palliative care. CONCLUSIONS For DHs, to positively contribute to multidisciplinary palliative care team approach, it is important to establish pregraduate and postgraduate education systems.","Nakajima, Nobuhisa",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,35,1

METHODS In December 2020, parents of pediatric otolaryngology patients were recruited for a survey about concerns related to elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. A Likert scale quantified concern. The 1 was anchored ""Not at all important"" and 5 was ""Most important."" Demographics included gender, age, race, education level, number of children in household, and whether their child had surgery since March 2020. RESULTS About 253 participants were included. Medians ranged from 1 for concerns about emotional and family support to 4 for concerns about their child being exposed to COVID-19 in the Emergency Room. Black parents were more concerned about the risks of COVID than White parents; they were more concerned about their child contracting COVID-19 during surgery compared to White parents, median was 4 versus 3 (P = .027). Black parents had a median score of 3 for concern about medical expenses compared to a median of 2 (P = .001). Parents of children who had surgery since March 2020 had less concern about their child being exposed to COVID-19 during hospitalization (P = .045) and less concern about critique from others (P = .024). CONCLUSION Parents were most concerned about the risk of seeking Emergency Room care. Black parents were generally more concerned about having their child undergo elective surgery. Whether this is translated into fewer Black children undergoing important but elective surgery requires more study.","C Viola, Francesca; DiNardo, Lauren; DeGiovanni, Jason C; Carr, Michele M","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",35,25

The aim of our paper is to explore the current attitudes of oculoplastic surgeons towards telemedicine and its utility in the present landscape and its prospects in the future. METHODS A 39-item questionnaire was distributed to consultant oculoplastic surgeons practising across the UK and anonymised responses were collected and analysed. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic has allowed rapid implementation of telemedicine services in oculoplastic departments across the UK with 86.6% of the respondents incorporating telemedicine into the routine clinical practice. Clinicians reported a statistically significant increase in utility of telemedicine, confidence in using telemedicine and quality of infrastructure available to employ telemedicine following the COVID-19 outbreak. The greatest utility of telemedicine is in triaging, postoperative assessment and eyelid lesion assessment. Main barriers to implementation of telemedicine included difficulties in conducting clinical examinations, lack of administrative support and poor access to digital technologies for patients. Overall, most clinicians were satisfied with the impact of telemedicine services and almost all experts foresee themselves continuing to use telemedicine in the future. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine has become an integral part of the oculoplastic service delivery since the COVID-19 pandemic its use is likely to continue.

We assessed regional cerebral perfusion pressure in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage by using CT perfusion source data. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with acute primary intracerebral hemorrhage were randomized to target systolic blood pressures of <150 mm Hg (n = 37) or <180 mm Hg (n = 36). Regional maps of cerebral blood flow, cerebral perfusion pressure, and cerebrovascular resistance were generated by using CT perfusion source data, obtained 2 hours after randomization. RESULTS Perihematoma cerebral blood flow (38.7 ± 11.9 mL/100 g/min) was reduced relative to contralateral regions (44.1 ± 11.1 mL/100 g/min, P = .001), but cerebral perfusion pressure was not (14.4 ± 4.6 minutes(-1) versus 14.3 ± 4.8 minutes(-1), P = .93). Perihematoma cerebrovascular resistance (0.34 ± 0.11 g/mL) was higher than that in the contralateral region (0.30 ± 0.10 g/mL, P < .001). Ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral perfusion pressure in the external (15.0 ± 4.6 versus 15.6 ± 5.3 minutes(-1), P = .15) and internal (15.0 ± 4.8 versus 15.0 ± 4.8 minutes(-1), P = .90) borderzone regions were all similar. Borderzone cerebral perfusion pressure was similar to mean global cerebral perfusion pressure (14.7 ± 4.7 minutes(-1), P ≥ .29). Perihematoma cerebral perfusion pressure did not differ between blood pressure treatment groups (13.9 ± 5.5 minutes(-1) versus 14.8 ± 3.4 minutes(-1), P = .38) or vary with mean arterial pressure (r = -0.08, [-0.10, 0.05]). CONCLUSIONS Perihematoma cerebral perfusion pressure is maintained despite increased cerebrovascular resistance and reduced cerebral blood flow. Aggressive antihypertensive therapy does not affect perihematoma or borderzone cerebral perfusion pressure. Maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure provides physiologic support for the safety of blood pressure reduction in intracerebral hemorrhage.","Tamm, A S; McCourt, R; Gould, B; Kate, M; Kosior, J C; Jeerakathil, T; Gioia, L C; Dowlatshahi, D; Hill, M D; Coutts, S B; Demchuk, A M; Buck, B H; Emery, D J; Shuaib, A; Butcher, K S",AJNR.

Although several studies have examined VTE, few have examined risk factors separately for DVT and PE after contemporary bariatric surgery, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Our objective was to define risk factors for DVT and PE independently for both LSG and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) patients using the largest validated bariatric surgery database. METHODS The metabolic and bariatric surgery accreditation and quality improvement program (MBSAQIP) database was queried to identify patients who underwent LSG or LRYGB between January 2015 and December 2017. Perioperative data were compared using bivariate analysis. Risk of DVT and PE after LSG or LRYGB was determined using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS During the study period, 369,032 bariatric cases (72% LSG, 28% LRYGB) were performed. The incidence of DVT was similar between LSG and LRYGB (0.2% vs. 0.2%, p = 0.96), while the incidence of PE was decreased for LSG compared to LRYGB (0.1% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001). Operative length was associated with increased risk of postoperative DVT (OR 1.1, CI 1.01-1.30, p = 0.04) and postoperative PE (OR 1.4, CI 1.16-1.64, p < 0.001) after surgery. The largest independent risk factors for DVT were history of DVT (OR 6.2, CI 4.44-8.45, p < 0.001) and transfusion (OR 4.2, CI 2.48-6.63, p < 0.001). The largest independent risk factors for PE were transfusion (OR 5.0, CI 2.69-8.36, p < 0.001) and history of DVT (OR 2.8, CI 1.67-4.58, p < 0.001). LSG was associated with a decreased risk of PE compared to LRYGB (OR 0.7 CI 0.55-0.91, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Prolonged operative length is associated with a higher risk of DVT and PE after either LSG or LRYGB. Transfusion and history of DVT are the largest risk factors for developing DVT and PE. There is a decreased risk of PE after LSG compared to LRYGB.","Gambhir, Sahil; Inaba, Colette S; Alizadeh, Reza F; Nahmias, Jeffry; Hinojosa, Marcelo; Smith, Brian R; Nguyen, Ninh T; Daly, Shaun",Surgical endoscopy,35,20

The patients were divided into two groups based on the different time intervals between neoadjuvant therapy and surgery: 139 (60.2%) patients were in group A (≤ 9 wk), and 92 (39.2%) patients were in group B (> 9 wk). DFS and pathologic response were analyzed as the primary endpoints. The secondary endpoints were postoperative complications and sphincter preservation. RESULTS For the 231 patients included, surgery was performed at ≤ 9 wk in 139 (60.2%) patients and at > 9 wk in 92 (39.8%). The patients' clinical characteristics, surgical results, and tumor outcomes were analyzed through univariate analysis combined with multivariate regression analysis. The overall pathologic complete response (pCR) rate was 27.2% (n = 25) in the longer time interval group (> 9 wk) and 10.8% (n = 15) in the shorter time interval group (≤ 9 wk, P = 0.001). The postoperative complications did not differ between the groups (group A, 5% vs group B, 5.4%; P = 0.894). Surgical procedures for sphincter preservation were performed in 113 (48.9%) patients, which were not significantly different between the groups (group A, 52.5% vs group B, 43.5%; P = 0.179). The pCR rate was an independent factor affected by time interval (P = 0.009; odds ratio [OR] = 2.668; 95%CI: 1.276-5.578). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis showed that the longer time interval (> 9 wk) was a significant independent prognostic factor for DFS (P = 0.032; OR = 2.295; 95%CI: 1.074-4.905), but the time interval was not an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION A longer time interval to surgery after neoadjuvant therapy may improve the pCR rate and DFS but has little impact on postoperative complications and sphincter preservation.","Mei, Shi-Wen; Liu, Zheng; Wei, Fang-Ze; Chen, Jia-Nan; Wang, Zhi-Jie; Shen, Hai-Yu; Li, Juan; Zhao, Fu-Qiang; Pei, Wei; Wang, Zheng; Wang, Xi-Shan; Liu, Qian",World journal of gastroenterology,35,8

Recently developed thrombectomy devices, such as stentrievers and aspiration systems, have helped in improving the endovascular management of acute ischemic stroke. The authors sought to assess the impact of these devices in the endovascular treatment of acute BAO. METHODS A retrospective analysis of 34 consecutive patients treated in Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital for acute BAO was carried out. All patients had undergone an endovascular procedure. In addition to the global results in terms of safety and effectiveness (recanalization rate and 3-month clinical outcome based on the modified Rankin Scale [mRS]), the authors aimed to determine if the patients treated with the most recently developed devices (i.e., the Solitaire stentriever or the ADAPT catheter) had better angiographic and clinical outcomes than those treated with older endovascular strategies. RESULTS The overall successful recanalization rate (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score 2b-3) was 50% (17 of 34 patients). A good clinical outcome (mRS score 0-2 at 3-month follow-up) was achieved in 11 (32.3%) of 34 patients. The mortality rate at 3-month follow-up was 29.4% (10 of 34 patients). Patients treated with the Solitaire stentriever and the ADAPT catheter had a higher recanalization rate (12 [92.3%] of 13 patients vs 5 [23.8%] of 21 patients, p = 0.0002) and a shorter mean (± SD) procedure duration (88 ± 31 minutes vs 126 ± 58 minutes, p = 0.04) than patients treated with older devices. CONCLUSIONS The latest devices have improved the effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy in acute BAO. Their use in further studies may help demonstrate a benefit in the endovascular management of acute BAO.","Fahed, Robert; Di Maria, Federico; Rosso, Charlotte; Sourour, Nader; Degos, Vincent; Deltour, Sandrine; Baronnet-Chauvet, Flore; Léger, Anne; Crozier, Sophie; Gabrieli, Joseph; Samson, Yves; Chiras, Jacques; Clarençon, Frédéric",Journal of neurosurgery,35,1

However, the underlying mechanism still remains to be fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of XQ-1H against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) from the perspective of blood brain barrier (BBB) protection, and explore whether the underlying mechanism is associated with Wnt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway activation. The therapeutic effects of XQ-1H were evaluated in mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and in immortalized mouse cerebral endothelial cells (bEnd.3) challenged by oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Results showed that treatment with XQ-1H improved neurological behavior, reduced brain infarction volume, diminished edema, and attenuated the disruption of BBB in vivo. In vitro, XQ-1H increased cell viability and maintained the barrier function of bEnd.3 monolayer after OGD/R. Moreover, the protection of XQ-1H was accompanied with activation of Wnt/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway and upregulation of tight junction proteins. Notably, the protection of XQ-1H was abolished by Wnt/GSK3β/β-catenin inhibitor XAV939 or β-catenin siRNA, indicating XQ-1H exerted protection in a Wnt/GSK3β/β-catenin dependent profile. In summary, XQ-1H attenuated brain injury and maintained BBB integrity after CIRI, and the possible underlying mechanism may be related to the activation of Wnt/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway and upregulation of tight junction proteins.","Fei, Yu-Xiang; Zhu, Jian-Ping; Bo, Zhao; Yin, Qi-Yang; Fang, Wei-Rong; Li, Yun-Man",Brain research bulletin,35,1

In Morocco, little information is available on the chemical properties of the resulting ashes. In this study, 16 hospital waste ash samples were collected from the incinerators of the two main hospitals in Rabat: Ibn Sina and Cheikh Zayd. A series of tests was conducted, including particle size distribution, mineralogical and chemical composition, and heavy metal leaching behaviour. The results showed that the samples were composed mainly of P2O5 (18%), SiO2 (17%), Na2O (16%), CaO (14%) and SO3 (10%). Moreover, chemical analysis clearly demonstrated that medical waste (MW) contains large amounts of waste generated by domestic activities in the hospital, with a lack of sorting system in the monitoring of MW. Furthermore, the ashes contained high concentrations of heavy metals such as zinc, lead, chromium and nickel with a vast range of 0.5-25071 mg/kg. Leaching tests showed that the extracted amounts of all the heavy metals were lower, with concentrations < 2.85 mg/kg. Comparison of the corresponding heavy metal concentrations with the limit values set by the Council Decision 2003/33/EC allowed us to conclude that bottom ashes meet the waste acceptance criteria regarding these heavy metals.","Bakkali, Meriem E L; Bahri, Meriem; Gmouh, Said; Jaddi, Hassan; Bakkali, Mohammed; Laglaoui, Amin; Mzibri, Mohammed E L","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",35,5

Assessing corrective muscle responses following mechanical perturbations can help clarify these underlying mechanisms, as these responses involve spinal (short-latency response, 20-50 ms), transcortical (long-latency response, 50-100 ms), and cortical (early voluntary response, 100-150 ms) mechanisms. Pairing mechanical (proprioceptive) perturbations with different conditions of visual feedback can also offer insight into how pain impacts on sensorimotor integration. The general aim of this study was to examine the impact of experimental tonic pain on corrective muscle responses evoked by mechanical and/or visual perturbations in healthy adults. Two sessions (Pain (induced with capsaicin) and No pain) were performed using a robotic exoskeleton combined with a 2D virtual environment. Participants were instructed to maintain their index in a target despite the application of perturbations under four conditions of sensory feedback: (1) proprioceptive only, (2) visuoproprioceptive congruent, (3) visuoproprioceptive incongruent, and (4) visual only. Perturbations were induced in either flexion or extension, with an amplitude of 2 or 3 Nm. Surface electromyography was recorded from Biceps and Triceps muscles. Results demonstrated no significant effect of the type of sensory feedback on corrective muscle responses, no matter whether pain was present or not. When looking at the effect of pain on corrective responses across muscles, a significant interaction was found, but for the early voluntary responses only. These results suggest that the effect of cutaneous tonic pain on motor control arises mainly at the cortical (rather than spinal) level and that proprioception dominates vision for responses to perturbations, even in the presence of pain. The observation of a muscle-specific modulation using a cutaneous pain model highlights the fact that the impacts of pain on the motor system are not only driven by the need to unload structures from which the nociceptive signal is arising.","Traverse, Elodie; Brun, Clémentine; Harnois, Émilie; Mercier, Catherine",Neural plasticity,35,1

Bacteria use these proteins to actively transport antibiotics to the extracellular medium, preventing the pharmacological action of these drugs. This study aimed to evaluate in vitro the antibacterial activity of 1,8-naphthyridines sulfonamides as well as its ability to inhibit efflux systems of Staphylococcus aureus strains expressing different levels of the NorA efflux pump. METHODS The broth microdilution test was performed to assess antibacterial activity. Efflux pump inhibition was evaluated in silico by molecular docking and in vitro,by fluorometric tests, and determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The MIC was determined in the association between 1,8-naphthyridine and norfloxacin or ethidium bromide. RESULTS The 1,8-naphthyridines did not show direct antibacterial activity. In contrast, they effectively reduced the MIC of multidrug-resistant bacteria by associating with norfloxacin and ethidium bromide, in addition to increasing the fluorescence emission of this. The in silico analysis addressing the binding between NorA and 1,8-naphthyridines suggests that hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic interactions represent the interactions with the most favorable binding energy, corroborating the experimental data. CONCLUSION In conclusion, our data suggest that 1,8-naphthyridines sulfonamides inhibit bacterial resistance through molecular mechanisms associated with inhibition of the NorA efflux pump in S. aureus strains.","de Morais Oliveira-Tintino, Cícera Datiane; Feitosa Muniz, Débora; Dos Santos Barbosa, Cristina Rodrigues; Silva Pereira, Raimundo Luiz; Maria Begnini, Iêda; Andrade Rebelo, Ricardo; da Silva, Luiz Everson; Lucio Mireski, Sandro; Caroline Nasato, Michele; Lacowicz Krautler, Maria Isabel; Silvino Pereira, Pedro; Galberto Martins da Costa, José; Galvão Rodrigues, Fabiola Fernandes; Rodrigues Teixeira, Alexandre Magno; Ribeiro-Filho, Jaime; Relison Tintino, Saulo; de Menezes, Irwin Rose Alencar; Melo Coutinho, Henrique Douglas; da Silva, Teresinha Gonçalves",Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,35,22

The study of SNORA71A is few, and its role in CRC is unknown. This study focused on screening abnormal snoRNAs in CRC and exploring the role of key snoRNA in CRC. The expression pattern of snoRNAs in 3 CRC and 3 normal colon tissues was detected via small RNA sequencing. The six candidate snoRNAs were identified by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Subsequently, the expression level of SNORA71A was further verified through the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data analysis and qPCR. The CCK8 and transwell assays were used to detect the functional role of SNORA71A in CRC cells. The integrated analysis of snoRNA expression profile indicated that a total 107 snoRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (DE) in CRC tissues compared with normal tissues, including 45 upregulated and 62 downregulated snoRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the DE snoRNAs were mainly implicated in ""detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception of smell"" and ""sensory perception of smell"" in the biological process. The DE snoRNAs were preferentially enriched in ""olfactory transduction"" and ""glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-ganglio series pathway."" The expression of SNORA71A was upregulated in CRC tissues and cells. SNORA71A expression showed statistically significant correlations with TNM stage (P = 0.0196) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0189) and can serve as biomarkers for CRC. Importantly, SNORA71A significantly facilitated the CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our findings indicate that SNORA71A screened by sequencing acted as an oncogene and promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of CRC cells.","Zhang, Zhengxiang; Tao, Yunxiang; Hua, Qingling; Cai, Juan; Ye, Xiaobing; Li, Hao",BioMed research international,35,31

There is a wide gap of information in developing countries regarding the sociodemographic factors linked to UTI among diabetics and the gender disparity among the same. Sociodemographic factors differ with geographical location and many other factors, and this makes them an important aspect that can influence the social burden of UTI among diabetics. The objective of this study was to determine the association between sociodemographic factors and UTI among diabetics. The study was carried out in the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kenya. One hundred and eighty diabetic patients were enrolled in cross-sectional study design. Clean-catch midstream urine was collected from all participants and cultured in cysteine lactose electrolyte deficient agar for bacterial isolation. Classification of a positive culture for urinary tract infection was based on more than 100,000 (≥105) colony-forming units of a single bacterial species. The data were analyzed using frequencies, chi-square (p < 0.05), and logic regression with the help of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 to find the odds ratio. One hundred and seven participants were male (59.4%), and 73 (40.6%) were female. The majority of the participants were between the age of 55 and 59 years old (77.2%), and 125 participants (69.4%) had attained tertiary education as the highest level of education. The overall prevalence of urinary tract infections was 20.6% with 37 participants testing positive for urinary tract infection. Age was found to have a significant association with urinary tract infection (p=0.002) while gender (p=0.45) and level of education (p=0.11) showed no significant association with urinary tract infections among diabetic patients. These findings suggest that age was the biggest association factor that influenced urinary tract infections among diabetic patients.","Mageto, Vincent M; Mbuthia, Oliver W; Ngetsa, Caroline J; Moraa, Dinah O; Okoyo, Erick O; Mathenge, Scholastica G; Njoroge, Wachuka G",International journal of microbiology,35,24

Well-established estimates are currently based on IR functions modeled on post-crash variables, such as velocity change sustained by the vehicle (ΔV); thence, these analyses do not directly suggest how pre-crash conditions can be modified to allow for IR reduction. Nevertheless, ΔV can be disaggregated into two contributions which enable its apriori calculation, based only on the information available at the impact instant: the Crash Momentum Index (CMI), representing impact eccentricity at collision, and the closing velocity at collision (Vr). By extensively employing the CMI indicator, this work assesses the overall influence of impact eccentricity and closing velocity on the risk for occupants to sustain a serious injury. As CMI synthesizes indications regarding ΔV, its use can be disjointed from the ΔV itself for the derivation of high-quality IR models. This feature distinguishes CMI from the other eccentricity indicators available at the state-of-the-art, allowing for the contribution of eccentricity on IR to be completely isolated. Because of this element of originality, special attention is given to the CMI variable throughout the present work. Based on data extracted from the NASS/CDS database, the influence of the CMI and Vr variables on IR is specifically highlighted and analyzed from several perspectives. The feature ranking algorithm ReliefF, whose use is unprecedented in the accident analysis field, is first employed to assess importance of such impact-related variables in determining the injury outcome: if compared to vehicle-related and occupant-related variables (as category and age, respectively), the higher influence of CMI and Vr is initially highlighted. Secondly, the relevance of CMI and Vr is confirmed by fitting different predictive models: the fitted models which include the CMI predictor perform better than models which neglect the CMI, in terms of classical evaluation metrics. As a whole, considering the high predictive power of the proposed CMI-based models, this work provides valuable tools for the apriori assessment of IR.","Gulino, Michelangelo-Santo; Gangi, Leonardo Di; Sortino, Alessio; Vangi, Dario",Accident; analysis and prevention,35,1

METHODS A total of 132 patients who underwent preprocedural Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI followed by initial RFA were retrospectively analyzed. Post-RFA intrahepatic distant recurrence, which excluded the hypervascularization of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules detected by preprocedural Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, was evaluated according to the presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules on preprocedural Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. RESULTS Intrahepatic distant recurrence rates following RFA were higher in patients with non-hypervascular hypointense nodules (1-year: 22.5%, 2-year: 52.1%, 5-year: 89.1%) compared with in patients without non-hypervascular hypointense nodules (1-year: 7.0%, 2-year: 28.8%, 5-year: 48.7%). The presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules was associated with markedly increased cumulative recurrence rates of both identical and different subsegment intrahepatic distant recurrence, being an independent risk factor for post-RFA identical and different subsegment intrahepatic distant recurrence (identical: HR = 2.365, P = 0.027; different: HR = 3.276, P < 0.001).

A similar contrast agent, ioversol, was used as an internal standard and the method underwent a rigorous validation protocol based on β-expectation tolerance intervals. METHODS We adapted the HPLC-UV method from Cavalier et al. to our LC-MS system. Data treatment for the validation was performed using Multiquant 3.0 (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) and e.noval 3.0 software (Arlenda, Liège, Belgium). RESULTS According to the validation results our method will give accurate and reliable results for concentrations ranging from 6.8 to 250μg/ml for iohexol and 6.15μg/ml to 250μg/ml for iothalamate. In our practice these intervals are sufficient to determine both compounds in most patient samples. Samples with higher detected concentrations can always be diluted into range. CONCLUSION With its internal standard and extensive validation, our method is now ready for routine and clinical research use.","Nyssen, Laurent; Delanaye, Pierre; Le Goff, Caroline; Peeters, Stéphanie; Cavalier, Étienne",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,35,26

The current systematic review aims to identify potential pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions from the existing literature to ensure their effective and safe combination usage in cancer patients. Methods A systematic search was conducted on nine major Chinese and English databases, including China Journal Net, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Ovid MEDLINE®, etc., to identify clinical, animal, and in-vitro studies that evaluate the effect of combined use of Lingzhi or Yunzhi with cytotoxic drugs. The Jadad scale was used to assess the quality of clinical studies. Results This search identified 213 studies, including 77 clinical studies that reported on the combined use of cytotoxic drugs with Yunzhi (n = 56) or Lingzhi (n = 21). Majority of these clinical studies demonstrated modest methodological quality. In clinical practice, the most commonly used cytotoxic drugs with Lingzhi were cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and paclitaxel, whereas Tegafur/uracil (UFT)/Tegafur, 5-FU, and mitomycin were the ones used more often with Yunzhi. Only two clinical pharmacokinetic studies were available showing no significant interactions between Polysaccharide K (PSK) and Tegafur. From the pharmacodynamic interactions perspective, combination uses of Yunzhi/Lingzhi with cytotoxic drugs in clinical practice could lead to improvement in survival (n = 31) and quality of life (n = 17), reduction in tumor lesions (n = 22), immune modulation (n = 38), and alleviation of chemotherapy-related side effects (n = 14) with no reported adverse effects. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the clinical combination use of Lingzhi or Yunzhi with cytotoxic drugs could enhance the efficacy and ameliorate the adverse effects of cytotoxic drugs, leading to improved quality of life in cancer patients. More high quality clinical studies including pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions studies are warranted to verify these observations and mechanisms involved. Based on the high quality clinical data, pharmacoepidemiology methods and bioinformatics or data mining could be adopt for further identification of clinical meaningful herb-drug interactions in cancer therapies.","Lam, Chun Sing; Cheng, Lok Pui; Zhou, Li Min; Cheung, Yin Ting; Zuo, Zhong",Chinese medicine,35,12

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about unprecedented challenges in how we take care of our patients. At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, we have gone to great lengths to implement expeditiously a telemedicine platform for safely and securely evaluating our patients during the pandemic. Since implementing live videoconference appointments in late March, 840 patients received ophthalmic care during a 12-week period among all subspecialties at the Vanderbilt Eye Institute. Of these, the majority (79.6%) were either return or postoperative visits. Live telehealth visits were more amenable to certain ophthalmic subspecialties, with paediatrics, neuro-ophthalmology and oculoplastics encounters making up 80.5% of all telemedicine visits. As demonstrated through this care model and our initial experience, live video telemedicine is a sustainable and safe care delivery approach to extend ophthalmic care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic and even post pandemic.","Patel, Shriji; Hamdan, Saif; Donahue, Sean",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,35,1

Objective To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of convalescent plasma therapy for patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants Open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial performed in 7 medical centers in Wuhan, China, from February 14, 2020, to April 1, 2020, with final follow-up April 28, 2020. The trial included 103 participants with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 that was severe (respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia) or life-threatening (shock, organ failure, or requiring mechanical ventilation). The trial was terminated early after 103 of a planned 200 patients were enrolled. Intervention Convalescent plasma in addition to standard treatment (n = 52) vs standard treatment alone (control) (n = 51), stratified by disease severity. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was time to clinical improvement within 28 days, defined as patient discharged alive or reduction of 2 points on a 6-point disease severity scale (ranging from 1 [discharge] to 6 [death]). Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality, time to discharge, and the rate of viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results turned from positive at baseline to negative at up to 72 hours. Results Of 103 patients who were randomized (median age, 70 years; 60 [58.3%] male), 101 (98.1%) completed the trial. Clinical improvement occurred within 28 days in 51.9% (27/52) of the convalescent plasma group vs 43.1% (22/51) in the control group (difference, 8.8% [95% CI, -10.4% to 28.0%]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.40 [95% CI, 0.79-2.49]; P = .26). Among those with severe disease, the primary outcome occurred in 91.3% (21/23) of the convalescent plasma group vs 68.2% (15/22) of the control group (HR, 2.15 [95% CI, 1.07-4.32]; P = .03); among those with life-threatening disease the primary outcome occurred in 20.7% (6/29) of the convalescent plasma group vs 24.1% (7/29) of the control group (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.30-2.63]; P = .83) (P for interaction = .17). There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality (15.7% vs 24.0%; OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.29-1.46]; P = .30) or time from randomization to discharge (51.0% vs 36.0% discharged by day 28; HR, 1.61 [95% CI, 0.88-2.93]; P = .12). Convalescent plasma treatment was associated with a negative conversion rate of viral PCR at 72 hours in 87.2% of the convalescent plasma group vs 37.5% of the control group (OR, 11.39 [95% CI, 3.91-33.18]; P < .001). Two patients in the convalescent plasma group experienced adverse events within hours after transfusion that improved with supportive care. Conclusion and Relevance Among patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, convalescent plasma therapy added to standard treatment, compared with standard treatment alone, did not result in a statistically significant improvement in time to clinical improvement within 28 days. Interpretation is limited by early termination of the trial, which may have been underpowered to detect a clinically important difference.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Around 20% of patients with COVID-19 present with gastrointestinal symptoms. COVID-19 might be neglected in these patients, as the focus could be on finding abdominal pathology. During the COVID-19 pandemic several centers have routinely added chest CT to abdominal CT to detect possible COVID-19 in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the incremental yield of this strategy is unknown. METHODS This multicenter study in six Dutch centers included consecutive adult patients presenting with acute non-traumatic gastrointestinal symptoms, who underwent standardized combined abdominal and chest CT between March 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020. All CT scans were read for signs of COVID-19 related pulmonary sequelae using the CO-RADS score. The primary outcome was the yield of high COVID-19 suspicion (CO-RADS 4-5) based on chest CT. RESULTS A total of 392 patients were included. Radiologic suspicion for COVID-19 (CO-RADS 4-5) was present in 17 (4.3%) patients, eleven of which were diagnosed with COVID-19. Only five patients with CO-RADS 4-5 presented without any respiratory symptoms and were diagnosed with COVID-19. No relation with community prevalence could be detected. CONCLUSION The yield of adding chest CT to abdominal CT to detect COVID-19 in patients presenting with acute gastrointestinal symptoms is extremely low with an additional detection rate of around 1%.","Borgstein, A B J; Scheijmans, J C G; Puylaert, C A J; Keywani, K; Lobatto, M E; Orsini, R G; Veillinga, T van Rees; van Rossen, J; Scheerder, M J; Voermans, R P; Han, A X; Russell, C A; Prins, J M; Gietema, H A; Stoker, J; Boermeester, M A; Gisbertz, S S; Besselink, M G",Annals of surgery,35,1

Thus, their choice among pancreatic surgeons is still mostly experience-based. Aim of the present study is to assess what is the best suture material to be used for pancreaticojejunostomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The force needed to reach the breaking point of five widely used suture materials (polypropylene, polyester, polydioxanone, silk, and polyglactin 910) has been determined through a digital precision dynamometer at baseline and after 5 and 20 days of incubation in pancreatic juice, bile, or a mixture of both. RESULTS Regardless of the condition, polyglactin 910 has retained only 10% of its baseline force. Silk has maintained almost 90% of its initial force showing a very low baseline value of force. In pancreatic juice, polypropylene has lost less force compared to polyester (0.25 vs. 0.93 N; p = 0.03) and polydioxanone (0.25 vs. 3.67 N; p = 0.04). Polyester and polydioxanone have showed similar values of force. However, polydioxanone has lost a significant amount of force in pancreatic juice when compared to polyester (0.93 vs. 3.67 N; p = 0.03). Polyester has showed the highest value of force needed to reach the breaking point after 20 days of incubation in pancreatic juice. CONCLUSIONS After incubation in pancreaticobiliary secretions, polyglactin 910 loses almost all its force. Polypropylene preserves its characteristic, but polydioxanone and polyester show absolute higher breaking points, with polyester retaining the highest value of force needed to reach its breaking point after incubation in pancreatic juice.","Andrianello, Stefano; Marchegiani, Giovanni; Anselmi, Biagio; Secchettin, Erica; Boriero, Fabrizio; Malleo, Giuseppe; Salvia, Roberto; Bassi, Claudio",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,35,24

ICT has also become an essential aspect of medical institutions and healthcare settings. Healthcare professionals, especially nurses are required to use ICT in their daily work. In Lebanon, however, due to political factors, many universities have not introduced technology or any form of ICT in their curricula. Institutions of higher education do use technology in various ways, however, successful incorporation of ICT in education requires acceptance by instructors who are expected to use ICT in teaching practices. Although international findings reveal that ICT should be used in nursing education, some faculty members experience difficulty integrating it. METHOD A mixed methodological research approach was used to investigate the attitudes of nursing teaching staff toward the use of ICT in nursing education. RESULTS Our findings revealed three categories of faculty with differing attitudes to the use of ICT in teaching and learning: pioneers, faculty members who have developed positive attitudes toward ICT usage; followers, faculty members with neutral attitudes; and resisters, faculty members with negative attitudes. CONCLUSIONS Identification of the nursing faculty members' attitude toward ICT and the challenges faced by them contributes to the integration of ICT into nursing curricula and further development of educational practices.","Nsouli, Rona; Vlachopoulos, Dimitrios",BMC nursing,35,5

The purpose of this clinical tutorial is (a) to describe how the Early Language and Literacy Acquisition in Children with Hearing Loss study, a longitudinal study involving speech-language assessment with children with and without hearing loss, transitioned from in-person to virtual assessment and (b) to provide tips for optimizing virtual assessment procedures. Method: We provide an overview of our decision making during the transition to virtual assessment. Additionally, we report on a pilot study that calculated test-retest reliability from in-person to virtual assessment for a subset of our preschool-age participants. Results: Our pilot study revealed that most speech-language measures had high or adequate test-retest reliability when administered in a virtual environment. When low reliability occurred, generally the measures were timed. Conclusions: Speech-language assessment can be conducted successfully in a virtual environment for preschool children with hearing loss.

The gene has, however, never been studied in Cinchona spp. The plants produce quinine alkaloid used for malaria medication, SARS-CoV-2 treatment and other industrial purposes. Cultured cells can produce the alkaloid but only at a much lower yield than the natural tree. This study describes STR expression and quinine content in various plant materials. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted on nine species of Rubiaceae to obtain reference sequences to design conservative primers for Cinchona ledgeriana STR (ClSTR). ClSTR expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR and quinine content was determined using HPLC. A complete coding sequence (CDS) of ClSTR was deposited in NCBI GenBank under the accession number MK422544.1. ClSTR was expressed in cultured cells, young and mature leaves, and stem bark. The elicited cells have higher expression than the control and they performed since the fourth week. However, the quinine content was greater in older cells. The gene expression in young leaves was superior, but quinine was most abundant in the stem bark. Every cell of C. ledgeriana, in culture or in the plant, expressed ClSTR and was capable of synthesizing the alkaloid quinine. The alkaloid from the leaves of the plant might be translocated and accumulated in the bark. No efflux of alkaloids from the confined cultured cells might contribute in triggering feedback inhibition in the biosynthetic pathway. This study revealed a critical obstacle in cell culture as a means of secondary metabolites production that needs further development of metabolic engineering. © 2021 Friends Science Publishers.

These relationships are examined through an analysis of 672 counties before SIP orders were issued. Areas that experienced the most significant transmission of disease are identified, and their characteristics are analyzed. A meaningful relationship was found between the increase of COVID-19 cases and several factors. Average commute time and the proportion of commuters using transit had a positive relationship. Along with other socio-economic factors, such as median house value and proportion of the Black population, several transportation-related factors had a significant association with the transmission of the disease. The decrease rate of total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) before and after SIP orders also had a solid and positive relationship with the expansion of the disease.

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell stimulates innate immunity including NLRP3 inflammasome and lead to development of adaptive immunity later. Hyperinflammatory response with the release of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-6 results in cytokine storm in some patients with a worse outcome. Colchicine acts on NLRP3 inflammasome and inhibits and IL-1 mediated inflammatory attacks in gout and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients. Patients with inadequate response to colchicine may benefit from anti-IL-1 biologic agents such as anakinra and canakinumab. Recently, favourable effects of anakinra have been observed in COVID-19 patients with findings of cytokine storm. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 among refractory FMF patients followed-up in tertiary referral with the treatment of biologic agents and also document the course of COVID-19 in these patients. Methods: We searched out database of FMF patients to identify those using biologic agents (anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6 or anti-TNF) for colchicine-refractory FMF. We interviewed the patients using a standard questionnaire by phone call for symptomatic COVID-19 and evaluated those patients who described findings of COVID-19 further by their hospital records or inviting them to the hospital for additional investigations. Results: We identified 183 patients and contacted 106 of them by phone in May-October 2020. A history of symptomatic COVID-19 was documented in 7 FMF patients who were on a biologic agent. Six were on anti-IL-1 and one was on anti-TNF, and one of the patients was not taking his biologic agents for 1 year. All of 7 patients had a favourable outcome. All but 1 patient followed at home and none of them developed findings of cytokine storm, thromboembolism and secondary bacterial infection. Hospitalized patient did not require intensive care unit (ICU) support or mechanical ventilation, and he was not given additional anti-inflammatory medications. Conclusion: This series of refractory FMF patients with potentially higher inflammatory characteristics showed COVID-19 did not result in a worse outcome in those patients during the first phase of the pandemic, and none developed findings of cytokine storm. Observations in these patients supports further that biologic agents blocking IL-1 and possibly TNF may contribute to the uneventful course of COVID-19 by preventing the development of hyperinflammatory response. Data collection from a larger group of patients, especially those with amyloidosis, will clarify the protective effects of colchicine and contribution of anti-IL-1 treatments on the favourable disease course during the second phase of the pandemic.","Aliyeva, N.; Yaļin Dulundu, B.

SARS-CoV-2, Ebola virus, and Nipah virus are examples of such viruses that have caused deadly epidemics and pandemics when spilled over from bats into human and animal populations2,3. Careful surveillance of viruses in bats is critical for identifying potential zoonotic pathogens. However, metagenomic surveys in bats often do not result in full-length viral sequences that can be used to regenerate such viruses for targeted characterization4. Here, we identify and characterize a novel morbillivirus from a vespertilionid bat species (Myotis riparius) in Brazil, which we term myotis bat morbillivirus (MBaMV). There are 7 species of morbilliviruses including measles virus (MeV), canine distemper virus (CDV) and rinderpest virus (RPV)5. All morbilliviruses cause severe disease in their natural hosts6–10, and pathogenicity is largely determined by species specific expression of canonical morbillivirus receptors, CD150/SLAMF111 and NECTIN412. MBaMV used Myotis spp CD150 much better than human and dog CD150 in fusion assays. We confirmed this using live MBaMV that was rescued by reverse genetics. Surprisingly, MBaMV replicated efficiently in primary human myeloid but not lymphoid cells. Furthermore, MBaMV replicated in human epithelial cells and used human NECTIN4 almost as well as MeV. Our results demonstrate the unusual ability of MBaMV to infect and replicate in some human cells that are critical for MeV pathogenesis and transmission. This raises the specter of zoonotic transmission of a bat morbillivirus.","Ikegame, Satoshi; Carmichael, Jillian C.; Wells, Heather; Furler, Robert L.; Acklin, Joshua A.; Chiu, Hsin-Ping; Oguntuyo, Kasopefoluwa Y.; Cox, Robert M.; Patel, Aum R.; Kowdle, Shreyas; Stevens, Christian S.; Eckley, Miles; Zhan, Shijun; Lim, Jean K.; Hashiguchi, Takao; Durigon, Edison; Schountz, Tony; Epstein, Jonathan E.; Plemper, Richard K.; Daszak, Peter; Anthony, Simon J.; Lee, Benhur",bioRxiv,35,10

International guidelines recommend systematic TB screening at health facilities in high-burden settings, but implementation is challenging. To construct a TB diagnosis care cascade, we investigated screening guideline adherence and completion of TB testing steps in Blantyre, Malawi. Methods A prospective cohort recruited adult ([≥]18) outpatients attending Bangwe acute-care primary clinic between 21/5/2018 and 6/9/2018. Entry interviews recording TB symptoms and demographic characteristics were linked to exit interviews by biometrics. Care cascades were constructed to estimate the proportion of patients progressing through each step of the diagnostic pathway. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with being asked to submit sputum. Results Of 5,442 clinic attendances 2,397 (44%) had exit interviews. In clinically indicated participants (n=330) 203 (61.5%) were asked about cough, 39 (11.8%) were asked for sputum, 27 (8.2%) gave sputum and 1 (0.3%) received same-day results. Significant associations with request for sputum were: any TB symptom (aOR:3.20, 95%CI:2.02-5.06), increasing age (aOR:1.02, 95%CI:1.01-1.04 per year) and for HIV-negative participants only, a history of previous TB (aOR:3.37, 95%CI:1.45-7.81). Numbers requiring sputum survey (20/day) outnumbered diagnostic capacity (8-12/day). Conclusion Patients were lost at every stage of the TB care cascade, with same day sputum submission achieved in only 8.2% if clinically indicated. Infection control strategies should be implemented, with reporting on early steps of the TB care cascade formalised. High-throughput interventions, such as digital CXR, that can optimise same-day TB screening are urgently needed to meet WHO End TB goals.","Feasey, H. R. A.; Corbett, E.

Covid-19 is asymptomatic for some individuals and for others it can cause symptoms ranging from flu-like to acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia and death. Several vaccine candidates are now available, and patients with chronic inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are encouraged to get vaccinated. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine perceptions of RA patients about the covid-19 vaccine. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study including Tunisian patients with RA (ACR/EULAR 2010). Demographic and disease parameters were collected: age, gender, educational status, disease duration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), disease activity score (DAS28), and treatments being used. All patients responded to a questionnaire on their perceptions and concerns about the covid-19 vaccine, and whether they intended to get vaccinated or not. A p value inferior to 0.05 was considered significant. Results: We included 54 patients (45 women and nine men) with a mean age of 55±11 years old [23-69]. Thirty-one percent of patients were illiterate. The mean disease duration was 9.9±5.9 years [0-20]. The mean DAS28 ESR was 4.68±1.35 [1.50-7.16]. NSAIDs were used in 13% of patients, corticosteroids in 63% of patients at a mean daily dose of 8mg [2.5-20] of prednisone equivalent, methotrexate in 63% of patients, sulphasalazine in 13% of patients, leflunomide in 3.7%, and biologics in 22.2% of patients. None of these patients had contracted the covid-19. Seventeen percent of patients had been in close contact with someone positive for the disease. All the patients reported that they respected the preventive measures. Fifteen percent of patients had stopped their treatment because they were afraid of the covid-19: Methotrexate (n=4), sulphasalazine (n=1), tocilizumab (n=2), and rituximab (n=1). More than half of patients (67.7%) reported that they didn't want to get vaccinated against covid-19. The reasons given by these patients were: presumed adverse events (100%), religious beliefs (86.7%). presumed inefficiency (83.3%), no recommendation from their doctor (80%), fear that the vaccine would interact with their treatment (76.7%), lack of trust in the pharmaceutical laboratories (76.7%), fear from vaccines in general (53.3%), fear that the vaccine would make RA worse (50%), and presumed overprice of the vaccine (30%).A significant association was noted between educational status and, religious beliefs (p=0.001), lack of trust in the pharmaceutical laboratories (p=0.007), fear that the vaccine would make RA worse (p=0.008) or interact with other treatments (p=0.022), and presumed overprice of vaccine (p<0.001). Conclusion: Most of RA patients expressed their unwillingness to get vaccinated against covid-19. Doubts about the vaccine's efficiency and security and religious beliefs were the main reasons for this choice.","Ben Abdelghani, K.; Boussaa, H.; Miladi, S.; Sellami, M.; Souabni, L.; Ouenniche, K.; Kassab, S.; Chekili, S.; Fazaa, A.; Laatar, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,35,22

Macrophage polarization and its secreted inflammatory factors have affinity with the outcomes of inflammation. Luteolin, a flavonoid abundant in plants has anti-inflammatory activity, but whether luteolin can manipulate M1/M2 polarization of BMDM to suppress inflammation is still veiled. The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of luterolin on the polarity of BMDM derived from C57BL/6 mice and the expression of inflammatory factors, to explore the mechanism of luteolin regulating the BMDM polarity. M1-polarized BMDM were induced by LPS+IFN-γ, M2-polarization were stimulated with IL-4. BMDM morphology was observed by laser confocal microscopy; levels of BMDM differentiation and CD11c or CD206 on membrane surface were assessed by FCM; mRNA and protein of M1/M2-type inflammatory factors were performed by qPCR and ELISA, respectively; the expression of p-STAT1 and p-STAT6 protein pathways was detected by Western-blotting. The isolated mouse bone marrow cells were successfully differentiated into BMDM, LPS+IFN-γ induced BMDM M1-phenotype polarization, and IL-4 induced its M2-phenotype polarization. After M1-polarized BMDM treated with luteolin, M1-type pro-inflammatory factors including IL-6, TNF-α□iNOS, CD86 were down-regulated while M2-type anti-inflammatory factors including IL-10, Arg1, CD206 were up-regulated; the expression of M1-type surface marker CD11c decreased, nevertheless, M2-type marker CD206 increased; levels of inflammatory signaling protein p-STAT1 and p-STAT6 were attenuated and enhanced respectively.

Due to restrictions and social distancing during the pandemic, counseling may not be applicable in detecting the problems. Therefore, an Islamic spiritual mindfulness-based application called DAHAGA is created in order to detect and reduce depression. It is believed that this innovative app could reduce mental health problems among students. Objective: This study aimed to determine the effect of DAHAGA on reducing depression among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with a comparison group pretest/posttest design conducted from May to June 2020. Seventy students were selected using convenience sampling, of which 35 were assigned in an experimental group and a comparison group. The validated Indonesian Version-Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDIII) was used for data collection. Paired t-test and independent t-test were used for data analysis. Results: There was a significant effect of DAHAGA on depression (p &lt; 0.001). The level of depression after intervention (mean 11.49, SD 4.49) was lower than it before the intervention (mean 17.20, SD 4.94).

This article examines the factors at play in the United States’ decision to bring the challenge. At the level of policy, the United States case reflects India's graduation from the protections afforded developing nations’ export-contingent subsidies under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. A closer examination, however, shows that India ramped up its export-contingent subsidies just as the SCM Agreement required it to wind those subsidies down. Moreover, the expanded Indian subsidies led to increased import competition with the politically influential metals and pharmaceutical sectors in the United States, which pushed the US challenge. We reflect on the larger implications of the challenge for the future of trade rules on industrial policy. In particular, we note that the United States pursued a trade enforcement policy that would have the effect of increasing pharmaceutical prices in the United States, by reducing subsidies for imported generic drugs, at a time when the Trump administration allegedly was trying to reduce the price of prescription drugs. This disconnect suggests the need for both greater transparency in trade policy and greater governmental coordination on the connection between trade policy and other policy priorities.","Dhingra, Swati Meyer Timothy",World Trade Review,35,7

Furthermore, early reports suggest faecal microbial transfer may have therapeutic potential, converting ICI nonresponders to responders. So far, identification of specific responsible bacterial taxa has been inconsistent between published studies, which limits future application. By culturing and metagenomic sequencing of stool sample bacteria, our group has identified a unique microbiome signature, which appears to be predictive of response to ICIs across all key published series as well as our own melanoma patient series (Robinson M et al, J Immunother Cancer 2020;8(suppl 3):A404). Because the patient numbers in all published series remain low, we are now further exploring and validating this microbiome signature in a larger scale study across several different cancer types.

The study explores the impact of zoonotic disease outbreaks on the wildlife trade of Ghana. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the trends of taxa trade and factors that influence trade from 1975–2018 by combining zoonotic disease data with data from the CITES database. Trade flow showed that reptiles were the most traded group, followed by birds, mammals, and amphibians. Species of the families Pythonidae, Dendrobatidae, Cercopithecidae, and Psittacidae were the most traded. The decade mean number of trade for 1997–2007 was the highest (n = 62) followed by 2008–2018 (n = 54.4). Most exporter countries that traded with Ghana are from Africa and importers from the United States of America, Europe and Asia. Continuous trade in reptiles and birds, especially the endangered pythons and psittacus species, could lead to their extinction in the wild. The outbreak of zoonotic diseases influenced the dynamics of the wildlife trade in Ghana as traders shifted their activities among taxa over a period of time. Because those taxa were observed to harbour zoonotic diseases and constitute high health risks when traded. Mammals’ trade flow decreased with disease outbreaks over time, while reptiles increased. Early detection of zoonotic diseases and the adoption of an expanded education module on avoiding species capable of harbouring pathogens will most likely help reduce trade in wildlife.","Bempah, Godfred; Nartey, Moses A.; Dakwa, Kwaku B.; Messenger, Kevin",bioRxiv,35,20

We conducted an epidemiological study in Hong Kong, a major epicentre of influenza virus in the sub-tropical region. RV is the most prevalent respiratory virus year-round and causes asymptomatic to mild symptoms while IV infection exerts a great burden of public health. We aimed to examine the correlation of RV prevalence against IV activity. Methods: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) collected from patients hospitalized in the regional hospitals from 2015 to 2019 were examined for the presence of respiratory viruses. The correlation of the monthly prevalence between all pairs of virus infection, the co-infection rate and the temporal interference of RV and IV were tested. The viral interference was validated in vitro by conducting sequential RV and IV infection in the well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells. Findings: A total of 112,926 NPA were evaluated, and the Enterovirus/RV was the most prevalent respiratory virus detected. The negative correlation between EV/RV and IVs prevalence was independent of age and meteorological factors. Co-infection of EV/RV and IV was significantly less when compared with other virus pairs. Prior exposure to RV inhibited the replication of influenza A, B and oseltamivir-resistance stain in vitro and the inhibition is replication dependent. Interpretation: Epidemiological surveillance and the sequential infection in vitro suggested viral interference between EV/RV and IV operated at the population, individual and cellular levels.","Tao, K.

These oscillatory stimuli can produce sound (i.e. airborne waves) and propagate through solid substrates. Pitch is the main perceptual characteristic of sound, and a similar perceptual attribute seems to exist in the case of substrate vibrations: vibro-tactile pitch. Here, we establish a mechanistic relationship between vibro-tactile pitch perception and the actual physical properties of vibrations using behavioral tasks, in which vibratory stimuli were delivered to the human fingertip or the mouse forelimb. The resulting perceptual reports were analyzed with a model demonstrating that physically different combinations of vibration frequencies and amplitudes can produce equal pitch perception. We found that the perceptually indistinguishable but physically different stimuli follow a common computational principle in mouse and human. It dictates that vibro-tactile pitch perception is shifted with increases in amplitude toward the frequency of highest vibrotactile sensitivity. These findings suggest the existence of a fundamental relationship between the seemingly unrelated concepts of spectral sensitivity and pitch perception.","Prsa, Mario; Kilicel, Deniz; Nourizonoz, Ali; Lee, Kuo-Sheng; Huber, Daniel",bioRxiv,35,1

It has also brought into sharp relief the fragility of the live music festival sector, whose success hinges fundamentally on the capacity for both travel and mass gatherings to occur. Considering this intersection of environmental sustainability and the live music festival sector, this paper-which reports on events occurring long before the global pandemic took hold-examines the ways in which eight Australian folk and world music festivals successfully engage in eco-friendly and pro-environmental practices and educational activities at their events. Findings from this research will assist industry practitioners in being able to engage in similar practices at their events, as well as further academic understandings of the relationship between the environment and the live music sector, and the role of environmental communication practices within this. Design/methodology/approach This study engaged an exploratory research design using interviews to gain an insight into the perceptions of eight live music festival promoters regarding their patrons' on-site eco-friendly behaviours and engagement with the eco-friendly initiatives at their events. Findings Social support within the on-site festival community (applied here through the notion of a sense of communitas), coupled with the provision of eco-friendly initiatives and effective environmental communication approaches, were key pivot drivers to support patrons' pro-environmental behaviours. Engagement with environmental authorities and experts during the festivals was found to validate their eco-friendly approaches. Originality/value This paper provides details of, as well as insights into, the success of the eco-friendly and pro-environmental education practices engaged at select world and folk music festivals in Australia. It broadens and builds upon existing understandings of environmental communication practices.","Alonso-Vazquez, M.; Ballico, C.",Arts and the Market,35,1

Apatinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, is a kind of antiangiogenic drugs which have shown synergistic therapeutic effects in combination with PD-1 blockade. We conducted this single-center, open label phase trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of camrelizumab in combination with apatinib in advanced treatment-naïve acral melanoma pts. Methods: Eligible participants were adult pts (aged 18 to 75) with histologically confirmed unresectable stage or distant metastatic acral melanoma. Exclusion criterion included unknown primary melanoma, brain metastatic disease or previous use of anti PD-1 ab. Pts received camrelizumab at 200mg intravenous infusion every 2 weeks, in combination with apatinib 250 mg orally once a day. The primary endpoint was ORR according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, and the secondary endpoints were safety and RFS. Results: Thirty pts were enrolled from April 2019 to January 2021. Basic characteristics: the mean age was 56.7 years, 22 pts were at stage, 33.3% had an elevated LDH level. Median tumor burden was 45mm (10-187). Gene mutation: Nras 4, cKit 3, Braf 2. Up to January 2021, 27 pts could be evaluated, in which 2 pts got CR, 4 pts achieved PR, and 63% experienced tumor shrinkage. The ORR and DCR were 22.2% and 77.8%, respectively. With a median follow up time of 8.3 months, the median PFS was 8.0 months (95% CI, 3.68, 10.19), the one-year durable response rate was 83.3% and the duration of response time was still not reached. Univariate analysis showed high LDH level was negatively associated with PFS. Whole exome data of baseline tumor biopsies revealed a positive correlation between high copy number variation (CNV) plus high mutational load (TMB) and efficacy, and all of the 4pts with MDC1 gene mutation got tumor shrink and 2 got PR. 96.7% pts experienced treatment-related AEs (TRAEs), including hand foot syndrome in 40%, proteinuria in 40%, liver dysfunction in 36.7%, and hypothyroidism in 30%. The grade 3-4 TRAEs were 33.3%. AE-related permanent discontinuation occurred in only 13.3% pts. 6 pts had delays of treatment due to the COVID-19 epidemic. No dose-limiting toxicities and suspected unexpected AEs were observed in the combination. Conclusions: The combination of apatinib plus camrelizumab was tolerable and showed promising antitumor activities and PFS improvement in pts with treatment-naïve metastatic acral melanoma. The survival is still in follow up.","Wang, X.; Cui, C.; Lian, B.; Si, L.; Chi, Z.; Sheng, X.; Kong, Y.; Mao, L.; Bai, X.; Tang, B.; Yan, X.; Li, S.; Zhou, L.; Guo, J.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,35,20

To date, service users views and co-production exercises have had little impact on the development of treatment and care. This needs to change, and our paper evidences the experiences and perspectives of a diverse range of people on how community services can best address the needs of people with complex emotional needs. Methods A co-produced qualitative research study. Lived experience researchers led data collection and analysis. Individual interviews were conducted with 30 people across England who had a diverse range of experiences and perspectives of using community services for complex emotional needs. Participants were asked about their experiences of using community services for their mental health, and views on how community services can best address their needs. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Results Participants reported some experiences of good practice but also of experiences of severely stigmatising treatment, a lack of effective support and service fragmentation. Relational Practice was identified as the central overarching theme and describes how community services can best support people with complex emotional needs. This approach involves care delivered in a non-stigmatising, individualised, compassionate and trauma-informed manner. It involves care that is planned collaboratively with service users to ensure their multiple needs are addressed in a flexible, holistic and consistent way which accounts for the long-term and fluctuating nature of their needs. Conclusions Relational practice approaches have potential to facilitate better community care for people with complex emotional needs. Research and service development are needed to examine how best to implement such approaches across the mental health service system.

Telehealth may simplify care logistics (e.g. reduce travel and waiting times), but it may also unintentionally exacerbate existing disparities in healthcare utilization by race/ethnicity, age, or rural/urban status. As telehealth will likely continue long-term, we examined telehealth use at a comprehensive cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic across patient populations with established disparities in cancer treatment and outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed telehealth visits from March until December 2020 among individuals diagnosed with cancer at the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center (MCC). We used Chi-squared tests and GEE logistic regression to compare video vs. phone visits by age, urban/rural status, and race/ethnicity (American Indian / American Native [AIAN], Asian, Non-Hispanic Black/African American [NH Black/AA], Hispanic, Multiple, Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander [NHPI], NH White). Results: Over the study period, 42,171 telehealth visits were performed with 11,097 patients at the MCC. Patients had a mean age of 62.7±13.9 years;59.2% were female;88.7% lived in urban areas;90.0% of patients were NH White, 4.4% NH Black/AA, 3.0% Asian, 1.5% Hispanic, 0.8% AIAN, 0.3% of multiple races, and 0.1% NHPI. The most common cancer sites were breast (24.1%), hematological (21.0%), gynecologic (10.0%), and lung (8.4%). NH White individuals were more likely (53.9%) to use video than AIAN (39.7%), Black/AA (37.8%), or NHPI individuals (34.9%). Video use was less common among rural (45.3%) than urban (53.7%;p&lt;.0001) residents, and among individuals aged 65 or older (45.2%) vs. younger than 65 (59.5%;p&lt;.0001). In a logistic regression, adjusted for continuous age and urban/rural status, all race/ethnic groups except Multiple were less likely to use video than NH White individuals (vs. phone;Table). Conclusions: Our findings underscore disparities in telehealth use for cancer care across historically underserved populations.

Comparing the spread of COVID-19 among different countries, Korea demonstrated several distinct characteristics. First, the duration of the coronavirus crisis was relatively short, and Korea was able to flatten the coronavirus curve in a brief period. Second, Korea blocked expanded transmission of the virus without implementing a national lockdown. Third, the coronavirus pandemic did not lead to economic panic.

Individuals experiencing financial insecurity are also more likely to face challenges in accessing the support services they need. There is evidence of unequal uptake of welfare support and benefits, particularly in some ethnic minority groups. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated financial insecurity for the most vulnerable and action is needed to improve the support provided for those affected during the recovery from the pandemic. One approach to improving uptake of benefits has been to deliver welfare services within health settings. This has the potential to increase income and possibly improve health. We conducted systematic review with a critical narrative synthesis to assess the health, social and financial impacts of welfare advice services co-located in health settings and explore the facilitators and barriers to successful implementation of these services, in order to guide future policy and practice. The review identified 14 studies published in the UK from 2010. The services provided generated on average 27GBP of social, economic and environmental return on investment per 1GBP invested. Individuals on average benefitted from an additional 2,757GBP household income per annum and cost savings for the NHS were demonstrated. The review demonstrated that improvements to health were made by addressing key social determinants of health, thereby reducing health inequalities. Co-located welfare services actively incorporated elements of proportionate universalism and targeted those, who due to predominately health needs, were most in need of this support. The nature of the welfare advice service, how it operates within a health setting, and how visible and accessible this service is to participants and professionals referring into the service, were seen as important facilitators. Co-production during service development and ongoing enhanced multi-disciplinary collaboration were also considered vital to the success of co-located services.","Reece, S.; Sheldon, T.

Suburbanization (i.e. the process of combining the non-centric population, economic growth, and spatial expansion) and suburbanisms (suburban ways of living) are key concepts for observing these transformations, framed under the umbrella of the post-suburban theoretical framework. This paper relies on a post-suburban standpoint as it enables the complexity of the diverse transformations at the urban edges to be addressed. On such basis, this paper discusses the outcomes of a qualitative case study conducted on the most recently built neighbourhood of Fiano Romano, a suburb of Rome that has faced a number of socio-spatial transformations over the past two decades. The study illustrates the diverse complexities related to the provision of welfare services and public amenities such as water and social infrastructures. In so doing, the article unfolds the shape of a ?new suburbia? characterized by emerging socio-spatial changes that lie in processes of peripheralization, which characterize many contemporary post-Fordist suburban areas, especially at the present time of the coronavirus crisis. The article points out the centrality of suburban ways of living in studying issues involving both spatial planning and governance of welfare. Furthermore, the article highlights the idea that new inequalities and deprivations are taking place in diverse suburban areas, and that such aspects deserve further governance agendas able to meet the suburban social demands that differ from traditional urban vulnerabilities.","De Vidovich, Lorenzo",European Urban and Regional Studies,35,11

Also, the mobility restrictions have had a widespread impact on people's behavior such as fear of using public transportation (traveling with unknown passengers in the closed area). Securing an appropriate level of safety during the pandemic situation is a highly problematic issue that resulted from the transportation sector which has been hit hard by COVID-19. This paper focuses on developing an intelligent computing model for forecasting the outbreak of COVID-19. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) machine learning model is used to develop the best model for twenty-one worst-affected states of India and six worst-hit countries of the world including India. The best ARIMA models are used for predicting the daily-confirmed cases for 90 days future values of six worst-hit countries of the world and six high incidence states of India. The goodness-of-fit measures for the model achieved 85% MAPE for all the countries and all states of India. The above computational analysis will be able to throw some light on the planning and management of healthcare systems and infrastructure. © 2013 IEEE.","Dash, S.; Chakraborty, C.; Giri, S.

However, not all pregnancies exposed to ZIKV result in an infant with apparent defects. During the 2015-2016 American outbreak of ZIKV, CZS rates varied by geographic location. The underlying mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity in outcomes have not been well defined. Therefore, we sought to characterize and compare the pathogenic potential of multiple Asian/American-lineage ZIKV strains in an established Ifnar1−/− pregnant mouse model. Here, we show significant differences in the rate of fetal demise following maternal inoculation with ZIKV strains from Puerto Rico, Panama, Mexico, Brazil, and Cambodia. Rates of fetal demise broadly correlated with maternal viremia but were independent of fetus and placenta virus titer, indicating that additional underlying factors contribute to fetus outcome. Our results, in concert with those from other studies, suggest that subtle differences in ZIKV strains may have important phenotypic impacts. With ZIKV now endemic in the Americas, greater emphasis needs to be placed on elucidating and understanding the underlying mechanisms that contribute to fetal outcome. IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) actively circulates in 89 countries and territories around the globe. ZIKV infection during pregnancy is associated with adverse fetal outcomes including birth defects, microcephaly, neurological complications, and even spontaneous abortion. Rates of adverse fetal outcomes vary between regions, and not every pregnancy exposed to ZIKV results in birth defects. Not much is known about how or if the infecting ZIKV strain is linked to fetal outcomes. Our research provides evidence of phenotypic heterogeneity between Asian/American-lineage ZIKV strains and provides insight into the underlying causes of adverse fetal outcomes. Understanding ZIKV strain-dependent pathogenic potential during pregnancy and elucidating underlying causes of diverse clinical sequelae observed during human infections is critical to understanding ZIKV on a global scale.","Bohm, Ellie K.; Vangorder-Braid, Jennifer T.; Jaeger, Anna S.; Moriarty, Ryan V.; Baczenas, John J.; Bennett, Natalie C.; O’Connor, Shelby L.; Fritsch, Michael K.; Fuhler, Nicole A.; Noguchi, Kevin K.; Aliota, Matthew T.",bioRxiv,35,1

Previous studies of mouse thymoma cells showed that GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but enriched in a mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) domain. Because PIG-L has no readily identifiable ER sorting determinants, we were interested in learning how PIG-L is localized to the ER and possibly enriched in MAM. We used HeLa cells transiently or stably expressing epitope-tagged PIG-L variants or chimeric constructs composed of elements of PIG-L fused to Tac antigen, a cell surface protein. We first analyzed the subcellular distribution of PIG-L and Glc-NAc-PI-de-N-acetylase activity and then studied the localization of Tac-PIG-L chimeras to identify sequence elements in PIG-L responsible for its subcellular localization. We show that human PIG-L is a type I membrane protein with a large cytoplasmic domain and that, unlike the result with mouse thymoma cells, both PIG-L and GlcNAc-PI-de-N-acetylase activity are uniformly distributed between ER and MAM in HeLa cells. Analyses of a series of Tac-PIG-L chimeras indicated that PIG-L contains two ER localization signals, an independent retention signal located between residues 60 and 88 of its cytoplasmic domain and another weak signal in the luminal and transmembrane domains that functions autonomously in the presence of membrane proximal residues of the cytoplasmic domain that themselves lack any retention information. We conclude that PIG-L, like a number of other ER membrane proteins, is retained in the ER through a multi-component localization signal rather than a discrete sorting motif.","Pottekat, Anita; Menon, Anant K",The Journal of biological chemistry,35,17

RECENT FINDINGS The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak affected over 8000 people killing 774 by July 2003. It particularly affected those providing health care. The initial response of the healthcare system was to use infection control techniques to prevent transmission to staff and patients. This had a dramatic impact on healthcare provision for non-severe acute respiratory syndrome patients during this period.

We describe the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic features of children who were admitted to the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, with a presumptive diagnosis of suspect or probable SARS. METHODS A prospective investigational study protocol was established for the management of children with a presumptive diagnosis of suspect or probable SARS. All were ultimately classified as having probable SARS, suspect SARS, or another cause on the basis of their epidemiologic exposure, clinical and radiologic features, and results of microbiologic investigations. RESULTS Twenty-five children were included; 10 were classified as probable SARS and 5 were classified as suspect SARS, and in 10 another cause was identified. The exposure consisted of direct contact with at least 1 adult probable SARS case in 11 children, travel from a World Health Organization-designated affected area in Asia in 9 children, and presence in a Toronto area hospital in which secondary SARS spread had occurred in 5 children. The predominant clinical manifestations of probable cases were fever, cough, and rhinorrhea. With the exception of 1 teenager, none of the children developed respiratory distress or an oxygen requirement, and all made full recoveries. Mild focal alveolar infiltrates were the predominant chest radiograph abnormality. Lymphopenia; neutropenia; thrombocytopenia; and elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase were present in some cases. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were negative for the SARS-associated coronavirus by an in-house reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in all 25 children. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that SARS is a relatively mild and nonspecific respiratory illness in previously healthy young children. The presence of fever in conjunction with a SARS exposure history should prompt one to consider SARS as a possible diagnosis in children irrespective of the presence or absence of respiratory symptoms. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal specimens seems to be of little utility for the diagnosis of SARS during the early symptomatic phase of this illness in young children.","Bitnun, Ari; Allen, Upton; Heurter, Helen; King, Susan M; Opavsky, Mary Anne; Ford-Jones, Elizabeth L; Matlow, Anne; Kitai, Ian; Tellier, Raymond; Richardson, Susan; Manson, David; Babyn, Paul; Read, Stanley",Pediatrics,35,28

The role of multiple adenosine receptor subtypes in regulating the heart cell function is not known. Ventricular cells cultured from chick embryos 14 days in ovo were used to study a novel feature of heart cell regulation by the stimulatory adenosine receptors. The inhibitory adenosine A1 receptor pathway was first inactivated by pertussis toxin treatment of the cultures, and the effects of adenosine agonists and antagonists on the heart cell contractile amplitude, measured via an opticovideo motion detection system, and on the modulation of cAMP level were determined. Adenosine and N-ethyladenosine-5'-uronic acid (NECA), capable of activating both the adenosine A2a and A2b receptors, caused a greater increase in the contractile amplitude than did the A2a-selective agonist 2-[4-(2-carboxythyl)phenylethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoa denosine (CGS21680). NECA caused a biphasic increase in cAMP, which became monophasic in the presence of the A2a receptor-selective antagonist 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine, whereas the CGS21680-induced cAMP response was monophasic. Blocking with 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine abolished most of the CGS21680-elicited contractile or cAMP response while attenuating only part of the adenosine- or NECA-stimulated responses. Blocking with the A2b-selective antagonists 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine or alloxazine caused a more pronounced inhibititon of the contractile or cAMP response by adenosine or NECA than by CGS21680. Affinity of the A2a receptor was 60-fold higher than that of the A2b receptor. These data demonstrate that a functional A2b receptor is expressed on the heart cell and is capable of mediating augmentation of cardiac myocyte contractility and that adenosine A2a and A2b receptors, with greatly different affinity, coexist and are coupled to the same functional responses. Taken together, the data suggest a novel feature of heart cell regulation, where the high-affinity A2a receptor can play an important modulatory role in the presence of a low level of adenosine, whereas the low-affinity A2b receptor becomes functionally important when the adenosine level is high.","Liang, B T; Haltiwanger, B",Circulation research,35,1

Constructing such registries entails extraneous effort of either reviewing medical charts or creating tailored case report forms (CRF). While documentation has shifted from handwritten notes into electronic medical records (EMRs), the majority of information is logged as free text, which is difficult to extract. OBJECTIVES To construct a tool within the EMR to document patient-related data as codified variables to automatically create a prospective database for all patients undergoing colorectal surgery. METHODS The hospital's EMR was re-designed to include codified variables within the operative report and patient notes that documented pre-operative history, operative details, postoperative complications, and pathology reports. The EMR was programmed to capture all existing data of interest with manual completion of un-coded variables. RESULTS During a 6-month pilot study, 130 patients underwent colorectal surgery. Of these, 104 (80%) were logged into the registry on the same day of surgery. The median time to log the rest of the 26 cases was 1 day. Forty-two patients had a postoperative complication. The most common cause for severe complications was an anastomotic leak with a cumulative rate of 12.3. CONCLUSIONS Re-designing the EMR to enable prospective documentation of surgical related data is a valid method to create an on-going, real-time database that is recorded instantaneously with minimal additional effort and minimal cost.","Rayman, Shlomi; Benvenisti, Haggai; Westrich, Gali; Schtrechman, Gal; Nissan, Aviram; Segev, Lior",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,35,19

In this study, the structure of IBDV SVP was determined in a cubic crystal and refined to 2.6A resolution. It contains 20 independent VP2 subunits in a crystallographic asymmetric unit. Each subunit is folded mainly into a shell domain and a protrusion domain, both with the Swiss-roll topology, plus a small helical base domain. Three VP2 subunits constitute a tight trimer, which is the building block of IBDV (sub)viral particles. The structure revealed a calcium ion bound to three pairs of symmetry-related Asp31 and Asp174 to stabilize the VP2 trimer. Our results of treatment of SVP with EGTA, a Ca(2+)-chelating reagent, indicated that the metal-ion may be important not only in maintaining highly stable quaternary structure but also in regulating the swelling and dissociation of the icosahedral particles. A Ca(2+)-dependent assembly pathway was thus proposed, which involves further interactions between the trimers. The 20 independent subunits showed conformational variations, with the surface loops of the protrusion domain being the most diverse. These loops are targets of the neutralizing antibodies. Several common interactions between the surface loops were clearly observed, suggesting a possible major conformation of the immunogenic epitopes.","Lee, Cheng-Chung; Ko, Tzu-Ping; Chou, Chia-Cheng; Yoshimura, Masato; Doong, Shyue-Ru; Wang, Min-Ying; Wang, Andrew H-J",Journal of structural biology,35,14

Here we show that His-1272 is also necessary for protease activity, consistent with the active site of the enzyme being composed of a catalytic dyad consisting of Cys-1151 and His-1272. By means of radiochemical amino acid sequencing, the site in the polyprotein cleaved by the nonstructural protease was found to follow Gly-1300 in the sequence Gly-1299-Gly-1300-Gly-1301. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that change of Gly-1300 to alanine or valine abrogated cleavage. In contrast, Gly-1299 and Gly-1301 could be changed to alanine with retention of cleavage, but a change to valine abrogated cleavage. Coexpression of a construct that contains a cleavage site mutation (to serve as a protease) together with a construct that contains a protease mutation (to serve as a substrate) failed to reveal trans cleavage. Coexpression of wild-type constructs with protease-mutant constructs also failed to reveal trans cleavage, even after extended in vitro incubation following lysis.

Accordingly, many pharmaceutical inhibitors have been developed to treat several pathologies, like hypertension and heart failure, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) became one of the major target in the treatment of these cardiovascular diseases. In the last decade however, it has become apparent that the classical view of the RAS was not quite accurate. For instance, ACE has been shown to work not only by generating angiotensin-II but also by interacting with receptors outside the renin-angiotensin system. Moreover, it has been shown that many local RAS are present in different tissues, such as the heart, brain, kidney and vasculature. However, in the past, it was impossible to determine the role of these local systems as they were pharmacologically indistinguishable from the systemic RAS. Hence, in recent years, the development of transgenic animals has allowed us to determine that these local systems are implicated in the roles that had been originally attributed exclusively to the systemic action of the RAS. However, with almost 30% of the medicated hypertensive patients harboring an uncontrolled blood pressure, a need for new drugs and new targets appears necessary. With the new century came the discovery of a new homolog of ACE, called ACE2, and early studies suggest that it may play a pivotal role in the RAS by controlling the balance between the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin-II and the vasodilatory properties of the angiotensin(1-7) peptide. Like ACE, ACE2 appears to hydrolyze peptides not related with the RAS and the enzyme has also been identified as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Although the tissue localization of ACE2 was originally though to be very restricted, new studies have emerged showing a more widespread distribution. Therefore, the whole dynamics of the RAS has to be re-evaluated in light of this new information. In this review, we will compare the structures, distributions and properties of ACE and its new homologue in the context of cardiovascular function, focusing on the autocrine/paracrine cardiac and brain renin-angiotensin systems and we will present recent data from the literature and our laboratory offering a new perspective on this potential target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","Lazartigues, Eric; Feng, Yumei; Lavoie, Julie L",Current pharmaceutical design,35,5

Four sows (group B) were inoculated with PRCV oronasally twice at 4 and 2 weeks before parturition; 1 sow (group C) was inoculated similarly, but in 2 subsequent pregnancies; and 2 sows (group D) were oronasally primed with PRCV at 4 weeks before parturition, and 2 weeks later were administered a booster inoculation of virulent TGEV. Two additional sows (group E) remained uninoculated and served as seronegative controls, and 1 sow (group A) that had been naturally infected with TGEV served as a seropositive control. The degree of passive immunity transferred by these sows to their litters was assessed by challenge exposing the pigs of sows in groups B-E (only the second litter of group C) with virulent TGEV at 3 to 5 days of age. After challenge exposure, clinical signs of infection and mortality were noted and fecal and nasal shedding of virus was assessed by ELISA. The IgA, IgG, and IgM antibody titers to TGEV were quantified in colostrum and milk of the sows by use of an isotype-specific monoclonal antibody-capture ELISA, using biotinylated monoclonal antibodies against each porcine isotype as detecting reagents. A plaque-reduction assay was used to quantify neutralizing antibody titers in serum, colostrum, milk, and fractionated whey (IgG and IgA/IgM). In the sow naturally infected with TGEV (group A), there was a pronounced decrease in IgG antibody titers to TGEV in the transition from colostrum to milk, and IgA TGEV antibodies became predominant, with high titers maintained throughout lactation. The 4 group-B sows partially protected their pigs after TGEV challenge exposure; mean mortality was 67%, compared with 100% in pigs suckling the 2 TGEV seronegative control sows (group-E litters). Although IgA TGEV antibodies were detected in colostrum and milk of group-B sows, IgG TGEV antibodies were the most abundant. The sow of group C had a marked increase in IgA TGEV antibody titers in colostrum and milk after reinoculation with PRCV during the second pregnancy, before TGEV challenge exposure of the litter. Its pigs were passively protected to a high degree after TGEV challenge exposure (27% litter mortality).

Knowing the exact location of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is mandatory for managing with interventional therapies. OBJECTIVES Radioisotope cisternography (RICG) is a common procedure in nuclear medicine and may be used as an additional procedure in the differential diagnosis of headaches due to intracranial liquor hypotension syndrome caused by microleakage of CSF. STUDY DESIGN We report an imaging case of complex chronic headache in a patient with an implanted drug delivery pump. The symptomatology of the patient was considered typical of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). Therefore, the initial suspicion was the loss of CSF due to the implanted pump catheter. The negativity of the routine headache test can exclude any leakage of CSF at the site of catheter insertion. SETTING Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Multidisciplinary Pain Management Department, General University General Hospital, Valencia, Spain. RESULTS Many patients are treated with implanted intrathecal infusion systems. In these patients, any neurological symptoms are readily attributed to the invasive neuroaxial system, especially severe cephalalgia. RICG was helpful in this particular case to make a diagnosis of exclusion of the diagnosis of SIH due to CSF leakage. CONCLUSION RICG may be considered as an additional diagnostic technique in patients with chronic pain and implanted spinal infusion devices for whom standard detection procedures have been exhausted.","De Andres, Jose; Esparza, Miguel J; Ferrer-Rebolleda, Jose; Castillo-Ruiz, Ascension; Villaneuva-Perez, Vincent Luis",Pain physician,35,1

To characterize further the mechanisms involved in the induction of protective immunity by this noninternal image anti-Id, plasma and splenocytes from Ab2gamma-immunized BALB/c mice were passively transferred to naive BALB/c mice, followed by viral challenge. A reproducible significant delay in mortality observed in mice to which plasma was passively transferred, together with the presence of specific in vitro neutralizing antiviral Ab3 identified the humoral immune response as the major element responsible for protection. The activation of specific and cross-reactive T lymphocytes by both virus and anti-Id in immunized mice and the absence of adoptive transfer of protection by splenocytes suggested the participation of T helper activity in the induction of protective virus-neutralizing Ab3. To obtain more defined monoclonal reagents for a better understanding of anti-Id-induced protection, mAb2 were generated against the same mAb1 7-10A and characterized. We report the successful generation of mAb2 of the gamma type.

As no effective vaccines or antiviral agents are available, the most effective measure to prevent the expansion of a SARS epidemic is the rapid diagnosis and isolation of SARS patients. To establish specific diagnostic methods, we generated nine clones of monoclonal antibodies to nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). On immunofluorescent antibody assay and Western blotting analysis, none of the monoclonal antibodies showed cross-reactivity to authentic and recombinant NPs of human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E strain. To determine the region on the NP molecule where the monoclonal antibodies bind, we generated four truncated recombinant NPs and analyzed the reactivity between monoclonal antibodies and truncated NPs. Two monoclonal antibodies reacted with a truncated NP covering from amino acid residues 111 to 230, and seven reacted with another truncated NP covering from amino acid residues 221 to 340. Epitope mapping analysis indicated that monoclonal antibody SN5-25 recognized the amino acid sequence Q(245)TVTKK(250) On SARS-NP. Within the epitope, Q245, T246, V247, K249, and K250 appeared to form an essential motif for monoclonal antibody SN5-25 to bind.

The Achilles heel of the virus is the lack of sustained human-human transmission. Fortunately, among the 124 cases reported through 30 May 2006, nearly all were acquired by direct contact with poultry. Unfortunately, the capability for efficient human-human transmission requires only a single mutation by a virus that is notoriously genetically unstable, hence the need for a new vaccine each year for seasonal influenza. Influenza A (H5N1) is being compared to another avian strain, the agent of the ""Spanish flu"" of 1918-1919, which traversed the world in 3 months and caused an estimated 50 million deaths. The question is, are we ready for this type of pandemic? The answer is probably no. The main problems are the lack of an effective vaccine, very poor surge capacity, a health care system that could not accommodate even a modest pandemic, and erratic regional planning. It's time to get ready, and in the process be ready for bioterrorism, natural disasters, and epidemics of other infectious diseases.","Bartlett, John G",Annals of internal medicine,35,16

METHODS A survey was sent to hospital-based members of Cancer Registrars of Illinois between April and June 2020. Survey questions focused on current use and quality of hospital cancer registry data for care coordination as well as items related to COVID-19's effect on cancer patients. The focus of this study was hospital-based registrars, as they are the individuals collecting data directly from primary patient records. RESULTS While hospital cancer registry data are being used for many purposes including continuity of care, this study found that providers are not using hospital cancer registry data to its fullest extent. It was also found that hospital cancer registrars have collected valuable data on the impact that COVID-19 has had on cancer patients. CONCLUSION Care coordination between providers is especially important for cancer patients who may see multiple providers and visit several facilities.

This paper aimed to present an up-to-date review of three specific economically important non-oncogenic immunosuppressive viral diseases of chickens, viz. chicken infectious anaemia (CIA), infectious bursal disease (IBD) and hydropericardium syndrome (HPS), with emphasis on their immunosuppressive effects. CIA and IBD causes immunosuppression in chickens and the socio-economic significance of these diseases is considerable worldwide. CIA occurs following transovarian transmission of chicken anaemia virus and has potential for inducing immunosuppression alone or in combination with other infectious agents, and is characterized by generalized lymphoid atrophy, increased mortality and severe anemia. The virus replicates in erythroid and lymphoid progenitor cells, causing inapparent, sub-clinical infections that lead to depletion of these cells with consequent immunosuppressive effects. The IBD virus replicates extensively in IgM(+) cells of the bursa and chickens may die during the acute phase of the disease, although IBD virus-induced mortality is highly variable and depends, among other factors, upon the virulence of the virus strain. The sub-clinical form is more common than clinical IBD because of regular vaccination on breeding farms. Infection at an early age significantly compromises the humoral and local immune responses of chickens because of the direct effect of B cells or their precursors. HPS is a recently emerged immunosuppressive disease of 3-6-weeked broilers, characterized by sudden onset, high mortality, typical hydropericardium and enlarged mottled and friable livers, with intranuclear inclusion bodies in the hepatocytes. The agent, fowl adenovirus-4, causes immunosuppression by damaging lymphoid tissues; the presence of IBD and CIA viruses may predispose for HPS or HPS may predispose for other viral infections. Synergism with CIA or other virus infections or prior immunosuppression is necessary to produce IBH-HPS in chickens and the susceptibility of chickens infected with fowl adenovirus varies throughout the course of CIA infection. The mechanism of immunosuppression has been studied in detail for certain chicken viruses at molecular levels, which will provides new opportunities to control these diseases by vaccination.","Balamurugan, V; Kataria, J M",Veterinary research communications,35,1

These events result in surprises that cannot easily be predicted based on information obtained at a single scale. Progress on catastrophic events has focused on one of the following two areas: nonlinear dynamics through time without an explicit consideration of spatial connectivity [Holling, C. S. (1992) Ecol. Monogr. 62, 447-502] or spatial connectivity and the spread of contagious processes without a consideration of cross-scale interactions and feedbacks [Zeng, N., Neeling, J. D., Lau, L. M. & Tucker, C. J. (1999) Science 286, 1537-1540]. These approaches rarely have ventured beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. We provide an interdisciplinary, conceptual, and general mathematical framework for understanding and forecasting nonlinear dynamics through time and across space. We illustrate the generality and usefulness of our approach by using new data and recasting published data from ecology (wildfires and desertification), epidemiology (infectious diseases), and engineering (structural failures). We show that decisions that minimize the likelihood of catastrophic events must be based on cross-scale interactions, and such decisions will often be counterintuitive. Given the continuing challenges associated with global change, approaches that cross disciplinary boundaries to include interactions and feedbacks at multiple scales are needed to increase our ability to predict catastrophic events and develop strategies for minimizing their occurrence and impacts. Our framework is an important step in developing predictive tools and designing experiments to examine cross-scale interactions.","Peters, Debra P C; Pielke, Roger A; Bestelmeyer, Brandon T; Allen, Craig D; Munson-McGee, Stuart; Havstad, Kris M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,35,16

METHODS: A survey was devised and publically published on the REDCap database management system with individual centres responding to a public link. RESULTS: 78 adult and paediatric centres worldwide contributed to the survey, representing at least 3500 patients' experience. Centres (n/78 unless otherwise specified, %) reported infrastructure maintenance for PN bag deliveries to patients (60, 76.92%) or delivery of ancillary items (dressing packs, gloves, bungs) (57, 73.08%) home delivery and HPN administration (65, 83.33%) but homecare nurse shortages (25, 32.05%).

These viral sequences or 'viromes' encode viruses that populate the Earth's oceans [2, 3] and terrestrial environments [4, 5], where their infections impact life across diverse ecological niches and scales [6, 7], including humans [8-10]. Most viruses have yet to be isolated and cultured [11-13], and surprisingly few efforts have explored what analysis of available data might reveal about their nature. Here, we compiled and analyzed seven decades of one-step growth and other data for viruses from six major families, including their infections of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic hosts [14-191]. We found that the use of host cell biomass for virus production was highest for archaea at 10%, followed by bacteria at 1% and eukarya at 0.01%, highlighting the degree to which viruses of archaea and bacteria exploit their host cells. For individual host cells, the yield of virus progeny spanned a relatively narrow range (10-1000 infectious particles per cell) compared with the million-fold difference in size between the smallest and largest cells. Furthermore, healthy and infected host cells were remarkably similar in the time they needed to multiply themselves or their virus progeny. Specifically, the doubling time of healthy cells and the delay time for virus release from infected cells were not only correlated (r = 0.71, p < 10-10, n = 101); they also spanned the same range from tens of minutes to about a week. These results have implications for better understanding the growth, spread and persistence of viruses in complex natural habitats that abound with diverse hosts, including humans and their associated microbes.","Jin, Tianyi; Yin, John",Integr Biol (Camb),35,20

RESULTS: Compared with the untreated group, T&#945;1 treatment significantly reduced the mortality of severe COVID-19 patients (11.11% vs 30.00%, P = .044). T&#945;1 enhanced blood T-cell numbers in COVID-19 patients with severe lymphocytopenia. Under such conditions, T&#945;1 also successfully restored CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell numbers in elderly patients. Meanwhile, T&#945;1 reduced PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on CD8+ T cells from severe COVID-19 patients compared with untreated cases. It is of note that restoration of lymphocytopenia and acute exhaustion of T cells were roughly parallel to the rise of TRECs. CONCLUSIONS: T&#945;1 treatment significantly reduced mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with counts of CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells in circulation less than 400/µL or 650/µL, respectively, gained more benefits from T&#945;1. T&#945;1 reversed T-cell exhaustion and recovered immune reconstitution through promoting thymus output during severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 infection.","Liu, Yueping; Pan, Yue; Hu, Zhenhong; Wu, Ming; Wang, Chenhui; Feng, Zeqing; Mao, Congzheng; Tan, Yingjun; Liu, Ying; Chen, Li; Li, Min; Wang, Gang; Yuan, Zilin; Diao, Bo; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen",Clin Infect Dis,35,1

METHODS: In this prospective study, single or double SM were worn by term pregnant women who applied for routine controls. The vital signs of the participants such as oxygen saturation, pulse, respiratory rate, fever, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured at admission and 30 min later. RESULTS: There were 223 participants in the single SM group and 231 participants in the double SM group. Thirty minutes after putting on the mask, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients whose oxygen saturation fell below 95 (3.6 vs 5.6%, p = 0.301). No significant difference was observed between the admission and 30 min oxygen saturation levels of the pregnant women in the single SM group. However, maternal oxygen saturation after 30 min of the pregnant women in the double SM group was significantly lower (97.4 ± 1.1 vs 96.6 ± 1.3, p < 0.001). No significant changes were observed in the vital signs of either groups. CONCLUSION: When using double SM, oxygen saturation is significantly reduced compared to pre-mask values. Nevertheless, it seems difficult to say that these decreases have clinical significance.","Isikalan, Mehmet Murat; Özkaya, Busra; Özkaya, Eren Berkay; Gümüs, Meryem; Ferlibas, Enes; Acar, Ali",Arch. gynecol. obstet,35,20

At the organismal level, the innate immune system is essential for the detection of viruses and constitutes the first line of defense. Viral components are sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs can be further classified based on their localization into Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLR), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and cytosolic DNA sensors (CDS). TLR and RLR signaling results in production of type I interferons (IFN&#945; and -ß) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in a cell-specific manner, whereas NLR signaling leads to the production of interleukin-1 family proteins. On the other hand, CLRs are capable of sensing glycans present in viral pathogens, which can induce phagocytic, endocytic, antimicrobial, and pro- inflammatory responses. Peripheral immune sensing of viruses and the ensuing cytokine response can significantly affect the central nervous system (CNS). But viruses can also directly enter the CNS via a multitude of routes, such as the nasal epithelium, along nerve fibers connecting to the periphery and as cargo of infiltrating infected cells passing through the blood brain barrier, triggering innate immune sensing and cytokine responses directly in the CNS. Here, we review mechanisms of viral immune sensing and currently recognized consequences for the CNS of innate immune responses to viruses.","Singh, Hina; Koury, Jeffrey; Kaul, Marcus",Viruses,35,1

Effective and rapid countermeasure against the spread of the disease's associated virus, SARS-CoV-2, requires to incorporate the computational approach. In this study, we employed various immunoinformatics tools to design a multi-epitope vaccine polypeptide with the highest potential for activating the human immune system against SARS-CoV-2. The initial epitope set was extracted from the whole set of viral structural proteins. Potential non-toxic and non-allergenic T-cell and B-cell binding and cytokine inducing epitopes were then identified through a priori prediction. Selected epitopes were bound to each other with appropriate linkers, followed by appending a suitable adjuvant to increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine polypeptide. Molecular modelling of the 3D structure of the vaccine construct, docking, molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations confirmed that the vaccine peptide had high affinity for Toll-like receptor 3 binding, and that the vaccine-receptor complex was highly stable. As our vaccine polypeptide design captures the advantages of structural epitopes and simultaneously integrates precautions to avoid relevant side effects, it is suggested to be promising for elicitation of an effective and safe immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","Behmard, Esmaeil; Soleymani, Bijan; Najafi, Ali; Barzegari, Ebrahim",Sci Rep,35,10

RESULTS: ACE2 is expressed in conjunctival samples at a low level, while BSG and TMPRSS2 are expressed at intermediate levels in both conjunctiva and cornea. Other receptors such as ANPEP, AGTR2 are expressed at low level in the conjunctiva. Two RNA editing enzymes involved in antiviral responses, APOBEC3A, and ADAR-1 were also highly expressed.

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19. The main purpose of this review was to provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: The authors searched the MEDLINE database for clinical studies related to virus characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, transmission mechanisms, and treatment options. RESULTS: As of January 27, 2021, the number of infected people and deaths associated with COVID-19 worldwide were approximately 100 million and 2 million, respectively. The manifestations of COVID-19 are variable, and the severity is affected by age and preexisting medical conditions. Children and adolescents are usually asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Older adults, in comparison, may experience severe illness and have disproportionally elevated mortality. Among those who survive, some may experience enduring deficits. The viral load is particularly elevated in saliva and oropharynx, which constitute potential sources of infection. The diagnosis of the disease may be confounded by factors related to the replicating cycle of the virus, viral load, and sensitivity of the diagnostic method used. As of January 2021, COVID-19 has no cure but can be prevented. Its treatment is based on supportive care along with antiviral medications and monoclonal antibodies. In severe cases with multiorgan involvement, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and hemodynamic support may be necessary. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a transmittable disease with a variable course. A substantial number of patients, particularly children, remain asymptomatic. Important advances have been made in the development of new treatments. However, the mortality in vulnerable populations remains elevated. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The elevated viral load in the oral cavity and pharynx suggests that oral health care professionals could get infected through occupational exposure. Providers should understand the variables that influence the yield of diagnostic studies because false-negative results can occur.","Lamberghini, Flavia; Testai, Fernando D",J Am Dent Assoc,35,32

The association between time to processing on outcomes was assessed with regression modeling, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Mean male age was 37.9 years in the clinic group and 37.2 years in the home group (p = 0.380). On average, men were abstinent for 3.0 days (SD 1.7) in the clinic group and 4.1 days (SD 5.4) in the home group (p = 0.028).

Many ``structured models'' capture aspects of the contact structure through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An important observation in such models, is that once a fraction $1-1/\mathcal{R}_0$ has been infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an epidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold can be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because the disease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunizing higher-risk individuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited ``first wave'' may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a second wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we systematically analyse a number of mean-field models for networks and other structured populations to address issues relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, we consider herd-immunity under several scenarios. We confirm that, in networks with high degree heterogeneity, the first wave confers herd-immunity with significantly fewer infections than equivalent models with lower degree heterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in the contact network, then this effect might become more subtle. Indeed, modifying the structure can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during the first wave and make the second wave more substantial. We confirm this finding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with real data and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of the mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. We find that results regarding herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, the duration of lockdown and how lockdown is implemented.","Lauro, Francesco Di; Berthouze, Luc; Dorey, Matthew D.; Miller, Joel C.; Kiss, Istv'an Z.",,35,16

Many factors have been identified as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, with much early attention being paid to body mass index (BMI), which is a well-known cardiometabolic risk factor. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to examine the impact of additional baseline cardiometabolic risk factors including high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes on the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in UK Biobank (UKB) study participants. METHODS: We examined the effect of BMI, lipid profiles, diabetes and alcohol intake on the odds of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 among 9,005 UKB participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16 through July 14, 2020. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and ancestry. RESULTS: Higher BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 odds (p < 0.05) while HDL-C and ApoA-I were associated with decreased odds (p < 0.001). Though the effect of BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were eliminated when HDL-C was controlled, the effect of HDL-C remained significant when BMI was controlled for. LDL-C, ApoB and triglyceride levels were not found to be significantly associated with increased odds. CONCLUSION: Elevated HDL-C and ApoA-I levels were associated with reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, while higher BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased odds. The effects of BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c levels were no longer significant after controlling for HDL-C, suggesting that these effects may be mediated in part through regulation of HDL-C levels. In summary, our study suggests that baseline HDL-C level may be useful for stratifying SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and corroborates the emerging picture that HDL-C may confer protection against sepsis in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular.","Scalsky, Ryan J; Chen, Yi-Ju; Desai, Karan; O039,; Connell, Jeffery R; Perry, James A; Hong, Charles C",PLoS One,35,22

METHODS: A search for articles was carried out in the SciELO, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus, Bireme and Web of Science databases. A search for gray literature was also conducted via Google Scholar. There was no restriction regarding place or language, and the search covered the period from January 2010 to August 2020. Studies were selected based on a combination of descriptors from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). RESULTS: Isolated cases of people diagnosed with COVID-19 who were classified as super-spreaders were found. They had been classified thus because they may have had greater potential for infecting other individuals. However, greater numbers of interventions are needed in order to identify and manage COVID-19 cases. There is little evidence regarding this detection, which further hinders recognition and understanding of super-spreading events. CONCLUSION: The scientific community needs greater depth of evaluation and understanding of how these patients physiologically develop the ability to propagate COVID-19 more intensely. A simpler way of tracking them is also necessary, given that many infected people are asymptomatic. Many patients also have mild symptoms, suggesting that these individuals could also be classified as possible COVID-19 spreaders.PROSPERO Number: ID 217874 (submitted for publication and is being assessed by the editorial team).","Rambo, Ana Paula Schmitz; Gonçalves, Laura Faustino; Gonzáles, Ana Inês; Rech, Cassiano Ricardo; Paiva, Karina Mary de; Haas, Patrícia",Sao Paulo Med J,35,7

It also has challenged conventional wisdom and empirical understandings in the comparative politics and policy of health. Three major questions present themselves: First, some of the countries considered to be most prepared-having the greatest capacity for outbreak response-have failed to respond effectively to the pandemic. How should our understanding of capacity shift in light of COVID-19, and how can we incorporate political capacity into thinking about pandemic preparedness? Second, several of the mechanisms through which democracy has been shown to be beneficial for health have not traveled well to explain the performance of governments in this pandemic. Is there an authoritarian advantage in disease response? Third, after decades in which coercive public health measures have increasingly been considered counterproductive, COVID-19 has inspired widespread embrace of rigid lockdowns, isolation, and quarantine enforced by police. Will these measures prove effective in the long run and reshape public health thinking? This article explores some of these questions with emerging examples, even amid the pandemic, when it is too soon to draw conclusions.","Kavanagh, Matthew M; Singh, Renu",J Health Polit Policy Law,35,33

However, few investigations have been conducted to understand the high co-occurrence of antisocial (ASPD), borderline (BPD), narcissistic (NPD), and histrionic (HPD) personality disorder traits and psychopathy. The triarchic model of psychopathy is a framework that focuses on dispositional constructs (meanness, boldness, and disinhibition) with neurobiological and developmental correlates that may be particularly useful in elucidating the overlap between Cluster B personality traits and psychopathy. This study investigated how the triarchic model relates to Cluster B personality traits. Two independent samples completed self-report measures of personality disorder traits. Sample 1 consists of 508 adults, and Sample 2 consists of 529 undergraduate students. Disinhibition positively predicted all Cluster B PDs. Meanness positively predicted ASPD, NPD, and BPD, and negatively predicted HPD. Boldness positively predicted ASPD, NPD, and HPD and negatively predicted BPD. Overall, our study provides insights into how these disorders may fit within new dimensional models of psychopathology and provides information regarding how transdiagnostic features (e.g., boldness) exist among the Cluster B personality disorder traits.

Despite the generally held assumption that insight fluctuates over time within individuals with BDD, its temporal instability and associated features remain unstudied. We examined insight as a multidimensional, contextually embedded, and dynamic factor using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), further assessing affect and self-esteem as potentially associated states. Thirty individuals with BDD and 30 mentally healthy controls (HCs) completed 6 days of EMA (M = 8.54 assessments per day, N = 3075 assessments in total). Multilevel analyses revealed substantial intraindividual fluctuations of insight dimensions (across 30 min to hours) that were more pronounced for individuals with BDD than for HCs. Poorer insight correlated with higher negative affect, lower positive affect, and lower self-esteem at concurrent time points in the BDD group. Considering all predictors at the same time point, poorer insight was characterized by lower self-esteem and, partly, negative affect in the BDD group. Across time, self-esteem and insight influenced each other reciprocally, with comparatively stronger effects for the prediction of poorer insight by previously lower self-esteem. These findings demonstrate that insight is a highly variable phenomenon in BDD, further suggesting a clinically and etiologically relevant link between self-esteem and insight in symptom maintenance.

We hypothesized that both the pandemic per se and the consequent socio-psychological sequelae could constitute stressors for Italian population, potentially affecting the endocrine system. This study was designed to describe the effect of lockdown-related stress on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in a cohort of young men. A prospective, observational clinical trial was carried out, including patients attending the male infertility outpatient clinic before and after the national lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic. The study provided a baseline visit performed before and a follow-up visit after the lockdown in 2020. During the follow-up visit, hormonal measurements, lifestyle habits and work management were recorded. Thirty-one male subjects were enrolled (mean age: 31.6 ± 6.0 years). TSH significantly decreased after lockdown (p = 0.015), whereas no significant changes were observed in the testosterone, luteinising hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol and prolactin serum levels. No patient showed TSH serum levels above or below reference ranges, neither before nor after lockdown. Interestingly, TSH variation after lockdown was dependent on the working habit change during lockdown (p = 0.042). We described for the first time a TSH reduction after a stressful event in a prospective way, evaluating the HPT axis in the same population, before and after the national lockdown. This result reinforces the possible interconnection between psychological consequences of a stressful event and the endocrine regulation.","Brigante, Giulia; Spaggiari, Giorgia; Rossi, Barbara; Granata, Antonio; Simoni, Manuela; Santi, Daniele",Sci Rep,35,8

To date, documentation of the histopathological features in fatal cases of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been scarce due to sparse autopsy performance and incomplete organ sampling. We aimed to provide a clinicopathological report of severe COVID-19 cases by documenting histopathological changes and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism. METHODS: In this case series, patients with a positive antemortem or post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 result were considered eligible for enrolment. Post-mortem examinations were done on 14 people who died with COVID-19 at the King County Medical Examiner's Office (Seattle, WA, USA) and Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office (Everett, WA, USA) in negative-pressure isolation suites during February and March, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. Tissue examination was done by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and quantitative RT-PCR. FINDINGS: The median age of our cohort was 73·5 years (range 42-84; IQR 67·5-77·25). All patients had clinically significant comorbidities, the most common being hypertension, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, and metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. The major pulmonary finding was diffuse alveolar damage in the acute or organising phases, with five patients showing focal pulmonary microthrombi. Coronavirus-like particles were detected in the respiratory system, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. Lymphocytic myocarditis was observed in one patient with viral RNA detected in the tissue. INTERPRETATION: The primary pathology observed in our cohort was diffuse alveolar damage, with virus located in the pneumocytes and tracheal epithelium. Microthrombi, where observed, were scarce and endotheliitis was not identified. Although other non-pulmonary organs showed susceptibility to infection, their contribution to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires further examination.

Platelets are recognized as mediators of inflammation, releasing proinflammatory and prothrombotic factors, and are hyperactivated in COVID-19 infected patients. Activated platelets have also been reported in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, putting these patients at higher risk for thromboembolic complications of COVID-19 infection. Methods: A case-control study of T2D (n=33) and control subjects (n=30) who underwent a hyperinsulinemic clamp to induce normoglycemia in T2D subjects: T2D: baseline glucose 7.5 ± 0.3mmol/l (135.1 ± 5.4mg/dl), reduced to 4.5 ± 0.07mmol/l (81 ± 1.2mg/dl) with 1-hour clamp; Controls: maintained at 5.1 ± 0.1mmol/l (91.9 ± 1.8mg/dl). Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement was used to determine a panel of platelet proteins. Results: Prothrombotic platelet proteins were elevated in T2D versus controls: platelet factor 4 (PF4, p<0.05); platelet glycoprotein VI (PGVI p<0.05); P-selectin (p<0.01) and plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1, p<0.01). In addition, the antithrombotic platelet-related proteins, plasmin (p<0.05) and heparin cofactor II (HCFII, p<0.05), were increased in T2D. Normalization of glucose in the T2D cohort had no effect on platelet protein levels. Conclusion: T2D patients have platelet hyperactivation, placing them at higher risk for thromboembolic events. When infected with COVID-19, this risk may be compounded, and their propensity for a more severe COVID-19 disease course increased.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed from 1st April to May 3, 2020 on 157 ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients in Shahid Modarres Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Patients' clinical, laboratory and radiological findings, and subsequent complications, were collected and compared between MetS and non-MetS groups. RESULTS: 74 of all cases had MetS. Among the MetS components, waist circumference (p-value = 0.006 for men; p-value<0.0001 for women), Triglycerides (p-value = 0.002), and Fasting Blood Sugar (p-value = 0.007) were significantly higher in MetS group; with no statistical difference found in HDL levels (p-value = 0.21 for men; p-value = 0.13 for women), systolic blood pressure(p-value = 0.07), and diastolic blood pressure (p-value = 0.18) between two groups. Length of ICU admission (p-value = 0.009), the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (p-value = 0.0001), respiratory failure (p-value = 0.0008), and pressure ulcers (p-value = 0.02) were observed significantly more in MetS group.

The current study aims to investigate the parallel mediation role of hope and self-efficacy in the relationship between insecurity and stress among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We employed a cross-sectional research design in a university by distributing questionnaires online. 5286 participants were recruited (mean age = 19.65; SD = 1.13). Items were from the Security Questionnaire, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, and the Positive Psychology Capital (Psycap) Questionnaire (PPQ). Parallel mediation analysis was performed using PROCESS macro in SPSS. RESULTS: The results indicate that insecurity predicted students' stress positively and that students with high-level perceived insecurity are more likely to perceive stress. Moreover, hope and self-efficacy mediated the relationship between insecurity and stress, indicating that hope and self-efficacy could buffer the negative effects of insecurity on stress. LIMITATIONS: This study examines the mediating model between insecurity and stress among Chinese university students. The generalizability of the findings in other regions remains to be explored. Additionally, the roles of other positive self-beliefs including optimism and resilience in relieving stress can be further explored in future research. CONCLUSIONS: This research provides direct evidence of insecurity effects on stress among university students, enriching relevant theories in the field of stress. Moreover, this research suggests that enhancing positive self-beliefs such as hope, and self-efficacy helps to relieve students' stress during COVID-19.","Wen, Fang-Fang; Zhu, Jian-Li; Ye, Han-Xue; Li, Lin-Yi; Ma, Zhen; Wen, Xiao-Xue; Zuo, Bin",J Affect Disord,35,1

Abdominal-pelvic MRI revealed a retrovesical mass suspected of liposarcoma with clear borders from surrounding organs. Following two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, we proceeded with surgery. Histopathology was dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Postoperatively, the patient suffered reactivation of COVID-19, and he was eventually discharged after two consecutive negative results on the PCR test on Post Operative Day (POD)-10. Retrovesical dedifferentiated liposarcoma is rare and considered as high-grade liposarcoma.

Meanwhile, myocardial infarction is and will probably remain the foremost cause of death in the Western world throughout the coming decades. Severe deregulation of the immune system can unnecessarily expand the inflammatory response and participate in target and multiple organ failure, in infection but also in critical illness. Indeed, the course and fate of inflammatory cells observed in severe ST-elevation myocardial infarction (neutrophilia, monocytosis, and lymphopenia) almost perfectly mirror those recently reported in severe coronavirus disease 2019. A pleiotropic proinflammatory imbalance hampers adaptive immunity in favor of uncontrolled innate immunity and is associated with poorer structural and clinical outcomes. The goal of the present review is to gain greater insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this canonical activation and downregulation of the two arms of the immune response in both entities, to better understand their pathophysiology and to open the door to innovative therapeutic options.

GTP is crucial for the formation of the initiation complex during RNA replication. This site was computationally targeted using a number of small molecule inhibitors of the hepatitis C RNA polymerase reported previously. Further optimizations suggested a lead molecule that may prove fruitful in the development of potent inhibitors against the RdRp of SARS-CoV2.","Ahmad, Mohammed; Dwivedy, Abhisek; Mariadasse, Richard; Tiwari, Satish; Kar, Deepsikha; Jeyakanthan, Jeyaraman; Biswal, Bichitra K.",ACS Omega,35,1

Whilst an evolving body of literature focuses on the impact of the pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people, less attention has been paid to the collection of qualitative, exploratory data. The aim of this study was to examine young people in North East England's experiences of COVID-19 and associated control measures. Flexible, qualitative diaries were collected with 31 young people aged 13-17 for six weeks between July and October 2020. Diary extracts were curated using Instagram Direct Messaging (DM), email and text messaging. At the end of this study, participants took part in a follow-up interview (conducted by telephone or Zoom), asking them to reflect on their diary entries. Thematic analysis of diaries and interviews yielded three central themes: (1) impacts upon mental health and emotional wellbeing; (2) disruptions and changes to education and school life; and (3) frustration, burden and responsibility. These findings highlight acute mental health impacts (loneliness, isolation, anxiety) as well as longer-term repercussions from disrupted education (missed parts of curriculum, home schooling, cancelled exams, periods of isolation) on young people aged 13-17 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Scott, Stephanie; McGowan, Victoria J; Visram, Shelina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),35,21

Unlike studies characterizing mass media in authoritarian contexts as government mouthpieces during a crisis, this study aims to disaggregate Chinese media practices to uncover differences in when, where, and how the severity of COVID-19 was reported. We examine differences in how media institutions reported the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic in China during the pre-crisis period from 1 January 2020 to 20 January 2020 in terms of both the ""vertical"" or hierarchical positions of media institutions in the Chinese media ecosystem and the ""horizontal"" positions of media institutions' social proximity to Wuhan in terms of geographical human traffic flows. We find that the coverage of crisis severity is negatively associated with the media's social proximity to Wuhan, but the effect varies depending on the positional prominence of a news article and situation severity. Implications of the institutions' differentiated reporting strategies on future public health reporting in an authoritarian context are also discussed.","Xi, Yipeng; Chen, Anfan; Ng, Aaron",PLoS One,35,10

The toughest test is the one that scientists will have to face to prevent virus transmission within schools. Data collected in Italy show that of the diagnosed cases of COVID-19, 2.1% involved children aged 0-9 years and 4.0% children aged 10-19 years, with a mortality rate close to zero. In recent weeks, however, there has been a considerable increase in cases in the paediatric and adolescent population-many of which are asymptomatic-and 16% of the cases reported to the health surveillance system were of subjects under the age of 19. Schools account for 2.5% of new outbreaks, therefore the focus must be shifted to prevention measures such as daily temperature checks, management of suspicious cases at school, and the possibility of using rapid tests at school, due to the high frequency of febrile episodes during winter, in order to distinguish suspected Covid cases from the seasonal flu. Data at hand, scientific studies confirm that children of all ages can be infected with the coronavirus and spread it to others and that in the school environment the spread of the virus can become critical especially in the presence of ""super-spreaders"". In fact, it has recently been shown that the majority of patients (70%) with Covid-19 have never infected anyone else, while only 8% of patients are linked to 60% of new infections. Prevention is crucial and it represents the only way to win the fight against coronavirus, a fight that will also be fought in the classroom during fall.

Herein both waves of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in spring and autumn 2020 differ principally. Whereas Europe was hit by the first wave more or less unprepared, which was aggravated by the high virulence of COVID-19, the second wave is characterized by a much higher contagiosity of the virus with very high incidences. On the other hand the virus has attenuated, which is reflected by the significantly lower incidence-related mortality rate. However, the overall increasing number of infected patients represents again a great challenge for the medical management of the disease. France and Spain are doing better in comparison to Germany and Italy this time. The absolute number of deaths per week is higher than during the peak of the first wave. However, urologists in these countries have also experienced greater restrictions in their activities in the second shutdown than in Germany, where there is only a reduction of beds to between 75 and 90%. Mostly all levels are operated. Of importance for Germany, however, is the plateau on a high level for several weeks probably due to the reduced efficacy of a light lock-down. This finally resulted in a total lock-down in mid-December 2020. Subsequently in Germany some hospitals are also reaching their limits with similar consequences for the departments of urology facing a 50% reduction of beds and operating only level III and IV indications.

This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized.

CONCLUSIONS: Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature at admission, respiratory failure, albumin, and C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Liu, Wei; Tao, Zhao-Wu; Wang, Lei; Yuan, Ming-Li; Liu, Kui; Zhou, Ling; Wei, Shuang; Deng, Yan; Liu, Jing; Liu, Hui-Guo; Yang, Ming; Hu, Yi",Chin Med J (Engl),35,16

METHODS: The EHS is an ongoing and deeply-phenotyped prospective cohort study that has recruited 667 participants in northwest Greece until August 31st, 2020. Level of knowledge on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and COVID-19 severity was labeled as poor, moderate or good. Variables assessing knowledge and beliefs towards the pandemic were summarized overall and by sex, age group (25-39, 40-49, 50-59, &#8805;60 years) and period of report (before the lifting of lockdown measures in Greece: March 30th to May 3rd, and two post-lockdown time periods: May 4th to June 31st, July 1st to August 31st). A hypothesis generating exposure-wide association analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between 153 agnostically-selected explanatory variables and participants' knowledge. Correction for multiple comparisons was applied using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 5%. RESULTS: A total of 563 participants (49 years mean age; 60% women) had available information on the standard EHS questionnaire, the clinical and biochemical measurements, and the COVID-19-related questionnaire. Percentages of poor, moderate and good knowledge status regarding COVID-19 were 4.5, 10.0 and 85.6%, respectively. The majority of participants showed absolute or moderate trust in the Greek health authorities for the management of the epidemic (90.1%), as well as in the Greek Government (84.7%) and the official national sources of information (87.4%). Trust in the authorities was weaker in younger participants and those who joined the study after the lifting of lockdown measures (p-value&#8804;0.001). None of the factors examined was associated with participants' level of knowledge after correction for multiple testing. CONCLUSIONS: High level of knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic and trust in the Greek authorities was observed, possibly due to the plethora of good quality publicly available information and the timely management of the pandemic at its early stages in Greece. Information campaigns for the COVID-19 pandemic should be encouraged even after the lifting of lockdown measures to increase public awareness.","Kanellopoulou, Afroditi; Koskeridis, Fotios; Markozannes, Georgios; Bouras, Emmanouil; Soutziou, Chrysa; Chaliasos, Konstantinos; Doumas, Michail T; Sigounas, Dimitrios E; Tzovaras, Vasilios T; Panos, Agapios; Stergiou, Yiolanda; Mellou, Kassiani; Papamichail, Dimitrios; Aretouli, Eleni; Chatzidimitriou, Dimitrios; Chatzopoulou, Fani; Bairaktari, Eleni; Tzoulaki, Ioanna; Evangelou, Evangelos; Rizos, Evangelos C; Ntzani, Evangelia; Vakalis, Konstantinos; Tsilidis, Konstantinos K",BMC Public Health,35,30

In particular, the healthcare system has been subject to an enormous pressure that has surpassed its ability in many instances. Additionally, the pandemic has called for a review of our daily medical practices, including our approach to colorectal cancer management where treatment puts patients at high risk of virus exposure. Given their higher median age, patients are at an increased risk for severe symptoms and complications in cases of infection, especially in the setting of immunosuppression. Therefore, a review of the routine colorectal cancer practices is needed to minimize risk of exposure. Oncologists should weigh risk of exposure versus the patient's oncologic benefits when approaching management. In addition, treatment protocols should be modified to minimize hospital visits and admissions while maintaining the same treatment efficacy. In this review, we will focus on challenges that colorectal cancer patients face during the pandemic, while highlighting the priority in each case. We will also discuss the evidence for potential modifications to existing treatment plans that could reduce infectious exposure without compromising care.

On the one hand, this exceptional situation created unprecedented learning opportunities for nursing students. Yet, on the other hand, this situation can jeopardise nursing students learning trajectory. OBJECTIVES: To study nursing students' experiences during clinical placement during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey design. SETTINGS: Clinical placements during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing students from nine Belgian nursing schools. METHODS: All students enrolled in nursing education are eligible to participate. The survey consists of five dimensions: demographics, risk perception, self-efficacy, support and communication, and resilience. RESULTS: The gaps that were identified by students focused on the need for more psychosocial support, establishing (regular) contact with their clinical placement supervisor, recognition of the difficult work situation, and the need for more space to unwind. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing students expressed a strong need to be heard, prepared, and supported. Most students felt supported by their nursing schools. Because of COVID-19, the role of the preceptor became more important. However, due to several reasons, the perceptor did not always meet the student's expectations. Preparing students for specific competencies is needed. In spite of the efforts of nursing schools and clinical sites, students often got lost in the chaos of the pandemic. This resulted in practical worries, fewer learning opportunities, and even fundamental doubts about their choice to become a nurse. Finally, it crucial that nursing schools and clinical sites communicate about matters such as the responsibility for testing nursing students, the provisions of uniforms and personal protective equipment, and structurally sharing guidelines with students to provide safe patient care.","Ulenaers, Dorien; Grosemans, Joep; Schrooten, Ward; Bergs, Jochen",Nurse Educ Today,35,16

Outreach included: local production and dissemination of 10 culturally relevant safety videos, 10 risk, prevention, and safety postcard messages, 3 virtual forums, and PPE kit distribution via the network and their distribution venues. Communication mediums included social media posts (i.e., Facebook and YouTube), network email distribution lists, and postcards distributed along with PPE kits. Outreach activities were evaluated via an online survey, reach of social media posts, and PPE distribution. Working through the organizational network, the WGHC reached a combined total of 30,310 community members with educational materials. Forty-four outreach events were held during this period and over 8000 PPE kits were distributed. The online survey, distributed through the network, yielded more than 400 completed questionnaires.

This article describes the author's experience providing nursing care to a female patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning to Taiwan from overseas. During the patient's period of isolation (February 5th to February 29th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform first-level holistic physical, psychological, and social nursing assessments and collected health-problem information using face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and observations via a remote monitoring system. A second level of assessment confirmed that the problems faced by the patient included (1) existing infections related to COVID-19 and (2) anxiety related to uncertainties about disease prognosis, forgiveness from the family, and potential violations of personal privacy by the media. Due to the special nature of the isolation ward, the author used a remote physiological monitoring system to monitor the vital signs, fever, and shortness of breath status of the patient to quickly decrease her physical discomfort and to improve her self-care ability during hospitalization. Environmental cleanliness was strictly maintained to reduce the risk of cross-infection and ensure patient safety. To alleviate patient anxiety, the author established a good therapeutic interpersonal relationship with the patient by making 10-60 minutes of caring calls to her each day, by providing individual care measures, and by using the Internet to play audio and video to teach mindfulness meditation. Caring for COVID-19 cases is a completely new experience.

[...]China has long been a partner in addressing African medical and public health challenges, and Chinese COVID-related aid in this sector continues to follow the decades-long blueprint of linking Chinese provincial medical teams to specific recipient countries alongside a provisioning of supplies and construction of medical infrastructure. [...]the widespread suspicion that the disease jumped to humans from a wild animal appears to be crystallizing China’s ambition to regulate its trade in wild animals and animal products, many of which originate in Africa. Following the coronavirus outbreak, China has taken initial steps to eradicate its domestic market for wild animals, and early anecdotal evidence of a slump in demand in African markets suggests these measures are already having an effect.5 Sharp reductions in Chinese trading of African wildlife would have not only major ecological benefits, but also developmental ones—by reducing organized crime and the depletion of biological resources. 7 Crucially, lockdowns and the global economic slowdown have had a profound impact on livelihoods: survey data from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Burkina Faso, and Nigeria suggest that 75% of households have lost some or all of their income.8 According to the World Bank, 2020 real per capita GDP is likely to have declined to 2008 levels in Sub-Saharan Africa.9 Drops in Chinese economic activity on the continent exacerbate these broader patterns.","Morgan, Pippa",Georgetown Journal of International Affairs,35,24

Apart from deaths with a positive COVID-19 test, many others have died from causes indirectly related to COVID-19. Therefore, the COVID-19 confirmed deaths underestimate the influence of the pandemic on society; instead, the measure of 'excess deaths' is a more objective and comparable way to assess the scale of the epidemic and formulate lessons. One common practical issue in analysing the impact of COVID-19 is to determine the 'pre-COVID-19' period and the 'post-COVID-19' period.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 among adults in China and its variation among provinces and by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Between May 8 and June 8, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among adults in China who were registered with the private survey company KuRunData. We set a target sample size of 10,000 adults, aiming to sample 300-360 adults from each province in China. Participants were asked 25 questions that tested their knowledge about COVID-19, including measures to prevent infection, common symptoms, and recommended care-seeking behavior. We disaggregated responses by age; sex; education; province; household income; rural-urban residency; and whether or not a participant had a family member, friend, or acquaintance who they know to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. All analyses used survey sampling weights. RESULTS: There were 5079 men and 4921 women who completed the questionnaire and were included in the analysis. Out of 25 knowledge questions, participants answered a mean and median of 21.4 (95% CI 21.3-21.4) and 22 (IQR 20-23) questions correctly, respectively. A total of 83.4% (95% CI 82.7%-84.1%) of participants answered four-fifths or more of the questions correctly. For at least one of four ineffective prevention measures (using a hand dryer, regular nasal irrigation, gargling mouthwash, and taking antibiotics), 68.9% (95% CI 68.0%-69.8%) of participants answered that it was an effective method to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although knowledge overall was similar across provinces, the percent of participants who answered the question on recommended care-seeking behavior correctly varied from 47.0% (95% CI 41.4%-52.7%) in Tibet to 87.5% (95% CI 84.1%-91.0%) in Beijing. Within provinces, participants who were male, were middle-aged, were residing in urban areas, and had higher household income tended to answer a higher proportion of the knowledge questions correctly. CONCLUSIONS: This online study of individuals across China suggests that the majority of the population has good knowledge of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion still holds misconceptions or incorrect beliefs about prevention methods and recommended health care-seeking behaviors, especially in rural areas and some less wealthy provinces in Western China. This study can inform the development of tailored public health policies and promotion campaigns by identifying knowledge areas for which misconceptions are comparatively common and provinces that have relatively low knowledge.","Yu, Fengyun; Geldsetzer, Pascal; Meierkord, Anne; Yang, Juntao; Chen, Qiushi; Jiao, Lirui; Abou-Arraj, Nadeem E; Pan, An; Wang, Chen; Bärnighausen, Till; Chen, Simiao",J Med Internet Res,35,1

In the present retrospective monocentric study, we report on our experience, our basic principles, and our results in establishing and managing ECMO in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU of the Geneva University Hospitals and supported by VV-ECMO from March 14 to May 31. The VV-ECMO implementation criteria were defined according to an institutional algorithm validated by the local crisis unit and the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. RESULTS: Out of 137 ARDS patients admitted to our ICU, 10 patients (age 57 ± 4 years, BMI 31.5 ± 5 kg/m2 , and SAPS II score 56 ± 3) were put on VV-ECMO. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO and mean time under ECMO were 7 ± 3 days and 19 ± 11 days, respectively. The ICU and hospital length of stay were 26 ± 11 and 35 ± 10 days, respectively. The survival rate for patients on ECMO was 40%. The comparative analysis between survivors and non-survivors highlighted that survivors had a significantly shorter mechanical ventilation duration before ECMO (4 ± 2 days vs. 9 ± 2 days, p = 0.01). All the patients who had more than 150 h of mechanical ventilation before the application of ECMO ultimately died. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that VV-ECMO can be safely utilized in appropriately selected COVID-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia. The main information for clinicians is that late VV-ECMO therapy (i.e., beyond the seventh day of mechanical ventilation) seems futile.","Giraud, Raphaël; Legouis, David; Assouline, Benjamin; De Charriere, Amandine; Decosterd, Dumeng; Brunner, Marie-Eve; Moret-Bochatay, Mallory; Fumeaux, Thierry; Bendjelid, Karim",Physiol Rep,35,1

For this purpose, three sites of Aghdasieh, Setad-e Bohran and Shahr-e-Rey, which are located in various parts of Tehran considered. Results showed that PM10 had maximum reduction especially for Aghdasieh and Setad-e Bohran stations (20–30%) compared to the 5-year monthly average. Furthermore, the highest reduction in the Shahr-e-Rey station was related to NO2 (−17.99%). The trend of AQI decreased considerably in 2020 compared to its pre-lockdown values. The relative reduction of AQI in March compared to February was about −12.8%, −27.6%, and −2.27% for Shahr-e-Rey, Aghdasieh, and Setad-e Bohran, respectively. The concentration of pollutants was expected to fall after the lockdown, but it was noted that compared to their average during the 5-year period, the concentrations of all pollutants especially O3 increased to some extent. A major reason for this trend is the removal of the traffic control plan and the increasing use of private vehicles in an effort to implement social distancing.","Aghashariatmadari, Zahra",Urban Climate,35,32

Others have argued that democratic governments have generally failed relative to more autocratic ones, simply because autocrats can make the hard choices required for stemming the spread of viruses. We address this question by asking whether more 'egalitarian' forms of democracy matter, given that they contain more equitable health-care access and societal infrastructure, such as social capital and trust. METHODS: We use standard regression techniques, including instrumental variables analysis addressing endogeneity on COVID-19 testing and deaths data as of the end of May and beginning of September. We use novel data from the Varieties of Democracy Project on health-system equity and egalitarian democracy. RESULTS: Our results suggest that more equitable access to health care increases testing rates and lowers the death rate from COVID-19. Broader egalitarian governance, measured as egalitarian democracy, however, shows the opposite effect. Thus, factors associated with health-care capacity to reach and treat matter more than broader societal factors associated with social capital and trust. The results are robust to alternative testing procedures, including instrumental variable technique for addressing potential endogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a great deal of public health focus on how equitable governance helps fight the adverse effects of so-called neoliberal pandemics, we find that broadly egalitarian factors have had the opposite effect on fighting COVID-19, especially when an equitable health system has been taken into account. Fighting disease, thus, might be more about the capacity of health systems rather than societal factors, such as trust in government and social capital.","Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya; Cooray, Arusha; de Soysa, Indra",Scand J Public Health,35,1

Thus, output neurons in M1 sculpt complex spatiotemporal patterns of motor output not only by actively turning on muscles but also by actively turning them off.","Griffin, Darcy M; Strick, Peter L",Sci.

In Brazil, football clubs' youth academies have faced a disruption of their regular activities. In order to study how the learning cultures of a Brazilian professional football club youth academy have been changed, and the alternatives created by the club's staff within this context, this perspective article aims to analyze how they have structured the Under-15 (U15) team learning culture during social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through document and thematic analysis on a Brazilian professional football club's youth academy program, we promoted a dialogue between the process of adaptation to remote theoretical-tactical teaching with the learning theory proposed by Hodkinson and collaborators. The main theme of analysis of this study was the remote structure of the theoretical-tactical learning and physical training. Challenged with the need to transpose face-to-face activities into a learning culture based on remote communication, the U15 team coaching staff created a process to prescribe physical training, and to teach and discuss football tactical issues with young players during the period of social isolation. This perspective article shows that it is possible for sports institutions to create programs for the development of young athletes within the social isolation/distancing context, considering both theoretical-tactical learning and physical training processes. The adaptation to remote environments as structures for the learning culture seems a challenge, but is also a good alternative for young players to develop their interpretation and perception of football theoretical-tactical issues.","Morbi, M.

On 11th March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) a pandemic, severe coronavirus-mediated human disease. Based on genomic and phylogenetic studies, SARS-CoV-2 might originate from bat coronaviruses and infects humans directly or through intermediate zoonotic hosts. However, the exact origin or the host intermediate remains unknown. Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to several existing coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV, but differs by silent and non-silent mutations. The virus uses different transmission routes and targets cells and tissues with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which makes it contagious. COVID-19 shares both the main clinical features and excessive/dysregulated cell responses with the two previous Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) epidemics. In this review, we provide an update of the current knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaining a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 structure, transmission routes, and molecular responses, will assist in the prevention and control of COVID-19 outbreaks in the future.","Tizaoui, Kalthoum; Zidi, Ines; Lee, Keum Hwa; Ghayda, Ramy Abou; Hong, Sung Hwi; Li, Han; Smith, Lee; Koyanagi, Ai; Jacob, Louis; Kronbichler, Andreas; Shin, Jae Il",Int J Biol Sci,35,16

For this propose, some important climate parameters, including daily average temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, in addition to urban parameters such as population density, were considered, and their impacts on confirmed cases of COVID-19 were analyzed. The analysis was performed for three case studies in Italy, and the application of the proposed method has been investigated. The impacts of parameters have been considered with a delay time from one to nine days to find out the most suitable combination. The result of the analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model and the impact of climate parameters on the trend of confirmed cases.

Reconfiguration of services during the pandemic may negatively affect medical and obstetric care. We aimed to examine the impacts on IBD antenatal care and pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective data were recorded in consecutive patients attending for IBD antenatal care including outpatient appointments, infusion unit visits and advice line encounters. RESULTS: We included 244 pregnant women with IBD, of which 75 (30.7%) were on biologics in whom the treatment was stopped in 29.3% at a median 28 weeks gestation. In addition, 9% of patients were on corticosteroids and 21.5% continued on thiopurines. The care provided during 460 patient encounters was not affected by the pandemic in 94.1% but 68.2% were performed via telephone (compared with 3% prepandemic practice; p<0.0001). One-hundred-ten women delivered 111 alive babies (mean 38.2 weeks gestation, mean birth weight 3324 g) with 12 (11.0%) giving birth before week 37. Birth occurred by vaginal delivery in 72 (56.4%) and by caesarean section in 48 (43.6%) cases. Thirty-three were elective (12 for IBD indications) and 15 emergency caesarean sections.

We evaluated the role of chloroquine and its derivatives in COVID-19 in Spanish individuals. METHODS: We performed a survey addressed to patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives for the control of their autoimmune diseases. The survey was distributed with special attention to Spanish patient associations centred on autoimmune diseases and rheumatology and to the general population. A sample of untreated subjects was matched to the treated group according to sex, age range and incidence region. COVID-19 disease prevalence was compared between treated and untreated-matched control sample. RESULTS: A total of 319 surveys of patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives were recovered for further analysis. The prevalence of declared COVID-19 status in the treated group was 5.3% and the mean prevalence among the untreated-matched groups was 3.4%. A community exposition to COVID-19 was associated with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 in both, treated (17.0% vs. 3.2%; p-value<0.001) and untreated groups (13.4% vs. 1.1%; p-value = 0.027). CONCLUSION: We did not find differences of reported COVID-19 cases between treated and untreated groups, indicating a lack of protection by regular administration of chloroquine and its derivative drugs on COVID-19 infection.

In response to the harmful effects of tobacco smoking, the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has emerged and gained significant popularity over the past 15 years. E-cigarettes are promoted as safe alternatives for traditional tobacco smoking and are often suggested as a way to reduce or quit smoking. However, evidence suggests they are not harmless. DISCUSSION: The rapid evolution of the e-cigarette market has outpaced the legislator's regulatory capacity, leading to mixed regulations. The increasing use of e-cigarettes in adolescents and young individuals is of concern. While the long-term direct cardiovascular effects of e-cigarettes remain largely unknown, the existing evidence suggests that the e-cigarette should not be regarded as a cardiovascular safe product. The contribution of e-cigarette use to reducing conventional cigarette use and smoking cessation is complex, and the impact of e-cigarette use on long-term cessation lacks sufficient evidence. CONCLUSION: This position paper describes the evidence regarding the prevalence of e-cigarette smoking, uptake of e-cigarettes in the young, related legislations, cardiovascular effects of e-cigarettes and the impact of e-cigarettes on smoking cessation. Knowledge gaps in the field are also highlighted. The recommendations from the population science and public health section of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology are presented.","Kavousi, Maryam; Pisinger, Charlotta; Barthelemy, Jean-Claude; Smedt, Delphine De; Koskinas, Konstantinos; Marques-Vidal, Pedro; Panagiotakos, Demosthenes; Prescott, Eva Bossano; Tiberi, Monica; Vassiliou, Vassilios S; Løchen, Maja-Lisa",Eur J Prev Cardiol,35,29

By observing the current changes taking place in it, we have a unique opportunity to learn about its potential development directions in the future with great acceleration. Some of the recent changes caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have a chance to affect this market's development in the coming years permanently. The paper's primary purpose is to identify relationships between factors that could significantly impact sustainable e-commerce development in cities, mainly including environmental issues, on the example of the European Union Countries. For this purpose, five groups of factors (criteria), based on literature, were selected: e-commerce drivers (Internet and mobile access, macroeconomic conditions and social aspects in the country), criteria describing the e-commerce market in cities, and criteria that assess the impact of the development of the e-commerce market in cities on the environment were assessed. According to the authors' proposal, the relationships between these groups of factors were verified, taking into account the network model of connections. For this purpose, the multi-criteria decision-making method with the use of the PROMETHEE technique has been applied. The research results presented in the paper confirmed that the relations between the analyzed groups of criteria are complex. In most countries, high positions in the rankings containing criteria describing the so-called drivers of the e-commerce market also translate into high places in the order describing this market's development. At the same time, those countries where the e-commerce activity in cities is high present lower environmental conditions.","Cheba, Katarzyna Kiba-Janiak Maja Baraniecka Anna Kołakowski Tomasz",Sustainable Cities and Society,35,20

As an emblematic example, preliminary data and early anecdotal experience suggested that a major driver of COVID-19 pathophysiology was hypercoagulability, suggesting the need for aggressive anticoagulation. In this article, we describe the rapid guidance process for the development of an anticoagulation protocol for COVID-19. Preliminary evidence was collected from multidisciplinary experts within our institution to inform the first protocol draft. After implementation, we rapidly acquired data to inform a revision, with subsequent modifications based on higher quality data. The description of this process can inform other health systems when faced with a similar crisis characterized by high patient volumes, poor clinical outcomes, lack of proven effective therapies, and rapid flow of information from multiple sources of variable credibility.","Tremblay, Douglas; Dunn, Andrew S; Oh, William K",Qual. manage. health care,35,5

The situation is considerably worse among millions of older (Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals or FDMNs) Rohingya adults, and the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate the already existing precarious situation. The present study investigated depressive symptoms and their associated factors in older adult Rohingya FDMNs in Cox Bazar, Bangladesh, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A total of 416 older adults aged 60 years and above residing in Rohingya camps situated in the South Eastern part of Bangladesh were interviewed using a 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) in Bengali language. Chi-square test was performed to compare the prevalence of depressive symptoms within different categories of a variable and a binary logistic regression model was performed to determine the factors associated with depressive symptoms. Results More than 41% of Rohingya older adults had depressive symptoms (DS). Socio-demographic and economic factors such as living alone, dependency on family for living, poor memory, feelings of being left out, difficulty in getting medicine and routine medical care during COVID-19, perception that older adults are at highest risk of COVID-19 and pre-existing non-communicable chronic conditions were found to be significantly associated with developing DS. Higher DS was also evident among older female Rohingya FDMNs. Conclusion DS are highly prevalent in older Rohingya FDMNs during COVID-19. The findings of the present study call for immediate arrangement of mental health care services and highlight policy implications to ensure the well-being of older FDMNs.","Mistry, S. K.; Ali, A. R.

Preliminary reports suggest that the disease may present in diverse ways, including with neurological symptoms, but few published reports in the literature describe seizures in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to characterize the risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes of seizures in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series. Cases were identified through a review of admissions and consultations to the neurology and neurocritical care services between April 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020. SETTING: The study setting was in a tertiary care, safety-net hospital in Boston, MA. PARTICIPANTS: Patients presenting with seizures and COVID-19 during the study period were included in the study. RESULTS: Seven patients met inclusion criteria (5 females, 71%). Patients ranged in age from 37 to 88â¯years (median: 75â¯years). Three patients had a prior history of well-controlled epilepsy (43%), while 4 patients had new-onset seizures, including 2 patients with prior history of remote stroke. Three patients had no preceding symptoms of COVID-19 prior to presentation (57%), and in all cases, seizures were the symptom that prompted presentation to the emergency department, regardless of prior symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Provoking factors for seizures in patients with COVID-19 may include metabolic factors, systemic illness, and possibly direct effects of the virus. In endemic areas with community spread of COVID-19, clinicians should be vigilant for the infection in patients who present with seizures, which may precede respiratory symptoms or prompt presentation to medical care. Early testing, isolation, and contact tracking of these patients can prevent further transmission of the virus.","Anand, Pria; Al-Faraj, Abrar; Sader, Elie; Dashkoff, Jonathan; Abdennadher, Myriam; Murugesan, Rubachandran; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna M; Daneshmand, Ali",Epilepsy Behav,35,10

This time, perhaps, sustained change is within reach. As organizations advance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, an often overlooked focus of is the health status of employees and their families, where equitable access to high-value health benefits offerings should be available to all. This commentary provides guidance for employers to expand their DEI initiatives to include employee and family health and well-being as a central outcome measure. Employers should ensure that DEI efforts incorporate equitable benefits design, and objectively assess benefit design impact on healthcare utilization and cost. Additionally, employers must appreciate the workplace as a significant determinant of health-for lower income workers, in particular-with review of policies and practices to mitigate any discriminatory negative health or well-being impact. Further, race and ethnicity data should be incorporated in health benefits data analysis to understand more clearly the differential outcomes of health management offerings on these different sub-populations. Finally, social needs data should be incorporated into strategic benefits planning to better understand gaps and opportunities to foster greater benefits equity. The provided recommendations can support employer goals of achieving greater equity and value in workforce health, measurably contributing to business success.","Sherman, Bruce W; Kelly, Rebecca K; Payne-Foster, Pamela",Am J Health Promot,35,1

We hypothesized a major global impact of COVID-19 not only on stroke volumes but also on various aspects of thrombectomy systems. AIMS: We conducted a convenience electronic survey with a 21-item questionnaire aimed to identify the changes in stroke admission volumes and thrombectomy treatment practices seen during a specified time period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The survey was designed using Qualtrics software and sent to stroke and neuro-interventional physicians around the world who are part of the Global Executive Committee (GEC) of Mission Thrombectomy 2020, a global coalition under the aegis of Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology, between April 5th and May 15th, 2020. RESULTS: There were 113 responses to the survey across 25 countries with a response rate of 31% among the GEC members. Globally there was a median 33% decrease in stroke admissions and a 25% decrease in mechanical thrombectomy (MT) procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic period until May 15th, 2020 compared to pre-pandemic months. The intubation policy for MT procedures during the pandemic was highly variable across participating centers: 44% preferred intubating all patients, including 25% of centers that changed their policy to preferred-intubation (PI) from preferred non-intubation (PNI). On the other hand, 56% centers preferred not intubating patients undergoing MT, which included 27% centers that changed their policy from PI to PNI. There was no significant difference in rate of COVID-19 infection between PI versus PNI centers (p=0.60) or if intubation policy was changed in either direction (p=1.00). Low-volume (<10 stroke/month) compared with high-volume stroke centers (>20 strokes/month) were less likely to have neurointerventional suite specific written personal protective equipment protocols (74% vs 88%) and if present, these centers were more likely to report them to be inadequate (58% vs 92%). CONCLUSION: Our data provides a comprehensive snapshot of the impact on acute stroke care observed worldwide during the pandemic. Overall, respondents reported decreased stroke admissions as well as decreased cases of MT with no clear preponderance in intubation policy during MT.

Here, we show that two indole-chloropyridinyl-ester derivatives, GRL-0820 and GRL-0920, exerted potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell-based assays performed using VeroE6 cells and TMPRSS2-overexpressing VeroE6 cells. While GRL-0820 and the nucleotide analog remdesivir blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral breakthrough occurred. No significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was found for several compounds reportedly active against SARS-CoV-2 such as lopinavir, nelfinavir, nitazoxanide, favipiravir, and hydroxychroloquine. In contrast, GRL-0920 exerted potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 (50% effective concentration [EC50] = 2.8 µM) and dramatically reduced the infectivity, replication, and cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 without significant toxicity as examined with immunocytochemistry. Structural modeling shows that indole and chloropyridinyl of the derivatives interact with two catalytic dyad residues of Mpro, Cys145 and His41, resulting in covalent bonding, which was verified using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS), suggesting that the indole moiety is critical for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of the derivatives.

Symptoms and visual acuity improved 4 weeks. In conclusion, ABT-414 therapy may cause transient ocular surface toxicity. The initiation of artificial tears and lubricant ointment was enough to control the ocular surface signs and symptoms. A multidisciplinary approach, complete ophthalmologic monitorization, and elaboration of protocols are required to adequately manage these patients.","Rocha-de-Lossada, Carlos; Linero, Carmen Alba; Ortega, Álvaro Santos; Calvo-de-Mora, Marina Rodríguez; Rachwani, Rahul; Borroni, Davide; Alba, Emilio; Orgaz, Manuel Benavides; Romano, Vito",Arq. bras. oftalmol,35,16

The goal of this study was to evaluate findings from a community needs assessment with street-based sex workers on impact of COVID-19 on health behaviors and social circumstances. A brief survey was developed at a community-based harm reduction and recovery services organization. Surveys were administered by peer specialists to street-based sex workers during street outreach in April and May 2020. A total of 46 surveys were analyzed. Many individuals reported continuing to do sex work and use substances during the COVID pandemic. Slightly more than a quarter of individuals (n = 13; 28.3%) indicated using personal protective equipment while doing sex work and described challenges to using precautions when working with clients. Individuals had used marijuana (n = 32, 71.1%), cocaine (n = 17, 39.5%), prescription stimulants (n = 9, 21.4%), methamphetamines (n = 5, 11.9%), prescription opioids (n = 12, 27.3%), street opioids (n = 12, 27.3%), sedatives (n = 11, 25.0%), hallucinogens (n = 3, 6.8%), inhalants (n = 3, 7.0%), or some other substance (n = 4, 8.7%) in the past 30 days. About half (48.8%) reported that COVID-19 had a major impact on their lives. This study is among the first to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on street-based sex workers. From a public health standpoint, this group also represents a high-priority population given their vulnerability and close contact with others, which increases the potential for community spread.","Rogers, Brooke G; Paradis-Burnett, Annaka; Nagel, Katherine; Yolken, Annajane; Strong, Sabrina H; Arnold, Trisha; Napoleon, Siena C; Maynard, Michaela; Sosnowy, Collette; Murphy, Matthew; Daley Ndoye, Colleen; Holcomb, Richard; Schierberl Scherr, Anna; Pinkston, Megan; Chan, Philip A",Arch. sex. behav,35,16

The goal of this study (NCT04746092) was to determine the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL. We evaluated humoral immune responses to BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL and compared responses with those obtained in age-matched healthy controls. Patients received two vaccine doses, 21 days apart, and antibody titers were measured using Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2S assay after administration of the second dose. In a total of 167 patients with CLL the antibody response rate was 39.5%. A comparison between 52 patients with CLL and 52 sex- and aged-matched healthy controls, revealed a significantly reduced response rate among patients (52% vs 100%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio=0.010, 95% CI 0.001-0.162; p<0.001). Response rate was highest in patients who obtained clinical remission after treatment (79.2%), followed by 55.2% in treatment-naïve and 16% only in patients under treatment at the time of vaccination. In patients treated with either BTK inhibitors or venetoclax ± anti-CD20 antibody, response rates were considerably low (16.0% and 13.6%, respectively). None of the patients exposed to anti-CD20 antibodies <12 months prior to vaccination responded. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of response were younger age, females, lack of currently active treatment, IgG levels &#8805;550 mg/dL and IgM levels &#8805;40mg/dL. In conclusion, antibody-mediated response to BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with CLL is markedly impaired and affected by disease activity and treatment.","Herishanu, Yair; Avivi, Irit; Aharon, Anat; Shefer, Gabi; Levi, Shai; Bronstein, Yotam; Morales Moshiashvili, Miguel; Ziv-Baran, Tomer; Shorer, Yamit; Scarfo, Lydia; Joffe, Erel; Perry, Chava; Ghia, Paolo",Blood,35,33

We assessed the effect of structured pre-visit preparatory telephone calls on success of telehealth visits and examined risk factors for unsuccessful visits. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out of 45,803 adult patients scheduled for a total of 64,447 telehealth appointments between March and July 2020 at an academic medical center. A subset of patients received a structured pre-visit phone call. Demographic factors and inclusion of a pre-visit call were analysed by logistic regression. Primary outcomes were non-completion of any visit and completion of phone-only versus audio-visual telehealth visits. RESULTS: A pre-visit telephone call to a subset of patients significantly increased the likelihood of a successful telehealth visit (OR 0.54; 95% CI: 0.48-0.60). Patients aged 18-30 years, those with non-commercial insurance or those of Black race were more likely to have incomplete visits. Compared to age 18-30, increasing age increased likelihood of a failed video visit: 31-50 years (OR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.13-1.51), 51-70 years (OR 2.98; 2.60-3.42) and >70 years (OR 4.16; 3.58-4.82). Those with non-commercial insurance and those of Black race (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.67-1.92) were more likely to have a failed video visit. DISCUSSION: A structured pre-call to patients improved the likelihood of a successful video visit during widespread adoption of telehealth. Structured pre-calls to patients may be an important tool to help reduce gaps in utilization among groups.","Gusdorf, Roman E; Shah, Kaustav P; Triana, Austin J; McCoy, Allison B; Pabla, Baldeep; Scoville, Elizabeth; Dalal, Robin; Beaulieu, Dawn B; Schwartz, David A; Horst, Sara N; Griffith, Michelle L",J Telemed Telecare,35,6

Determining which patients are at high risk of severe illness or mortality is essential for appropriate clinical decision making. We propose a novel severity score specifically for COVID-19 to help predict disease severity and mortality. 4711 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. We derived a risk model using the first half of the cohort (n = 2355 patients) by logistic regression and bootstrapping methods. The discriminative power of the risk model was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). The severity score was validated in a second half of 2356 patients. Mortality incidence was 26.4% in the derivation cohort and 22.4% in the validation cohort. A COVID-19 severity score ranging from 0 to 10, consisting of age, oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, blood urea nitrogen, C-Reactive protein, and the international normalized ratio was developed. A ROC curve analysis was performed in the derivation cohort achieved an AUC of 0.824 (95% CI 0.814-0.851) and an AUC of 0.798 (95% CI 0.789-0.818) in the validation cohort. Furthermore, based on the risk categorization the probability of mortality was 11.8%, 39% and 78% for patient with low (0-3), moderate (4-6) and high (7-10) COVID-19 severity score. This developed and validated novel COVID-19 severity score will aid physicians in predicting mortality during surge periods.","Altschul, David J; Unda, Santiago R; Benton, Joshua; de la Garza Ramos, Rafael; Cezayirli, Phillip; Mehler, Mark; Eskandar, Emad N",Sci Rep,35,24

This variety of agents is currently the cause of severe respiratory diseases (SARS-CoV2 and Influenza), Hepatitis C, measles and of high prevalence tropical diseases that are detected throughout the year (Dengue and Zika). The rs10774671 polymorphism is a base change from G to A in the last nucleotide of intron-5 of the OAS1 gene. This change modifies a splicing site and generates isoforms of the OAS1 protein with a higher molecular weight and a demonstrated lower enzymatic activity. The low activity of these OAS1 isoforms makes the innate immune response against RNA virus infections less efficient, representing a previously unattended risk factor for certain populations. OBJECTIVE: Determine the distribution of rs10774671 in the open population of Mexico. METHODS: In 98 healthy volunteers, allelic and genotypic frequencies were determined by qPCR using allele specific labeled probes, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was determined. RESULTS: The A-allele turned out to be the most prevalent in the analyzed population. CONCLUSIONS: Our population is genetically susceptible to RNA virus disease due to the predominant presence of the A allele of rs10774671 in the OAS1 gene.","Sanchez-Gonzalez, M.

The fact that the COVID-19 cases and mortalities are reported globally and the WHO has declared this outbreak as the pandemic, the international health authorities have focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as search for therapies able to counter the disease severity. Due to the lack of known specific, effective and proven therapies as well as the situation of public-health emergency, drug repurposing appears to be the best armour to find a therapeutic solution against 2019-nCoV infection. Repurposing anti-malarial drugs and chloroquine (CQ)/ hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have shown efficacy to inhibit most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus.

Each session lasted approximately 30 min and was provided once a week over five weeks between October 13, 2020 and November 18, 2020. For data analysis, we used SPSS 25.0. The analysis results indicated that there were no significant differences between the experimental and the control groups in terms of depression (t = 1.641, p =. 109) and attitude toward the robot (t = 1.176, p =. 247), but the experimental group exhibited more positive changes. There was no significant difference in mood state before and after program participation in the experimental group. However, the mood score increased after the program (t = 2.624, p =. 079), and in the case of content usage, singing was the most commonly used feature. In a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the untact silver-care-robot program is expected to be introduced and utilized as one of the efficient care approaches for the elderly in the future. © ICROS 2021.","Oh, J.

A state of uncertainty related to what has become known as SARS-CoV-2 has since fueled conspiracy narratives on social media about the origin, transmission and medical treatment of and vaccination against the resulting disease, COVID-19. Using social media intelligence to monitor and understand the proliferation of conspiracy narratives is one way to analyze the distribution of misinformation on the pandemic. We analyzed more than 9.5M German language tweets about COVID-19. The results show that only about 0.6% of all those tweets deal with conspiracy theory narratives. We also found that the political orientation of users correlates with the volume of content users contribute to the dissemination of conspiracy narratives, implying that partisan communicators have a higher motivation to take part in conspiratorial discussions on Twitter. Finally, we showed that contrary to other studies, automated accounts do not significantly influence the spread of misinformation in the German speaking Twitter sphere. They only represent about 1.31% of all conspiracy-related activities in our database. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Shahrezaye, M.; Meckel, M.; Steinacker, L.; Suter, V.","Future of Information and Communication Conference, FICC 2021",35,16

He has no other health conditions of note. Brian lives with his parents and an older brother, who also has ASD, in a rural area 2 hours from the center where he was diagnosed. Brian has a history of intermittent self-injurious behaviors (head-banging, throwing himself onto the floor, etc.) that regularly result in bruising, intense and lengthy tantrums, and aggression toward family and teachers. Brian will occasionally indicate items that he wants, but otherwise has no functional communication skills. Over the past 18 months, Brian's challenging behaviors have waxed and waned. The regional special education program is not equipped to safely manage his behaviors, and there are no in-home or center-based agencies that provide applied behavior analysis (ABA) available. Brian's developmental pediatrician initiated guanfacine (eventually adding a small dose of aripiprazole) and referred the family to psychology for weekly telehealth behavioral parent training to address behavioral concerns using the Research Units in Behavioral Intervention curriculum.Brian's behavioral problems decreased during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 crisis, when he no longer had to leave home or attend special education. However, as summer continued, his behaviors worsened substantially (regular bruising and tissue damage, numerous after-hours consultations with his psychologist and developmental pediatrician, and one trip to the emergency department). The intensity of Brian's behaviors (maintained primarily by access to tangible items and escape from demands) made progress with behavioral supports slow and discouraging for his parents. Other psychosocial stressors coalesced for the family as well, including employment loss, limited social support because of social distancing requirements, and illness of one of his parents. The developmental pediatrician continued to modify the medication regimen over the summer, transitioning Brian from guanfacine to clonidine and increasing his aripiprazole incrementally (with clear increased benefit); hydroxyzine was also used as needed during the episodes of highest intensity.Despite the availability of best-practice guidelines for children with Brian's presenting concerns, a confluence of barriers (geographic, economic, ABA work force, global pandemic, etc.) present serious questions for his family and care team related to the next steps in Brian's care. Should he attend in-person school in the fall, knowing that the available program may have limited educational benefit and increase his risk of COVID-19 exposure (not to mention self-injury)? Would the potential benefits of cross-country travel to an intensive behavioral treatment program outweigh the associated psychosocial and economic stressors? How else can the virtual care team support this family?","Nadler, Cy; Godwin, Dinah L; Dempsey, Jack; Nyp, Sarah S",J. dev. behav. pediatr,35,16

Participants were 468,569 men and women (56.5 ± 8.1, 54.6% women) residing in the United Kingdom. Lifestyle indexes included traditional and emerging lifestyle risk factors based on health guidelines and best practice recommendations for: physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep quality, diet quality, alcohol consumption, and smoking status. The main outcome was mortality from infectious diseases, including pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations among combinations of lifestyle risk factors was inversely associated with mortality. Hazard ratios ranged between 0.26 (0.23-0.30) to 0.69 (0.60-0.79) for infectious disease and pneumonia. Among participants with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or cancer, hazard ratios ranged between 0.30 (0.25-0.34) to 0.73 (0.60-0.89). COVID-19 mortality risk ranged between 0.42 (0.28-0.63) to 0.75 (0.49-1.13). We found a beneficial dose-response association with a higher lifestyle index against mortality that was consistent across sex, age, BMI, and socioeconomic status. There was limited evidence of synergistic interactions between most lifestyle behaviour pairs, suggesting that the dose-response relationship among different lifestyle behaviours is not greater than the sum of the risk induced by each behaviour. Improvements in lifestyle risk factors and meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations could be used as an ancillary measure to ameliorate infectious disease mortality.","Ahmadi, Matthew N; Huang, Bo-Huei; Inan-Eroglu, Elif; Hamer, Mark; Stamatakis, Emmanuel",Brain behav. immun,35,2

This article discusses the legality and constitutionality of such a policy. First, it analyzes the laws, regulations, and Supreme Court decisions that provide for the possibility of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. Subsequently, it analyzes the constitutionality of a mandatory vaccination policy through the proportionality method to address the conflict between, on one side, the right to individual autonomy, which includes the right to refuse a medical intervention, and, on the other, health policies that interfere with individual autonomy to protect the rights to life and health. The application of this method allows for the identification of key questions that need to be answered to determine the constitutionality of a mandatory vaccination program. These questions cannot be answered a priori and in the abstract because they depend on the concrete circumstances of the pandemic, on the characteristics of the vaccine(s) against COVID-19, and on how a mandatory vaccination policy might be designed and implemented by authorities.","Wang, D.

During this period, even access to emergency dental care has been limited. A review of the current guidance issued by international organisations and professional bodies regarding the re-opening of dental services showed considerable variation in the safety procedures required. Most sources recommended triage of patients and an emphasis on only emergency and urgent care; wearing filtering facepiece class 2 masks; reducing the risk of transmission; and avoiding AGP.

Implementation of lockdown and limited outdoor activities resulted in changes in routines of children with diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of lockdown on glycemic control, weight and body mass index (BMI) patterns of children with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) from different socio-economic (SE) classes. Methods This observational study included 77 children and youth (5-20 years) with T1DM having disease duration of &#8805;6 months. Demographic data and investigations were recorded at two time points (post lockdown when the children came for follow up, pre lockdown data from medical records). Results Glycemic control improved (pre lockdown HbA1C 79.4±19.2 vs. post lockdown Hba1C 74.5±16.9 mmol/mol, p<0.05) and there was weight gain post lockdown (pre lockdown weight z-score -0.4±0.8 vs. post lockdown weight z-score -0.2±0.8, p<0.05) without any significant change in BMI and insulin requirements. Improved glycemic was seen in the lower SE group control post lockdown (p<0.05), whereas in higher SE group, it remained unchanged. Children whose parents were at home during lockdown showed an improved glycemic control (p<0.05) as compared to children whose parents continued to work during lockdown (p>0.01) Conclusions During coronavirus lockdown, glycemic control was adequately maintained in children with T1DM, highlighting importance of stronger family support system leading to more steady daily routine.","Shah, Nikhil; Karguppikar, Madhura; Bhor, Shital; Ladkat, Dipali; Khadilkar, Vaman; Khadilkar, Anuradha",,35,24

COVID-19 is a complex multisystem inflammatory vasculopathy with a significant mortality implication for those admitted to intensive care. Institutional strategic preparation and meticulous intensive care support are essential to maximising outcomes during the pandemic. The significant mortality variation observed between institutions and internationally, despite a single aetiology and uniform presentation, highlights the potential influence of management strategies on outcome. Given that optimal organ support and adjunctive therapies for COVID-19 have not yet been well defined by trial-based outcomes, strategies are predicated on existing literature and experiential learning.

The effect of COVID-19 on liver injury has not been fully presented. AIMS: To evaluate the dynamic changes in liver function and the relationship between liver function damage and prognosis in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical data of 675 patients with COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 3 to March 8, 2020. Patients were classified as normal, abnormal liver function and liver injury. RESULTS: Of 675 patients, 253 (37.5%) had abnormal liver function during hospitalisation, and 52 (7.7%) had liver injury. The dynamic changes of ALT and AST levels were more significant in patients with liver injury and in those who died. AST >3-fold ULN had the highest risk of death and mechanical ventilation. Compared to patients with normal AST levels, mortality and risk of mechanical ventilation significantly increased 19.27-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.89-75.97; P < 0.0001) and 116.72-fold (95% CI, 31.58-431.46; P < 0.0001), respectively, in patients with AST above 3-fold ULN. Increased leucocytes, decreased lymphocytes and female sex were independently associated with liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic changes in liver function may have a significant correlation with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Increased index of liver injury was closely related to mortality and need for mechanical ventilation. Therefore, these indicators should be closely monitored during hospitalisation.","Huang, Haijun; Chen, Shanshan; Li, Hong; Zhou, Xian-Long; Dai, Yining; Wu, Jia; Zhang, Jun; Shao, Lina; Yan, Rong; Wang, Mingshan; Wang, Jiafeng; Tu, Yuexing; Ge, Minghua",Aliment. pharmacol. ther,35,24

RESULTS: In all 20 surgeons wearing FFP2 covered by surgical masks, a reduction in arterial O2 saturation from around 97.5% before surgery to 94% after surgery was recorded with increase of heart rates. A shortness of breath and light-headedness/headaches were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, wearing an FFP2 covered by a surgical mask induces a reduction in circulating O2 concentrations without clinical relevance, while an increase of heart frequency and a sensation of shortness of breath, light-headedness/headaches were recorded.","Scarano, Antonio; Inchingolo, Francesco; Rapone, Biagio; Festa, Felice; Tari, Sergio Rexhep; Lorusso, Felice",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),35,1

Multiple approaches have been applied to relieve pressure on and support existing healthcare. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MOH) launched an initiative to support the national healthcare system. Since 5 June 2020, 238 outpatient fever clinics have been established nationwide. This study aimed to assess the safety outcome and reported adverse events from hydroxychloroquine use among suspected COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The cross-sectional study included 2733 patients subjected to the MOH treatment protocol (hydroxychloroquine) and followed up for 3-7 days after initiation. Data were collected through an electronic link and cross-checked with the national database (Health Electronic Surveillance Network) and reports from the MOH Morbidity and Mortality Committee. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty patients (8.8%) discontinued treatment because of side effects (4.1%) and non-clinical reasons (4.7%). Adverse effects were reported among 6.7% of all participants, including mainly cardiovascular symptoms (2.5%; 0.15% with corrected QT prolongation) and gastrointestinal symptoms (2.4%). No intensive care unit admission or death was reported among these patients. CONCLUSION: Our results show that hydroxychloroquine use for COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms in an outpatient setting with the recommended protocol and inclusion/exclusion criteria is safe, is highly tolerable and has minimal side effects.","Mohana, Abdulrhman; Sulaiman, Tarek; Mahmoud, Nagla; Hassanein, Mustafa; Alfaifi, Amel; Alenazi, Eissa; Radwan, Nashwa; AlKhalifah, Nasser; Elkady, Ehab; Almohaizeie, Abdullah; AboGazalah, Fouad; AlabdulKareem, Khaled; AlGhofaili, Fahad; Jokhdar, Hani; Alrabiah, Fahad",Int J Infect Dis,35,16

Design: Descriptive cross-sectional study. Setting: Online survey conducted between April 9 and April 30, 2020, during the COVD-19 pandemic. Participants: About 1,046 older adults over the age of 50 who live in North America. Measurements: Participants were asked about their basic demographic information, current health status, and the impact of the current SDG on their subjective state of mental health. Participants completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, to determine the amount and intensity of physical activity performed, as well as both the Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Scale, to ascertain the extent of their depression and anxiety-like symptoms. Results: Ninety-seven percent of participants indicated that they adhered to current SDG ""Most of the time"" or ""Strictly."" Participants who performed greater levels of physical activity experienced lower levels of depression-like symptoms when age, sex, and education were accounted for;however, no relationship between physical activity and anxiety-like symptoms was found. A hierarchical regression analysis that incorporated the intensity of physical activity performed (light, moderate, and vigorous) in the model indicated that greater light and strenuous activity, but not moderate, predicted lower depression-like symptoms. Conclusions: These results suggest that performing even light physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may help alleviate some of the negative mental health impacts that older adults may be experiencing while isolated and adhering to SDG during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Peer support through debriefing has demonstrated positive impacts on clinicians' well-being following critical incidents. This study explored community hospital emergency department staff's perceptions of critical incidents, assessed openness to debriefing and measured baseline well-being. Our analysis provides a baseline of provider well-being immediately prior to the local onset of COVID-19. The potential need for additional resources to support frontline providers during the pandemic can be evaluated. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study for 4-weeks prior to the first COVID-19 case in Connecticut using a survey offered to an interprofessional group of emergency department clinical staff. The main outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale. Pearson's chi-square test was used to identify significant differences in perceptions of critical incidents and debriefings between professional categories. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's test were used to analyze significant differences in well-being between professional categories. RESULTS: Thirty-nine clinical personnel from St. Vincent's Emergency Department responded to the survey. Events frequently selected as critical incidents were caring for critically ill children (89.7%), mass casualty events (84.6%), and death of a patient (69.2%). Critical incidents were commonly reported (81.6%) as occurring once per week. Additionally, 76.2% of participants reported wanting to discuss a critical incident with their team. Across all respondents, 45.7% scored borderline or abnormal for anxiety, 55.9% scored moderate for burnout, and 55.8% scored moderate to high for secondary traumatic stress. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline, providers reported caring for critically ill children, mass casualty events, and death of a patient as critical incidents, which typically occurred once per week. Death of a patient occurs at increased frequency during the protracted mass casualty experience of COVID-19 and threatens provider well-being. Receptiveness to post-event debriefing is high but the method is still underutilized. With nearly half of staff scoring borderline or abnormal for anxiety, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress at baseline, peer support measures should be implemented to protect frontline providers' well-being during and after the pandemic.","Cantu, Laura; Thomas, Listy",BMC Emerg Med,35,16

This trust, however, is often broken by vulnerabilities, ransomware, and abuse from malignant actors. But what is trust? In this paper we explore, through twelve in-depth interviews with software engineers, how they perceive trust in their daily work. From the interviews we conclude three things. First, software engineers make a distinction between an adoption factor and a trust factor when selecting a package. Secondly, while in literature mostly technical factors are considered as the main trust factors, the software engineers in this study conclude that organizational factors are more important. Finally, we find that different kinds of software engineers require different views on trust, and that it is impossible to create one unified perception of trust.

The development of these and other psychiatric disorders may be related to changes in immune, endocrine, autonomic, cognitive, and affective processes induced by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, many of these same changes can be triggered by psychosocial stressors such as social isolation and rejection, which have become increasingly common due to public policies aimed at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The present review aims to shed light on these issues by describing how viral infections and stress affect mental health. First, we describe the multi-level mechanisms linking viral infection and life stress exposure with risk for psychopathology. Then, we summarize how resilience can be enhanced by targeting vagus nerve function by, for example, applying transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation and targeting lifestyle factors, such as exercise. With these biopsychosocial insights in mind, researchers and healthcare professionals will be better equipped to reduce risk for psychopathology and increase resilience during this challenging pandemic period and beyond.","Dedoncker, Josefien; Vanderhasselt, Marie-Anne; Ottaviani, Cristina; Slavich, George M",Neurosci Biobehav Rev,35,16

Across the three successive samples, views for all videos increased from ~ 125 million to over 560 million views, and from ~ 63 million to more than 273 million for those videos specifically mentioning disease transmission, respectively. This increase coincided with the increase in the worldwide number of cases and the occurrence of COVID-19 transmission informational milestones. Despite its importance for community mitigation, the majority of the widely viewed videos we sampled did not specifically mention disease transmission.

Italy is the hardest hit country after China. Considering the deleterious consequences of malnutrition, which certainly can affect patients with COVID-19, the aim of this article is to present a pragmatic protocol for early nutritional supplementation of non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease. It is based on the observation that most patients present at admission with severe inflammation and anorexia leading to a drastic reduction of food intake, and that a substantial percentage develops respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation or even continuous positive airway pressure. METHODS: High-calorie dense diets in a variety of different consistencies with highly digestible foods and snacks are available for all patients. Oral supplementation of whey proteins as well as intravenous infusion of multivitamin, multimineral trace elements solutions are implemented at admission. In the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficit, cholecalciferol is promptly supplied. If nutritional risk is detected, two to three bottles of protein-calorie oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are provided. If <2 bottles/d of ONS are consumed for 2 consecutive days and/or respiratory conditions are worsening, supplemental/total parenteral nutrition is prescribed. CONCLUSION: We are aware that our straight approach may be debatable. However, to cope with the current emergency crisis, its aim is to promptly and pragmatically implement nutritional care in patients with COVID-19, which might be overlooked despite being potentially beneficial to clinical outcomes and effective in preventing the consequences of malnutrition in this patient population.","Caccialanza, Riccardo; Laviano, Alessandro; Lobascio, Federica; Montagna, Elisabetta; Bruno, Raffaele; Ludovisi, Serena; Corsico, Angelo Guido; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Belliato, Mirko; Calvi, Monica; Iacona, Isabella; Grugnetti, Giuseppina; Bonadeo, Elisa; Muzzi, Alba; Cereda, Emanuele",Nutrition,35,23

These outbreaks often led to respiratory tract diseases and have proved to be fatal sometimes. Currently, we are facing an elusive health crisis with the emergence of COVID-19 disease of the coronavirus family. One of the modes of transmission of COVID- 19 is airborne transmission. This transmission occurs as humans breathe in the droplets released by an infected person through breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, or sneezing. Hence, public health officials have mandated the use of face masks which can reduce disease transmission by 65%. For face recognition programs, commonly used for security verification purposes, the use of face mask presents an arduous challenge since these programs were typically trained with human faces devoid of masks but now due to the onset of Covid-19 pandemic, they are forced to identify faces with masks. Hence, this paper investigates the same problem by developing a deep learning based model capable of accurately identifying people with face-masks. In this paper, the authors train a ResNet-50 based architecture that performs well at recognizing masked faces. The outcome of this study could be seamlessly integrated into existing face recognition programs that are designed to detect faces for security verification purposes.","Mandal, Bishwas; Okeukwu, Adaeze; Theis, Yihong",,35,32

In infected cells, the CoV RNA-synthesizing machinery associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are transformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). Although double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) appear to be a pan-CoV RO element, studies to date describe an assortment of additional CoV-induced membrane structures. Despite much speculation, it remains unclear which RO element(s) accommodate viral RNA synthesis. Here we provide detailed 2D and 3D analyses of CoV ROs and show that diverse CoVs essentially induce the same membrane modifications, including the small open double-membrane spherules (DMSs) previously thought to be restricted to gamma- and delta-CoV infections and proposed as sites of replication. Metabolic labeling of newly synthesized viral RNA followed by quantitative electron microscopy (EM) autoradiography revealed abundant viral RNA synthesis associated with DMVs in cells infected with the beta-CoVs Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV and the gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis virus. RNA synthesis could not be linked to DMSs or any other cellular or virus-induced structure. Our results provide a unifying model of the CoV RO and clearly establish DMVs as the central hub for viral RNA synthesis and a potential drug target in CoV infection.","Snijder, Eric J; Limpens, Ronald W A L; de Wilde, Adriaan H; de Jong, Anja W M; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; Maier, Helena J; Faas, Frank F G A; Koster, Abraham J; Bárcena, Montserrat",PLoS Biol,35,20

Despite these recommendations, the individual decision to adhere and wear a mask may not be a simple decision. In this article, we examine the decision to wear a mask from a social-ecological perspective. Through critical analysis of societal, interpersonal and community, and intrapersonal influences, it is clear that the decision to wear a mask is multifaceted and influenced by constructs including public health recommendations and government mandates, racism and cultural norms, geography, household income, age, and personal attitudes. Understanding the multifactorial influences on mask wearing during COVID-19 is crucial for informing the creation and distribution of inclusive public health messaging regarding mask wearing now in the midst of an unprecedented health crisis, and in future unforeseen public health emergencies.","Casola, Allison R; Kunes, Brianna; Cunningham, Amy; Motley, Robert J",Health Promot Pract,35,25

Following the start of global Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and as per the statement released by the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (ASGBI), we also modified our services to hybrid SHC (HSHC) by mainly providing telephonic follow-up with an occasional face-to-face (F2F) service. We conducted a service evaluation to assess the effectiveness and serviceability of HSHC during a pandemic. METHODS: This service evaluation was conducted from 30th March till 26th May 2020. The pathway was developed to mostly telephonic consultation with selective face-to-face consultation at a designated area in the medical ambulatory unit. The analysis then performed using SPSS version 21. RESULTS: As the overall attendance fell in hospital, 149 patients, including 54(36.2%) male, and 95(63.8%) females, attended SHC during COVID-19 lockdown. Out of these 149, 87(58.3%) were referred from Accident & Emergency (A&E), 2(1.3%) from GP, 9(6.04%) after scan through radiology department, while 51(34.2%) after discharge from hospital. Out of those who have telephonic consultation (n = 98), 12 patients were called in for review with either blood tests or further clinical examination. In total, only 10 out of 149 patients required admission to the hospital, for either intervention or symptomatic treatment.

The goal of this study is to evaluate fear of relapse, social support, and psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress level) of Iranian patients with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic stage. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled. We asked all cases to fill valid and reliable Persian version of depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21), perceived social support, and fear of relapse scale questionnaires. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled. Female to male ratio was (F/M) = 4.6. Mean age and mean duration of disease were 35.3±8.6 and 7.1±5 years, respectively. Mean scores of social support, DASS, and FoR questionnaires were 63.1±16.8, 16.4±13.4, and 51.4±17.3, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between social support and FoR scores and also significant positive correlations between components of DASS and FoR. Linear regression analysis by considering FoR as dependent variable and age, sex, marital status, duration of the disease, and EDSS as dependent variables showed that sex was an independent predictor of FoR score.

We analyzed data from the 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018 National Financial Capability Surveys and found that subjective financial knowledge, financial confidence, and savings account ownership, but not objective financial knowledge, were significant and consistent predictors of having an emergency fund. Savings account ownership was the strongest predictor, accounting for an increase in the probability of having an emergency fund of 25% to 29% across study years. Adding homeownership and ability to cover expenses to the models increased the proportion of variance explained by an average of 29%.

We performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across 145 HLA-A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explored the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome was successfully sampled and was represented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (M. Lin, H.-T. Tseng, J. A. Trejaut, H.-L. Lee, et al., BMC Med Genet 4:9, 2003, https://bmcmedgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2350-4-9). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting that it could enable cross-protective T-cell-based immunity. Finally, we reported global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.IMPORTANCE Individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to a virus across a population. In particular, understanding how variation in HLA may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease. HLA typing can be fast and inexpensive. Pairing HLA typing with COVID-19 testing where feasible could improve assessment of severity of viral disease in the population. Following the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, individuals with high-risk HLA types could be prioritized for vaccination.","Nguyen, Austin; David, Julianne K; Maden, Sean K; Wood, Mary A; Weeder, Benjamin R; Nellore, Abhinav; Thompson, Reid F",J. virol,35,21

The method utilized isocratic elution using an ODP-40 C18 column, the flow rate was set at 1.0 mL/min and negative polar signals. The linearity ranges were 3.0-18.0 µg/mL for MA, 1.5-4.0 µg/mL for AS and 0.5 to 3.0 µg/mL for CLA, respectively. Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) procedure was optimized in plasma samples. The recoveries percentages were 85.4, 81.2 and 88.8 correspondingly, in rat plasma. However, the drugs extraction by protein precipitation method yields very poor recoveries (around 50%). The new HPLC- refractive index (RI) methods are better than the previously reported HPLC-ultra violet methods in terms of greenness and simplicity of procedures. Moreover, the previously reported LC-MS methods lack the simplicity and availability of such expensive techniques in Quality control (QC) labs.

Here, we assessed if tomographic HS is also a risk factor for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We included 213 patients with a positive real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and chest computed tomography (CT) from an out-hospital facility and a hospital. We obtained information on demographics; weight; height; smoking history; diabetes; hypertension; and cardiovascular, lung, and renal disease. Two radiologists scored the CO-RADs system (COVID-19 Reporting and Data System) (1 = normal, 2 = inconsistent, 3-4 = indeterminate, and 5 = typical findings) and the chest CT severity index (&#8805;20 of 40 was considered severe disease). They evaluated the liver-to-spleen ratio (CTL/S) and defined tomographic steatosis as a CTL/S index &#8804;0.9. We used descriptive statistics, &#967;2 and t student tests, logistic regression, and reported odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Of the patients, 61% were men, with a mean age of 51.2 years, 48.3% were CO-RADs 1 and 51.7% CO-RADs 2-5. Severe tomographic disease was present in 103 patients (48.4%), all CO-RADs 5. This group was older; mostly men; and with a higher prevalence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and HS (69.9 vs 29%).

511860,511860,511860,On the Gap between Epidemiological Surveillance and Preparedness,11.592957,5.787258,2020-08-10,"Background: Large-scale events such as COVID-19 show that there are situations that can lead to huge stress on health infrastructure systems (HIS). The pandemic reveals that it is very difficult to protect HIS from all kinds of possible hazards. They can be unpredictable and spread rapidly; hence, it is hard to find an effective mitigation strategy to completely protect society and its important HIS. Methods: An often raised central question is what we should do if we cannot protect HIS from these types of hazards. To answer this question, the focus should move from HIS protection to HIS resilience. Therefore, in this paper, the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Index (CIRI) is used to estimate the resilience of health infrastructure systems. Results: The results of the case study show that HIS resilience was enhanced significantly after the implementation of measures. The results indicate that among the resilience phases the learning phase of resilience is the weakest part. This requires a root cause analysis, which should be prioritized by HIS managers and stakeholders. Conclusion: This paper discusses how the resilience concept will help decision- and policy-makers to have a clear view of HIS performance before, during, and after the disaster. An easy-to-use and applicable methodology for HIS assessment and evaluation was employed. It can be concluded that resilience and its identified phases can help HIS managers to allocate available resources accordingly in the phases during and post-crisis.","Barabadi, Abbas; Ghiasi, Mohammad Hossein; Qarahasanlou, Ali Nouri; Mottahedi, Adel",Arch.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 and at least one marker of cardiac involvement [cardiac symptoms, abnormal electrocardiograph (ECG), or abnormal cardiac biomarkers] and 25 healthy age- and gender-matched control subjects were recruited to the study. Patients were divided into those with elevated (n = 8) or normal TnI (n = 17). There were significant differences in global longitudinal strain among patients who were positive and negative for hs-TnI, and controls [-12.3 (-13.3, -11.5)%, -13.1 (-14.2, -9.8)%, and -15.7 (-18.3, -12.7)%, P = 0.004]. Native myocardial T1 relaxation times in patients with positive and negative hs-TnI manifestation (1169.8 ± 12.9 and 1113.2 ± 31.2 ms) were significantly higher than the normal (1065 ± 57 ms) subjects, respectively (P < 0.001).

In an effort to slow disease spread and protect valuable healthcare resources, cessation of non-essential surgery including many orthopaedic procedures, has recently become commonplace in areas affected by the novel coronavirus. This crisis has created a unique situation in the care of spine patients as we must balance the urgency of patient evaluation, surgical intervention, and continued training against the risk of disease exposure and resource management.The Spine division of an Orthopaedic Surgery Department at a tertiary care and academic center has taken an active role in enacting protocol changes in anticipation of COVID-19. In the past four weeks, since these changes were enacted, the Spine division has performed ten surgeries compared to an average of 60.4 spine cases performed annually over the same time period between 2015-2019. Furthermore, the number of clinic visits decreased from an average of 417.4 over this time period, to 322 with the percentage of new patient visits decreasing from 28% to 20%. During COVID-19, 318 of the 322 spine clinic visits were performed remotely via telehealth.The response to COVID-19 has been variable among surgical subspecialties and geographic regions. We present the changes that have been made regarding the care of spine patients at a busy academic center.

We conducted a test-negative case-control study to assess the durability of protection after full vaccination with BNT162b2, defined as 14 days after the second dose, against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a national medical practice between February 1, 2021 and August 22, 2021. We fit conditional logistic regression (CLR) models stratified on residential county and calendar time of testing to assess the association between time elapsed since vaccination and the odds of symptomatic infection or non-COVID-19 hospitalization (negative control), adjusted for several covariates. The primary population included 652 individuals who had a positive symptomatic test after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (cases) and 5,946 individuals with at least one negative symptomatic test after full vaccination (controls). The adjusted odds of symptomatic infection were higher 120 days after full vaccination versus at the date of full vaccination (Odds Ratio [OR]: 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-7.74). Importantly, the odds of infection were still lower 150 days after the first BNT162b2 dose as compared to 4 days after the first dose (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.19-0.45), when immune protection approximates the unvaccinated status. Low rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalization or death in this cohort precluded analyses of these severe outcomes. The odds of experiencing a non-COVID-19 hospitalization decreased with time since vaccination, suggesting a possible underestimation of waning protection by this approach due to confounding factors. Taken together, these data constitute an early signal for waning protection against symptomatic illness while also providing reassurance that BNT162b2 continues to protect against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection several months after full vaccination. Continued surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine durability, particularly against severe disease, is critical to guide effective and equitable strategies to respond to the pandemic, including distribution of booster doses, development of new vaccines, and implementation of both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions.","Puranik, Arjun; Lenehan, Patrick; O'Horo, John C; Niesen, Michiel JM; Virk, Abinash; Swift, Melanie D; Kremers, Walter; Venkatakrishnan, AJ; Gordon, Joel E; Geyer, Holly L; Speicher, Leigh Lewis; Soundararajan, Venky; Badley, Andrew D",,35,18

Cancellation of surgery and appointments, medication shortages and fear of the virus itself may have further challenged wellbeing. We aimed to understand how COVID-19 has affected people with endometriosis. METHODS: Using a mixed methods design, we examined; 1) the impact of COVID-19 on endometriosis related healthcare, symptoms and functioning; and 2) the relationship between a measure of fear of COVID-19 and qualitative impact in 162 women with endometriosis. RESULTS: We found that 60% of women reported impact of the pandemic upon healthcare, with sub-themes documenting the difficulty of cancelled and delayed treatment, specific COVID-19 barriers, and the advantages and disadvantages of telehealth. Only 23% reported negative impact on symptoms, specifically stress; 76% reported impact on daily functioning, with sub-themes related to compromised work, social life and healthy living. A 'hidden benefits' theme revealed ways that COVID-19 had improved some women's lives, including working from home, and the opportunity for healthy lifestyle choices.

Results support a model in which the 21kDa major CP is the product of direct translation of a sgRNA, while the 24kDa minor CP is a cleavage product derived from both the polyprotein and a larger ~26kDa precursor translated directly from the sgRNA. Cleavage occurs at an LXG[G/A] motif conserved in many viruses that use papain-like proteases for polyprotein processing and protection against degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.","Edwards, Michael C.; Weiland, John J.",Virology,35,16

METHODS: COVID-19 patients (confirmed by PCR or CT-Scan) who visited Imam Hospital in Sari were selected in this case-control study. The control group was selected from Tabari cohort population matched with the case group in terms of gender and age. CBC, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and outcome of the disease (in the case group) were assessed in this study. RESULTS: The number of participants were 527 in both case and control groups, of which, 232 (44%) were females in each arms. Platelet count, lymphocyte count, and hemoglobin concentration were also higher in the control group (P=0.000). NLR and PLR were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to the control group (P=0.000). NLR had a significant relationship with the severity of the disease. NLR was two times higher in the patients who died of COVID-19 than those who recovered (P=0.000). ROC curve analysis for diagnostic values of NLR and PLR showed that the areas under the ROC curves for NLR and PLR were 0.703 (95% CI: 0.64-0.76) and 0.535 (95% CI: 0.46-06), respectively. CONCLUSION: NLR can be used as a prognostic marker for COVID-19 given the significant difference of NLR between those who died and recovered from COVID-19.","Eslamijouybari, Mohammad; Heydari, Keyvan; Maleki, Iradj; Moosazadeh, Mahmood; Hedayatizadeh-Omran, Akbar; Vahedi, Lale; Ghasemian, Roya; Sharifpour, Ali; Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza",Caspian J Intern Med,35,20

However, many medical educators do not have experience planning or leading these sessions. Despite the prevalence of Zoom learning, there has been little published on best practices. In this article we describe best practices for using Zoom for remote learning, acknowledging technical considerations, and recommending workflows for designing and implementing virtual sessions. Furthermore, we discuss the important role of cognitive learning theory and how to incorporate these key pedagogical insights into a successful virtual session. While eventually in-person classrooms will open, virtual teaching will remain a component of medical education. If we utilize these inventive tools creatively and functionally, then virtual learning can augment and elevate the practice of medical education.","Ohnigian, Sarah; Richards, Jeremy B; Monette, Derek L; Roberts, David H",J Med Educ Curric Dev,35,29

In particular, large availability on Internet and unmonitored shipping have facilitated the diffusion of NPS on national territories. In this scenario, the forensic activity based on the process of drug detection, including investigation, seizure, recognition and analytical identification is crucial to get insights into the drug black market transformation. In this study, we describe the results obtained from the analysis of hundreds of packages seized during the months of year 2020, and suspected to contain NPS because not reacting with standard field test kits. We focused on the analysis by GC-MS and HPLC-HRMS, and NPS in particular, trying to underline the most common molecules present on the Italian territory during the COVID-19 pandemic. NPS were identified in 92.6% of the samples. The most prevalent compounds were synthetic cathinones, and 3-MMC in particular, which alone accounted for 18.6% of the total cases. Other prevalent molecules were 5F-MDMB-PICA, 2-FDCK, 1cp-LSD and 1P-LSD. Fentanyl was never detected.

These rapid diagnostic tests are usually based on antigen detection in a lateral flow approach. Aims & Methods While for PCR diagnostics the validation of a PCR assay is well established, for antigen tests e.g. rapid diagnostic tests there is no common validation strategy. Here we present the establishment of a panel of 50 pooled clinical specimens that cover a SARS-CoV-2 concentration range from approximately 1.1 x 109 to 420 genome copies per mL of specimen. The panel was used to evaluate 31 rapid diagnostic tests in up to 6 laboratories. Results Our results show that there is significant variation in the detection limits and the clinical sensitivity of different rapid diagnostic tests. We conclude that the best rapid diagnostic tests can be applied to reliably identify infectious individuals who are presenting with SARS-CoV-2 loads correlated to 106 genome copies per mL of specimen. Infected individuals displaying SARS-CoV-2 genome loads corresponding to less than 106 genome copies per mL will be identified by only some rapid diagnostics tests, while many tests miss these viral loads to a large extent. Conclusions Sensitive RDTs can be applied to identify infectious individuals with high viral loads, but not to identify infected individuals.","Puyskens, A.; Krause, E.; Michel, J.; Nuebling, M.; Scheiblauer, H.; Bourquain, D.; Grossegesse, M.; Valusenko, R.; Corman, V.

However, the etiology of 10–20% hepatitis cases remains unclear. Some hepatitis-associated viruses, like the hepatitis E virus, are zoonotic pathogens. Rats, shrews, and bats are reservoirs for many zoonotic pathogens. Therefore, understanding the virome in the liver of these animals is important for the investigation of the etiologies of hepatitis and monitoring the emerging zoonotic viruses. In this study, viral metagenomics and PCR methods were used to investigate viral communities in rats, mice, house shrews, and bats livers. Viral metagenomic analysis showed a diverse set of sequences in liver samples, comprising: sequences related to herpesviruses, orthomyxoviruses, anelloviruses, hepeviruses, hepadnaviruses, flaviviruses, parvoviruses, and picornaviruses. Using PCR methods, we first detected hepatovirus sequences in Hipposideros larvatus (3.85%). We also reported the first detection of Zika virus-related sequences in rats and house shrews. Sequences related to influenza A virus and herpesviruses were detected in liver. Higher detection rates of pegivirus sequences were found in liver tissue and serum samples from rats (7.85% and 15.79%, respectively) than from house shrews. Torque teno virus sequences had higher detection rates in the serum samples of rats and house shrews (52.72% and 5.26%, respectively) than in the liver. Near-full length genomes of pegivirus and torque teno virus were amplified. This study is the first to compare the viral communities in the liver of bats, rats, mice, and house shrews. Its findings expand our understanding of the virome in the liver of these animals and provide an insight into hepatitis-related viruses.","He, Wenqiao; Gao, Yuhan; Wen, Yuqi; Ke, Xuemei; Ou, Zejin; Li, Yongzhi; He, Huan; Chen, Qing",Front Microbiol,35,20

Recent studies suggest important roles for lncRNAs in PCOS development. Based on the hypothesis that lncRNAs are able to regulate mRNA functions by competitive binding to shared miRNAs, the present work sought to construct a PCOS-related lncRNA-mRNA network (PCLMN) to identify key lncRNAs with dysregulated expression and potential prognostic and therapeutic relevance. A global background network was constructed after retrieving lncRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA pairs from the lncRNASNP2, miRTarBase and StarBase databases. Based on gene expression profiles from ovarian granulosa cells from PCOS patients and controls in the GEO’s GSE95728 dataset, the PCLMN was then constructed by applying hypergeometric testing. Using topological analysis, we identified 3 lncRNAs (LINC00667, AC073172.1 and H19) ranking within the top-ten gene lists for all three centrality measures. We then explored their subcellular localization, performed functional module analyses, and identified 4 sex hormone-related transcription factors as potential regulators of their expression. Significant associations with inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis-related processes and pathways were revealed for the key lncRNAs in our PCMLN. Further studies verifying the mRNA/lncRNA relationships identified herein are needed to clarify their clinical significance.","Ma, Yue; Ma, Linna; Cao, Yurong; Zhai, Jun",Aging (Albany NY),35,18

However, it may prolong the QTc interval. Furthermore, when hydroxychloroquine is administered concomitantly with other drugs, it can exacerbate the risk of QT prolongation. Nevertheless, the risk of QT prolongation due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between hydroxychloroquine and concomitant medications has not yet been identified. To evaluate the risk of QT prolongation due to DDIs between hydroxychloroquine and 118 concurrent drugs frequently used in real-world practice, we analyzed the electrocardiogram results obtained for 447,632 patients and their relevant electronic health records in a tertiary teaching hospital in Korea from 1996 to 2018. We repeated the case–control analysis for each drug. In each analysis, we performed multiple logistic regression and calculated the odds ratio (OR) for each target drug, hydroxychloroquine, and the interaction terms between those two drugs. The DDIs were observed in 12 drugs (trimebutine, tacrolimus, tramadol, rosuvastatin, cyclosporin, sulfasalazine, rofecoxib, diltiazem, piperacillin/tazobactam, isoniazid, clarithromycin, and furosemide), all with a p value of < 0.05 (OR 1.70–17.85). In conclusion, we found 12 drugs that showed DDIs with hydroxychloroquine in the direction of increasing QT prolongation.","Choi, Byung Jin; Koo, Yeryung; Kim, Tae Young; Chung, Wou Young; Jung, Yun Jung; Park, Ji Eun; Lim, Hong-Seok; Park, Bumhee; Yoon, Dukyong",Sci Rep,35,33

Since then, infections have been detected in >1500 individuals, with disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to severe, fatal pneumonia. To elucidate the pathogenesis of this virus and investigate mechanisms underlying disease severity variation in the absence of autopsy data, a rhesus macaque and common marmoset model of MERS-CoV disease were analyzed. Rhesus macaques developed mild disease, and common marmosets exhibited moderate to severe, potentially lethal, disease. Both nonhuman primate species exhibited respiratory clinical signs after inoculation, which were more severe and of longer duration in the marmosets, and developed bronchointerstitial pneumonia. In marmosets, the pneumonia was more extensive, with development of severe airway lesions. Quantitative analysis showed significantly higher levels of pulmonary neutrophil infiltration and higher amounts of pulmonary viral antigen in marmosets. Pulmonary expression of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, was similar in marmosets and macaques. These results suggest that increased virus replication and the local immune response to MERS-CoV infection likely play a role in pulmonary pathology severity. Together, the rhesus macaque and common marmoset models of MERS-CoV span the wide range of disease severity reported in MERS-CoV–infected humans, which will aid in investigating MERS-CoV disease pathogenesis.","Baseler, Laura J.; Falzarano, Darryl; Scott, Dana P.; Rosenke, Rebecca; Thomas, Tina; Munster, Vincent J.; Feldmann, Heinz; de Wit, Emmie",The American Journal of Pathology,35,1

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire. METHODS: Local and foreign students attending an international summer school programme were invited to participate in a self-administered survey. RESULTS: Respondents complied with most of the preventive measures, excluding website viewing and mask wearing. Significant differences in compliance and perceived necessity were found amongst students from Singapore, Hong Kong and the USA. Singaporean students were significantly more likely to comply with all measures and consume antiviral medication in response to the pandemic than students studying in the US. CONCLUSIONS: Students’ responses towards university pandemic measures were largely positive, but sensitivity towards these measures varied between groups by country of study.

The deaths of four schoolchildren, during a pandemic influenza outbreak in December 2017 in Ghana, raised doubts about the ILI surveillance system’s performance. We evaluated the ILI surveillance system in the Greater Accra region, Ghana, to assess the system’s attributes and its performance on set objectives. METHODS: CDC guidelines were used to evaluate the data of the ILI surveillance system between 2013 and 2017. We interviewed the surveillance personnel on the system’s description and operation. Additionally, routinely entered ILI data from the National Influenza Center provided by the six sentinel sites in Accra was extracted. We sampled and reviewed 120 ILI case-investigation forms from these sites. Surveillance activities were examined on system’s performance indicators, each being scored on a scale of 1 to 3 (poorest to best performance). RESULTS: All population and age groups were under ILI surveillance over the period evaluated. Overall, 2948 suspected case-patients, including 392 (13.3%) children under-five were reported, with 219 being positive for influenza virus (Predictive value positive = 7.4%). The predominant influenza subtype was H3N2, recorded in 90 (41.1%) of positive case-patients. The system only met two out of its four objectives. None of the six sentinel sites consistently met their annual 260 suspected case-detection quota. Samples reached the laboratory on average 48 hours after collection and results were disseminated within 7 days. Of 120 case-investigation forms sampled, 91 (76.3%) were completely filled in. CONCLUSIONS: The ILI surveillance system in the Greater Accra region is only partially meeting its objectives. While it is found to be sensitive, representative and timely, the data quality was sub-optimal. We recommend the determination of thresholds for alert and outbreak detection and ensuring that sentinel sites meet their weekly case-detection targets.","Nuvey, Francis Sena; Edu-Quansah, Elijah Paa; Kuma, George Khumalo; Eleeza, John; Kenu, Ernest; Sackey, Samuel; Ameme, Donne; Abakar, Mahamat Fayiz; Kreppel, Katharina; Ngandolo, Richard Bongo; Afari, Edwin; Bonfoh, Bassirou",PLoS One,35,7

Although AgNPs synthesized using BGEs have been reported earlier in fundamental antimicrobial studies, the possible antioxidant activity, antibacterial efficacy against superbugs, and a potential antimicrobial mechanism are still lacking. The characterization of as-prepared AgNPs was studied through UV-vis, TEM, Zeta-potential, FT-IR, XRD, and XPS analysis. The antioxidant ability of BG-AgNPs was extensively evaluated through DPPH and FRAP assays, which showed that A-BG-AgNPs possessed higher scavenging ability and superior reducing power due to the high phenolic content present in the BG extract. Furthermore, A-BG-AgNPs were highly stable in various physiological media and displayed excellent antibacterial activity against drug-resistant bacterial strains (i.e., MIC value of 4 µg/mL). The generation of reactive oxygen species evidenced that the possible antimicrobial mechanism was induced by BG-AgNPs, resulting in bacterial cell damage.

Yet, evidence on the greenium is mixed and the determinants of green bond yields are not fully understood. In this model two sources of uncertainty are introduced, that is, of cash flows of the firm and of the effectiveness of the financed green projects. The adoption of two risk factors brings in some mathematical complexity but allows for a better modelling of the multi-facet nature of these financial instruments. Our model is rich enough to generate both a positive and a negative premium, as both have been detected in the empirical literature.

Material and method Recommendations based on the consensus conference model. Results In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies. Conclusion During COVID-19 pandemic, patients suffering from cancer should not lose life chance, while limiting the risks associated with the virus.","Akladios, C.; Azais, H.; Ballester, M.; Bendifallah, S.; Bolze, P.-A.; Bourdel, N.; Bricou, A.; Canlorbe, G.; Carcopino, X.; Chauvet, P.; Collinet, P.; Coutant, C.; Dabi, Y.; Dion, L.; Gauthier, T.; Graesslin, O.; Huchon, C.; Koskas, M.; Kridelka, F.; Lavoue, V.; Lecointre, L.; Mezzadri, M.; Mimoun, C.; Ouldamer, L.; Raimond, E.; Touboul, C.",Gynecol Obstet Fertil Senol,35,24

Specifically, this study explored: (1) the demographic and geographic distributions of suicidal ideation (SI) and deliberate self-harm (DSH), and (2) the associations of mental health and substance use with SI and DSH. METHOD: A total of 809 Canadian adolescents, aged 12-18 years, completed an online survey between June 17, 2020 and July 31, 2020. RESULTS: 44% of adolescents reported experiencing SI since the pandemic began, while 32% reported engaging in DSH. SI and DSH were more common among youth who: identified as transgender, non-binary or gender fluid; who did not reside with both parents; and who reported psychiatric concerns or frequent cannabis use. CONCLUSION: Canadian adolescents appear to be experiencing higher rates of self-harm thoughts and behaviours relative to before the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important for adults who are likely to interact with distressed youth to be aware of potential warning signs that a youth is struggling with self-harm, and to refer youth to specialty mental health services where appropriate.","Turner, Brianna J; Robillard, Christina L; Ames, Megan E; Craig, Stephanie G",Can J Psychiatry,35,29

We hypothesized that genetic variants in ADRB2 associated with a response to asthma therapy during an asthma exacerbation were also associated with severity of acute respiratory tract infections. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 5 common polymorphisms in the promoter region and coding block of the ADRB2 gene (loci -2387, -2274, -1343, +46, and +79) from 374 Caucasian and African American term infants who were enrolled at the time of acute respiratory illness over four respiratory viral seasons. Severity of respiratory tract infections was measured using a bronchiolitis severity score (BSS; range = 0-12, clinically significant difference = 0.5) with a higher score indicating more severe disease. We assigned the promoter, coding and combined promoter and coding haplotypes to the unphased genotype data. The associations between each of these five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as the haplotypes and infant BSS were analyzed using nonparametric univariate analysis and multivariable proportional odds model separately in Caucasians and African Americans. RESULTS: There was no significant association between infant BSS and each of the SNPs in both Caucasians and African Americans. However, promoter haplotype CCA was associated with a decreased BSS in African Americans in a dose dependent manner. The median (interquartile range) BSS of infants with no copies of the CCA haplotype, one copy, and two copies of the CCA haplotype were 5.5 (2.0, 8.0), 4.0 (1.0, 7.5), and 3.0 (1.0, 4.0), respectively. This dose dependent relationship persisted after adjusting for infant age, gender, daycare exposure, secondhand smoke exposure, prior history of breastfeeding, siblings at home, and enrollment season (adjusted odds ratio: 0.59, 95 % confidence interval: 0.36, 0.98). There was no similar protective relationship of haplotype CCA on severity of respiratory tract infections identified in Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: ADRB2 genotype may be predictive of severity of acute respiratory tract infections in African Americans, and potentially identify a subset of infants who may respond to beta-agonist therapy.

Aminopeptidase N (CD13) has been implicated in most of these phenomena, although its participation has been attributed to its enzymatic activity, while its role as an adhesion molecule has been almost unexplored. Here, we show that certain anti‐CD13 monoclonal antibodies induce HA of monocytic U‐937 cells, independently of their effect on enzymatic activity. The phenomenon is related to binding to a specific site on the CD13 molecule and is independent of integrins. It is abrogated by low temperature, by the glycolysis inhibitor 2‐deoxyglucose, and by inhibitors of tyrosine and mitogen‐activated protein kinases. The inhibitor of microtubule polymerization colchicine has a synergistic effect on CD13‐mediated aggregation, suggesting an inhibitory role of microtubules in this process. Finally, during HA, CD13 actively redistributes to the zones of cell‐cell contact, as determined by live cell imaging studies, demonstrating a direct role of CD13 in the adhesion phenomenon. Together, these data show for the first time the participation of CD13 in monocytic cell adhesion.","Mina‐Osorio, Paola; Shapiro, Linda H.; Ortega, Enrique",J Leukoc Biol,35,20

In this study, we examined the influences of living at home during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic NASH patients. In this study, we compared the clinical parameters of NASH patients without COVID-19 infection 3 months before with those 3 months after the declaration of a state of emergency. In the results, the changes of aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase in the 3 months before (aspartate transaminase, –3.6 ± 13.8 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, –6.8 ± 19.5 U/L) was significantly exacerbated in the 3 months after (aspartate transaminase, 2.3 ± 7.5 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 1.7 ± 10.4 U/L). Furthermore, the changes of the fibrosis-4 index in the 3 months before (–0.27 ± 0.84) was also significantly exacerbated in the 3 months after (0.38 ± 0.96). In conclusion, liver dysfunctions in NASH patients were exacerbated due to the emergency declaration and outing restriction which accompanied COVID-19.","Asai, Akira; Yasuoka, Hidetaka; Matsui, Masahiro; Okamoto, Norio; Fukunishi, Shinya; Higuchi, Kazuhide",J Clin Biochem Nutr,35,18

We surveyed 9,743 respondents between March 22 and September 26, 2020. We find that interpersonal contact has been dramatically reduced in the US, with an 82% (95%CI: 80%–83%) reduction in the average number of daily contacts observed during the first wave compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, we find increases in contact rates over the subsequent waves. We also find that certain demographic groups, including people under 45 and males, have significantly higher contact rates than the rest of the population.

Rather than immediately arguing for a new set of standards, as Heads of Social Work programmes the authors of this paper promoted a principles-led approach to inform ‘the right’ way—in an ethical sense—of ensuring social work education could continue in Australia during the pandemic. This meant conceptualising the challenges of delivering social work education in a pandemic as being not only practical but also ethical in their nature. Using examples of how this approach guided the design of adaptive online teaching and field education placements at our universities, we consider the future possibilities for ethical and rules-based governance approaches to social work education. How students learn is changing and what they are learning will help them respond to the immediate and future needs arising from the pandemic.

Based on the publicly available contact-tracing data, we identified 337 transmission chains from 10 provinces in China and estimated the serial interval (SI) and generation interval (GI) of COVID-19 in China. Methods: Inspired by possibly different values of the time-varying reproduction number for the imported cases and the local cases in China, we divided all transmission events into three subsets: imported (the zeroth generation) infecting 1st-generation locals, 1st-generation locals infecting 2nd-generation locals, and others transmissions among 2+ generations. The corresponding SI (GI) is respectively denoted as $\mbox{SI}^{0}_{1}$ ($\mbox{GI}^{0}_{1}$), $\mbox{SI}^{1}_{2}$ ($\mbox{GI}^{1}_{2}$), and $\mbox{SI}^{2+}_{3+}$ ($\mbox{GI}^{2+}_{3+}$). A Bayesian approach with doubly interval-censored likelihood is employed to fit the lognormal, gamma, and Weibull distribution function of the SI and GI using the identified 337 transmission chains. Findings: It is found that the estimated $\mbox{SI}^{0}_{1}$ = 6.27 (95%CI : 5.62 - 6.98), $\mbox{SI}^{1}_{2}$ = 5.92 (95%CI : 5.27 - 6.66), $\mbox{SI}^{2+}_{3+}$ = 4.36 (95%CI : 3.65 - 5.20), and $\mbox{GI}^{0}_{1}$ = 8.15 (95%CI : 6.73 - 9.91), $\mbox{GI}^{1}_{2}$ = 5.26 (95%CI : 4.25 - 6.69), $\mbox{GI}^{2+}_{3+}$ = 3.85 (95%CI : 2.18 - 6.72), thus overall both SI and GI decrease when generation increases.","Li, Menghui; Liu, Kai; Song, Yukun; Wang, Ming; Wu, Jinshan",,35,30

This study was conducted to determine if a rate enhancement hybridization (REH) buffer, developed for membrane hybridization, could be used to decrease hybridization time for ISH. Tissue from swine with an enteric disease produced by a swine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was used as a model to standardize hybridization conditions for a rapid ISH technique. Small intestinal sections from pigs experimentally and naturally infected with TGEV were hybridized for various times at 52°C and 70°C with a radiolabelled or a fluorescein-labelled RNA probe in a standard hybridization or a REH buffer. Viral RNA was detected in intestines from as early as 30 min of hybridization by using both buffers with the radiolabelled probe; however, the signal was stronger with the REH buffer. With the fluorescein-labelled probe, viral RNA was detected in virus-infected cells of the intestines after 30 min of hybridization by using the REH buffer. Signal intensity was greater with the REH buffer than with the standard hybridization buffer when compared at each hybridization time and hybridization temperature using both radiolabelled and fluorescein-labelled probes. With the REH buffer, hybridization signal intensity was greater at 70°C than at 52°C for both probes. The best results were obtained when small intestinal sections were hybridized at 70°C for 2 h using a radiolabelled or a fluorescein-labelled probe diluted in the REH buffer. The fluorescein-labelled RNA probe with REH buffer resulted in a minimal non-specific signal when compared with the radiolabelled probe. These studies demonstrated that the REH buffer can be used to decrease the time of ISH for the detection of viral RNA. This rapid ISH technique should have broad applications in the utilization of probe technology in diagnostics and research for the detection of target ribonucleic acidsin situ","Sirinarumitr, Theerapol; Paul, Prem S.; Halbur, Patrick G.; Kluge, John P.",Molecular and Cellular Probes,35,16

This study aims to evaluate the proximal and distal effects of a mindfulness-based program, specially developed to promote teachers’ social-emotional competencies (SEC), across teachers, classroom climates, and students’ outcomes. METHODS: The study followed a randomized trial design with two data collection points (pretest and posttest). Participants in the experimental group (EG) included 123 elementary school teachers, their 1503 students, and these students’ parents (1494), while the control group (CG) comprised 105 elementary school teachers, their 947 students, and these students’ parents (913). A mixed data collection strategy was used that included teachers’ and students’ (self-) report, observational ratings of teachers’ classroom behaviors, and parents’ reports on students. RESULTS: After the intervention, EG teachers, compared to CG teachers, reported a significant increase in mindfulness and emotional regulation competencies, self-efficacy, and well-being and a decrease in burnout symptoms. Similarly, a significant improvement was found in EG teachers’ classroom behaviors related to students’ engagement. Additionally, significant improvements were also found in EG students’ perceptions of the quality of their teachers’ involvement in classroom relationships, self-reported effect, and social competencies perceived by their parents. CONCLUSIONS: These findings further the knowledge on the role played by mindfulness-based SEC interventions in reducing teachers’ burnout symptoms and cultivating their SEC and well-being, in promoting a nurturing classroom climate and also in promoting the SEC and well-being of students.

A novel nested RT-PCR approach targeting five different regions of the viral genome improved the sensitivity of RT-qPCR assays and generated nucleotide sequences at sites with known sequence polymorphisms among SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We were able to detect co-circulating virus variants, some specifically prevalent in England, and to identify changes in viral RNA sequences with time consistent with the recently reported increasing global dominance of Spike protein G614 pandemic variant.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, radiological imaging, management, and outcome of COVID-19 infection in patients of diabetes mellitus and its association with glycemic control. METHODS: The present study was designed to evaluate the difference between uncontrolled and controlled diabetes for COVID-19 manifestations by enrolling 80 admitted COVID-19 patients. Patients were categorized into two groups, where group 1 had patients with uncontrolled diabetes as indicated by HbA1c > 8 g% and group 2 had patients with controlled diabetes as indicated by HbA1c < 8 g%. Information concerning medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, radiological imaging, management, and outcome was extracted from medical records for evaluation, interpretation, and association among both the groups. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes exhibited a severe symptomatic presentation, excessive uncontrolled inflammatory responses, and hypercoagulable state. Total leukocyte count, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, serum levels of IL-6, FDP, and D-dimer were significantly raised (p < 0.05) in case of uncontrolled diabetes as compared with controlled diabetes. Radiological findings detected by chest radiograph and computed tomography chest suggested severe lung involvement in uncontrolled diabetes. COVID-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes required intensive treatment as compared with controlled diabetes group in terms of insulin therapy (p = 0.0226) and non-invasive ventilation (p = 0.0292). Patients with uncontrolled diabetes had higher mortality (p = 0.0375) and required prolonged hospitalization (p = 0.0479) as compared with controlled diabetes group. CONCLUSION: From the current study, it can be concluded that uncontrolled diabetic condition might be a risk factor for severity and morbidity of COVID-19 patients. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus might be responsible for an overall higher susceptibility for COVID-19 infection and severity in terms of symptomatic presentation, inflammatory storm, rapid pulmonary invasion, requirement of more intensive treatment, and a poor outcome.","Bhandari, Sudhir; Rankawat, Govind; Singh, Ajeet; Gupta, Vishal; Kakkar, Shivankan",Int J Diabetes Dev Ctries,35,24

Therefore, the present study analyses the dimensions of sustainable HCWM by using a multi-method approach: PESTEL (political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal) analysis, TISM (total interpretive structural modeling) and fuzzy- MICMAC (cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification) analysis. The opted research framework yields 17 PESTEL dimensions of sustainable HCWM during the COVID-19 outbreak through the literature survey and experts’ discussions. Then, the TISM methodology developed a hierarchical digraph of all the 17 dimensions of sustainable HCWM based on the interrelationships. Fuzzy-MICMAC analysis classified all 17 PESTEL dimensions into four groups depending upon their driving and dependence powers. The study concluded that the policy framework for targeting political, legal and environmental issues should be the immediate concern of the worldwide governments and health officials. The effluent control and compliance to environmental laws being the output dimensions should be tracked regularly for ensuring the cleaner production in healthcare services.

A total of 200 respondents from the West Java province in Indonesia were included. Data on mental health, work satisfaction, and quality of life were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and multivariate regression analysis. Responses to open questions regarding concerns and strengths were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: An increased mental health symptom experienced by healthcare professionals was associated with decreased health status (β=−0.724, p=0.001) and self-perceived health (β=−0.59, p=0.001). Further, serving patients with COVID-19 (β=−0.133, p=0.024) was related to lower health status. Five themes emerged regarding concerns about being exposed to COVID-19, namely 1) fear of transmitting the virus, 2) the impact of COVID-19 on family life, 3) death and isolation, 4) personal safety, and 5) social stigma. Five themes emerged regarding the source of encouragement and strength, ie. 1) religiosity, 2) social support systems, 3) the moral responsibility of the profession, 4) following health and safety protocols, and 5) acceptance and positive attitudes towards the future. CONCLUSION: Mental health problems impacted the quality of life. Serving patients with COVID-19 could predict lower health status. HCPs’ concerns and sources of strength when exposed to COVID-19 are discussed. Our results give a better understanding of the factors that can decrease and improve HCPs’ quality of life, therefore can be used to design psychological interventions to lower HCP’s psychological problems and improving their quality of life.","Iskandarsyah, Aulia; Shabrina, Arina; Djunaidi, Achmad; Siswadi, Ahmad Gimmy P",Psychol Res Behav Manag,35,25

The goal of this ecological cross-sectional study is to examine the demographic and economic nature of spatial hot and cold spots of SARS-CoV-2 rates in New York City and Chicago as of April 13, 2020. In both cities, cold spots (clusters of low SARS-CoV-2 rate ZIP code tabulation areas) demonstrated typical protective factors associated with the social determinants of health and the ability to social distance. These neighborhoods tended to be wealthier, have higher educational attainment, higher proportions of non-Hispanic white residents, and more workers in managerial occupations. Hot spots (clusters of high SARS-CoV-2 rate ZIP code tabulation areas) also had similarities, such as lower rates of college graduates and higher proportions of people of color. It also appears to be larger households (more people per household), rather than overall population density, that may to be a more strongly associated with hot spots. Findings suggest important differences between the cities' hot spots as well. They can be generalized by describing the NYC hot spots as working-class and middle-income communities, perhaps indicative of service workers and other occupations (including those classified as ""essential services"" during the pandemic) that may not require a college degree but pay wages above poverty levels. Chicago's hot spot neighborhoods, on the other hand, are among the city's most vulnerable, low-income neighborhoods with extremely high rates of poverty, unemployment, and non-Hispanic Black residents.","Maroko, A.

We use a nationally representative survey of 1,476 adults in the UK between December 12 to 18, 2020 and five focus groups conducted in the same period. Trust is a core predictor, with distrust in vaccines in general and mistrust in government raising vaccine hesitancy. Trust in health institutions and experts and perceived personal threat are vital, with focus groups revealing that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is driven by a misunderstanding of herd immunity as providing protection, fear of rapid vaccine development and side effects, belief the virus is man-made and related to population control. Particularly those who obtain information from relatively unregulated social media sources such as YouTube that have recommendations tailored by watch history are less likely to be willing to become vaccinated. Those who hold general conspiratorial beliefs are less willing to be vaccinated. Since an increasing number of individuals use social media for gathering health information, interventions require action from governments, health officials and social media companies. More attention needs to help people understand their own risks, unpack complex concepts and fill knowledge voids.","Jennings, W.; Stoker, G.; Willis, H.; Valgardsson, V.; Gaskell, J.; Devine, D.; Mckay, L.; Mills, M.

To design geographically targeted and effective intervention mechanisms of malaria, an up-to-date map that shows the spatial distribution of malaria is needed. This study analyzed 2018 Mozambique Malaria Indicator Survey using geostatistical methods to: i) explore individual, household, and community-level determinants of malaria in under-five children, ii) prepare a malaria prevalence map in Mozambique, and iii) produce prediction prevalence maps and exceedence probability across the country. The results show the overall weighted prevalence of malaria was 38.9% (N = 4347, with 95% CI: 36.9%–40.8%). Across different provinces of Mozambique, the prevalence of malaria ranges from 1% in Maputo city to 57.3% in Cabo Delgado province. Malaria prevalence was found to be higher in rural areas, increased with child’s age, and decreased with household wealth index and mother’s level of education. Given the high prevalence of childhood malaria observed in Mozambique there is an urgent need for effective public health interventions in malaria hot spot areas. The household determinants of malaria infection that are identified in this study as well as the maps of parasitaemia risk could be used by malaria control program implementers to define priority intervention areas.","Ejigu, Bedilu Alamirie",PLoS One,35,16

In the early stages of the pandemic, countries with universal BCG vaccination programs registered a low number of new cases of COVID-19, with the situation now reversed, as exemplified by India. The high genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2, a known characteristic of RNA viruses, causing the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may have led to the virus adapting to overcome the initial immune protection. The strains from the United Kingdom (B1.1.7), Brazil (B1.1.28 and B1.1.33), South Africa (B.1.351), and India (B.1.617) are characterized by a greater ability to spread in the environment, in comparison with the original infectious agent of SARS-CoV-2. It should be remembered that the large variation in the genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 may result in future changes in its pathogenicity, immunogenicity and antigenicity, and therefore it is necessary to carefully study the mutations occurring within the virus to determine whether the current vaccines will remain effective. However, most studies show that monoclonal antibodies produced after vaccination against COVID-19 are effective against the newly developed variants.","Kulus, Jakub; Kulus, Magdalena; Stefańska, Katarzyna; Sobolewski, Jarosław; Piotrowska-Kempisty, Hanna; Mozdziak, Paul; Kempisty, Bartosz",Vaccines (Basel),35,20

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) patients (including 2 deaths) of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019. ResultsOf the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 (24.4%) patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. Conclusion: Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients. Therefore, the monitoring of the heart functions of COVID-2019 patients and applying potential interventions for those with abnormal cardiac injury related characteristics, is vital to prevent the fatality.","Hui, H.; Zhang, Y.; Yang, X.; Wang, X.; He, B.; Li, L.; Li, H.; Tian, J.; Chen, Y.",,35,1

We used a broad range PCR approach to investigate the presence and diversity of astroviruses in healthy pigs of different ages on 20 farms and in 3 slaughterhouses situated in the province of Quebec, Canada between 2005 and 2007. Our study unexpectedly revealed remarkable levels of genetic diversity and high prevalence of astroviruses in pigs of this province. Astroviruses were detected on every farm investigated and in all age groups of pigs, from suckling piglets to adults. In addition, we found that nearly 80% of healthy finisher pigs harbour astroviruses in their intestine at slaughter. Phylogenetic evidence based on partial polymerase and complete capsid sequences, suggests that porcine astroviruses do not form a monophyletic group but are rather found on separate branches across the mamastrovirus tree. In addition to type species strains, we found highly divergent strains that form two additional lineages, one of which falls outside existing taxonomic groups. The presence of diverse astroviruses in a majority of healthy pigs likely represents a continuous source of infection to piglets and possibly to other animal species including humans. Porcine astrovirus strains appeared phylogenetically related not only to prototypical human astroviruses, as was already known, but also to novel human strains recently discovered suggesting multiple cross species transmission events between these hosts and other animal species. Overall, the findings reported in this study suggest an active role of pigs in the evolution and ecology of the Astroviridae.","Luo, Zhiyao; Roi, Stéphanie; Dastor, Margaux; Gallice, Estelle; Laurin, Marc-André; L’Homme, Yvan",Veterinary Microbiology,35,1

Whenever DNA damage occurs, it is sensed by DNA-repairing proteins and thereby performing the DNA-repair mechanism. Specifically, in response to DNA damage, H2AX is a key protein involved in initiating the DNA-repair processes. In this present study, we investigate the effect of UV-C on earthworm, Perionyx excavatus and analyzed the DNA-damage response. Briefly, we expose the worms to different doses of UV-C and find that worms are highly sensitive to UV-C. As a primary response, earthworms produce coelomic fluid followed by autotomy. However, tissue inflammation followed by death is observed when we expose worm to increased doses of UV-C. In particular, UV-C promotes damages in skin layers and on the contrary, it mediates the chloragogen and epithelial outgrowth in intestinal tissues. Furthermore, UV-C promotes DNA damages followed by upregulation of H2AX on dose-dependent manner. Our finding confirms DNA damage caused by UV-C is directly proportional to the expression of H2AX. In short, we conclude that H2AX is present in the invertebrate earthworm, which plays an evolutionarily conserved role in DNA damage event as like that in higher animals.","Subbiahanadar Chelladurai, Karthikeyan; Selvan Christyraj, Jackson Durairaj; Azhagesan, Ananthaselvam; Paulraj, Vennila Devi; Jothimani, Muralidharan; Yesudhason, Beryl Vedha; Chellathurai Vasantha, Niranjan; Ganesan, Mijithra; Rajagopalan, Kamarajan; Venkatachalam, Saravanakumar; Benedict, Johnson; John Samuel, Jemima Kamalapriya; Selvan Christyraj, Johnson Retnaraj Samuel",Sci Rep,35,1

With a combination of chemical stability, thermal stability and biocompatibility, ceramic nanoparticles outperformed intermetallics of zinc alloys with inherent advantages of retaining a proper corrosion rate and an exceptional ductility. Compared with Zn alloys, Zn matrix nanocomposites showed an unprecedented strengthening without sacrifices of corrosion rate, which were introduced by intermetallics. In this work, in situ titanium diboride (TiB2) reinforced Zn nanocomposite was prepared via a few cost-effective and economical methods: flux-assisted synthesis (FAS), ultrasound-assisted nanoparticle homogenization and hot rolling. 3 vol.% of TiB2 nanoparticles were synthesized with an average size of 454nm, followed by molten salt assisted ultrasound homogenization and hot rolling. Hot-rolled (HR) Zn-TiB2 performed high strength and high ductility, mostly due to precipitation strengthening (Orowan strengthening). Yield stress (YS) and ultimate tensile stress (UTS) increased by 90% and 45%, respectively, while the elongation to failure retained 23%.

Early and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in reducing the spread of the disease and its accompanied mortality. Currently, detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard of outpatient and inpatient detection of Covid-19. RT-PCR is a rapid method; however, its accuracy in detection is only ~70–75%. Another approved strategy is computed tomography (CT) imaging. CT imaging has a much higher sensitivity of ~80–98%, but similar accuracy of 70%. To enhance the accuracy of CT imaging detection, we developed an open-source framework, CovidCTNet, composed of a set of deep learning algorithms that accurately differentiates Covid-19 from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other lung diseases. CovidCTNet increases the accuracy of CT imaging detection to 95% compared to radiologists (70%). CovidCTNet is designed to work with heterogeneous and small sample sizes independent of the CT imaging hardware. To facilitate the detection of Covid-19 globally and assist radiologists and physicians in the screening process, we are releasing all algorithms and model parameter details as open-source.

To give an indication of possible implications, this study investigated excess mortality patterns during a previous influenza epidemic. METHODS: Using Dutch population and mortality registers, a historical cohort study was designed to compare mortality during the 2017–2018 influenza epidemic with mortality in the same period in the three previous years. People with ID were identified by entitlements to residential ID‐care services as retrieved from a national database. RESULTS: Data covered the entire adult Dutch population (12.6 million; GenPop), of which 91 064 individuals were identified with an ID. During the influenza epidemic, mortality among people with ID increased almost three times as much than in the GenPop (15.2% vs. 5.4%), and more among male individuals with ID (+19.5%) than among female individuals with ID (+10.6%), as compared with baseline. In both cohorts, comparable increases in mortality within older age groups and due to respiratory causes were seen. Particularly in the ID‐cohort, excess deaths also occurred in younger age groups, due to endocrine diseases and ID‐specific causes. CONCLUSIONS: During the 2017–2018 influenza epidemic, excess mortality among people with ID was three times higher than in the general Dutch population, appeared more often at young age and with a broader range of underlying causes. These findings suggest that a pandemic may disproportionally affect people with ID while population data may not immediately raise warnings. Early detection of diverging patterns and faster implementation of tailored strategies therefore require collection of good quality data.","Cuypers, M.; Schalk, B. W. M.; Koks‐Leensen, M. C.

Frequencies of infections are only known for hospitalized children. OBJECTIVES: Comparing infection frequencies in children who have mild infections with frequencies in children needing hospital uptake will determine whether infection by one of the four HCoVs leads to more severe disease. In addition, the sequence of seroconversions can reveal whether infection by one HCoV protects from infection by other HCoVs. STUDY DESIGN: Two distinct study groups were monitored: healthy children and children hospitalized due to respiratory infection. HCoV natural infection rates in healthy children were obtained by serology in 25 newborns (followed 0–20 months). The frequencies of severe HCoVs infection was determined by real time RT-PCR among 1471 hospitalized infants (<2-years old) with acute respiratory tract disease. RESULTS: The majority of healthy children seroconverted for HCoV-OC43 (n = 19) and HCoV-NL63 (n = 17), less for HCoV-HKU1 (n = 9) and HCoV-229E (n = 5). Notably, HCoV-HKU1 seroconversion was absent after HCoV-OC43 infection. Also HCoV-229E infection was rarely observed after HCoV-NL63 infection (1 out of 5). In the hospital 207 (14%) out of 1471 children were HCoV positive. Again we observed most infection by HCoV-OC43 (n = 85) and HCoV-NL63 (n = 60), followed by HCoV-HKU1 (n = 47) and HCoV-229E (n = 15). CONCLUSIONS: HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 infections occur frequently in early childhood, more often than HCoV-HKU1 or HCoV-229E infections. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 may elicit immunity that protects from subsequent HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E infection, respectively, which would explain why HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 are the most frequently infecting HCoVs. There are no indications that infection by one of the HCoVs is more pathogenic than others.","Dijkman, Ronald; Jebbink, Maarten F.; Gaunt, Eleanor; Rossen, John W.A.; Templeton, Kate E.; Kuijpers, Taco W.; van der Hoek, Lia",J Clin Virol,35,1

Current rapid antigen tests cannot quantitate and track antigen dynamics with high sensitivity and specificity in respiratory samples. METHODS: We developed and validated an ultra-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay with smartphone readout using the Microbubbling Digital Assay previously developed by our group, which is a platform that enables highly sensitive detection and quantitation of protein biomarkers. A computer vision-based algorithm was developed for microbubble smartphone image recognition and quantitation. A machine learning-based classifier was developed to classify the smartphone images based on detected microbubbles. Using this assay, we tracked antigen dynamics in serial swab samples from COVID patients hospitalized in ICU and immunocompromised COVID patients. RESULTS: The limit of detection (LOD) of the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay was 0.5 pg/mL (10.6 fM) recombinant nucleocapsid (N) antigen or 4000 copies/mL inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, comparable to many rRT-PCR methods. The assay had high analytical specificity towards SARS-CoV-2. Compared to EUA-approved rRT-PCR methods, the Microbubbling Antigen Assay demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI), 92–99%) in symptomatic individuals within 7 days of symptom onset and positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid results, and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 97% (95% CI, 94–100%) in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with negative nucleic acid results. Antigen positivity rate in NP swabs gradually decreased as days-after-symptom-onset increased, despite persistent nucleic acid positivity of the same samples. The computer vision and machine learning-based automatic microbubble image classifier could accurately identify positives and negatives, based on microbubble counts and sizes. Total microbubble volume, a potential marker of antigen burden, correlated inversely with Ct values and days-after-symptom-onset. Antigen was detected for longer periods of time in immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies, compared to immunocompetent individuals. Simultaneous detectable antigens and nucleic acids may indicate the presence of replicating viruses in patients with persistent infections. CONCLUSIONS: The Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay enables sensitive and specific detection of acute infections, and quantitation and tracking of antigen dynamics in different patient populations at various stages of infection. With smartphone compatibility and automated image processing, the assay is well-positioned to be adapted for point-of-care diagnosis and to explore the clinical implications of antigen dynamics in future studies.","Chen, Hui; Li, Zhao; Feng, Sheng; Wang, Anni; Richard-Greenblatt, Melissa; Hutson, Emily; Andrianus, Stefen; Glaser, Laurel J.; Rodino, Kyle G.; Qian, Jianing; Jayaraman, Dinesh; Collman, Ronald G.; Glascock, Abigail; Bushman, Frederic D.; Lee, Jae Seung; Cherry, Sara; Fausto, Alejandra; Weiss, Susan R.; Koo, Hyun; Corby, Patricia M.; O’Doherty, Una; Garfall, Alfred L.; Vogl, Dan T.; Stadtmauer, Edward A.; Wang, Ping",medRxiv,35,1

Basic bioinformatics skills together with critical analysis of scientific literature are essential for addressing research questions in modern biology. The work presented here describes a fully online, collaborative research experience created to allow undergraduate students to learn those skills. The research experience was focused on the development and implementation of the Organonitrogen Biodegradation Database (ONDB, z.umn.edu/ondb). The ONDB was developed to catalog information about the cost, chemical properties, and biodegradation potential of commonly used organonitrogen compounds. A cross-institutional team of undergraduate researchers worked in collaboration with two faculty members and a postdoctoral fellow to develop the database. Students carried out extensive online literature searches and used a biodegradation prediction website to research and represent the microbial catabolism of different organonitrogen compounds. Participants employed computational tools such as R, Shiny, and flexdashboard to construct the database pages and interactive web interface for the ONDB. Worksheets and forms were created to encourage other students and researchers to gather information about organonitrogen compounds and expand the database. Student progress was evaluated through biweekly project meetings, presentations, and a final reflection. The ONDB undergraduate research experience provided a platform for students to learn bioinformatics skills while simultaneously developing a teaching and research tool for others.","Robinson, Serina L.; Biernath, Troy; Rosenthal, Caleb; Young, Dean; Wackett, Lawrence P.; Martinez-Vaz, Betsy M.",J Microbiol Biol Educ,35,21

However, AAs are more likely to be hesitant in receiving COVID-19 vaccinations when compared to non-Hispanic Whites. We examined factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among a predominant AA community sample. We performed a cross-sectional analysis on data collected from a convenience sample of 257 community-dwelling participants in the Central Savannah River Area from 5 December 2020, through 17 April 2021. Vaccine hesitancy was categorized as resistant, hesitant, and acceptant. We estimated relative odds of vaccine resistance and vaccine hesitancy using polytomous logistic regression models. Nearly one-third of the participants were either hesitant (n = 40, 15.6%) or resistant (n = 42, 16.3%) to receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine-resistant participants were more likely to be younger and were more likely to have experienced housing insecurity due to COVID-19 when compared to both acceptant and hesitant participants, respectively. Age accounted for nearly 25% of the variation in vaccine resistance, with 21-fold increased odds (OR: 21.93, 95% CI: 8.97–5.26–91.43) of vaccine resistance in participants aged 18 to 29 compared to 50 and older adults. Housing insecurity accounted for 8% of the variation in vaccine resistance and was associated with 7-fold increased odds of vaccine resistance (AOR: 7.35, 95% CI: 1.99–27.10).

The immune responses in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still under investigation, and data are evolving. While it is known that humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 are elicited, it is uncertain whether these responses protect against reinfection or that they provide definitive evidence of viral clearance. Very few cases have been reported in the literature regarding reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a middle-aged man with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection who later developed mild symptomatic COVID-19 after a period of 3 months. The source of reinfection was likely from the community, which had a soaring burden of infection with the highest number of COVID-19 cases per million in the world at that time. The patient had 2 negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests 2 weeks after the initial infection. During the second infection, a nasopharyngeal reverse-transcription PCR test and tests for the presence of COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies were all positive. CONCLUSIONS: Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is a strong possibility. This case raises concerns that asymptomatic infections may not provide long-term protective immunity to all patients, which could make them susceptible to rein-fection. Possible explanations for reinfection include an interval decrease in protective antibodies titers after SARS-CoV-2 infection that may be more prevalent in patients who had an asymptomatic infection. Other possibilities include viral reactivation after a prolonged carriage of the virus or delayed immune response.","Sharma, Rohit; Sardar, Sundus; Arshad, Abdullah Mohammad; Ata, Fateen; Zara, Sabeen; Munir, Waqar",Am J Case Rep,35,26

In addition to the final tests, learners’ programming knowledge, skills, and capacities are primarily demonstrated throughout the programming process, particularly in the situation when they encounter challenges and problems. However, few studies examine how learners engage in the programming processes and to what extent unplugged programming fosters learning. This research used a quasi-experimental design to investigate two instructional modes in China’s secondary education, namely, the instructor-directed lecturing and the learner-centered unplugged programming. Based on an analytical framework, this research used mixed methods to compare learners’ knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under these two instructional modes. RESULTS: The research results revealed discrepancies between two instructional modes. First, learners in the unplugged programming class achieved significantly higher scores on the programming knowledge assessment, compared to learners in the traditional lecturing class. Second, compared to the traditional lecturing class, learners in the unplugged programming class had higher test scores of the computational thinking skills, particularly on the cooperativity dimension. Next, discrepancies of in-class behaviors showed that learners in the unplugged programming class had frequent behaviors of listening to the instructor’s instructions and discussing with peers, while learners in the instructor-directed class had frequent behaviors of listening to instructor, taking notes, and irrelevant activities. Learners’ self-reported attitudes in the unplugged programming indicated a higher level of confidence than learners in the traditional lecturing class. Overall, this research revealed that the learner-centered unplugged programming had potential to improve learners’ programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes compared to the traditional instructor-directed lecturing of programming. CONCLUSIONS: As a feasible and easy-to-use instructional activity in computer science education, unplugged programming is encouraged to be integrated in formal education to increase learners’ programming interests, motivations, and qualities. This quasi-experimental research compared learners’ programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under two instructional modes. The results revealed critical discrepancies between two instructional modes on learners’ knowledge gains, in-class behaviors, and changes of attitudes towards programming.

There is currently no specific drug for therapeutic treatment or for use as a prophylactic agent against infection and no commercially available vaccine. Prohibitin has been identified as a receptor protein used by chikungunya virus to enter mammalian cells. Recently, synthetic sulfonyl amidines and flavaglines (FLs), a class of naturally occurring plant compounds with potent anti‐cancer and cytoprotective and neuroprotective activities, have been shown to interact directly with prohibitin. This study therefore sought to determine whether three prohibitin ligands (sulfonyl amidine 1 m and the flavaglines FL3 and FL23) were able to inhibit CHIKV infection of mammalian Hek293T/17 cells. All three compounds inhibited infection and reduced virus production when cells were treated before infection but not when added after infection. Pretreatment of cells for only 15 minutes prior to infection followed by washing out of the compound resulted in significant inhibition of entry and virus production.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 2020 to April 2020. The nurses working in Wuhan from the other parts of China were the target population. The Professional Quality of Life Scale version 5, the Hospital Ethical Climate Survey, and a basic information sheet were used to collect data. Descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: In total, 236 nurses participated in this study, and 219 valid questionnaires were analyzed. The average age of the participants was 31.2 ± 5.0 years. Most nurses were female (176/219; 80.4%) and married (145/219; 66.2%). In term of professional quality of life, nurses reported moderate (129/219; 58.9%) to high (90/219; 41.1%) levels of compassion satisfaction, low (119/219; 54.3%) to moderate (100/219; 45.7%) levels of burnout, and low (67/219; 36.0%) to high (10/219; 4.6%) levels of secondary traumatic stress. Regarding hospital ethical climate, nurses reported moderately high hospital ethical climates with an average score of 4.46. After controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, the multiple linear regression models showed that the hospital ethical climate subscale of “relationship with physicians” was independently associated with the compassion satisfaction (β = 0.533, P < 0.01) and burnout (β = −0.237, P < 0.05); the hospital ethical climate subscale of “relationship with peers” (β = −0.191, P < 0.01) was independently associated with the secondary traumatic stress. CONCLUSIONS: During the early stage of the pandemic, nurses demonstrated moderate to high level of compassion satisfaction, low to moderate level of burnout, and all nurses experienced secondary traumatic stress. Nurses perceived a high level of hospital ethical climate, and the perceived hospital ethical climate played an important role in promoting nurses’ professional quality of life during a life-threatening infectious disease pandemic.","Jiang, Wenjing; Zhao, Xing'e; Jiang, Jia; Zhou, Qidi; Yang, Jiahui; Chen, Yuqing; Goldsamt, Lloyd; Williams, Ann Bartley; Li, Xianhong",Int J Nurs Sci,35,20

Methods: We identified prevalent mutations using the spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 deposited in the Nextstrain global database and comparing them to the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 genomic sequence as a reference. Then we calculated the percentages of mutant genomes from the total regional subsample isolates from December 2019 to the end of January 2021. We developed two separate time series forecasting models for the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. The computational model used the structure of the S-RBD to examine its interactions with the neutralizing antibody, named CV30 (isolated from a patient), and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2), based on a hybrid algorithm of template-based modeling to predict the affinity of S protein to the neutralizing antibodies and hACE-2 receptor. Results: The proportion of the B.1.1.7 strain in North America is growing fast. From these computations, it seems that the S-RBD and hACE-2 proteins are less favorable for the South African strain (K417N, E484K, and N501Y) as compared to the wild type structure and more favorable for B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants. In the present of crystallized CV30 neutralizing antibodies, docking scores suggest antibodies can be partially neutralize the B.1.1.7 variant, and, less efficiently, the B.1.351 and P.1 variants. Conclusion: The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to allow the newly-emerged B.1.351, and P.1 variants to escape from natural or vaccine-induced neutralizing immunity and viral spreading.","Quinonez, E.; Vahed, M.; Hashemi Shahraki, A.; Mirsaeidi, M.",,35,10

We assessed the compliance of health workers with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID-19 in outpatient settings in Tanzania, before the pandemic. METHODS: This study was based on a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected as part of a randomised controlled trial in private for-profit dispensaries and health centres and in faith-based dispensaries, health centres, and hospitals, in 18 regions. We observed provider–patient interactions in outpatient consultation rooms, laboratories, and dressing rooms, and categorised infection prevention and control practices into four domains: hand hygiene, glove use, disinfection of reusable equipment, and waste management. We calculated compliance as the proportion of indications (infection risks) in which a health worker performed a correct action, and examined associations between compliance and health worker and facility characteristics using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models. FINDINGS: Between Feb 7 and April 5, 2018, we visited 228 health facilities, and observed at least one infection prevention and control indication in 220 facilities (118 [54%] dispensaries, 66 [30%] health centres, and 36 [16%] hospitals). 18 710 indications were observed across 734 health workers (49 [7%] medical doctors, 214 [29%] assistant medical officers or clinical officers, 106 [14%] nurses or midwives, 126 [17%] clinical assistants, and 238 [32%] laboratory technicians or assistants). Compliance was 6·9% for hand hygiene (n=8655 indications), 74·8% for glove use (n=4915), 4·8% for disinfection of reusable equipment (n=841), and 43·3% for waste management (n=4299). Facility location was not associated with compliance in any of the infection prevention and control domains. Facility level and ownership were also not significantly associated with compliance, except for waste management. For hand hygiene, nurses and midwives (odds ratio 5·80 [95% CI 3·91–8·61]) and nursing and medical assistants (2·65 [1·67–4·20]) significantly outperformed the reference category of assistant medical officers or clinical officers. For glove use, nurses and midwives (10·06 [6·68–15·13]) and nursing and medical assistants (5·93 [4·05–8·71]) also significantly outperformed the reference category. Laboratory technicians performed significantly better in glove use (11·95 [8·98–15·89]), but significantly worse in hand hygiene (0·27 [0·17–0·43]) and waste management (0·25 [0·14–0·44] than the reference category. Health worker age was negatively associated with correct glove use and female health workers were more likely to comply with hand hygiene. INTERPRETATION: Health worker infection prevention and control compliance, particularly for hand hygiene and disinfection, was inadequate in these outpatient settings. Improvements in provision of supplies and health worker behaviours are urgently needed in the face of the current pandemic.

College students were vulnerable to food insecurity pre-pandemic and this study examined how the living situations and food security status changed for Midwestern university students due to COVID-19 restrictions. An email survey administered to Iowa State University students between the ages of 18 and 30 who physically attended campus prior to its closure produced 1434 responses. Students living with a parent or guardian increased by 44% and were less likely to experience food insecurity or less likely to work. They had lower stress and ate more home-cooked meals. Students living on their own had higher rates of food insecurity, greater stress, poorer health status, higher cooking self-efficacy, and worked more hours. Seventeen percent of all students were food insecure; related factors were non-White ethnicity, lower cooking self-efficacy, undergraduate status, receipt of financial aid, employment, stress, living in the same situation as before the campus closure, and consumption of more take-out or fast food.

Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the changes in personal attitudes and behaviour before and after negative serological test results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We conducted a survey questionnaire on 200 industry workers (69% males and 31% females) that have been previously tested negative. The survey examined participants' self-reported general attitudes towards COVID-19, sense of fear, as well as their behaviour related to protective measures before and after the testing. The participants perceived the disease as a severe health threat and acknowledged the protective measures as appropriate. They reported a high level of adherence to measures and low level of fear both before and after the testing. Although those indicators were statistically significantly reduced after the test (P < 0.004), they did not result in risk behaviour. Therefore, the serological tests are not an additional threat regarding the risk behaviour in an environment where protective measures are efficient. In contrast, they might contribute to reducing the fear in the society and working environment.","Ljubic, T.; Banovac, A.; Buljan, I.; Jerkovic, I.; Basic, Z.; Kruzic, I.; Kolic, A.; Kolombatovic, R.

However, the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients, and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal-domain (NTD) induced the open conformation of receptor binding domain (RBD) and thus enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2 and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis revealed that all the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the NTD. Structural analysis demonstrated that all the infectivity-enhancing antibodies bound to NTD in a similar manner. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected at high levels in severe patients. Moreover, we identified antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site in uninfected donors, albeit at a lower frequency. These findings demonstrate that not only neutralizing antibodies but also enhancing antibodies are produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Yafei; Soh, Wai Tuck; Kishikawa, Jun-ichi; Hirose, Mika; Nakayama, Emi E.; Li, Songling; Sasai, Miwa; Suzuki, Tatsuya; Tada, Asa; Arakawa, Akemi; Matsuoka, Sumiko; Akamatsu, Kanako; Matsuda, Makoto; Ono, Chikako; Torii, Shiho; Kishida, Kazuki; Jin, Hui; Nakai, Wataru; Arase, Noriko; Nakagawa, Atsushi; Matsumoto, Maki; Nakazaki, Yukoh; Shindo, Yasuhiro; Kohyama, Masako; Tomii, Keisuke; Ohmura, Koichiro; Ohshima, Shiro; Okamoto, Toru; Yamamoto, Masahiro; Nakagami, Hironori; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Kato, Takayuki; Okada, Masato; Standley, Daron M.; Shioda, Tatsuo; Arase, Hisashi",Cell,35,1

We started an investigation to identify the etiologic agent, find additional cases, develop and implement control measures. METHODS: We defined probable cases as students, teachers and other staffs in the school developed fever (T ≥ 37.5 °C) with cough or sore throat; or a diagnosis of pneumonia during May 1–June 31, 2018. Confirmed cases were probable cases with Mycoplasma pneumoniae detected in oropharyngeal (OP) swabs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We searched case by reviewing school absenteeism records and interviewing students, teachers and staff in this school. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic students. Two qPCR) assay, a duplex qPCR assay, and sequencing were performed to determine the pathogen, genotype and macrolide resistance at the gene level, respectively. RESULTS: From May 1st to June 31st, 2018, we identified 55 cases (36 probable and 19 confirmed), of whom 25 (45%) were hospitalized for complications. All cases were students, none of the teachers and other staffs in the school were with similar symptoms. The attack rate (AR) was 3.9% (55/1398) for all students. The cases were mainly male (58%), with an age range of 7–8 years (median: 7 years). 72% (18/25) of inpatients had radiograph findings consistent with pneumonia, and some cases were hospitalized for up to 4 weeks. Pathogen detection results indicated that Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumoniae) P1 type 1 was the causative agent in this outbreak, and the strain harbored one point mutation of A to G at position 2063. CONCLUSIONS: The infections by macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae are not always mild and pneumonia was common and M. pneumoniae could causes serious complications which require long-term hospitalization. In the future infectious disease prevention and control practice, M. pneumoniae should be paid more attention. It is necessary to establish and improve the pathogen and drug resistance surveillance system in order to prevent and control such mutated strains of M. pneumoniae from causing future outbreaks or epidemics in China.","Zhang, Wen-Zeng; Zhang, Song-Jian; Wang, Quan-Yi; Li, Yin-Dong; Jing, Hong-Bo; Hu, Guang-Yi; Wu, Dan",BMC Infect Dis,35,28

To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a longitudinal study to estimate the incidence of SARIs among children in rural Bangladesh. METHODS: During June through October 2010, we followed children aged <5 years in 67 villages to identify those with cough, difficulty breathing, age-specific tachypnea and/or danger signs in the community or admitted to the local hospital. A study physician collected clinical information and obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from all SARI cases and blood for bacterial culture from those hospitalized. We tested swabs for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, human metapneumoviruses, adenoviruses and human parainfluenza viruses 1–3 (HPIV) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We calculated virus-specific SARI incidence by dividing the number of new illnesses by the person-time each child contributed to the study. RESULTS: We followed 12,850 children for 279,029 person-weeks (pw) and identified 141 SARI cases; 76 (54%) at their homes and 65 (46%) at the hospital. RSV was associated with 7.9 SARI hospitalizations per 100,000 pw, HPIV3 2.2 hospitalizations/100,000 pw, and influenza 1.1 hospitalizations/100,000 pw. Among non-hospitalized SARI cases, RSV was associated with 10.8 illnesses/100,000 pw, HPIV3 1.8/100,000 pw, influenza 1.4/100,000 pw, and adenoviruses 0.4/100,000 pw. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses, particularly RSV, were commonly associated with SARI among children. It may be useful to explore the value of investing in prevention strategies, such as handwashing and respiratory hygiene, to reduce respiratory infections among young children in such settings.","Nasreen, Sharifa; Luby, Stephen P.; Brooks, W.

Questionnaire data suggest children’s sleep was impacted during the pandemic, yet device-based data (i.e. accelerometry) on this topic is lacking. The purpose of this study was to examine children’s sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. spring and summer 2020) compared to previous data collected from the same children during each of the two previous years (spring and summer 2018 and 2019). METHODS: 68 children (age = 9.9±1.2 years, 56% Black, 53% male) previously recruited for an observational cohort study wore a Fitbit Charge 2 on their wrist during the spring and summer from 2018-2020 (i.e. six 30-day measurement periods). We used multilevel mixed models to examine how children’s sleep patterns changed during the pandemic accounting for previous trajectory (i.e. 2018 to 2019). Models included age, sex, and race as covariates. RESULTS: Children had an average of 84 nights of sleep data across all six 30-day measurement periods. In the spring of the pandemic, children slept 24.6 minutes more (95%CI = 11.6, 37.5) compared to previous springs. During the pandemic summer, they slept 40.0 minutes more (95%CI = 24.6, 58.5) compared to previous summers. Sleep midpoint was 117.1 minutes later (95%CI = 103.6, 130.6) in the spring during the pandemic and 46.0 minutes later (95% CI = 26.9, 65.2) in the summer during the pandemic compared to previous years. Sleep efficiency improved slightly by 1.3% (95% CI = 0.7, 1.9) and 3.6% (95% CI = 2.7, 4.5) in spring and summer, respectively, during the pandemic compared to previous years. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, children slept longer after accounting for previous developmental trends. Notably, the shift in sleep timing during the pandemic was nearly two hours later in the spring compared to previous years, potentially due to the lack of structure usually provided by school. Later sleep timing is independently associated with poor health behaviors (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, screen time). Future studies should examine if these changes in sleep persist over time and have potential long-term effects on children’s health.

Most patients generated humoral responses against NP and spike protein-related antigens but with their distinct kinetics profiles. Combined detection of NP and ECD antigens as detecting antigen synergistically improved the sensitivity of the serological assay, compared to that of using NP or RBD as detection antigen. 80.7% of convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients revealed that the varying extents of neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2.

This study aims to identify factors that explain the behavioral intention of Wuhan City urban residents to wear masks. METHODS: A theoretical model was extended on UTAUT by incorporating the feature on residents having relevant knowledge and sufficient awareness on the pandemic. During early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, an online survey was conducted in Wuhan City and 728 valid samples were collected from 35 communities. Structural equations modeling and bootstrapping were applied. RESULTS: Sample data present acceptable reliability and validity. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and knowledge about COVID-19 have positive effects on behavioral intention. Facilitating condition, knowledge, and behavioral intention have significant effects on use behavior. Gender, age, education, income, and current marital status are significant moderators in the theoretical model. CONCLUSION: Having relevant knowledge on the pandemic, together with performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating condition, affects behavioral intention and usage behavior of Wuhan residents to wear masks at early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Impairment in patient screening and risk management plays a fundamental role on how governments and authorities are directing resources, planning reopening, as well as sanitary countermeasures, especially in regions where poverty is a major component in the equation. An efficient diagnostic method must be highly accurate, while having a cost-effective profile. We combined a machine learning-based algorithm with mass spectrometry to create an expeditious platform that discriminate COVID-19 in plasma samples within minutes, while also providing tools for risk assessment, to assist healthcare professionals in patient management and decision-making. A cross-sectional study enrolled 815 patients (442 COVID-19, 350 controls and 23 COVID-19 suspicious) from three Brazilian epicenters from April to July 2020. We were able to elect and identify 19 molecules related to the disease’s pathophysiology and several discriminating features to patient’s health-related outcomes. The method applied for COVID-19 diagnosis showed specificity >96% and sensitivity >83%, and specificity >80% and sensitivity >85% during risk assessment, both from blinded data. Our method introduced a new approach for COVID-19 screening, providing the indirect detection of infection through metabolites and contextualizing the findings with the disease’s pathophysiology. The pairwise analysis of biomarkers brought robustness to the model developed using machine learning algorithms, transforming this screening approach in a tool with great potential for real-world application.","Delafiori, Jeany; Navarro, Luiz Cláudio; Siciliano, Rinaldo Focaccia; de Melo, Gisely Cardoso; Busanello, Estela Natacha Brandt; Nicolau, José Carlos; Sales, Geovana Manzan; de Oliveira, Arthur Noin; Val, Fernando Fonseca Almeida; de Oliveira, Diogo Noin; Eguti, Adriana; dos Santos, Luiz Augusto; Dalçóquio, Talia Falcão; Bertolin, Adriadne Justi; Abreu-Netto, Rebeca Linhares; Salsoso, Rocio; Baía-da-Silva, Djane; Marcondes-Braga, Fabiana G; Sampaio, Vanderson Souza; Judice, Carla Cristina; Costa, Fabio Trindade Maranhão; Durán, Nelson; Perroud, Mauricio Wesley; Sabino, Ester Cerdeira; Lacerda, Marcus Vinicius Guimarães; Reis, Leonardo Oliveira; Fávaro, Wagner José; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo; Rocha, Anderson Rezende; Catharino, Rodrigo Ramos",Anal Chem,35,1

Methods: Real-world Covid-19 experience based on a retrospective cohort study Results: On the cohort of 31 patients treated by lopinavir/ritonavir for Covid-19, we observed very high lopinavir plasma concentrations, increased of 4.6-fold (IQR 2.9-6.4), with regards to average plasma concentrations in HIV treatment. All except two patients were above the upper limit of the concentration ranges of HIV treatment. In this cohort, about one over four to five patients prematurely stopped lopinavir/ritonavir therapy due to a moderate adverse drug reaction, mainly hepatic and gastrointestinal disorders. Conclusion: Patients with Covid-19 pneumonitis treated with lopinavir/ritonavir have plasma concentrations dramatically higher than expected. Owing to that high plasma concentration may be required for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, it appears that lopinavir dosage should not be reduced in the absence of adverse effect. About 80% of the patients well tolerated lopinavir/ritonavir therapy under these plasma concentrations. However, cautious is necessary as drug repurposing can be associated with a new drug safety profile.","Chouchana, L.; Boujaafar, S.; Gana, I.; Preta, L.-H.; Regard, L.; Legendre, P.; Azoulay, C.; CanouiÌ, E.; Zerbit, J.; Carlier, N.; Terrier, B.; Kerneis, S.; Batista, R.; Treluyer, J.-M.; Zheng, Y.; Benaboud, S.",,35,16

Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease may differ, most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients may develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or mechanical ventilatory support. In this study, we aimed to identify validity of our modified scoring system for foreseeing the approach to the COVID-19 patient and the disease, the treatment plan, the severity of morbidity and even the risk of mortality from the clinician's point of view. In this single center study, we examined the patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between 01/04/2020 and 01/06/2020, of the 228 patients who were between 20 and 90 years of age, and whose polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests of nasal and pharyngeal swab samples were positive. We evaulated 228 (92 male and 136 female) PCR (+) patients. Univariate analysis showed that advanced age (p < 0.001), hemoglobin (p < 0.001), troponin-I (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), fibrinogen (p < 0.001), HT (p = 0.01), CAD (p = 0.001), DM (p < 0.001), history of malignancy (p = 0.008), along with m-sPESI scores (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in patients that needed intensive care due to COVID-19 infection. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, only the m-sPESI score higher than ≥ 2 was found to be highly significant in terms of indicating the need for ICU admission (AUC 0.948; 84.6% sensitivity and 94.6% specificity) (p < 0.001). With an increasing number of hospitalized patients, healthcare providers are confronting a deluge of lab results in the process of caring for COVID-19 patients. It is imperative to identify risk factors for mortality and morbidity development. The modified sPESI scoring system, which we put forward, is successful in predicting the course of the disease at the presentation of the patient with COVID-19 disease and predicting the need for intensive care with high specificity and sensitivity, can detect the need for intensive care with high specificity and sensitivity.","As, Ahmet Kagan; Erdolu, Burak; Duman, Burak; Yazgan, Elif; Eris, Cuneyt; Aydin, Ufuk; Ata, Yusuf; Sengoren Dikis, Ozlem; Türk, Tamer",J Thromb Thrombolysis,35,3

Despite its worldwide distribution, very little information is known about BNoV in Africa. In this study, BNoV was detected in 27.6% (8/29) of tested fecal materials, collected from sporadic cases of diarrheic calves, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and primers that target RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene. Additionally, one primer pair was designed to flank the BNoV-VP2 (small capsid protein) gene for molecular analysis. Study VP2 sequences were phylogenetically-related to BNoV-GIII.2 (Newbury2-like) genotype, which is highly prevalent all over the world. However, they were separated within the cluster and one strain (41FR) grouped with recombinant GIII.P1/GIII.2 strains. Compared to reference VP2 sequences, 14 amino acid substitution mutations were found to be unique to our strains. The study confirms that BNoV is currently circulating among diarrheic calves of Egypt and also characterizes its ORF3 (VP2) genetically. The status of BNoV should be continuously evaluated in Egypt for effective prevention and control.","Mohamed, Fakry F.; Ktob, Gamelat K.F.; Ismaeil, Mohamed E.A.; Ali, Ahmed A.H.; Goyal, Sagar M.",Int J Vet Sci Med,35,29

Methods: Subjects were 44 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 infection being treated for schizophrenia in a psychiatric ward. Eating function was assessed using the Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) before and after infection. We also evaluated age, comorbidities, COVID-19 hospital stay, obesity index, weight loss rate, and chlorpromazine equivalent. Results: Subjects had a mean age of 68.86 years. Pre-infection, 20 subjects had a FILS score of 7–9 (presence of eating/swallowing disorder) and 24 subjects had a score of 10 (normal). Eating function after infection resolution showed decreasing FILS score compared to that before infection in 14 subjects (74.14 years). Six subjects (79.3 years) transitioned from oral feeding to parenteral feeding. A ≥ 10% weight loss during infection treatment was significantly associated with decreased eating function and a transition to parenteral feeding. Chlorpromazine equivalents, comorbidities, and number of days of hospitalization showed no associations with decreased eating function. Conclusions: Preventing malnutrition during treatment for COVID-19 infection is important for improving post-infection life prognosis and maintaining quality of life (QOL).","Kikutani, Takeshi; Ichikawa, Yoko; Kitazume, Eri; Mizukoshi, Arato; Tohara, Takashi; Takahashi, Noriaki; Tamura, Fumiyo; Matsutani, Manami; Onishi, Junko; Makino, Eiichiro",Nutrients,35,20

A group of 150 patients with COVID-19, hospitalized in our center, was analyzed. Patients with the known liver comorbidities were excluded (n = 15). Clinical features and laboratory parameters were compared between patients with normal and abnormal aminotransferase values. Liver injury expressed as any alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation was noted in 45.6% of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. The frequencies of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation were lower. It was noted that elevated ALT/AST unfavorably affected other parameters related to liver function such as albumin level; gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP); and partly, ALP activity and influenced inflammation-related parameters. The most probable cause of mild hepatitis during COVID-19 was anoxia and immune-mediated damage due to the inflammatory response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. A direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 on hepatocytes, albeit less probable, can be considered as well.

Although many argue over the potential merits of antibody testing as an immunity passport to allow the economy to restart, there are other implications that stand at the heart of the bioethical debate that are often overlooked. Particularly with COVID-19, there are many uncertainties and the discourse alone of antibodies presumes misinformation that may outweigh the epidemiological benefits of antibody testing. Although this paper does not seek to eliminate antibody testing, it does highlight the need for appropriate counselling both on a personal level with each patient but on a more global level.

This includes inflammatory bowel disease, viral and non-viral associated intestinal lymphomas and immunodeficiency associated syndromes. Morphologic and phenotypic characterization of the normal small intestinal diffuse MALT in 22 SPF cats was performed using flow cytometry and cytology on isolated intestinal leukocytes from the intra-epithelial and lamina proprial compartments, as well as immunohistology on tissues from the feline duodenum, jejunum and ileum. The intra-epithelial compartment (IEC) was dominated by lymphocytes (>85%) which frequently contained intracytoplasmic granules. The most striking findings in the IEC were the elevated percentages of CD8α+ lymphocytes (40%), presumed to express CD8αα chains, and CD4−/CD8− (double negative) lymphocytes (44%), and the consistent presence of a minor subpopulation of CD3+/CD11d+ IELs (6%). Small percentages of CD4+ lymphocytes (10%) were observed such that the IEL CD4:CD8 ratio (0.25) was low. The LPC also contained a majority of T cells and few plasma cells. However, this compartment had reduced percentages of CD8α+ lymphocytes (28%) and increased percentages of CD4+ lymphocytes (27%) relative to the IEC. However, the LPL CD4:CD8 ratio (1.0) remained low compared with the ratio in peripheral blood. In feline MALT, MHC class II expression was lower than in other peripheral lymphoid compartments. The results of this study provide important reference values for future investigations involving feline intestinal lymphocytes and demonstrates that the leukocyte distribution and phenotypic characteristics of the feline diffuse MALT appear largely similar to the murine, rat and human counterparts.","Roccabianca, P.; Woo, J.C.; Moore, P.F.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,35,20

However, some experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in influenza virus infections is associated with excessive host response including a cell-mediated immune reaction. During the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus infections in Korea, we experienced a dramatic effect of immune-modulators (corticosteroids) on the patients with severe pneumonia who had significant respiratory distress at presentation and those who showed rapidly progressive pneumonia during oseltamivir treatment. We also found that the pneumonia patients treated with corticosteroids showed the lowest lymphocyte differential and that the severity of pneumonia was associated with the lymphocyte count at presentation. From our findings and previous experimental and clinical studies, we postulated that hyperactive immune cells (T cells) may be involved in the acute lung injury of influenza virus infections, using a hypothesis of ‘protein homeostasis system’; the inducers of the cell-mediated immune response are initially produced at the primary immune sites by the innate immune system. These substances reach the lung cells, the main target organ, via the systemic circulation, and possibly the cells of other organs, including myocytes or central nerve system cells, leading to extrapulmonary symptoms (e.g., myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, and encephalopathy). To control these substances that may be possibly toxic to host cells, the adaptive immune reaction may be operated by immune cells, mainly lymphocytes. Hyperimmune reaction of immune cells produces higher levels of cytokines which may be associated with acute lung injury, and may be controlled by early use of immune-modulators. Early initiation and proper dosage of immune-modulators with antiviral agents for severe pneumonia patients may reduce morbidity and prevent progressive fatal pneumonia.","Lee, Kyung-Yil; Rhim, Jung-Woo; Kang, Jin-Han",Med Hypotheses,35,20

They are key sensors for a number of infectious agents, some of which are oncogenic, and they launch an immune response against them, normally promoting their eradication. Inherited variations in genes encoding these receptors and proteins and their signaling pathways may affect their function, possibly modulating cancer risk and features of cancer progression. There are numerous studies investigating the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms within or near genes encoding Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors, cancer risk, and features of cancer progression. However, there is an almost total absence of articles analyzing the correlation between polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors and cancer risk or progression. Nevertheless, there is some evidence supporting the hypothesis that inherited C-type lectin receptor and RIG-I-like receptor variants can be associated with increased cancer risk. Certain C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns of potentially oncogenic infectious agents, and certain polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors may have functional consequences at the molecular level that can lead to association of such single nucleotide polymorphisms with risk or progression of some diseases that may modulate cancer risk, so these gene polymorphisms may affect cancer risk indirectly. Polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors thereby may be correlated with a risk of lung, oral, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, and liver cancer, as well as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, glioblastoma, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma.

We reviewed discharge criteria for hospitalised COVID-19 patients from ten countries with the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases as of 26th July 2020. Five countries (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Chile and Iran) had no discharge criteria; the remaining five (United States of America, India, Russia, South Africa and the United Kingdom) had discharge guidelines with large inter-country variability. India and Russia recommend discharge for a clinically recovered patient with two negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests 24 hours apart; the USA offers either a symptom based strategy—clinical recovery and ten days after symptom onset, or the same test-based strategy. The UK suggests that patients can be discharged when patients have clinically recovered; South Africa recommends discharge 14 days after symptom onset if clinically stable. We recommend a unified, simpler discharge criteria, based on current studies which suggest that most SARS-CoV-2 loses its infectivity by 10 days post-symptom onset. In asymptomatic cases, this can be taken as 10 days after the first positive PCR result. Additional days of isolation beyond this should be left to the discretion of individual clinician. This represents a practical compromise between unnecessarily prolonged admissions and returning highly infectious patients back to their care facilities, and is of particular importance in older patients discharged to LTCFs, residents of which may be at greatest risk of transmission and worse clinical outcomes.","Sze, Shirley; Pan, Daniel; Williams, Caroline M L; Barker, Joseph; Minhas, Jatinder S; Miller, Chris; Tang, Julian W; Squire, Iain B; Pareek, Manish",Age Ageing,35,20

Several studies have investigated the use of plant extracts in the prevention and control of PRRS outbreaks. Thai medicinal plants may be useful for treating PRRSV infection in pigs. Therefore, we investigated the in vitro anti-PRRSV and antioxidant properties of seven Thai medicinal plants: Caesalpinia sappan Linn., Garcinia mangostana Linn., Houttuynia cordata, Perilla frutescens, Clinacanthus nutans, Phyllanthus emblica, and Tiliacora triandra. RESULTS: Using antiviral screening, we observed that T. triandra extract strongly inhibited PRRSV infectivity in MARC-145 cells [virus titer 3.5 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/ml (log10)] at 24 h post-infection, whereas C. sappan extract strongly inhibited PRRSV replication [virus titer 2.5 TCID(50)/ml (log10)] at 72 h post-infection. C. sappan extract had the highest total phenolic content [220.52 mM gallic acid equivalent/g] and lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration [1.17 mg/ml in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2.58 mg/ml in 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazo-line-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt]. CONCLUSION: T. triandra extract could inhibit PRRSV infectivity, whereas C. sappan extract was the most effective in inhibiting PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. This study elucidates the antiviral activities of Thai medicinal plant extracts in vivo. The results promise that Thai medicinal plant extracts, particularly T. triandra and C. sappan extracts, can be developed into pharmaceutical drugs for the prevention of PRRS in pigs.","Arjin, Chaiwat; Pringproa, Kidsadagon; Hongsibsong, Surat; Ruksiriwanich, Warintorn; Seel-audom, Mintra; Mekchay, Supamit; Sringarm, Korawan",BMC Vet Res,35,24

As an alternative, most of the prior studies have focused on Chest CT images and Chest X-Ray images using deep learning algorithms. However, these two approaches cannot always be used for patients’ screening due to the radiation doses, high costs, and the low number of available devices. Hence, there is a need for a less expensive and faster diagnostic model to identify the positive and negative cases of COVID-19. Therefore, this study develops six predictive models for COVID-19 diagnosis using six different classifiers (i.e., BayesNet, Logistic, IBk, CR, PART, and J48) based on 14 clinical features. This study retrospected 114 cases from the Taizhou hospital of Zhejiang Province in China. The results showed that the CR meta-classifier is the most accurate classifier for predicting the positive and negative COVID-19 cases with an accuracy of 84.21%. The results could help in the early diagnosis of COVID-19, specifically when the RT-PCR kits are not sufficient for testing the infection and assist countries, specifically the developing ones that suffer from the shortage of RT-PCR tests and specialized laboratories.","Arpaci, Ibrahim; Huang, Shigao; Al-Emran, Mostafa; Al-Kabi, Mohammed N.; Peng, Minfei",Multimed Tools Appl,35,20

However, the optimal treatment is still a matter of debate. Even though nonoperative treatment is commonly considered the gold standard, advantages have been described using operative stabilization. This systematic review aims to compare operative and nonoperative treatment in adult patients with humeral shaft fractures. METHOD: We used the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL on October 1, 2018, searching for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. Two reviewers screened the studies using Covidence, followed by systematic data extraction. The primary outcome was defined as posttreatment complications such as nonunion, radial nerve palsy, malunion, and infections. The secondary outcomes were functional scores and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). To assess study quality, the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions and the Cochrane risk of bias tool were used. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included: 1 RCT, 1 prospective cohort, and 10 retrospective cohorts with a total of 1406 patients, of whom 835 were treated operatively and 571 nonoperatively. Mean age ranged from 35 to 64, and 54% of the patients were male. The cohort studies had, in general, moderate bias, whereas the RCT had a low bias. There were statistically significant fewer nonunions in the operative treated group with a risk ratio of 0.49 (0.35-0.67), yielding a number needed to treat = 12. There were more deep infections in the operative group with a risk ratio of 2.76 (1.01-7.53) but otherwise no statistical differences concerning malunion or nerve damage. Only 1 study included PROM data. CONCLUSION: There were fewer nonunions in the operative group but more deep infections. Because of the lack of studies reporting PROMs, the potential positive effect of operative therapy in early aftercare could not be evaluated. Therefore, PROMs should be mandatory in future comparative studies.","Lode, Ingunn; Nordviste, Vegard; Erichsen, Julie Ladeby; Schmal, Hagen; Viberg, Bjarke",J Shoulder Elbow Surg,35,20

The objective of this study is to evaluate their effectiveness in the disinfection of pathogens in the air in hospital blood sampling rooms. METHODS: Samples were taken from the air before and after disinfection with PX-UV and non-thermal atmospheric plasma. We counted bacterial colonies and identified the types of bacteria. RESULTS: Non-thermal plasma treatment significantly reduced bacterial counts in the air, the median reduced from 1 before treatment to zero afterwards (p = 0.03). PX-UV treatment also significantly reduced bacterial counts in the air (p = 0.01), the median reduced from 1.5 before treatment to zero afterwards. Pathogens identified in the current study include nosocomial bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and yeast.

Usually, such aggregation occurs only once, resulting in ‘single-aggregation disease maps’ whose representation of the underlying data depends on the chosen set of aggregation units. This dependence is described by the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). Despite an extensive literature, in practice, the MAUP is rarely acknowledged, including in disease mapping. Further, despite single-aggregation disease maps being widely relied upon to guide distribution of healthcare resources, potential inefficiencies arising due to the impact of the MAUP on such maps have not previously been investigated. RESULTS: We introduce the overlay aggregation method (OAM) for disease mapping. This method avoids dependence on any single set of aggregate-level mapping units through incorporating information from many different sets. We characterise OAM as a novel smoothing technique and show how its use results in potentially dramatic improvements in resource allocation efficiency over single-aggregation maps. We demonstrate these findings in a simulation context and through applying OAM to a real-world dataset: ischaemic stroke hospital admissions in Perth, Western Australia, in 2016. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing, widespread lack of acknowledgement of the MAUP in disease mapping suggests that unawareness of its impact is extensive or that impact is underestimated. Routine implementation of OAM can help avoid resource allocation inefficiencies associated with this phenomenon. Our findings have immediate worldwide implications wherever single-aggregation disease maps are used to guide health policy planning and service delivery.","Tuson, Matthew; Yap, Matthew; Kok, Mei Ruu; Boruff, Bryan; Murray, Kevin; Vickery, Alistair; Turlach, Berwin A.; Whyatt, David",Int J Health Geogr,35,1

Clinical algorithms to identify children who are likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment remain suboptimal. Biomarkers that accurately identify serious bacterial infection (SBI) could improve diagnosis and clinical management. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) and neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) are neutrophil-derived biomarkers associated with bacterial infection. Methods We evaluated LCN2 and MMP-8 as candidate biomarkers in 40 healthy controls and 151 febrile children categorised confirmed SBI, probable SBI, or viral infection. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 and MMP-8 to predict SBI was estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and compared to the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP). Results Plasma LCN2 and MMP-8 concentration were predictive of SBI. The AUROC (95% CI) for LCN2, MMP8 and CRP to predict SBI was 0.88 (0.82-0.94); 0.80 (0.72-0.87) and 0.89 (0.84-0.94), respectively. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 in combination with CRP was significantly superior to either marker alone: AUROC 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96). Conclusion LCN2 is a sensitive and specific predictor of SBI in children which could be used to improve clinical management and antimicrobial stewardship. LCN2 should be further evaluated in prospective clinical studies.","Herberg, Jethro; Huang, Honglei; Thezenas, Marie L.; Janes, Victoria; Carter, Michael; Gormley, Stuart; Hamilton, Melisa S.; Kessler, Benedikt; Levin, Michael; Casals-Pascual, Climent",bioRxiv,35,30

Few LMICs changed their management framework, taking steps like triaging patients, prioritizing care, therapeutic spacing, and a shift to telehealth. SUMMARY: Modified protocols where available have served LMICs well for resource allocation; however, effectiveness of these cannot be determined due to lack of outcomes reporting. This pandemic has underscored the importance of flexibility, prompt intervention, good communication, and reassessment to address unexpected healthcare challenges and has been a learning lesson to help tailor guidelines early in the future.","Shahzad, Hania; Mubarik, Fatima; Sattar, Abida K.",Curr Breast Cancer Rep,35,1

Thus, concepts focused on positive occupational health, such as Job Crafting or psychological empowerment (PE), have been examined as a tool to prevent mental health problems at work. In this work, we intended to adapt and validate the 7-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale in health workers (N = 194). The interpretation of the measurement model indicates adequate values of internal consistency reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity. The overall goodness of fit of the model was also adequate. The structural model indicates that the implementation of job crafting measures in health services leads to workers’ greater PE. High levels of anxiety and depression prevent health professionals from psychologically detaching from work. In turn, PE can reduce the emotional disorders caused by the fear of COVID-19.","Llorente-Alonso, Marta; García-Ael, Cristina; Topa, Gabriela; Sanz-Muñoz, María Luisa; Muñoz-Alcalde, Irene; Cortés-Abejer, Beatriz",J Clin Med,35,16

Vaccines are in scare supply, however. Current recommendations in the United States are that subjects with a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease should receive the full vaccine regimen. This is despite the fact that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection infection confers some degree of protection and that the immune response to the vaccine is not well studied. Methods: The present study compared the time course and magnitude of the humoral immune response to an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2) in subjects with prior infection/COVID-19 disease (n=24) and those without prior infection (n=25). Serum anti-Spike RBD antibody and serum neutralizing activity were assessed longitudinally prior to and at 2-week intervals for 56 days post first dose of vaccine. Subjects received the standard Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine regimen i.e., two doses of 30 mcg, 3 weeks apart. Findings: The cohort with prior COVID-19 achieved robust increases in anti-Spike IgG antibody and serum neutralizing activity compared to the SARS-CoV-2 naive cohort at day 14 post vaccine. Thereafter, the COVID-19 cohort showed relatively little further increase in humoral immunity even after the second dose such that anti-Spike IgG and neutralizing activity were similar in the 2 groups from day 28 through day 56. Conclusions: In contrast to the responses of SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects in whom a 2 dose regimen appears to be required to achieve robust immune protection, subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit immune memory and have a robust response to the first dose of an mRNA vaccine. They may require only a single dose of vaccine.","Kelsen, S. G.; Braverman, A.; Patel, P.; Aksoy, M. O.; Hayman, J.; Rajput, C.; Ruggieri, M.; Gentile, N.",,35,1

Combining transcriptomics and proteomics with large-scale gene knockdown experiments will enable the identification of novel antiviral targets. Second, massive parallel assay systems, such as DNA microarrays, which define the post-genomic era, will facilitate viral diagnostics. Third, the combination of genetics with genomics will enable the analysis of viral mutants and strains on an unprecedented scale.

We identified two variable regions, one within the 1a and one within the S gene, whereas the 1b and N genes were most conserved. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HCoV-NL63 genomes have a mosaic structure with multiple recombination sites. Additionally, employing three different algorithms, we assessed the evolutionary rate for the S gene of group Ib coronaviruses to be ∼ 3 × 10(− 4) substitutions per site per year. Using this evolutionary rate we determined that HCoV-NL63 diverged in the 11th century from its closest relative HCoV-229E.","Pyrc, Krzysztof; Dijkman, Ronald; Deng, Lea; Jebbink, Maarten F.; Ross, Howard A.; Berkhout, Ben; van der Hoek, Lia",J Mol Biol,35,28

In this paper, we compare the performance of 16 available deep learning algorithms to help identify COVID19. We utilize an already existing diagnostic technology (X-ray) and an already existing neural network (ResNet-50) to diagnose COVID-19. Our approach eliminates the extra time and resources needed to develop new technology and associated algorithm, thus aiding the front-line in the race against the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that ResNet-50 is the optimal pretrained neural network for the detection of COVID-19, using three different cross-validation ratios, based on training time, accuracy, and network size. We also present a custom visualization of the results that can be used to highlight important visual biomarkers of the disease and disease progression.","Elgendi, M.; Fletcher, R.; Howard, N.; Menon, C.; Ward, R.",,35,28

A multitude of scientific publications have also pointed to the importance of food and nutrition in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The present perspective critically addresses the question of what food science can actually contribute in this context. Animal studies suggest that micronutrients, food bioactives or functional foods may carry the potential to augment viral defense. However, the specific roles of food components in viral infectious diseases in humans remain unclear. Rigorous research assessing the efficacy of food compounds in counteracting infections would require long-term randomized controlled trials in large samples. While no foods, single nutrients or dietary supplements are capable of preventing infection with COVID-19, a balanced diet containing sufficient amounts of macronutrients and diverse micronutrients is a prerequisite of an optimally functioning immune system. Highenergy diets and obesity are major risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19. Therefore, population-wide body weight control and weight reduction in overweight people are important preventive measures. Diet may play a beneficial role in maintaining a healthy body weight and preventing non-communicable conditions.","Lange, Klaus W.",,35,26

OBJECTIVE: To compare COVID-19 trends among people with and without IDD, overall and stratified by age. METHODS: Data from the TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network platform was used to identify COVID-19 patients. Analysis focused on trends in comorbidities, number of cases, number of deaths, and case-fatality rate among patients with and without IDD who had a positive diagnosis for COVID-19 through May 14, 2020. RESULTS: People with IDD had higher prevalence of specific comorbidities associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Distinct age-related differences in COVID-19 trends were present among those with IDD, with a higher concentration of COVID-19 cases at younger ages. In addition, while the overall case-fatality rate was similar for those with IDD (5.1%) and without IDD (5.4%), these rates differed by age: ages <17 – IDD 1.6%, without IDD <.01%; ages 18-74 – IDD 4.5%, without IDD 2.7%; ages >75– IDD 21.1%, without IDD, 20.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Though of concern for all individuals, COVID-19 appears to present a greater risk to people with IDD, especially at younger ages. Future research should seek to document COVID-19 trends among people with IDD, with particular attention to age related trends.","Turk, Margaret A.; Landes, Scott D.; Formica, Margaret K.; Goss, Katherine D.",Disabil Health J,35,1

Since most urological conditions are treated non-urgently, a major result of the lockdown may be a cumulating treatment backlog in elective urological surgery. Indeed, the predicted global urological surgery backlog has been estimated to be 2.5 million procedures.","Uimonen, Mikko; Kuitunen, Ilari; Seikkula, Heikki; Mattila, Ville M.; Ponkilainen, Ville",BJU Int,35,11

There are two FCoV serotypes. Both type I and II FCoV can replicate in Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf)-4 cells, but the replicability of type I FCoV in feline cell lines is lower than that of type II FCoV, the reason for which is unclear. Inhibition of IFNβ production by non-structural and structural proteins, excluding spike protein has been reported in many coronavirus infections. In this study, we investigated whether IFNβ is involved in the difference in replicability in feline cell lines between types I and II FCoV. When fcwf-4 cells were infected with FCoV, the virus titer of type II FCoV in the culture supernatant was higher than that of type I FIPV. When the IFNβ expression level in FCoV-infected fcwf-4 cells was semi-quantitatively analyzed, infection with type I FIPV, excluding type I FIPV UCD-1, highly induced IFNβ expression. In contrast, induction of IFNβ by type II FCoV infection was significantly lower than that by type I FIPV. In addition, when fcwf-4 cells were adsorbed by FIPV and then stimulated with Poly(I:C), type II FCoV infection inhibited Poly(I:C)-induced IFNβ gene expression. Also, the proliferation of type I FIPV was enhanced by a IFN inhibitor. These findings clarified that, unlike type I FIPV, type II FCoV strongly inhibits IFNβ expression in infected cells. It was also suggested that the IFNβ-inducing ability is different among type I FIPV strains.","Doki, Tomoyoshi; Yabe, Midori; Takano, Tomomi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu",Res Vet Sci,35,29

In February 2020, the World Health Organization acronymed the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19, for coronavirus disease 2019. The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, which has been detected in at least 103 countries, has reached 1,970,225 worldwide as of April 14, 2020 with 124,544 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sitammagari et al. (2020) [1]. Many cases of COVID-19 resolve quickly. However, the disease, which, like other respiratory pathogens that cause common cold symptoms is believed to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. Infection with COVID-19 can also lead to significant morbidity and death; this is particularly the case for cancer patients. Moreover, because the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are easily misattributed to the sequelae of cancer itself, such as pulmonary embolism, or its treatment, such as nausea and diarrhea, diagnosis may be delayed or missed. Potential COVID-19 rule out criteria, based on the Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism, another protean disease entity, are provided as a decision-making aid. This review summarizes the current understanding of the transmission, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, pathogenesis, rationale to treat the cancer or not, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 with an emphasis on implications in cancer.","Larson, Christopher; Oronsky, Bryan; Goyal, Sharad; Ray, Carolyn; Hedjran, Farah; Hammond, Terese C.; Kesari, Santosh; Caroen, Scott; Lybeck, Michelle; Dobalian, Vaughn E.; Oronsky, Arnold; Reid, Tony",Biochim Biophys Acta Rev Cancer,35,16

They seek to express their individuality even when receiving medical care. It is a part of modern medical practice and respect for patient autonomy to show respect for different values. We give an account of what it means to respect different values and challenging patients in medical practice. Challenging choices are often choices which are perceived by many to be either irrational or against a person's interests, such as engaging in harmful or excessively risky activities. When the medical profession is involved in such choices, the basic medical principle of acting in a person's best interests is challenged. Often doctors refuse to respect controversial choices on paternalistic grounds. We should all respect and facilitate the controversial choices of competent individuals, subject to resource limitations, our own and others well-being and autonomy, and the public interest. But more importantly, sometimes such choices make for a better, more autonomous life. Sometimes, such choices reflect considerations of global well-being or altruism, or idiosyncratic attitudes to risk. Sometimes, they reflect unusual values. However, in some other cases, controversial choices are irrational and are not expressions of our autonomy. Doctors should assist patients to make rational if individual choices. The patient also bears the responsibility for bringing his beliefs to the attention of the clinician.","Ward, Michael; Savulescu, Julian",Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol,35,1

COVID-19 is predominantly defined by respiratory symptoms, but cardiac complications including arrhythmias, heart failure, and viral myocarditis are also prevalent. Although the systemic ischemic and inflammatory responses caused by COVID-19 can detrimentally affect cardiac function, the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human cardiomyocytes is not well-understood. We used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as a model system to examine the mechanisms of cardiomyocyte-specific infection by SARS-CoV-2. Microscopy and immunofluorescence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can enter and replicate within hiPSC-CMs, localizing at perinuclear locations within the cytoplasm. Viral cytopathic effect induced hiPSC-CM apoptosis and cessation of beating after 72 hours of infection. These studies show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect hiPSC-CMs in vitro, establishing a model for elucidating the mechanisms of infection and potentially a cardiac-specific antiviral drug screening platform.","Sharma, Arun; Garcia, Gustavo; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja; Svendsen, Clive N.",bioRxiv,35,16

In recent decades, the growing interest in mitochondria research has revealed that these multifunctional organelles are more than just the cell powerhouses, playing many other key roles as signaling platforms that regulate cell metabolism, proliferation, death and immunological response. As key regulators, mitochondria, when dysfunctional, are involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of metabolic, neurodegenerative, immune and neoplastic disorders. Far more recently, mitochondria attracted renewed attention from the scientific community for their ability of intercellular translocation that can involve whole mitochondria, mitochondrial genome or other mitochondrial components. The intercellular transport of mitochondria, defined as horizontal mitochondrial transfer, can occur in mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo, and in physiological and pathological conditions. Mitochondrial transfer can provide an exogenous mitochondrial source, replenishing dysfunctional mitochondria, thereby improving mitochondrial faults or, as in in the case of tumor cells, changing their functional skills and response to chemotherapy. In this review, we will provide an overview of the state of the art of the up-to-date knowledge on intercellular trafficking of mitochondria by discussing its biological relevance, mode and mechanisms underlying the process and its involvement in different pathophysiological contexts, highlighting its therapeutic potential for diseases with mitochondrial dysfunction primarily involved in their pathogenesis.","Valenti, Daniela; Vacca, Rosa Anna; Moro, Loredana; Atlante, Anna",Int J Mol Sci,35,20

The paper unpacks urban poverty in light of the corona virus. The emergence of the COVID-19 and the lack of any vaccines requires physical distancing as preventative measures to contain and reduce the spread of the virus. Governments across the world, including in Anglophone Sub Saharan Africa have implemented lockdown measures. The COVID-19 pandemic is happening within settlements where the majority of the population lives from hand to mouth. In Anglophone sub-Saharan Africa because of urbanisation and increased urban poverty, COVID-19 scourge has had a huge impact on the urban poor. The COVID-19 is likely to devastate economies and the community. For rapidly growing, densely populated and poorly planned settlements, the situation is tragic for these inhabitants. Nation states lockdown and social and physical distancing in response to the pandemic have escalated their misery. The paper adopts a critical review of literature anchored in case study analysis, document analysis and scanning from reports. Results point to redefining the way humanity has related, functioned and conceptualised realities. There is need to go beyond prevention from infection as majority of urban dwellers are in the informal sector or unemployed. For the urban poor, strategies for social distancing may not be possible or effective. People are being asked to make choices between being hungry and risk of getting infected.

To define key cell types that require type I IFN signaling to orchestrate immunity against West Nile virus (WNV), we infected mice with conditional deletions of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) gene. Deletion of the Ifnar gene in subsets of myeloid cells resulted in uncontrolled WNV replication, vasoactive cytokine production, sepsis, organ damage, and death that were remarkably similar to infection of Ifnar (−/−) mice completely lacking type I IFN signaling. In Mavs(−/−)×Ifnar(−/−) myeloid cells and mice lacking both Ifnar and the RIG-I-like receptor adaptor gene Mavs, cytokine production was muted despite high levels of WNV infection. Thus, in myeloid cells, viral infection triggers signaling through MAVS to induce proinflammatory cytokines that can result in sepsis and organ damage. Viral pathogenesis was caused in part by massive complement activation, as liver damage was minimized in animals lacking complement components C3 or factor B or treated with neutralizing anti-C5 antibodies. Disease in Ifnar (−/−) and CD11c Cre(+) Ifnar (f/f) mice also was facilitated by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, as blocking antibodies diminished complement activation and prolonged survival without altering viral burden. Collectively, our findings establish the dominant role of type I IFN signaling in myeloid cells in restricting virus infection and controlling pathological inflammation and tissue injury.","Pinto, Amelia K.; Ramos, Hilario J.; Wu, Xiaobo; Aggarwal, Shilpa; Shrestha, Bimmi; Gorman, Matthew; Kim, Kristin Y.; Suthar, Mehul S.; Atkinson, John P.; Gale Jr, Michael; Diamond, Michael S.",PLoS Pathog,35,26

The present research recruited 5,115 participants from the general public across 32 provinces and autonomous regions in China in an online survey study, about 20 days after the lockdown of the epicenter (Wuhan), to investigate the relationship between the length of the quarantine and negative affect (including depression and anxiety), as well as the mediating roles of negative cognition (including worry and anticipation), and the moderating roles of dispositional optimism, tolerance of uncertainty, social support, and healthy behavior. The results showed that: (1) Worry and anticipation mediated the relationship between quarantine length and depression and anxiety; (2) Dispositional optimism moderated the path coefficients of quarantine length to worry, worry to anxiety, and anticipation to depression; (3) Tolerance of uncertainty moderated the path coefficient of worry to anxiety; (4) Social support moderated the path coefficient of anticipation to anxiety. In conclusion, during quarantine, dispositional optimism, uncertainty tolerance, and social support can buffer the direct or indirect effects of quarantine length on depression and anxiety. These findings could have profound implications on the societal responses to COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Hou, Lulu; Long, Fangfang; Meng, Yao; Cheng, Xiaorong; Zhang, Weiwei; Zhou, Renlai",Front Psychol,35,8

We evaluated the anti-Spike protein response in healthcare workers after a complete vaccination scheme of 2 doses spaced by 3 weeks. METHODS: Immunoglobulin class G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD were detected by means of a chemiluminescence immunoassay for quantitative IgG antibodies using Maglumi SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD IgG kit during the 3rd week after vaccination completion. RESULTS: IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were detected in 99.88% of 1765 healthcare workers 3 weeks after 2nd dose of BNT162b2. Higher median IgG values were observed in younger subjects (807 UA/mL in under 30 vs 429 UA/mL in over 60; p < 0.001) and those with previous COVID-19 (1284 vs 574 UA/mL; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: BNT162b2 is effective in inducing anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies even in real-life setting. The higher antibody title observed in workers with a previous documented SARS CoV2 infection confirms the possibility to carry out only one dose of BNT162b2 in a context of vaccines shortage.","Mariani, Marcello; Acquila, Maura; Tripodi, Gino; Spiazzi, Raffaele; Castagnola, Elio",J Infect Public Health,35,22

The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, combined with a lack of population immunity and prevalence of severe clinical outcomes, urges the rapid development of effective therapeutic countermeasures. Here, we report the generation of synthetic nanobodies, known as sybodies, against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. In an expeditious process taking only twelve working days, sybodies were selected entirely in vitro from three large combinatorial libraries, using ribosome and phage display. We obtained six strongly enriched sybody pools against the isolated RBD and identified 63 unique anti-RBD sybodies which also interact in the context of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain. Among the selected sybodies, six were found to bind to the viral spike with double-digit nanomolar affinity, and five of these also showed substantial inhibition of RBD interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Additionally, we identified a pair of anti-RBD sybodies that can simultaneously bind to the RBD. It is anticipated that compact binders such as these sybodies could feasibly be developed into an inhalable drug that can be used as a convenient prophylaxis against COVID-19. Moreover, generation of polyvalent antivirals, via fusion of anti-RBD sybodies to additional small binders recognizing secondary epitopes, could enhance the therapeutic potential and guard against escape mutants. We present full sequence information and detailed protocols for the identified sybodies, as a freely accessible resource.","Walter, Justin D.; Hutter, Cedric A.J.; Zimmermann, Iwan; Wyss, Marianne; Earp, Jennifer; Egloff, Pascal; Sorgenfrei, Michèle; Hürlimann, Lea M.; Gonda, Imre; Meier, Gianmarco; Remm, Sille; Thavarasah, Sujani; Plattet, Philippe; Seeger, Markus A.",bioRxiv,35,20

The present study aimed to evaluate presence and changes in luminal lung concentrations of the APPs haptoglobin (Hp), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactoferrin (Lf) in calves with an acute respiratory disease experimentally induced by Chlamydia (C.) psittaci. RESULTS: Intra-bronchial inoculation of the pathogen resulted in a consistent respiratory illness. In venous blood of the infected calves (n = 13), concentrations of plasma proteins and serum LBP were assessed (i) before exposure and (ii) 8 times within 14 days after inoculation (dpi). Increasing clinical illness correlated significantly with increasing LBP—and decreasing albumin concentrations in blood, both verifying a systemic acute phase response. Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from all 13 calves experimentally infected with C. psittaci at 4, 9 and 14 dpi, and from 6 uninfected healthy calves. Concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA), Hp, LBP, CRP and Lf in BALF were determined by ELISA. In infected animals, absolute concentrations of LBP and Hp in BALF correlated significantly with the respiratory score. The quotient [LBP]/[BSA] in BALF peaked significantly in acutely infected animals (4 dpi), showed a time-dependent decrease during the recovery phase (9-14 dpi), and was significantly higher compared to healthy controls. Concentrations of Hp and Lf in BALF as well as [Hp]/[BSA]—and [Lf]/[BSA]-quotients decreased during the study in infected animals, but were never higher than in healthy controls. CRP concentrations and [CRP]/[BSA]-quotient did not express significant differences between infected and healthy animals or during the course of infection. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, absolute concentrations of LBP in blood and BALF as well as the quotient [LBP]/[BSA] in BALF perfectly paralleled the clinical course of respiratory illness after infection. Beside LBP, the suitability of Hp and Lf as local biomarkers of respiratory infections in cattle and their role in the local response to pathogens is worth further investigation, while CRP does not seem to play a role in local defense mechanisms of the bovine lung.","Prohl, Annette; Schroedl, Wieland; Rhode, Heidrun; Reinhold, Petra",BMC Vet Res,35,1

We aim to conduct a comprehensive scoping review to map the existing literature with a key focus on how the literature on vaccination timeliness has evolved, how it has been defined or measured, and what determinants have been explored in the period spanning the last four decades. This scoping review protocol was developed based on the guidance for scoping reviews from the Joanna Briggs Institute. We will include English and French language peer-reviewed publications and grey literature on the timeliness of routine childhood vaccination in low-and middle-income countries published between January 1978 through to 2021. A three-step search strategy that involves an initial search of two databases to refine the keywords, a full search of all included electronic databases, and screening of references of previous studies for relevant articles missing from our full search will be employed. The search will be conducted in five electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, CINAHL and Web of Science. Google search will also be conducted to identify relevant grey literature on vaccination timeliness. All retrieved titles from the search will be imported into Endnote X9.3.3 (Clarivate Analytics) and deduplicated. Two reviewers will screen the titles, abstracts and full texts of publications for eligibility using Rayyan–the web based application for screening articles for systematic reviews. Using a tailored data extraction template, we will extract relevant information from eligible studies. The study team will analyse the extracted data using descriptive statistical methods and thematic analysis. The results will be presented using tables, while charts and maps will be used to aid the visualisation of the key findings and themes. The proposed review will generate evidence on key methodological gaps in the literature on timeliness of childhood vaccination. Such evidence would shape the direction of future research, and assist immunisation programme managers and country-level stakeholders to address the needs of their national immunisation system.","Wariri, Oghenebrume; Okomo, Uduak; Kwarshak, Yakubu Kevin; Murray, Kris A.; Grundy, Chris; Kampmann, Beate",PLoS One,35,24

Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 ± 3.5% and 10 ± 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 ± 1.6% and 6.2 ± 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater waters of 5.4 ± 0.2 log(10) genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.","Randazzo, Walter; Truchado, Pilar; Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Simón, Pedro; Allende, Ana; Sánchez, Gloria",Water Res,35,20

DATA SOURCES: Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and MedRxiv were searched until 25 July 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included published and unpublished studies comparing the mortality rate between patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin and patients managed with standard of care. PARTICIPANTS: Patients ≥18 years old with confirmed COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. METHODS: Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. Multiple subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the drug safety. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 839 articles, of which 29 articles met our inclusion criteria. All studies except one were conducted on hospitalized patients and evaluated the effects of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. Among the 29 articles, 3 were randomized controlled trials (RCT), one was a non-randomized trial and 25 were observational studies, including 10 with a critical risk of bias and 15 with a serious or moderate risk of bias. After excluding studies with critical risk of bias, the meta-analysis included 11,932 participants for the hydroxychloroquine group, 8,081 for the hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin group and 12,930 for the control group. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality: pooled Relative Risk RR=0.83 (95% CI: 0.65-1.06, n=17 studies) for all studies and RR=1.09 (95% CI: 0.97-1.24, n=3 studies) for RCTs. Hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin was associated with an increased mortality: RR=1.27 (95% CI: 1.04-1.54, n=7 studies). We found similar results with a Bayesian meta-analysis.

The assessment of volume status guides medical management and estimation of prognosis. Jugular venous pressure (JVP) estimation is the most important and accurate part of the physical examination in heart failure patients to assess volume status. Telemedicine visits are now a common place across the nation due to the current pandemic. In this unique situation we conducted a study to assess the accuracy of JVP estimation during a telemedicine visit. Methods This is a retrospective observational study. All the patients who were seen via telemedicine visit in the advanced heart failure, LVAD and transplant clinics were considered. The patients who underwent a right heart catheterization (RHC) within two weeks of the telemedicine clinic visit were included in the study. JVP measured by physical examination was obtained from chart review. Invasive hemodynamic data was obtained from RHC. JVP assessment was done via tele assessment with the patient in sitting position. For the purpose of this study JVP on examination was estimated by the clinician as either a numerical number or by distance in relation to the clavicle and jaw. Majority of the patients were male (n = 10) and had a mean age of 57 years. Mean BMI of the patients was 30. Eight of the eleven were post heart transplant patients. Two patients had a left ventricular assist device (Heartmate II and HVAD devices) placed as Destination therapy. Results From April 1st 2020 to May 21st 2020 twenty patients were identified who underwent RHC two weeks after their telemedicine visit. Of these eleven patients had JVP documented at the time of telemedicine visit and were included in the study. Seven patients had JVD not detectable above the level of clavicle on examination. 85% (n = 6) of these patients had mean RA pressure less than 7 mm Hg on RHC. One patient had mean RA pressure 8 mm Hg. Two patients were documented to have a JVP of 10 cm H2O. Both these patients had JVP of 8 mm Hg on RHC. Two patients were documented to have JVP of more than 10 cm H20 and both these patients had mean RA pressure more than or equal to 12 mm Hg on RHC.90% (n = 10) of patients had accurate assessment of right-sided filling pressures by examination via tele visit.","Sunkara, Anusha; Trachtenberg, Barry",Journal of Cardiac Failure,35,22

In addition to physical symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are common following outbreaks of EID. METHODS: The present study investigated the long-term mental health outcomes and related risk factors in survivors of MERS. A prospective nationwide cohort study was conducted 12 months after the MERS outbreak at multi-centers throughout Korea. PTSD and depression as the main mental health outcomes were assessed with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised Korean version (IES-R-K) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) respectively. RESULTS: 42.9% of survivors reported PTSD (IES-R-K ≥ 25) and 27.0% reported depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) at 12 months post-MERS. A multivariate analysis revealed that anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.76; 95%CI, 1.29–25.58; P = 0.021), and a greater recognition of stigma (aOR, 11.09, 95%CI, 2.28–53.90; P = 0.003) during the MERS-affected period were independent predictors of PTSD at 12 months after the MERS outbreak. Having a family member who died from MERS predicted the development of depression (aOR, 12.08, 95%CI, 1.47–99.19; P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: This finding implies that psychosocial factors, particularly during the outbreak phase, influenced the mental health of patients over a long-term period. Mental health support among the infected subjects and efforts to reduce stigma may improve recovery from psychological distress in an EID outbreak.","Park, Hye Yoon; Park, Wan Beom; Lee, So Hee; Kim, Jeong Lan; Lee, Jung Jae; Lee, Haewoo; Shin, Hyoung-Shik",BMC Public Health,35,24

ACE2 also contributes to a deviation of the lung renin–angiotensin system (RAS) towards its counter-regulatory axis, thus transforming harmful ANG II to protective ANG (1–7). Based on this purported ACE2 double function, it has been put forward that the benefit from ACE2 upregulation with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) counterbalances COVID-19 risks due to counter-regulatory RAS axis amplification. In this manuscript we discuss the relationship between ACE2 expression and function in the lungs and other organs and COVID-19 severity. Recent data suggested that the involvement of ACE2 in the lung counter-regulatory RAS axis is limited. In this setting, an augmentation of ACE2 expression and/or a dissociation of ACE2 from the ANG (1–7)/Mas pathways that leaves unopposed the ACE2 function, the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, predisposes to more severe disease and it appears to often occur in the relevant risk factors. Further, the effect of RAASi on ACE2 expression and on COVID-19 severity and the overall clinical implications are discussed.","Triposkiadis, Filippos; Xanthopoulos, Andrew; Giamouzis, Grigorios; Boudoulas, Konstantinos Dean; Starling, Randall C.; Skoularigis, John; Boudoulas, Harisios; Iliodromitis, Efstathios",J Clin Med,35,1

Scenarios with fewer customers without face to face seating and turning off the horizontal supplying air conditioner are examined as well. Various surfaces are still detected with droplets in 300 s after sneezing. The horizontal supplying air conditioner causes increment in the velocities of the droplets and leads to further spreading of the droplets. It is essential to sanitize all surfaces in a cafeteria including the walls, floor, ceiling, and tables that are not occupied by any customer. Keeping a safe distance in small indoor spaces such as cafeterias does not offer sufficient protection for activities without wearing a face mask.

METHODS: We investigated the effects on individuals’ mental wellbeing of this long-term isolation by means of an online survey on 71 Italian volunteers. They completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and Fear of COVID-19 Scale and judged valence, arousal, and dominance of words either related or unrelated to COVID-19, as identified by Google search trends. RESULTS: Emotional judgments changes from normative data varied depending on word type and individuals’ emotional state, revealing early signals of individuals’ mental distress to COVID-19 confinement. All individuals judged COVID-19-related words to be less positive and dominant. However, individuals with more negative feelings and COVID-19 fear also judged COVID-19-unrelated words to be less positive and dominant. Moreover, arousal ratings increased for all words among individuals with more negative feelings and COVID-19 fear but decreased among individuals with less negative feelings and COVID-19 fear. DISCUSSION: Our results show a rich picture of emotional reactions of Italians to tight and 2-month long confinement, identifying early signals of mental health distress.

While computational docking simulations remain a popular method of choice for the in silico ligand design and high-throughput screening of therapeutic agents, it is severely limited in the discovery of new candidate ligands owing to the high computational cost and vast chemical space. Here, we present a de novo molecular design strategy that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to discover new therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.

MERS-CoV transmission continues to be reported in the Saudi Arabian Peninsula since its discovery in 2012. However, it has rarely been epidemic outside the area except one large outbreak in South Korea in May 2015. The genome of the epidemic MERS-CoV isolated from a Korean patient revealed its homology to previously reported strains. MERS-CoV encodes 5 accessory proteins and generally, they do not participate in the genome transcription and replication but rather are involved in viral evasion of the host innate immune responses. Here we report that ORF8b, an accessory protein of MERS-CoV, strongly inhibits both MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated activation of interferon beta promoter activity while downstream signaling molecules were left largely unaffected. Of note, MDA5 protein levels were significantly down-regulated by ORF8b and co-expression of ORF4a and ORF4b. These novel findings will facilitate elucidation of mechanisms of virus-encoded evasion strategies, thus helping design rationale antiviral countermeasures against deadly MERS-CoV infection.","Lee, Jeong Yoon; Bae, Sojung; Myoung, Jinjong",J Microbiol,35,6

The ways SARS-CoV-2 spreads are still partly unknown; to quantify and adequately respond to the pandemic, various parameters and reporting systems have been introduced at national and European levels to promptly recognize the most alarming epidemiological situations and therefore limit the impact of the virus on the health of the population. The relevant key points to implement adequate measures to face the epidemic include identifying the population groups most involved in terms of morbidity and mortality, identifying the events mostly related to the spreading of the virus and recognizing the various viral mutations. The main objective of this work is to summarize the epidemiological situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and Italy almost a year after the first reported case in our continent.

However, few studies have accounted for the nature of contagious diseases, i.e., their dependent happenings. Aim We aimed to quantify the impact of temperature on the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan. We employed two epidemiological measurements of transmissibility and severity: the effective reproduction number (Rt) and case fatality risk (CFR). Methods We used empirical surveillance data and meteorological data in Tokyo to estimate the Rt and time-delay adjusted CFR and to subsequently assess the nonlinear and delay effect of temperature on Rt and time-delay adjusted CFR. Results For Rt at low temperatures, the cumulative relative risk (RR) at first temperature percentile (3.3) was 1.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-1.7). As for the virulence to humans, moderate cold temperatures were associated with higher CFR, and CFR also increased as the temperature rose. The cumulative RR at the 10th and 99th percentiles of temperature (5.8 and 30.8) for CFR were 3.5 (95%CI: 1.3-10) and 6.4 (95%CI: 4.1-10.1). Conclusions This study provided information on the effects of temperature on the COVID-19 epidemiology using Rt and time-delay adjusted CFR. Our results suggest the importance to take precautions to avoid infection in both cold and warm seasons to avoid severe cases of COVID-19. The results and proposed framework will also help in assessing possible seasonal course of COVID-19 in the future.","Yamasaki, L.; Murayama, H.; Hashizume, M.",,35,16

With ≈20 million new cases per year globally, cancer affects a significant portion of the population. Individuals affected by cancer are more susceptible to infections due to coexisting chronic diseases (cardiovascular, pulmonary and diabetes), overall poor health status, and systemic immunosuppressive states caused by both cancer and anticancer treatments. As a consequence, patients with malignancies, and especially with lung cancer who develop COVID19 experience more difficult outcomes. A recent multicenter study developed by the Hubei Anti-Cancer Association also documented that lung cancer patients had an increased risk of death, ICU requirement, risk of presenting severe or critical symptoms, and use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Here we present two representative cases of patients with lung cancer and COVID19 without respiratory compromise and with atypical and severe skin manifestations, findings that could be influenced by the chronic use of anti-PD1 antibodies.","Rolfo, Christian; Cardona, Andrés F.; Ruiz-Patiño, Alejandro; Ariza, Santiago; Zatarain-Barron, Lucia; Pino, Luis E.; Viola, Lucia; Russo, Alessandro; Rojas, Leonardo; Ricaurte, Luisa; Arrieta, Oscar",J Thorac Oncol,35,16

Among the 451,053 Italian citizens 80 were hospitalized as compared to 31 out of 99,127 foreign citizens, giving a significantly higher risk (odds ratio 1.76; 95% CI: 1.16–2.66) for the foreign children. The risk was highest for children of African ethnicity as compared to Italians with an odds ratio of 2.76 (95% CI: 1.56–4.87). None of the patients deceased. There was no significant difference in age (thou infants regardless of ethnicity had a 10-fold higher risk), sex, length of hospitalization or comorbidities, namely overweight. As bureaucratic, cultural and information barriers mostly affect preventive and adult services and considering that in contrast to other countries, in Italy pediatric care is guaranteed free of (out-of-pocket) charge to all people <16 years, and hospitals are densely spaced, access to health care seems to be a minor problem. Thus, other possible root causes are discussed. We believe that this is an unbiased starting point to understand and overcome the reasons for the higher risk those children experience.","Baronio, Roberto; Savaré, Lucia; Ruggiero, Jessica; Crotti, Beatrice; Mazza, Angelo; Marseglia, Gian Luigi; Dodi, Icilio; Cavalli, Claudio; Schumacher, Richard Fabian",Front Pediatr,35,16

Our analysis highlights a bidirectional relationship between both markets over the short and long run, with a greater lead for the futures market. This result confirms the future market’s dominant contribution to price discovery in commodities. Changes in commodity prices appear first in the futures market, as informed investors and speculators prefer trading on this market that is characterized by low costs and a high-leverage effect.

Newborn piglets were orally inoculated with PEAV P15, P67 and P100. Compared with P15 and P67, P100 resulted in only mild clinical signs and intestinal lesions in piglets. The virus shedding in feces and viral antigens in intestinal tract were markedly reduced in P100-inoculated piglets. Importantly, all P100-inoculated newborn piglets survived, indicating that P100 was an attenuated variant. Sequence analysis revealed that the virulent strain GDS04 had four, one, six and eleven amino acid differences in membrane, nucleocapsid, spike and ORF1ab proteins, respectively, from P100. Furthermore, more differences in the predicted three-dimensional structure of S protein between GDS04 and P100 were observed, indicating that these differences might be associated with the pathogenicity of PEAV.

We assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms (DS) and explore the association with characteristics related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an online survey among 881 men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) assessing the presence of DS using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10); results were compared with previously self-reported DS and national data. We applied latent class analysis (LCA) to identify classes of participants with similar COVID-19 related characteristics. The overall prevalence of significant DS was 53.3%. By LCA posterior probabilities we identified three classes: (1) minimal impact of COVID-19 (54.1%), (2) objective risk for COVID-19 (41.5%), and (3) anxiety and economic stress caused by COVID-19 (4.4%). Multivariate logistic regression showed that compared with those in class one, the odds to have significant DS were almost five times higher for those in class three. Our findings suggest high levels of depression among MSM and TGW in Mexico during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for the provision of targeted psychological interventions to minimize the impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health.","Cerecero-Garcia, Diego; Vermandere, Heleen; Bojorquez, Ietza; Gómez-Castro, José; Arturo Sánchez-Ochoa, José; Martínez-Dávalos, Araczy; Huerta-Icelo, Ivonne; Bautista-Arredondo, Sergio",Front Public Health,35,5

AIM: To elicit the anatomical distribution and physiological significance of the components of the RAS in the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS: An extensive online literature review including Pubmed and Medline. RESULTS: There is evidence for RAS involvement in gastrointestinal physiology and pathophysiology, with all the components required for autonomous regulation identified throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The RAS is implicated in the regulation of glucose, amino acid, fluid and electrolyte absorption and secretion, motility, inflammation, blood flow and possibly malignant disease within the gastrointestinal tract. Animal studies investigating the effects of RAS blockade in a range of conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, functional gut disorders, gastrointestinal malignancy and even intestinal ischaemia have been encouraging to date. Given the ready availability of drugs that modify the RAS and their excellent safety profile, an opportunity exists for investigation of their possible therapeutic role in a variety of human gastrointestinal diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The gastrointestinal renin‐angiotensin system appears to be intricately involved in a number of physiological processes, and provides a possible target for novel investigative and therapeutic approaches.","Garg, M.; Angus, P.

We described the clinical presentation and course of COVID-19 in LTCF residents who were tested either because of presence of core symptoms (S-based) or because of transmission prevention (TP-based) Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting and participants: Amsta (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), is a 1185-bed LTCF. All LTCF residents who underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between March 16, 2020 and May 31, 2020 were included (n = 380). Measures: Clinical symptoms, temperature and oxygen saturation were extracted from medical records, 7 days before testing up to 14 days after testing. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in 81 (21%) residents. Of these 81, 36 (44%) residents were tested S-based and 45 (56%) residents were tested TP-based. Yet, CT-values did not differ between the groups. In the 7 days prior to the test the most common symptoms in both groups were: falling (32%), somnolence (25%) and fatigue (21%). Two days before the test, we observed a stronger decrease in oxygen saturation and an increase in temperature for the S-based group compared to the T-based group that remained up to 10 days after testing. Residents with in the S-based group were 2.5 times more likely to decease within 30 days than residents in the TP-based group (HR, 2.56; 95% 1.3 to 5.2). Even though, 73% of the T-based group did eventually developed core symptoms. Conclusion and implications: Many LTCF residents with a positive PCR did not have core symptoms when tested but had other signs/symptoms in the week before the positive test. Testing policies should therefore be adjusted to prevent transmission. Daily measures of temperature and oxygen saturation can contribute to earlier detection.","Paap, K. C.; van Loon, A.

The number of cases of COVID-19 and its associated mortality have raised serious concerns worldwide. Early diagnosis of viral infection undoubtedly allows rapid intervention, disease management, and substantial control of the rapid spread of the disease. Currently, the standard approach for COVID-19 diagnosis globally is the RT-qPCR test; however, the limited access to kits and associated reagents, the need for specialized lab equipment, and the need for highly skilled personnel has led to a detection slowdown. Recently, the development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based diagnostic systems has reshaped molecular diagnosis. The benefits of the CRISPR system such as speed, precision, specificity, strength, efficiency, and versatility have inspired researchers to develop CRISPR-based diagnostic and therapeutic methods. With the global COVID-19 outbreak, different groups have begun to design and develop diagnostic and therapeutic programs based on the efficient CRISPR system. CRISPR-based COVID-19 diagnostic systems have advantages such as a high detection speed (i.e., 30 min from raw sample to reach a result), high sensitivity and precision, portability, and no need for specialized laboratory equipment. Here, we review contemporary studies on the detection of COVID-19 based on the CRISPR system.","Rahimi, Hossein; Salehiabar, Marziyeh; Barsbay, Murat; Ghaffarlou, Mohammadreza; Kavetskyy, Taras; Sharafi, Ali; Davaran, Soodabeh; Chauhan, Subhash C.; Danafar, Hossein; Kaboli, Saeed; Nosrati, Hamed; Yallapu, Murali M.; Conde, João",ACS Sens,35,1

Objective: It may take many weeks or months to establish a standard treatment approach. Given the growing morbidity and mortality with respect to COVID-19, we present a treatment approach based on a thorough review of scholarly articles and clinical reports. Our focus is on staged progression, clinical algorithms, and individualized treatment. Evidence Review: We followed the protocol for a quality review article proposed by Heyn et. al.1 A literature search was conducted to find all relevant studies related to COVID-19. The search was conducted between April 1, 2020 and April 13, 2020 using the following electronic databases: PubMed (1809 to present), Google Scholar (1900 to present), MEDLINE (1946 to present), CINAHL (1937 to present), and Embase (1980 to present). Keywords used included COVID-19, 2019-nCov, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, with terms such as efficacy, seroconversion, microbiology, pathophysiology, viral levels, inflammation, survivability, and treatment and pharmacology. No language restriction was placed on the search. Reference lists were manually scanned for additional studies. Findings: Of the articles found in the literature search, 70 were selected for inclusion in this study (67 cited in the body of the manuscript and 3 additional unique references in the Figures). The articles represent work from China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Rwanda, Israel, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States. Most of the articles were cohort or case studies, but we also drew upon information found in guidelines from hospitals and clinics instructing their staff on procedures to follow. In addition, we based some decisions on data collected by agencies such as the CDC, FDA, IHME, ISDA, and Worldometer. None of the case studies or cohort studies used a large number of participants. The largest group of participants numbered less than 500 and some case studies had fewer than 30 patients. However, the review of the literature revealed the need for individualized treatment protocols due to the variability of patient clinical presentation and survivability. A number of factors appear to influence mortality: the stage at which the patient first presented for care, pre-existing health conditions, age, and the viral load the patient carried. Conclusion and Relevance: COVID-19 can be divided into three distinct Stages, beginning at the time of infection (Stage I), sometimes progressing to pulmonary involvement (Stage II, with or without hypoxemia) and less frequently to systemic inflammation (Stage III). In addition to modeling the stages of disease progression, we have also created a treatment algorithm which considers age, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and disease progression to suggest drug classes or treatment modalities. This paper presents the first evidence-based recommendations for individualized treatment for COVID-19.","Aguilar, Richard B; Hardigan, Patrick; Mayi, Bindu; Sider, Darby; Piotrkowski, Jared; Mehta, Jinesh; Dev, Jenankan; Seijo, Yelenis; Lewis Camargo, Antonio; Andux, Luis; Hagen, Kathleen; Hernandez, Marlow B",,35,2

Here, an unbiased interrogation of the anti-viral memory B cell repertoire of convalescent patients has been performed by generating large, stable hybridoma libraries and screening thousands of monoclonal antibodies to identify specific, high-affinity immunoglobulins (Igs) directed at distinct viral components. As expected, a significant number of antibodies were directed at the Spike (S) protein, a majority of which recognized the full-length protein. These full-length Spike specific antibodies included a group of somatically hypermutated IgMs. Further, all but one of the six COVID-19 convalescent patients produced class-switched antibodies to a soluble form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein. Functional properties of anti-Spike antibodies were confirmed in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Importantly, more than half of all of the antibodies generated were directed at non-S viral proteins, including structural nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, as well as auxiliary open reading frame-encoded (ORF) proteins. The antibodies were generally characterized as having variable levels of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in all Ig classes and sub-types, and a diversity of VL and VH gene usage. These findings demonstrated that an unbiased, function-based approach towards interrogating the COVID-19 patient memory B cell response may have distinct advantages relative to genomics-based approaches when identifying highly effective anti-viral antibodies directed at SARS-CoV-2.","DiMuzio, Jillian M.; Heimbach, Baron C.; Howanski, Raymond J.; Dowling, John P.; Patel, Nirja B.; Henriquez, Noeleya; Nicolescu, Chris; Nath, Mitchell; Polley, Antonio; Bingaman, Jamie L.; Smith, Todd; Harman, Benjamin C.; Robinson, Matthew K.; Morin, Michael J.; Nikitin, Pavel A.",bioRxiv,35,20

Volunteers were recruited and trained to assist the carers to use the Verily Connect app and videoconferencing. The overall research design was a stepped wedge open cohort randomized cluster trial involving 12 rural communities, spanning three states of Australia, with three types of participants: carers of people living with dementia, volunteers, and health/aged services staff. Data collected from volunteers (n = 39) included eight interviews and five focus groups with volunteers, and 75 process memos written by research team members. The data were analyzed using a descriptive evaluation framework and building themes through open coding, inductive reasoning, and code categorization. The volunteers reported that the Verily Connect app was easy to use and they felt they derived benefit from volunteering. The volunteers had less volunteering work than they desired due to low numbers of carer participants; they reported that older rural carers were partly reluctant to join the trial because they eschewed using online technologies, which was the reason for involving volunteers from each local community.","Wilding, Clare; Davis, Hilary; Rasekaba, Tshepo; Hamiduzzaman, Mohammad; Royals, Kayla; Greenhill, Jennene; O’Connell, Megan E.; Perkins, David; Bauer, Michael; Morgan, Debra; Blackberry, Irene",Int J Environ Res Public Health,35,20

Although these have diminished the risk of disease transmission, there are additional steps that could be taken to prevent another blood-borne viral epidemic. A new Office of Blood Product Safety (OBPS) might be established within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to communicate information on the safety and availability of blood and blood products to the public and health care professionals. Furthermore, the costs of collection, processing, and distribution of blood for transfusion should be borne by the public, not individual patients. Another recommendation is to establish an Office for the Control of Pharmaceutical Prices (COPP) within the Department of Health and Human Services to set caps on the prices of blood products, essential drugs, and medical devices. If a pharmaceutical required for human health becomes unavailable, then this Office could authorize subsidies for its production. The chapter concludes by urging greater investment in basic and applied research to identify the causes of disease, develop diagnostic tests and therapeutic materials, and produce vaccines that might prevent future outbreaks of blood-borne diseases.","Green, David",Linked by Blood: Hemophilia and AIDS,35,27

SUMMARY: A 72-year-old White man was started on dulaglutide for outpatient management of type 2 diabetes, in addition to his existing antihyperglycemic regimen of metformin, glipizide, pioglitazone, and insulin glargine. His glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) concentration improved from 8.2% to 7.2% with the addition of dulaglutide. Furthermore, the use of dulaglutide did not lead to weight loss. After 16 months of treatment with dulaglutide, he presented to the emergency room with nausea, loss of appetite, and progressive sharp, nonradiating right upper quadrant pain. Based on symptom presentation, laboratory workup, and computed tomography scan results, acute cholecystitis was diagnosed. He underwent a cholecystectomy to remove what was found to be a gangrenous gallbladder. Per documented surgical dictation from the cholecystectomy, the gallbladder was removed, but portions of the biliary tree were left intact. The patient was continued on dulaglutide postoperatively without recurrence of bile stones, biliary tree disease, or abdominal symptoms at 8 months after initial cholecystitis incident. CONCLUSION: A male patient with possible dulaglutide-induced cholecystitis was successfully continued on dulaglutide therapy post cholecystectomy without recurrent complications within the biliary tract.","Butler, Jared; Bjurstrom, Marysue; Marceau, Anna",Am J Health Syst Pharm,35,16

The Swedish Public Health Agency emphasized individual responsibility and pushed for behavioral changes. With strict lockdown a 77% decrease in ankle fracture incidence has been reported. We investigated whether there was a change in the incidence of ankle fractures seen at 7 selected hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic 2020. Patients and methods — Data on all ankle fractures treated at 7 selected departments during March 15 through June 15, 2020, and for the same period in the preceding 3 years (2017–2019), was retrieved from the Swedish Fracture Register. The number of fractures during the whole period and subsequent 30-day periods were compared between 2020 and 2017–2019, including subgroup analyses of age and sex. Results — The monthly rate of ankle fractures was reduced by 14% in 2020 (139 fractures) compared with 2017–2019 (161 fractures). Women had a 16% decrease and patients aged > 70 years had a 29% decrease. During the 1st 30-day period, a 26% decrease in fractures was seen. Interpretation — During the 1st wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a moderate decline in the number of ankle fractures was seen. Women and patients aged > 70 years displayed the greatest reduction. The greatest reduction in incidence of fractures was seen during the 1st 30-day period. This indicates greater adherence to government recommendations regarding social distancing in these subgroups and during the 1st month of the pandemic.

The objectives of this study were to understand mothers’ SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions to explore reasons for and against SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. METHODS: Participants from the All Our Families pregnancy longitudinal cohort whose children had reached ages 9–12 years were invited in May–June 2020 to complete a survey on the impact of COVID-19. The survey covered topics about the impact of the pandemic and included 2 specific questions on mothers’ intentions to vaccinate their child against SARS-CoV-2. Current responses were linked to previously collected data, including infant vaccine uptake. Multinomial regression models were run to estimate associations between demographic factors, past vaccination status and vaccination intention. Qualitative responses regarding factors affecting decision-making were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: The response rate was 53.8% (1321/2455). A minority of children of participants had partial or no vaccinations at age 2 (n = 200, 15.1%). A total of 60.4% of mothers (n = 798) intended to vaccinate their children with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 8.6% (n = 113) did not intend to vaccinate and 31.0% (n = 410) were unsure. Lower education, lower income and incomplete vaccination history were inversely associated with intention to vaccinate. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses showed 10 themes, including safety and efficacy, long-term effects and a rushed process. INTERPRETATION: Within a cohort with historically high infant vaccination, a third of mothers remained unsure about vaccinating their children against SARS-CoV-2. Given the many uncertainties about future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, clear communication regarding safety will be critical to ensuring vaccine uptake.","Hetherington, Erin; Edwards, Sarah A.; MacDonald, Shannon E.; Racine, Nicole; Madigan, Sheri; McDonald, Sheila; Tough, Suzanne",CMAJ Open,35,16

Endothelial functions in health include dynamic maintenance of vascular tone, angiogenesis, hemostasis, and the provision of an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic interface. Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium presents with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, heightened oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, leukocyte adhesion and hyperpermeability, and endothelial cell senescence. Recent studies have implicated altered endothelial cell metabolism and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition as new features of endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is regarded as a hallmark of many diverse human panvascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. Endothelial dysfunction has also been implicated in severe coronavirus disease 2019. Many clinically used pharmacotherapies, ranging from traditional lipid-lowering drugs, antihypertensive drugs, and antidiabetic drugs to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors and interleukin 1β monoclonal antibodies, counter endothelial dysfunction as part of their clinical benefits. The regulation of endothelial dysfunction by noncoding RNAs has provided novel insights into these newly described regulators of endothelial dysfunction, thus yielding potential new therapeutic approaches. Altogether, a better understanding of the versatile (dys)functions of endothelial cells will not only deepen our comprehension of human diseases but also accelerate effective therapeutic drug discovery. In this review, we provide a timely overview of the multiple layers of endothelial function, describe the consequences and mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction, and identify pathways to effective targeted therapies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The endothelium was initially considered to be a semipermeable biomechanical barrier and gatekeeper of vascular health. In recent decades, a deepened understanding of the biological functions of the endothelium has led to its recognition as a ubiquitous tissue regulating vascular tone, cell behavior, innate immunity, cell-cell interactions, and cell metabolism in the vessel wall. Endothelial dysfunction is the hallmark of cardiovascular, metabolic, and emerging infectious diseases. Pharmacotherapies targeting endothelial dysfunction have potential for treatment of cardiovascular and many other diseases.","Xu, Suowen; Ilyas, Iqra; Little, Peter J; Li, Hong; Kamato, Danielle; Zheng, Xueying; Luo, Sihui; Li, Zhuoming; Liu, Peiqing; Han, Jihong; Harding, Ian C; Ebong, Eno E; Cameron, Scott J; Stewart, Alastair G; Weng, Jianping",Pharmacological reviews,35,1

In addition, RATs tend to be negative from approximately 11 days after symptom onset. To determine whether the antigen-negative state indicates a lack of infectiousness, we assessed the association between viral culture and RAT results. Viral culture, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and rapid antigen testing were performed on stored nasopharyngeal samples with threshold cycle values <30, based on previous RT-qPCR testing. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated by viral culture from nine samples (45%) and one sample (17%) with positive and negative RAT results, respectively. The RAT and viral culture results were both associated with the viral load level and their cutoffs were similar, but the associations were not statistically significant. RAT might be a useful indicator of infectiousness, which can be helpful to control infection. However, further studies with larger sample size are warranted to confirm this observation.","Yamamoto, Kei; Nagashima, Mami; Yoshida, Isao; Sadamasu, Kenji; Kurokawa, Masami; Nagashima, Maki; Kinoshita, Noriko; Kenji, Maeda; Takasaki, Jin; Teruya, Katsuji; Ohmagari, Norio",J Infect Chemother,35,29

To date, four vaccines have been approved by European and American authorities for preventing COVID-19, but the development of additional vaccine platforms with improved supply and logistics profiles remains a pressing need. Here we report the preclinical evaluation of a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on the electroporation of engineered, synthetic cDNA encoding a viral antigen in the skeletal muscle. We constructed a set of prototype DNA vaccines expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and assessed their immunogenicity in animal models. Among them, COVID-eVax—a DNA plasmid encoding a secreted monomeric form of SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)—induced the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses (including against the current most common variants of concern) and a robust T cell response. Upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2, immunized K18-hACE2 transgenic mice showed reduced weight loss, improved pulmonary function, and lower viral replication in the lungs and brain. COVID-eVax conferred significant protection to ferrets upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In summary, this study identifies COVID-eVax as an ideal COVID-19 vaccine candidate suitable for clinical development. Accordingly, a combined phase I-II trial has recently started.","Conforti, Antonella; Marra, Emanuele; Palombo, Fabio; Roscilli, Giuseppe; Ravà, Micol; Fumagalli, Valeria; Muzi, Alessia; Maffei, Mariano; Luberto, Laura; Lione, Lucia; Salvatori, Erika; Compagnone, Mirco; Pinto, Eleonora; Pavoni, Emiliano; Bucci, Federica; Vitagliano, Grazia; Stoppoloni, Daniela; Pacello, Maria Lucrezia; Cappelletti, Manuela; Ferrara, Fabiana Fosca; D’Acunto, Emanuela; Chiarini, Valerio; Arriga, Roberto; Nyska, Abraham; Di Lucia, Pietro; Marotta, Davide; Bono, Elisa; Giustini, Leonardo; Sala, Eleonora; Perucchini, Chiara; Paterson, Jemma; Ryan, Kathryn Ann; Challis, Amy-Rose; Matusali, Giulia; Colavita, Francesca; Caselli, Gianfranco; Criscuolo, Elena; Clementi, Nicola; Mancini, Nicasio; Groß, Rüdiger; Seidel, Alina; Wettstein, Lukas; Münch, Jan; Donnici, Lorena; Conti, Matteo; De Francesco, Raffaele; Kuka, Mirela; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Castilletti, Concetta; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Guidotti, Luca G.; Rovati, Lucio; Iannacone, Matteo; Aurisicchio, Luigi",Mol Ther,35,24

As a stress response, the autophagy machinery interconnects a wide range of cellular pathways, enhancing the spread of certain pathogens while limiting others, and has become a highly active research area over the past several years. Independent laboratories have recently reported that autophagy vesicles accumulate in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected cells and that autophagy proteins can function as proviral factors required for HCV replication. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about the interplay between autophagy and HCV and the possible mechanisms whereby autophagy proteins might favor HCV propagation.","Dreux, Marlène; Chisari, Francis V.",Viruses,35,20

Lockdown has necessarily changed the gambling habits of gamblers in the UK, and the impact of these measures on the mental health of gamblers is unknown. To understand the impact of lockdown on gamblers, in April 2020, after ~6 weeks of lockdown, participants (N = 1,028, 72% female) completed an online questionnaire. Gambling engagement data was collected for pre-lockdown via the Brief Problem Gambling Screen (BPGS) allowing participants to be classified as Non-Gamblers (NG), Non-Problem Gamblers (NPG) or Potential Problem Gamblers (PPG). The Depression, Stress, and Anxiety Scale (DASS21) was used to measure depression, stress, and anxiety scores both pre- and during-lockdown. Results indicate that depression, stress and anxiety has increased across the whole sample. Participants classified in the PPG group reported higher scores on each sub scale at both baseline and during lockdown. Increases were observed on each DASS21 subscale, for each gambler group, however despite variable significance and effect sizes, the magnitude of increases did not differ between groups. Lockdown has had a significant impact on mental health of participants; whilst depression stress and anxiety remain highest in potential problem gamblers, pre-lockdown gambler status did not affect changes in DASS21 scores.","Sharman, Steve; Roberts, Amanda; Bowden-Jones, Henrietta; Strang, John",Front Psychiatry,35,14

We aimed to identify sociodemographic, occupational, and community risk factors among physician trainees during the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in New York City. In this retrospective study of 328 trainees at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, we administered a survey to assess risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 February and 30 June 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by self-reported and laboratory-confirmed IgG antibody and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test results. We used Bayesian generalized linear mixed effect regression to examine associations between hypothesized risk factors and infection odds. The cumulative incidence of infection was 20.1%. Assignment to medical-surgical units (OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.18–5.34), and training in emergency medicine, critical care, and anesthesiology (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.24–6.92) were independently associated with infection. Caring for unfamiliar patient populations was protective (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03–0.73). Community factors were not statistically significantly associated with infection after adjustment for occupational factors. Our findings may inform tailored infection prevention strategies for physician trainees responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pawloski, Kate R.; Kolod, Betty; Khan, Rabeea F.; Midya, Vishal; Chen, Tania; Oduwole, Adeyemi; Camins, Bernard; Colicino, Elena; Leitman, I.

On 18th March 2020, the Malaysian government put into action an enforced movement control order (MCO) to reduce the numbers of infections. This study aims to investigate the concentrations of air pollutants during the MCO in the Klang Valley. The concentrations of air pollutants were recorded by the continuous air quality monitoring system (CAQMS) operated by the Department of Environment. The results showed that there were significant reductions (p < 0.05) of PM(10), PM(2.5), NO(2) and CO during the MCO compared with the same periods in 2019 and 2018. The highest percentage of reduction during the MCO was recorded by NO(2) with a percentage reduction of between −55 % and −72 %. O(3) concentrations at several stations showed an increase due to the reductions of its precursors such as NO. Further investigation using diurnal patterns of air pollutant concentrations both before and during the MCO showed that NO(2) and CO were both reduced significantly during the rush hours, indicating the reduction in motor vehicles on the roads as a consequence of the MCO influenced the levels of these pollutants.","Latif, Mohd Talib; Dominick, Doreena; Hawari, Nor Syamimi Sufiera Limi; Mohtar, Anis Asma Ahmad; Othman, Murnira",Sustain Cities Soc,35,1

METHODS: : We conducted a systematic review of the literature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. We searched in 5 databases: PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCO, Elsevier, and MEDLINE, and included articles published between December 2019 and July 2020. RESULTS: : This review included 22 publications that met inclusion criteria, 17 of which were case series, 2 case reports, and 3 massive screenings. All articles compared saliva with nasopharyngeal swabs. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva was similar to NPS. The sensitivity ranged between 20% and 97%, and specificity ranged between 66 and 100%. CONCLUSIONS: : This systematic review found that saliva might be an appropriate, fast, painless, simple, and non-invasive sample for SARS-CoV-2 detection, making it ideal for massive screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cañete, Martín González; Valenzuela, Isidora Mujica; Garcés, Patricia Carvajal; Massó, Isabel Castro; González, María Julieta; Providell, Sergio González",Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol,35,1
