The language barrier presents only one of the challenges to overcome. Creating a European early warning system by linking national surveillance structures and the development of a communication network are important initial achievements. Several instruments have been designed and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has already played a major role in the coordination of this process. It has also led the assessment of preparedness and planning by Member States. The speed of the European Member States in preparing for and the foci they have chosen when dealing with an influenza outbreak are heterogeneous. The simultaneous analysis presented here from European, national and regional points of view aims to identify both opportunities and risks of this diversity in Europe for coping with a new pandemic. Regional and local initiatives for cross-border measures and crisis management will play a central role in achieving successful influenza pandemic preparedness in Europe.","Haas, Walter; Straetemans, M.; Pfaff, G.; Nicoll, A.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080053/,449

In particular, seasonal variations in demographic processes may considerably affect the persistence of a pathogen in these populations. Furthermore, it has been long observed in computer simulations that under seasonal perturbations, a host–pathogen system can exhibit complex dynamics, including the transition to chaos, as the magnitude of the seasonal perturbation increases. In this paper, we develop a seasonally perturbed Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model of avian influenza in a seabird colony. Numerical simulations of the model give rise to chaotic recurrent epidemics for parameters that reflect the ecology of avian influenza in a seabird population, thereby providing a case study for chaos in a host– pathogen system. We give a computer-assisted exposition of the existence of chaos in the model using methods that are based on the concept of topological hyperbolicity. Our approach elucidates the geometry of the chaos in the phase space of the model, thereby offering a mechanism for the persistence of the infection. Finally, the methods described in this paper may be immediately extended to other infections and hosts, including humans.","O’Regan, Suzanne M.; Kelly, Thomas C.; Korobeinikov, Andrei; O’Callaghan, Michael J.

4798,Prinzipien und Aspekte der Seuchenalarmplanung am Beispiel der Influenzapandemieplanung,2005,"Abnormal levels of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) during resuscitation in the delivery suite are associated with intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) development. Our aim was to determine whether carbon dioxide (CO(2)) levels in the first 3 days after birth reflected abnormal EtCO(2) levels in the delivery suite, and hence, a prolonged rather than an early insult resulted in IVH. In addition, we determined if greater EtCO(2)level fluctuations during resuscitation occurred in infants who developed IVH. EtCO(2) levels during delivery suite resuscitation and CO(2) levels on the neonatal unit were evaluated in 58 infants (median gestational age 27.3 weeks). Delta EtCO(2) was the difference between the highest and lowest level of EtCO(2). Thirteen infants developed a grade 3–4 IVH (severe group). There were no significant differences in CO(2) levels between those who did and did not develop an IVH (or severe IVH) on the NICU. The delta EtCO(2) during resuscitation differed between infants with any IVH (6.2 (5.4–7.5) kPa) or no IVH (3.8 (2.7–4.3) kPA) (p < 0.001) after adjusting for differences in gestational age. Delta EtCO(2) levels gave an area under the ROC curve of 0.940 for prediction of IVH. Conclusion: The results emphasize the importance of monitoring EtCO(2) levels in the delivery suite.","Tamura, Kentaro; Williams, Emma E; Dassios, Theodore; Pahuja, Anoop; Hunt, Katie A; Murthy, Vadivelam; Bhat, Prashanth; Bhat, Ravindra; Milner, Anthony; Greenough, Anne",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080666/,449
5872,Behandlungsstrategien des akut-auf-chronischen Leberversagens,2019-08-28,"PURPOSE: Cell therapy may become an option for lung injury treatment. However, no data are available on the alveolar presence and time course of CD4+ CD25 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory lymphocyte cells (Tregs) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Accordingly, we (1) measured the ratio of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Tregs to all (CD4+) lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of ARDS patients and of control subjects without lung disease and (2) assessed their impact on 30-day mortality. METHODS: In a prospective study, the ratios of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory cells to all CD4+ cells were measured (FACS) within 24 h of the patients’ ICU referral in the BAL and in the blood of 47 patients with ARDS (32 males, 15 females; mean age 44 years ±13) as well as in 8 controls undergoing elective abdominal surgery (5 men, 3 women; mean age 49 years ±4). BAL concentrations of several cytokines were also measured in ARDS patients. RESULTS: Tregs were detected in the BAL of control subjects and ARDS patients. However, the mean ratio of Tregs to all CD4+ lymphocytes was threefold greater in ARDS non-survivors (16.5 %; p = 0.025) and almost twofold greater in ARDS survivors (9.0 %; p = 0.015) compared to controls (5.9 %). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed the ratio of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory lymphocytes to all CD4+ lymphocytes in the BAL to be an important and independent prognostic factor for 30-day survival (HR 6.5; 95 % CI, 1.7–25; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: An increased T-regulatory cell ratio in the admission BAL of patients with ARDS is an important and independent risk factor for 30-day mortality.","Adamzik, Michael; Broll, Jasmin; Steinmann, Jörg; Westendorf, Astrid Maria; Rehfeld, Irene; Kreissig, Carla; Peters, Jürgen",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095258/,449
5989,Abstracts der 108. Jahrestagung der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Kinder- und Jugendmedizin e.V. (DGKJ),2012-09-05,"□ BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid antibodies comprise a family of auto-antibodies mainly characterized by the presence of the lupus anticoagulant (LA) and anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA). □ CLINICAL APPEARANCE: The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is defined by the appearance of frequent thromboses, repeated fetal losses and thrombocytopenia. Other clinical manifestations associated with APA include migraine, chorea, hemolytic anemia, heart valve disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, perpetual pancreatitic episodes, intestinal infarctions, malignant hypertension, livedo reticularis, pre-eclampsia, fetal growth retardation or catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. LA and ACA occur in a variety of clinical conditions (secondary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, SAPS), including other autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, neoplastic disorders, in association with the use of certain drugs or in otherwise healthy individuals (primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, PAPS). □ TREATMENT: Patients with thrombosis associated with APA should receive long-term anticoagulation therapy, whereas treatment of asymptomatic patients seems to be not indicated, because only approximately 10% of patients with APA may develop thrombotic complications. In patients with PAPS there is no evidence that the prophylactic administration of immunosuppressive drugs will prevent thromboembolic events.","Schmidt, Rüdiger; Scheuermann, Ernst-Heinrich; Viertel, Achim; Geiger, Helmut; Scharrer, Inge",Med Klin (Munich),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095803/,449

5994,Akutes Leberversagen,2001,"OBJECTIVE: Gossypol has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gossypol on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. METHODS: Male BALB/c mice were pretreated with gossypol 1 h before intranasal instillation of LPS. Then, 7 h after LPS administration, the myeloperoxidase in histology of lungs, lung wet/dry ratio and inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the BALF were measured by ELISA. The extent of phosphorylation of IκB-α, p65 NF-κB, p46–p54 JNK, p42–p44 ERK, and p38 were detected by western blot. RESULTS: Gossypol markedly attenuated the LPS-induced histological alterations in the lung and inhibited the production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Additionally, gossypol reduced the inflammatory cells in BALF, decreased the wet/dry ratio of lungs and inhibited the phosphorylation of IκB-α, p65 NF-κB, p46–p54 JNK, p42–p44 ERK, and p38 caused by LPS. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that anti-inflammatory effects of gossypol against the LPS-induced ALI may be due to its ability of inhibition of the NF-κB and MAPKs signaling pathways. Gossypol may be a promising potential therapeutic reagent for ALI treatment.","Liu, Zhicheng; Yang, Zhengtao; Fu, Yunhe; Li, Fenyang; Liang, Dejie; Zhou, Ershun; Song, Xiaojing; Zhang, Wen; Zhang, Xichen; Cao, Yongguo; Zhang, Naisheng",Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095812/,449

PTLD developed 1 year after transplantation (tx) in 14 patients. Five patients were diagnosed at autopsy, 2 were lost to follow up, 3 died before therapy could be instituted, and 1 patient has just started chemotherapy. Of the 8 evaluable patients, 2 received acyclovir and are alive in complete remission (CR) and 6 received chemotherapy ± surgery. Of these 6, 4 died of lymphoma and/or infection, 1 died of unrelated causes in CR, and 1 is alive in CR. PTLD is a severe complication of tx, usually running an aggressive course which may preclude prompt diagnosis and treatment. Nevertheless, therapy is feasible and must be tailored on the histologic subtype. Seventy-four percent of patients were diagnosed with late-onset PTLD stressing the need for long-term follow up.","Muti, G.; De Gasperi, A.; Cantoni, S.; Oreste, P.; Gini, G.; Civati, G.; Busnach, G.; Brando, B.; Frigerio, M.; Mangiavacchi, M.; Alberti, A.; Decarus, L.; Rondinara, G.; De Giuli, E.; Morra, E.",Transpl Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095845/,449

Diagnostic imaging is important for detection, differentiation and follow up of pneumonic infiltration. However morphology of pulmonary infiltration is unspecific, even with computed tomography (CT). Therefore determination of the underlying agent with imaging is generally limited and non infectious differential diagnosis has to be considered. Knowledge of special manifestations, distribution patterns and differential diagnoses of pneumonic infiltrations and consideration of clinical aspects is essential to narrow differential diagnosis and spectrum of infectious agents.

Meanwhile, the descriptive term of the concept as intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) is preferred. The most significant risk factors for the development of ICUAW are sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In at least one third of patients, persistent impairment by paralysis, sensory disturbances and balance problems persist when they leave the ICU. At approximately 10%, these leg-accentuated and highly everyday relevant disorders persist over the first year after ICU therapy.

A successful transplantation should result in an improved quality of life as well as an increase in life-expectancy for certain diseases (cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension). There is still a critical need regarding the number of available donor organs. Presently, one out of six patients dies on the waiting list. In order to identify suitable candidates for transplantation a number of criteria require consideration. These include the exact etiology of the pulmonary or cardiac disease, but also patient age, physical mobility, nutritional and muscular status as well as a comprehensive assessment to exclude significant extra-pulmonary co-morbidities. Complications arising after transplantation occur because of general perioperative risks, but also as a result of specific issues such as acute or chronic graft rejection, airway stenoses, infections of the newly immunosuppressed patient as well as a complete spectrum of secondary extra-pulmonary conditions. Comprehensive follow-up care in lung transplantation patients remains a vital issue.

However, in contrast to successfully introduced new treatments, a number of therapeutical failures exist as well: despite impressive data from animal models, convincing concepts, and promising phase I/II studies, some investigated drugs and strategies showed no positive effects in clinical trials, or trials had to be terminated because of unexpected side effects.

Previous studies on the effect of iNO in patients with ARDS were usually lumped together with respect to causation. Methods: We describe the acute effect of iNO in 4 children (age 4–54 months) suffering from acute, virus-induced, hypoxemic respiratory failure. Inhaled NO was administered at a dose of 20 ppm during the first hour and subsequently decreased to a dose of 5 ppm. The effects on oxygenation were assessed by changes in arterial oxygen tension and in the oxygenation index at one and 4 hours after initiating iNO therapy. Results: Inhaled NO dramatically improved oxygenation in 3 of 4 children and reduced the oxygenation index by more than 30%. One patient showed no improvement in oxygenation, but a significant reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance. Discussion: Although previous studies have failed to show any benefit of iNO on the survival rate of children with ARDS, we believe that its use can be justified if the improvement in oxygenation helps to stabilise the patient during the acute stage of hypoxemic respiratory failure.","Trachsel, D.; Rutishauser, M.; Frei, F.; Hammer, J.",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095952/,449

Even brief periods of inadequate respiratory support can cause atelectatrauma and volutrauma which in turn can have deleterious cardiorespiratory consequences and accentuate pre-existing lung disease. A variety of respirators and respiratory support strategies are available and should be selected to meet a patient’s particular needs. Optimal PEEP and normal tidal volumes during conventional ventilation, high volume strategy during high frequency ventilation, and permissive hypercapnia are the corner stones of a lung protective strategy.

We evaluated a self-designed, low-cost, patient-specific acetabular jig to guide cup placement in total hip arthroplasty in comparison to conventional technique. METHODS: It was a prospective randomized control study. Thirty-six patients were categorized into group-A & group-B. In group-A, virtually designed acetabular jig was 3 Dimensional (3D) printed and used intra-operatively to guide cup placement. In group-B, the standard method of cup placement was used. Acetabular cup placement was evaluated on post-operative x-rays and compared between two groups. RESULTS: In group-A, angle of anteversion were significantly in centre of range of safe zone as compared to group B in which hip is maximally stable with more precision in creating hip centre as compared to group-B without any significant(p = 0.325) increase in surgical time or blood loss. CONCLUSION: Computed tomography (CT) scan based virtual pre-operative templating and cup placement guided by virtually designed, patient-specific acetabular jig is a low-cost tool with a short learning curve which can be designed and made available easily. It is a useful tool in decreasing chances of malpositioning of cup and recreates hip centre close to anatomical one especially in cases where anatomy has been distorted such as bony ankylosis and developmental dysplasia of hip.","Mishra, Abhishek; Verma, Tarun; Rajkumar; Agarwal, Gaurang; Sharma, Amit; Maini, Lalit",Indian J Orthop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096340/,449

Large outbreaks occur in the central interior at long, irregular intervals, most recently in 2010–2011; however, the level of herd immunity of ruminant livestock, a key determinant of outbreaks, is unknown. During 2015–2016 a cross-sectional study on 234 randomly-selected farms investigated the prevalence, patterns of, and factors associated with, antibodies to RVF virus (RVFV) in livestock in an area heavily affected by that outbreak. A RVFV inhibition ELISA was used to screen 977 cattle, 1,549 sheep and 523 goats and information on potential risk factors was collected using a comprehensive questionnaire. The estimated RVFV seroprevalence, adjusted for survey design, was 42.9% in cattle, 28.0% in sheep and 9.3% in goats, showing a high degree of farm-level clustering. Seroprevalence increased with age and was higher on private vs. communal land, on farms with seasonal pans (temporary, shallow wetlands) and perennial rivers and in recently vaccinated animals. Seropositivity amongst unvaccinated animals born after the last outbreak indicates likely viral circulation during the post-epidemic period.

Vasoplegic syndrome (VS) is a state of shock refractory to catecholamines and vasopressin that is often multifactorial in liver failure patients, and can occur in any phase of liver transplantation (LT) [i.e., pre-transplantation, intraoperative, and post-transplantation]. Methylene blue (MB) has been a well-established pharmacologic therapy for VS. However, it has been known to cause dose-related toxicity. Hydroxocobalamin (HXC) is not currently FDA approved for the management of VS, but studies have demonstrated its ability to cause an increase in systolic blood pressure by hypothesized mechanisms with only minimal side effects. To date, only three other reports have demonstrated the use of HXC in LT patients, which highlighted its use both intraoperatively and post-transplantation. Our report illustrates the utility of HXC in four LT patients with VS. Two of these cases illustrate the usefulness of HXC in the pre-transplantation period, which has never been previously reported. HXC is a useful pharmaceutical agent in the management of VS, especially if contraindications to MB exist or in cases of MB-resistant vasoplegia. Further studies with large sample sizes are necessary to ascertain the optimal dosage of HXC in LT patients.","Sakpal, Sujit Vijay; Reedstrom, Hannah; Ness, Cody; Klinkhammer, Tobin; Saucedo-Crespo, Hector; Auvenshine, Christopher; Santella, Robert N.; Steers, Jeffery",Drugs Ther Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102271/,449

7594,Mitteilungen der DGRh,2020-04-02,"I have observed a relationship between GC content in coding sequences of RNA viruses and their genome polarity. Positive-stranded RNA viruses have significantly higher GC contents than negative-stranded RNA viruses. Coding sequences of all negative-stranded RNA viruses are biased toward high A in coding strands (high T in genomes), while two distinct patterns were observed among positive-stranded RNA genomes. This finding suggests that RNA viruses with different genome polarity are under different mutational pressure, which may be a consequence of the difference in the strategies of viral genome expression and replication. The GC content directly affects the viral codon adaptation index using highly expressed human genes as the reference set, which may theoretically predict the efficiency of viral gene expression in human cells.","Auewarakul, Prasert",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114242/,449

9620,Nekrotisierende Pneumonie durch Panton-Valentin-Leukozidin(PVL)-positiven Staphylococcus aureus nach Parainfluenza-2-Infektion,2020-04-14,"BACKGROUND: The first month is the most crucial period for child survival. Neonatal mortality continues to remain high with little improvement over the years in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. This region shows the least progress in reducing neonatal mortality and continues to be a significant public health issue. In this study setting, the causes and predictors of neonatal death in the neonatal intensive care units are not well documented. Hence, this study aimed to determine the causes and predictors of neonatal mortality among infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units in eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based in prospective follow-up study was conducted among neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals of eastern Ethiopia from November 1 to December 30, 2018. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and a follow-up checklist. The main outcomes and causes of death were set by pediatricians and medical residents. EpiData 3.1 and Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 25 software were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of facility-based neonatal mortality. RESULTS: The proportion of facility-based neonatal mortality was 20% (95% CI:16.7–23.8%). The causes of death were complications of preterm birth (28.58%), birth asphyxia (22.45%), neonatal infection (18.36%), meconium aspiration syndrome (9.18%), respiratory distress syndrome (7.14%), and congenital malformation (4.08%). Low birth weight, preterm births, length of stay of the neonatal intensive care unit, low 5 min APGAR score, hyperthermia, and initiation of feeding were predictors of neonatal death among infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals in eastern Ethiopia. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of facility-based neonatal deaths was unacceptably high. The main causes of death were preventable and treatable. Hence, improving the timing and quality of antenatal care is essential for early detection, anticipating high-risk newborns, and timely interventions. Furthermore, early initiation of feeding and better referral linkage to tertiary health facilities could lead to a reduction in neonatal death in this setting.","Desalew, Assefa; Sintayehu, Yitagesu; Teferi, Nardos; Amare, Firehiwot; Geda, Bifitu; Worku, Teshager; Abera, Kebebush; Asefaw, Abiyot",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155275/,449
10547,Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft für Gastroenterologie in NRW,2020-04-24,"BACKGROUND: Evaluating cirrhotic severity is essential for individualizing surgical modalities for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous study proposed a non-invasive method named cirrhotic severity scoring (CSS) to stage liver cirrhosis. Indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG-R15) has been widely used for the preoperative evaluation of hepatic functional reserve; however, whether ICG-R15 is well correlated with cirrhotic severity, and especially whether comparable with CSS in predicting cirrhotic severity in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function remains unknown. METHODS: Overall, 510 HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function undergoing hepatectomy between January 2011 and December 2014 were retrospectively studied. Cirrhotic severity was pathologically assessed using the Laennec staging system. The correlations between ICG-R15, CSS, and cirrhotic severity were analyzed. Furthermore, the performance of ICG-R15 and CSS in predicting posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) and 90-day mortality was compared. RESULTS: Patients with no, mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis accounted for 15.9%, 29.2%, 35.9%, and 19.0%, respectively, in the entire cohort. ICG-R15 was found to be less than 10% in 100%, 93.3%, 86.3%, and 70.1% of the patients with no, mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis, respectively. There was only a weak correlation between ICG-R15 and the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis (r = 0.325; P < 0.001). However, CSS showed a strong correlation with the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis (r = 0.788; P < 0.001). For those with ICG-R15 in the normal range, the accuracy of CSS in diagnosing no/mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis was 89.1%, 72.8%, and 72.1%, respectively. In addition, CSS was superior to ICG-R15 in predicting PHLF and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CSS was more useful than ICG-R15 in the preoperative assessment of cirrhotic severity in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function. More studies are needed to further validate CSS in patients with different Child-Pugh grades.","Gu, Jin; Zhang, Erlei; Liang, Binyong; Zhang, Zunyi; Chen, Xiaoping; Huang, Zhiyong",World J Surg Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181509/,449

However, many patients treated with oseltamivir developed adverse reactions, including hypersensitivity, gastritis, and neurological symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in Mexican patients treated with oseltamivir and whether these ADRs are associated with SNPs of the genes involved in the metabolism, transport, and interactions of oseltamivir. This study recruited 310 Mexican patients with acute respiratory diseases and treated them with oseltamivir (75 mg/day for 5 days) because they were suspected to have influenza A/H1N1 virus infection. Clinical data were obtained from medical records and interviews. Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan probes. The association was assessed under genetic models with contingency tables and logistic regression analysis. Out of 310 patients, only 38 (12.25%) presented ADRs to oseltamivir: hypersensitivity (1.9%), gastritis (10%), and depression and anxiety (0.9%). The polymorphism ABCB1-rs1045642 was associated with adverse drug reactions under the recessive model (P = 0.017); allele C was associated with no adverse drug reactions, while allele T was associated with adverse drug reactions. The polymorphisms SLC15A1-rs2297322, ABCB1-rs2032582, and CES1-rs2307243 were not consistent with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and no other associations were found for the remaining polymorphisms. In conclusion, the polymorphism rs1045642 in the transporter encoded by the ABCB1 gene is a potential predictive biomarker of ADRs in oseltamivir treatment.","Bermúdez de León, Mario; León-Cachón, Rafael B.

V. 2020,2020-08-31,"BACKGROUND: Egypt is a country of nearly 100 million citizens, and there are less than 1000 registered psychiatrists. The mental health care system is under resourced and nearly inaccessible for the majority of the population. In addition, youth under the age of 25 years represent 50% of Egyptian citizens; however, there are no specific services addressing their unique needs. How can the needs of the largest population in the Middle East be effectively addressed? Is a web-based framework an option for Egyptian psychiatrists to serve the population? OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to better understand the opinions of psychiatrists on the current state of mental health care services in Egypt and their current knowledge on electronic mental health (EMH); assess the attitudes of Egyptian psychiatrists toward web-based interventions and telemedicine for mental health; and identify perceived advantages and barriers of EMH development in Egypt. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online among 640 Egyptian psychiatrists. It included a total of 36 items within a set of 16 questions asking about EMH literacy, integrating EMH into the mental health care system, and the perceived priorities and barriers of EMH. The sampling was supported by Tanta University, a large academic institution close to Cairo. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25 (IBM Corp). Descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, the independent sample t test, and analysis of variance were applied. RESULTS: A total of 188 participants responded (response rate of 29.4%), of which 54.2% (102/188) were female and 54.3% (102/188) were between 30 and 45 years old. Less than half of the participants thought that the current health care system was efficient for adults (69/155, 44.4%), and even less thought it was efficient for youth (44/155, 28.3%). Almost all participants agreed that EMH would be beneficial for patient care (147/155, 94.8%) and that integrating EMH into the current health care system would be a good idea (118/155, 76.2%). The highest rated utility of web-based solutions was documentation, followed by psychoeducation and communication with professionals. The main advantages were to improve access to care in rural areas of the country and its convenience. CONCLUSIONS: There is scarcity of mental health resources in Egypt. Egyptian psychiatrists are interested in EMH and believe web-based platforms can become part of the solution for the Egyptian mental health care system.","Kamel, Mostafa Mamdouh; Westenberg, Jean Nicolas; Choi, Fiona; Tabi, Katarina; Badawy, Adel; Ramy, Hisham; Elsawi, Hossam; Krausz, Michael",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453323/,449
13166,Mitteilungen der DGU,2020-10-09,"BACKGROUND: Two of the most important causes of global disease fall in the realm of environmental health: household air pollution (HAP) and poor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) conditions. Interventions, such as clean cookstoves, household water treatment, and improved sanitation facilities, have great potential to yield reductions in disease burden. However, in recent trials and implementation efforts, interventions to improve HAP and WASH conditions have shown few of the desired health gains, raising fundamental questions about current approaches. OBJECTIVES: We describe how the failure to consider the complex systems that characterize diverse real-world conditions may doom promising new approaches prematurely. We provide examples of the application of systems approaches, including system dynamics, network analysis, and agent-based modeling, to the global environmental health priorities of HAP and WASH research and programs. Finally, we offer suggestions on how to approach systems science. METHODS: Systems science applied to environmental health can address major challenges by a) enhancing understanding of existing system structures and behaviors that accelerate or impede aims; b) developing understanding and agreement on a problem among stakeholders; and c) guiding intervention and policy formulation. When employed in participatory processes that engage study populations, policy makers, and implementers, systems science helps ensure that research is responsive to local priorities and reflect real-world conditions. Systems approaches also help interpret unexpected outcomes by revealing emergent properties of the system due to interactions among variables, yielding complex behaviors and sometimes counterintuitive results. DISCUSSION: Systems science offers powerful and underused tools to accelerate our ability to identify barriers and facilitators to success in environmental health interventions. This approach is especially useful in the context of implementation research because it explicitly accounts for the interaction of processes occurring at multiple scales, across social and environmental dimensions, with a particular emphasis on linkages and feedback among these processes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7010","Rosenthal, Joshua; Arku, Raphael E.; Baumgartner, Jill; Brown, Joe; Clasen, Thomas; Eisenberg, Joseph N.S.; Hovmand, Peter; Jagger, Pamela; Luke, Douglas A.; Quinn, Ashlinn; Yadama, Gautam N.",Environ Health Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7546437/,449
14147,Mitteilungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Pathologie,2020-11-17,"Although existing literature increasingly suggests a positive influence of pet ownership on human physical activity levels, results from many European, American, and Japanese studies have been inconsistent. How pet ownership impacts mental health and atopy is likewise controversial and whether distinct demographic subgroups experience differential effects is unclear. This cross-sectional study surveyed participants (n = 823) via a self-administered online questionnaire. Comparisons of outcomes between pet owners and non-pet owners with subgroup analyses were performed within a propensity score-matched subset (n = 566) of respondents. There were no differences in physical activity levels or mental health scores between pet owners and non-pet owners. In subgroup analyses, compared to non-pet owners, main pet caregivers reported 14.1 (95% CI 2.79–25.3) and 19.0 (95% CI 4.70–33.3) more minutes per week of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity respectively and higher SF-36 emotional well-being (β = 2.7, 95% CI 0.100–5.32) and energy scores (β = 3.8, 95% CI 0.410–7.27). Age was a significant effect modifier of the association between pet ownership and emotional well-being, energy and social functioning scores, with greater scores above the ages of 39, 35 and 39 years old respectively (interaction p = 0.043, 0.044, 0.042). Finally, pet acquisition was associated with worsening of allergic rhinitis, while pet ownership cessation was associated with improvement of allergic rhinitis and eczema symptoms.

We have built the COVID-19 Knowledge Extractor (COKE), a web application to extract, curate, and annotate essential drug-target relationships from the research literature on COVID-19 to assist drug repurposing efforts. Materials and Methods: SciBiteAI ontological tagging of the COVID Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a repository of COVID-19 scientific publications, was employed to identify drug-target relationships. Entity identifiers were resolved through lookup routines using UniProt and DrugBank. A custom algorithm was used to identify co-occurrences of protein and drug terms, and confidence scores were calculated for each entity pair. Results: COKE processing of the current CORD-19 database identified about 3,000 drug-protein pairs, including 29 unique proteins and 500 investigational, experimental, and approved drugs. Some of these drugs are presently undergoing clinical trials for COVID-19. Discussion: The rapidly evolving situation concerning the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a dramatic growth of publications on this subject in a short period. These circumstances call for methods that can condense the literature into the key concepts and relationships necessary for insights into SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing. Conclusion: The COKE repository and web application deliver key drug - target protein relationships to researchers studying SARS-CoV-2.

Results demonstrated that a higher level of neighborhood street-view greenery was associated with a lower fear of crime, and its relationship was mediated by perceived physical incivilities. While increasing street greenery of the micro-environment may reduce fear of crime, this paper also suggests that social factors should be considered when designing ameliorative programs.","Jing, Fengrui; Liu, Lin; Zhou, Suhong; Song, Jiangyu; Wang, Linsen; Zhou, Hanlin; Wang, Yiwen; Ma, Ruofei",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7794801/,449

Successful policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) interventions to reduce obesity must reflect the circumstances of the population. We used a health equity lens to identify barriers and facilitators for healthy food access in Martin County, Kentucky, to design interventions responsive to social, cultural, and historical contexts. METHODS: We conducted 5 focus groups in Martin County, Kentucky, in fall 2019 to obtain perspectives on the local food system and gauge acceptability of PSE interventions. We used grounded theory to identify perceived barriers and facilitators for healthy eating. RESULTS: Thirty-four adults (27 women; median age, 46 years) participated in 5 groups. One prominent theme was declining interest in farming; many participants believed this decline was generational. One participant noted, “Most of my adult male relatives worked in the coal mines, and they worked 6 days a week. . . . My grandpa had the garden, but then my dad’s generation is the one quit gardening.” Another shared, “You would probably have to have someone to teach [gardening].” Instead of enhancing farmers markets, participants suggested building community capacity for home gardens to increase vegetable consumption. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the importance of obtaining community input on the development of PSE interventions to mitigate inequities in obesity. Although farmers market interventions were deemed not feasible, other solutions to enhance access to produce were identified. Developers of community-responsive PSE interventions to improve healthy eating in rural, food-insecure locations should consider using an equity-oriented prevention framework to ensure acceptable interventions.","Cardarelli, Kathryn; DeWitt, Emily; Gillespie, Rachel; Norman-Burgdolf, Heather; Jones, Natalie; Mullins, Janet Tietyen",Prev Chronic Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7784552/,449

Mouse NLRP1B can be activated through proteolytic cleavage by the bacterial Lethal Toxin (LeTx) protease, resulting in degradation of the N-terminal domains of NLRP1B and liberation of the bioactive C-terminal domain, which includes the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). However, natural pathogen-derived effectors that can activate human NLRP1 have remained unknown. Here, we use an evolutionary model to identify several proteases from diverse picornaviruses that cleave human NLRP1 within a rapidly evolving region of the protein, leading to host-specific and virus-specific activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome. Our work demonstrates that NLRP1 acts as a 'tripwire' to recognize the enzymatic function of a wide range of viral proteases and suggests that host mimicry of viral polyprotein cleavage sites can be an evolutionary strategy to activate a robust inflammatory immune response.","Tsu, Brian V; Beierschmitt, Christopher; Ryan, Andrew P; Agarwal, Rimjhim; Mitchell, Patrick S; Daugherty, Matthew D",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7857732/,449

The purpose of this work is to analyze the role of VSM in this context. To do so, a scoping review of works from recent years (2015 to 2019) was done. The results show that most applications of VSM reported are in the tertiary level of care, and the United States of America (USA) is the country which leads most of the applications published. In relation with the development of VSM, a heterogeneity in the maps and the sustainability indicators is remarkable. Moreover, only operational and social sustainability indicators are commonly included.

The drugs currently used to treat visceral leishmaniasis suffer from toxicity and the emergence of parasite resistance, and so a better solution would be the development of an effective subunit vaccine; however, no approved vaccine currently exists. The comparative testing of a large number of vaccine candidates requires a quantitative and reproducible experimental murine infection model, but the parameters that influence infection pathology have not been systematically determined. To address this, we have established an infection model using a transgenic luciferase-expressing L. donovani parasite and longitudinally quantified the infections using in vivo bioluminescent imaging within individual mice. We examined the effects of varying the infection route, the site of adjuvant formulation administration, and standardised the parasite preparation and dose. We observed that the increase in parasite load within the liver during the first few weeks of infection was directly proportional to the parasite number in the initial inoculum. Finally, we show that immunity can be induced in pre-exposed animals that have resolved an initial infection. This murine infection model provides a platform for systematic subunit vaccine testing against visceral leishmaniasis.","Ong, Han Boon; Clare, Simon; Roberts, Adam Jonathan; Wilson, Mary Elizabeth; Wright, Gavin James",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7070049/,449

These channels are widely expressed in the cardiovascular and nervous systems and exist in many other human tissues and cell types, playing several crucial roles in the human physiological and pathological processes. Hence, the emergence of TRPCs modulators can help investigate these channels’ applications in health and disease. It is worth noting that the TRPCs subfamilies have structural and functional similarities, which presents a significant difficulty in screening and discovering of TRPCs modulators. In the past few years, only a limited number of selective modulators of TRPCs were detected; thus, additional research on more potent and more selective TRPCs modulators is needed. The present review focuses on the striking desired therapeutic effects of TRPCs modulators, which provides intel on the structural modification of TRPCs modulators and further pharmacological research.

In the current study, we integrated the physicochemical properties of Poly (caprolactone)/ Poly (vinyl alcohol)/Collagen (PCL/PVA/Col) nanofibers with the biological activities of Momordica charantia pulp extract to develop an efficient wound dressing. The electrospinning method was applied to fabricate the nanofibers, and the prepared wound dressings were thoroughly characterized. RESULTS: SEM imaging showed that the nanofibers were uniform, straight, without any beds with a diameter in the range of 260 to 480 nm. Increasing the concentration of the extract increased the diameter of the nanofibers and also the wettability characteristics while reduced the ultimate tensile strength from 4.37 ± 0.90 MPa for PCL/PVA/Col to 1.62 ± 0.50 MPa for PCL/PVA/Col/Ex 10% (p < 0.05). The in vivo studies showed that the application of the wound dressings significantly enhanced the healing process and the highest wound closure, 94.01 ± 8.12%, was obtained by PCL/PVA/Col/Ex 10% nanofibers (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The incorporation of the extract had no significant effects on nanofibers’ porosity, water vapor permeability, and swelling characteristics. The in vitro evaluations showed that the fabricated nanofibers were hemocompatible, cytocompatible, and prevent bacterial penetration through the dressing.

Although still a young and scarce subject, research has revealed that social media has addictive potential. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore the associations between problematic use of social media and mental distress, problematic gaming and gambling, within the Swedish general population. METHODS: Data from 2,118 respondents was collected through self-report questions on demographics and validated scales measuring addiction-like experiences of social media, problem gaming, problem gambling, and mental distress. Associations were analyzed in unadjusted analyses and–for variables not exceedingly inter-correlated–in adjusted logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, problematic use of social media demonstrated a relationship with younger age, time using instant messaging services, and mental distress, but not with education level, occupational status, or with treatment needs for alcohol or drug problems. Behavioral addictions (internet, gaming and gambling) were substantially inter-correlated, and all were associated with problematic use of social media in unadjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Social media use is associated with other addictive behaviors and mental distress. While factors of causality remain to be studied, these insights can motivate healthcare professionals to assess social media habits, for example in individuals suffering from issues concerning gambling, gaming or mental health.","Henzel, Vincent; Håkansson, Anders",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8032197/,449
17146,Rebuttal From Drs Sulmasy and Maldonado,2021-02-02,"BACKGROUND: Many patients with lower limb edema do not tolerate traditional higher-pressure compression devices and require alternative devices for edema control. METHODS: Two systems were evaluated for control of bilateral or unilateral lower limb edema: an elasticized longitudinal stockinette (ELS; EdemaWear; Compression Dynamics, Omaha, Nebraska) and an elasticized tubular bandage (ETB; Tubigrip; Mölnlycke Health Care, Norcross, Georgia). Twenty-five patients were recruited; patients with bilateral edema (n = 12) wore the ELS on one limb, and the ETB on the other. Patients with unilateral edema (n = 13) were randomized to wear either the ELS or ETB. Edema measurements, leg pain, and patient preference were recorded. RESULTS: There were 14 females (56%) and 11 males (44%); mean age was 66 years (range, 32-88 years); and mean body mass index was 40.4 kg/m(2) (range, 26.1–66.9 kg/m(2)). Patients with bilateral edema wearing ELS had a foot-to-leg circumference between 25.5 and 42.9 cm pre-ELS that remained essentially unchanged at 2 weeks. The five patients with unilateral edema using ELS had a 24.3– to 43.7-cm circumference pre-ELS and 24.2- to 42.6-cm range at 2 weeks. The patients with bilateral edema using ETBs had a foot-to-leg circumference of 25.5 to 43.7 cm before treatment, unchanged 2 weeks later. The eight patients with unilateral edema using ETB had a 25.4- to 45.3-cm circumference pre-ETB and 24.8– to 42.0-cm range post-ETB. Mean pain levels decreased from 1.0 at week 0 to 0.5 at week 2. More patients preferred ELS (17/23, 78.3%) over ETB (5/23, 21.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Both systems were easy to apply and provided low compression without increased pain. The ELS was preferred by more patients (78.3%) than ETB (21.7%).","Sibbald, R.

Constructing the transmission model of SFTS could help provide clues for disease control and fill the gap in research on SFTS models. METHODS: We built an SFTS transmission dynamics model based on the susceptible–exposed–infectious–asymptomatic–recovered (SEIAR) model and the epidemiological characteristics of SFTS in Jiangsu Province. This model was used to evaluate the effect by cutting off different transmission routes and taking different interventions into account, to offer clues for disease prevention and control. RESULTS: The transmission model fits the reported data well with a minimum R(2) value of 0.29 and a maximum value of 0.80, P < 0.05. Meanwhile, cutting off the environmental transmission route had the greatest effect on the prevention and control of SFTS, while isolation and shortening the course of the disease did not have much effect. CONCLUSIONS: The model we have built can be used to simulate the transmission of SFTS to help inform disease control. It is noteworthy that cutting off the environment-to-humans transmission route in the model had the greatest effect on SFTS prevention and control.

17307,Mitteilungen der DGIIN,2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Digital technologies (DTs) for older adults focus mainly on health care and are considered to have the potential to improve the well-being of older adults. However, adoption rates of these DTs are considered low. Although previous research has investigated possible reasons for adoption and acceptance of DT, age-based stereotypes (eg, those held by health care professionals) toward the abilities of older adults to use DTs have yet to be considered as possible barriers to adoption. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the influencing role of ageism in the context of health care professionals attitudes toward older adults’ abilities to use health care DT. A further goal was to examine if social comparison and stereotype activation affect and moderate this association. METHODS: A new measurement to assess health care professionals’ attitudes toward older adults using technology (ATOAUT-10) was developed and used in 2 studies. Study 1 involved the development of the ATOAUT-10 scale using a principal component analysis and further examined health care professionals’ attitudes toward the use of health care DTs and correlations with ageism. Study 2 further explored the correlation between ageism and ATOAUT in an experimental design with health care professionals. RESULTS: In study 1, physiotherapists (N=97) rated older adults as young as 50 years as less able to use health care DT compared to younger adults (P<.001). A multiple regression analysis revealed that higher levels of ageism, beyond other predictors, were predictive of more negative ATOAUT, (β=.36; t=3.73; P<.001). In study 2, the salience of age was manipulated. Health care professionals (N=93) were randomly assigned to rate the abilities of a young or old person to use health care DT. Old age salience moderated the correlation between ageism and ATOAUT (R(2)=0.19; F(6,85)=3.35; P=.005), such that higher levels of ageism correlated with more negative ATOAUT in the old age salient condition, but not the young condition. Stereotype activation accounted for health care professionals’ attitudes more than did the experience of working with older patients or the professionals’ age. CONCLUSIONS: Negative and ageist attitudes of health care professionals can potentially affect how older adults are viewed in relation to DT and consequently might influence actual use and adoption of technology-based treatment. Future studies should broaden the validation of the ATOAUT-10 scale on more diverse samples and focus on the discriminatory aspect of ageism and self-ageism of older adults. This study calls for a focus on ageism as a determinant of adoption of DT.","Mannheim, Ittay; Wouters, Eveline J M; van Boekel, Leonieke C; van Zaalen, Yvonne",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8100887/,449

Fish harvest and biodiversity data remain largely disparate and severely deficient in many areas, which makes assessing and managing inland fisheries difficult. Expert knowledge is increasingly used to improve and inform biological or vulnerability assessments, especially in data-poor areas. Integrating expert knowledge on the distribution, intensity, and relative influence of human activities can guide natural resource management strategies and institutional resource allocation and prioritization. This paper introduces a dataset summarizing the expert-perceived state of inland fisheries at the basin (fishery) level. An electronic survey distributed to professional networks (June-September 2020) captured expert perceptions (n = 536) of threats, successes, and adaptive capacity to fisheries across 93 hydrological basins, 79 countries, and all major freshwater habitat types. This dataset can be used to address research questions with conservation relevance, including: demographic influences on perceptions of threat, adaptive capacities for climate change, external factors driving multi-stressor interactions, and geospatial threat assessments.","Stokes, Gretchen L.; Lynch, Abigail J.; Funge-Smith, Simon; Valbo‐Jørgensen, John; Beard, T.

This study aims to assess the relevance of viral genomic data for the prediction of severe influenza A(H3N2) infections among patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), in view of risk assessment and patient management. METHODS: 160 A(H3N2) influenza positive samples from the 2016–2017 season originating from the Belgian SARI surveillance were selected for whole genome sequencing. Predictor variables for severity were selected using a penalized elastic net logistic regression model from a combined host and genomic dataset, including patient information and nucleotide mutations identified in the viral genome. The goodness-of-fit of the model combining host and genomic data was compared using a likelihood-ratio test with the model including host data only. Internal validation of model discrimination was conducted by calculating the optimism-adjusted area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) for both models. RESULTS: The model including viral mutations in addition to the host characteristics had an improved fit ([Formula: see text] =12.03, df = 3, p = 0.007). The optimism-adjusted AUC increased from 0.671 to 0.732. CONCLUSIONS: Adding genomic data (selected season-specific mutations in the viral genome) to the model containing host characteristics improved the prediction of severe influenza infection among hospitalized SARI patients, thereby offering the potential for translation into a prospective strategy to perform early season risk assessment or to guide individual patient management.

In preparation for a future randomized controlled trial, this pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component intervention (I-SLEEP) that educates and empowers inpatients to advocate for fewer nighttime disruptions in order to improve sleep during periods of hospitalization. METHODS: Eligible inpatients received I-SLEEP, which included an educational video, brochure, sleep kit, and three questions patients can ask their team to reduce nighttime disruptions. Following I-SLEEP, inpatients were surveyed on the primary feasibility outcomes of satisfaction with and use of I-SLEEP components. Inpatients were also surveyed regarding empowerment and understanding of intervention materials. Patient charts were reviewed to collect data on nighttime (11 PM–7 AM) vital sign and blood draws disruptions. RESULTS: Ninety percent (n = 26/29) of patients were satisfied with the brochure and 87% (n = 27/31) with the video. Nearly all (95%, n = 36/37) patients felt empowered to ask their providers to minimize nighttime disruptions and 68% (n = 26/37) intended to alter sleep habits post-discharge. Forty-nine percent (n = 18/37) of patients asked an I-SLEEP question. Patients who asked an I-SLEEP question were significantly more likely to experience nights with fewer disruptions due to nighttime vitals (19% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: This pilot study found that I-SLEEP was well-accepted and enabled hospitalized patients to advocate for less disrupted sleep. Educating patients to advocate for reducing nighttime disruptions may be a patient-centered, low-cost strategy to improve patients’ care and in-hospital experience. These results suggest that I-SLEEP is ready to be evaluated against routine care in a future randomized controlled trial.

20304,Mitteilungen der DGIM,2021-08-25,"Giant lung bullae are usually seen in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Over time, air trapping leads to severe dyspnea and CO(2) accumulation. In severe cases, overinflation and rupture of the bulla can cause secondary life-threatening tension pneumothorax. Since positive pressure ventilation exerts deleterious effects on the bulla, general anesthesia is always challenging in patients with giant bullae. We encountered remarkable intraoperative hypercapnia and decreased tidal volume in a 58-year-old male patient with bilateral bullae who underwent right upper bullectomy, due to overinflation of a bulla located in the upper lobe of the ventilated side. Through this experience, to avoid further overinflation, we devised an original, unique and simple airway management strategy using a standard double lumen tube (DLT), which only requires slightly deeper advancement of the DLT to achieve selective lobar blockade during one lung ventilation (OLV). Following the first case, we used this strategy in a 48-year-old male patient who underwent left giant bullectomy, resulting in successful airway management without overinflation during OLV. We recommend our strategy as an option for successful intraoperative airway management during OLV in select bullectomy patients with bilateral giant bullae.","Kawagoe, Izumi; Hayashida, Masakazu; Satoh, Daizoh; Kudoh, Osamu; Fukuda, Masataka; Kochiyama, Tsukasa; Kishii, Jun; Mitaka, Chieko",J Anesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8387664/,449

The use of percutaneous bone cement [polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)] injection for pain management and strengthening in pelvic bone metastasis has rarely been reported. To evaluate this method, we aimed to determine surgical outcomes and complications over a long-term follow-up period using a large patient group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 178 patients who underwent percutaneous cementoplasty for pelvic metastatic lesions, 201 in total. Surgical outcomes evaluated included pain reduction and improvement of ambulation. Mortality within 1 month after procedure and pulmonary embolism caused by thrombus, fat, tumor emboli, or bone cement were investigated as surgical complications. For long-term survivors, pain relapse and mechanical failure were analyzed. The mean follow-up period was 12.6 months, and there were 159 fatalities at last follow-up. RESULTS: The mean regional pain numerical rating scale scores decreased from 6.1 preoperatively to 2.4 1 month after procedure (p < 0.01). Gait function was maintained, worsened, and uncheckable in 68%, 24%, and 8% of patients, respectively, 1 month after procedure.

Here, we conducted a nationwide study to assess the outcome of SCID patients after HCT in Japan. METHODS: A cohort of 181 SCID patients undergoing their first allogeneic HCT in 1974–2016 was studied by using the Japanese national database (Transplant Registry Unified Management Program, TRUMP). RESULTS: The 10-year overall survival (OS) of the patients who received HCT in 2006–2016 was 67%. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation was performed in 81 patients (45%). The outcomes of HCT from HLA-matched UCB (n = 21) and matched sibling donors (n = 22) were comparable, including 10-year OS (91% vs. 91%), neutrophil recovery (cumulative incidence at 30 days, 89% vs. 100%), and platelet recovery (cumulative incidence at 60 days, 89% vs. 100%). Multivariate analysis of the patients who received HCT in 2006–2016 demonstrated that the following factors were associated with poor OS: bacterial or fungal infection at HCT (hazard ratio (HR): 3.8, P = 0.006), cytomegalovirus infection prior to HCT (HR: 9.4, P = 0.03), ≥ 4 months of age at HCT (HR: 25.5, P = 0.009), and mismatched UCB (HR: 19.8, P = 0.01).

20742,Abstracts des 33. Jahreskongresses der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Geriatrie,2021-09-01,"RBPs (RNA-binding proteins) play critical roles in human biology and disease. Aberrant RBP expression affects various steps in RNA processing, altering the function of the target RNAs. The RBP SRSF4 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 4) has been linked to neuropathies and cancer. However, its role in the heart is completely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of SRSF4 in the heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: Echocardiography of mice specifically lacking SRSF4 in the heart (SRSF4 KO) revealed left ventricular hypertrophy and increased cardiomyocyte area, which led to progressive diastolic dysfunction with age. SRSF4 KO mice showed altered electrophysiological activity under isoproterenol-induced cardiac stress, with a post-QRS depression and a longer QT interval, indicating an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death. RNA-Seq analysis revealed expression changes in several long noncoding RNAs, including GAS5 (growth arrest-specific 5), which we identified as a direct SRSF4 target in cardiomyocytes by individual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immuno-precipitation. GAS5 is a repressor of the GR (glucocorticoid receptor) and was downregulated in SRSF4 KO hearts. This corresponded with elevated GR transcriptional activity in cardiomyocytes, leading to increases in hypertrophy markers and cell size. Furthermore, hypertrophy in SRSF4 KO cardiomyocytes was reduced by overexpressing GAS5. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of SRSF4 expression results in cardiac hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and abnormal repolarization. The molecular mechanism underlying this effect involves GAS5 downregulation and consequent elevation of GR transcriptional activity. Our findings may help to develop new therapeutic tools for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial pathology in patients with Cushing syndrome.","Larrasa-Alonso, Javier; Villalba-Orero, María; Martí-Gómez, Carlos; Ortiz-Sánchez, Paula; López-Olañeta, Marina M.; Rey-Martín, M.

Here, we identified a short peptide named P2, which has a higher proportion of basic residues than the CDN1 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1) protein it is derived from, and we used bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation to confirm the penetration property of peptide P2. We found that peptide P2 can efficiently enter different cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. The endocytosis pathway, especially receptor-related endocytosis, may be involved in the process of P2 penetration. Our data also showed that peptide P2 is safe in cultured cell lines and red blood cells. Lastly, peptide P2 can efficiently deliver self-labeling protein HaloTag into cells for imaging.

20779,Tabakentwöhnung - Strategien für die Praxis,2021-09-09,"BACKGROUND: Although fingerstick is often favorably compared to venipuncture as a less invasive method of drawing blood for clinical labs, there is little empirical research that compares physical and psychological stress responses to fingerstick vs. venipuncture (blood draw using a needle in the arm) within the same person. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We assessed changes in cortisol (a stress hormone), heart rate variability (a marker of autonomic stress), and psychological stress in 40 healthy women who completed both venipuncture and fingerstick. Contrary to our predictions, there was a significant decline in cortisol across conditions, with greater decline from pre- to post-draw in response to venipuncture than fingerstick. There were similar patterns of rise and fall in heart rate variability in both types of blood draw, suggestive of mild vasovagal responses. Psychological measures of stress (such as negative emotion and perceived stress) were generally stronger predictors of participant’s reported pain and blood draw preferences than physical stress measures. CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the characterization of fingerstick as necessarily “less invasive” than venipuncture, as participant’s stress responses to fingerstick were equivalent to (and for some measures greater than) their response to venipuncture. Heart rate variability response to fingerstick significantly predicted that individual’s vasovagal-like responses to venipuncture, suggesting that measuring heart rate variability during pre-donation hemoglobin testing may identify donors at risk for adverse events during venipuncture.","Lorenz, Tierney K.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415584/,449

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parents’ preferences and experiences regarding transparency of their child’s health care costs. Multivariable linear regression examined associations between clinical and sociodemographic variables with parents’ preferences for knowing, discussing, and considering costs in the clinical setting. Factors included family financial difficulties, child’s level of chronic disease, insurance payer, deductible, family poverty level, race, ethnicity, parental educational level, and study site. RESULTS: Of 644 invited participants, 526 (82%) were enrolled (290 [55%] male), of whom 362 (69%) were White individuals, 400 (76%) were non-Hispanic/Latino individuals, and 274 (52%) had children with private insurance. Overall, 397 families (75%) wanted to discuss their child’s medical costs, but only 36 (7%) reported having a cost conversation. If cost discussions were to occur, 294 families (56%) would prefer to speak to a financial counselor. Ninety-eight families (19%) worried discussing costs would hurt the quality of their child’s care. Families with a medical financial burden unrelated to their hospitalized child had higher mean agreement that their child’s physician should consider the family’s costs in medical decision-making than families without a medical financial burden (effect size, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.18-0.92]). No variables were consistently associated with cost transparency preferences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most parents want to discuss their child’s costs during an acute hospitalization. Discussions of health care costs may be an important, relatively unexplored component of family-centered care. However, these discussions rarely occur, indicating a tremendous opportunity to engage and support families in this issue.","Bassett, Hannah K.; Beck, Jimmy; Coller, Ryan J.; Flaherty, Brian; Tiedt, Kristin A.; Hummel, Kevin; Tchou, Michael J.; Kapphahn, Kristopher; Walker, Lauren; Schroeder, Alan R.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8456391/,449

These sequences were then analyzed along with the classical strain (ch-1a) and two other epidemic strains SD (3) and SD2006. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence with ch-1a indicated that nsp2 genes of seventeen Ningxia isolates (NX strain) have deletions of 87 nucleotides. Sequence analysis indicated that homology between the Ningxia strain and ch-1a was 60.3%–79.9% in the nucleotide sequence, and homology between the NX strains and SD strains was 80.3%–98.8% in the nucleotide sequence. The nsp2 genes of the seventeen isolates had 74.9%–100% nucleotide sequence identities with each other. This study was undertaken to assess the regional variation of prevalent PRRSV and to establish a sequence database for PRRSV molecular epidemiological studies.","Tian, Hong; Wu, Jing-yan; Yin, Shuang-hui; Shang, You-jun; Man, Zi-ping; Zhao, Na; Jin, Ye; Liu, Xiang-tao",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091468/,449
22932,Mitteilungen der DGIM,2011-05-04,"BACKGROUND: The rate of admissions to hospital with bronchiolitis has increased over the past years. The reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial including improved survival of preterm infants. AIM: To assess the severity of viral bronchiolitis in preterm compared to term infants admitted at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt, based on the outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted throughout a 3-year period from September 2011 to October 2014. It included 153 infants, 74 healthy preterm, and 79 healthy term infants admitted with clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Bronchiolitis severity score (BSS) was recorded, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from each patient at the time of presentation. Viruses were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The clinical course and patient’s outcome were recorded. RESULTS: This study recorded a significantly more severe BSS for preterm compared to term infants. The preterm group had an increased mean length of hospital stay and oxygen therapy and was more likely to need intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation (MV) compared to the term group. The mean (± SD) BSS for infections with h-MPV, RSV, and para-influenza 3 was more significantly severe in preterm compared to term infants. Bacterial co-infection was significantly correlated with severity scoring in both groups. CONCLUSION: Prematurity significantly affects the severity of bronchiolitis, and this underscores the importance of early categorization as a high-risk group on their first visit. The physician should be aware that their illness runs a more severe course, even if they have no underlying disorders.","El Basha, Noussa R.; Marzouk, Huda; Sherif, May M.; El Kholy, Amani A.",J Egypt Public Health Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091660/,449

In spite of expanding areas affected by and upsurge of these diseases in the region, the tropical urban country is known to have sustained an effective vector control, which often resulted in moderate prevalence and/or quick control of domestic outbreaks. This research has adopted an inter-disciplinary review of previous studies combined with field studies: interviewing at the Ministry of Health, Singapore and the National Environment Agency, Singapore; visiting a laboratory and hospitals; and observing on-site vector mosquito surveillance operations conducted by the agency. The findings have pointed out the national vector surveillance and control system implemented by 1970s, followed by improved countermeasures like vector and virus surveillance which have incorporated science and technology especially in the last two decades. The analysis produces an influential role of a government in promoting and supporting public health measures, which have been typically demonstrated through inter-ministry collaboration, public-private cooperation, and community involvement. In light of increasing transnational nature of emerging infectious diseases, Singapore’s contribution in the region like sharing its knowledge of and experiences in dengue and chikungunya virus infection is illustrated. The resilient model of Singapore’s vector control and governmental action warrants a further study to investigate transferability in other parts of the region.","Yoshikawa, Minako Jen",Current Topics of Infectious Diseases in Japan and Asia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120152/,449
24503,Grundlagen der systemischen Therapie,2007,"Biosurveillance is an emerging field that provides early detection of disease outbreaks by collecting and interpreting data on a variety of public health threats. The public health system and medical care community in the United States have wrestled with developing new and more accurate methods for earlier detection of threats to the health of the public. The benefits and challenges of using Emergency Department data for surveillance are described in this chapter through examples from one biosurveillance system, the North Carolina Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT). ED data are a proven tool for biosurveillance, and the ED data in NC DETECT have proved to be effective for a variety of public health uses, including surveillance, monitoring and investigation. A distinctive feature of ED data for surveillance is their timeliness. With electronic health information systems, these data are available in near real-time, making them particularly useful for surveillance and situational awareness in rapidly developing public health outbreaks or disasters. Challenges to using ED data for biosurveillance include the reliance on free text data (often in chief complaints). Problems with textual data are addressed in a variety of ways, including preprocessing data to clean the text entries and address negation. The use of ED data for public health surveillance can significantly increase the speed of detecting, monitoring and investigating public health events. Biosurveillance systems that are incorporated into hospital and public health practitioner daily work flows are more effective and easily used during a public health emergency. The flexibility of a system such as NC DETECT helps it meet this level of functionality.","Waller, Anna E.; Scholer, Matthew; Ising, Amy I.; Travers, Debbie A.",Infectious Disease Informatics and Biosurveillance,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120837/,449

The intertwining complexity of these pathogens with their diverse tissue tropisms, direct effects on host cells, multiphasic immunological responses, and additional influence of superimposed secondary agents is beyond the expertise of a single discipline in modern medicine. A combined evaluation of patient’s history, clinical manifestations, and physical examination may suggest a list of differential diagnosis, but it is often insufficient to determine the specific infectious etiology. Laboratory methods are essential to identify an etiologic agent from testing clinical samples, such as blood, serum, nasopharyngeal swab, etc. These methods, including traditional microbiological techniques, conventional immunological assays, and modern molecular methods, remain the mainstay in today’s practice of clinical microbiology and infectious disease medicine. Nevertheless, there are technical and logistic issues associated with these methods, and the test results often lack a clinicopathologic correlation that can confound the interpretation of their clinical significance. For example, microbiological culture may fail to grow a causative organism, while the organism isolated by the laboratory in vitro may arise from contamination and does not represent the actual infective agent in vivo.","Shieh, Wun-Ju; Zaki, Sherif R.",Advanced Techniques in Diagnostic Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122422/,449

Most retain at least the vestiges of genes once required for infectious horizontal transfer, namely envelope genes. In contrast, the long evolutionary histories of retrotransposons are presumed not to have included infectious ancestors. With the characterization of the Gypsy retrotransposon in Drosophila melanogaster as an infectious, endogenous retrovirus, these distinctions have blurred. A number of plant LTR retroelements possess coding regions whose conceptual translations produce hypothetical proteins with predicted structural elements found in viral envelope proteins, and the term endogenous retrovirus began to be applied to these elements. The question of whether any of the many plant retroelement genes now annotated as “env-like” generate proteins that have or had envelope functions remains unanswered.

Within the context of this spatial pattern, we evaluated the status of game in the hunting grounds of an indigenous community in eastern Ecuador. We constructed a spatially explicit model of hunter‐prey interactions that mimicked the hunting in the village and included realistic animal‐dispersal rules. We compared predictions from the model with distributions of animal harvest rates and catch per unit effort of 12 game species. Six species were overharvested in part or all of the area, and two other species were probably being overharvested, although high dispersal rates complicated the interpretation. We then compared our method with methods that have been used previously. We argue that because our method provides information about the spatial extent of overharvesting, it could be particularly useful in informing decision makers about where to establish no‐take areas and could therefore aid in improving the sustainability of hunting in tropical forests.","SIRÉN, ANDERS; HAMBÄCK, PETER; MACHOA, JOSÉ",Conserv Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202275/,449
32309,On the Weisfeiler-Leman Dimension of Fractional Packing,2020-01-07,"Disease plays a significant role as a risk factor in wildlife conservation programmes involving animal movements, such as translocation, transportation among zoos or reintroduction. However, the traditional ‘zero‐risk tolerance’ approach to the assessment of disease risk in these programmes is unattainable and unmanageable, often leading to an excessively cautious attitude towards the risks that are involved. It is therefore critically important to develop a comprehensive, unified and broadly applicable set of descriptive and analytical tools that can more realistically and accurately assess disease‐based risks in conservation‐based animal‐movement programmes. The Conservation Breeding Specialist Group, of the IUCN – World Conservation Union, has brought together an international team of wildlife medicine professionals to construct a set of qualitative and quantitative tools to assess disease risk. The tools are flexible, intuitive and span a broad range of complexities. These tools are designed to enable professionals to incorporate not only published, statistically valid data but also to make reasonable decisions under conditions of uncertainty, and to capture valuable information from more basic field or clinical experience. Selected tools from the larger ‘toolkit’ are described here, with examples from actual case studies where available.","MILLER, P.

Solid waste management protocols and system dynamic modeling support policy development as it uses waste prevention to explain the complex waste management systems and suggests methods for effective management. However, creating an effective waste system goes beyond the formulation of policies and legislation; it involves financial and technological proficiency, skilled human capacity, technical, social, resource recycling, educational awareness programs, and active public participation. Because of urbanization, Liberia’s municipal solid waste (MSW) problems have become heightened, thereby impacting the economic, social, and political fabric of society by overburdening infrastructure and social facilities. The impact of urbanization must be addressed because urbanization, amongst several factors, including unsustainable management of MSW, degrades the environment and presents risks to public health. The purpose of this review was to highlight the current waste management activities in Liberia and provide information to the readers about the challenges facing the waste management sector and the challenges impeding the development of a sustainable waste management system. In Liberia, waste management activities are getting worse daily due to shortage of a comprehensive waste management framework, the absence of guidelines regarding the responsibilities of waste generators, and the decision-makers' lack of intent to design and implement a sustainable and integrated management system. Recommendations for collaborative efforts are made by focusing on delivering a waste strategy which concentrates on waste minimization, recycling, resource recovery, and promoting sustainable waste management practices for communities, small businesses, corporations, and government institutions in Liberia and other developing countries.","David, Victor Emery; John, Yasinta; Hussain, Shahid",J Mater Cycles Waste Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202682/,449

The infection and mortality rates of the disease have forced governments to implement a wave of public health measures. Depending on the context, these range from the implementation of simple hygienic rules to measures such as social distancing or lockdowns that cause major disruptions in citizens’ daily lives. The success of these crucial public health measures rests on the public's willingness to comply. However, individual differences in following the official public health recommendations for stopping the spread of COVID-19 have not yet to our knowledge been assessed. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the sociodemographic and psychological correlates of implementing public health recommendations that aim to halt the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate these associations in the context of France, one of the countries that has been most severely affected by the pandemic, and which ended up under a nationwide lockdown on March 17. In the next sections we describe our theoretical expectations over the associations between sociodemographics, personality, ideology, and emotions with abiding by the COVID-19 public health measures.

Since students have left a large amount of online learning data, it provides an effective way to predict students’ academic performance and enable pre-intervention for at-risk students. Current data sources used to predict students’ performance are limited to data just from the corresponding learning platform, from which only learning behaviors on that course can be observed. However, students’ academic performance will be related to other behavioral factors, especially the patterns of using Internet. In this paper, we utilize two types of datasets from 505 university students, i.e., online learning records for a project-based course, and network logs of university campus network. A deep learning framework: Sequential Prediction based on Deep Network (SPDN) is proposed to predict students’ performance in the course. SPDN models students’ online behavioral sequences by utilizing multi-source fusion CNN technique, and incorporates static information based on bidirectional LSTM. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SPDN model outperforms the baselines and has a significant improvement on early-warning. Furthermore, it can be learned that Internet access patterns even have a greater impact on students’ academic performance than online learning activities.","Li, Xiang; Zhu, Xinning; Zhu, Xiaoying; Ji, Yang; Tang, Xiaosheng",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206178/,449

In the past, it stood out, that specialist constraint solvers (like simplex solver or SAT solver) outperform general constraint solvers, for the problems they can handle. The disadvantage of such specialist constraint solvers is that they can handle only a small subset of problems with special limitations to the domains of the variables and/or to the allowed constraints. In this paper we introduce the concept of fd-complete constraints and fd-complete constraint satisfaction problems, which allow combining both previous approaches. More accurately, we convert general constraint problems into problems which use only one, respectively one kind of constraint. The goal is it to interpret and solve the converted constraint problems with specialist solvers, which can solve the transformed constraint problems faster than the original solver the original constraint problems.","Löffler, Sven; Liu, Ke; Hofstedt, Petra",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256598/,449

Local techniques consider a certain subset of the behavior, but might loose the “big picture”. A combination of both techniques is promising to balance out each others drawbacks, but exists so far only in an implicit and unsystematic way.

The literature on methods for aligning tractograms is in active development and provides methods that operate either from voxel information, e.g. fractional anisotropy, orientation distribution function, T1-weighted MRI, or directly from streamline information. In this work, we align streamlines using the linear assignment problem (LAP) and propose a method to reduce the high computational cost of aligning whole brain tractograms. As further contribution, we present a comparison among some of the freely-available linear and nonlinear tractogram alignment methods, where we show that our LAP-based method outperforms all others. In discussing the results, we show that a main limitation of all streamline-based nonlinear registration methods is the computational cost and that addressing such problem may lead to further improvement in the quality of registration.","Olivetti, Emanuele; Gori, Pietro; Astolfi, Pietro; Bertó, Giulia; Avesani, Paolo",Biomedical Image Registration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7279924/,449

The infectious virus-contaminated carriers were subjected to wiping in the Wiperator per the standard. Following the use of negative control (J-Cloth)-, AHP-, or QAC-based wipes, recovery of residual infectious virus was assayed. In the case of the J-Cloth wipes (negative control), although removal of virus from inoculated carriers was extensive i.e., ~99% (1.9–3.5 log(10)) transfer of virus by these wipes to a secondary surface amounted to ≤ 2% (~3.8 log(10)) of the initial virus load. In the case of each DPW, >6 log(10) removal/inactivation of virus was observed, with limited (EBOV/Mak) or no (VSV) virus transfer observed. The efficacy of wipes for decontaminating high-touch environmental surfaces spiked with EBOV/Mak or VSV is discussed. In summary, removal of EBOV/Mak and VSV using wipes was extensive in this study. In the absence of a sufficient concentration and contact time of an appropriate microbicidal active in DPW (such as the AHP- and QAC-based DPW tested), transfer of a low, albeit significant (from an infectious unit/infectious dose perspective), quantity of infectious virus from the inoculated surface to a secondary surface was observed. In the case of Ebola virus, it is essential that a DPW with an appropriate microbicidal active, following the appropriate contact time, be used to prevent unintended transfer of infectious virus to a clean secondary surface (as observed in negative control /J-Cloth). Otherwise, there exists the possibility of dissemination of Ebola virus and the associated risk of transmission of Ebola virus disease.","Cutts, Todd A.; Robertson, Catherine; Theriault, Steven S.; Nims, Raymond W.; Kasloff, Samantha B.; Rubino, Joseph R.; Ijaz, M.

This paper describes the Hospital Availability Management System (HAMS), a software developed in the framework of the EU-funded SAFECARE project. The main goal of HAMS is to provide the current status of a hospital (or health-care facility) to the internal staff, but also to first responders (paramedics, firefighters, civil protection, etc.) in order to manage the flow of patients correctly. Beyond the data coming from the normal operations of a hospital, the HAMS is able to integrate inputs from incident detection systems deployed in the hospital, to automatically update availability data after cyber and/or physical incidents, also taking into account the propagation of impacts among interconnected assets. Finally, HAMS implements the OASIS EDXL-HAVE standard, to allow the exchange of information in a open and interoperable format.","Lubrano, Francesco; Stirano, Federico; Varavallo, Giuseppe; Bertone, Fabrizio; Terzo, Olivier","Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7283995/,449

Effective vaccines are available, but those could benefit from improvements, including increasing the immunity duration, reducing the shot frequency and adverse reactions. In addition, more sophisticated antigen delivery and potentiation systems are urgently required. The protective antigen (PA), one of three major virulence factors associated with anthrax was displayed on the surface of Bacillus subtilis spores, which is a vaccine production host and delivery vector with several advantages such as a low production cost, straightforward administration as it is safe for human consumption and the particulate adjuvanticity. Mice were immunized orally (PO), intranasally (IN), sublingually (SL) or intraperitoneally (IP) with the PA displaying probiotic spore vaccine. Clinical observation, serological analysis and challenge experiment were conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. RESULTS: A/J mice immunized with the PA spore vaccine via PO, IN, SL, and IP were observed to have increased levels of active antibody titer, isotype profiles and toxin neutralizing antibody in sera, and IgA in saliva. The immunized mice were demonstrated to raise protective immunity against the challenge with lethal B. anthracis spores. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed a B. subtilis spore vaccine that displays the PA on its surface and showed that the PA-displaying spore vaccine was able to confer active immunity to a murine model based on the results of antibody isotype titration, mucosal antibody identification, and a lethal challenge experiment.","Oh, Yeonsu; Kim, Jung Ae; Kim, Chang-Hwan; Choi, Soo-Keun; Pan, Jae-Gu",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7385935/,449

To date, little is known about the clearance effects of oscillating devices on patients with acute respiratory failure undergoing iMV. This study aimed to assess (1) the effects of high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) on lung aeration and ventilation distribution, as assessed by electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and (2) the effect of the association of HFCWO with recruitment manoeuvres (RM). METHODS: Sixty critically ill patients, 30 classified as normosecretive and 30 as hypersecretive, who received ≥ 48 h of iMV, underwent HFCWO; patients from both subgroups were randomized to receive RM or not, according to two separated randomization sequences. We therefore obtained four arms of 15 patients each. After baseline record (T0), HFCWO was applied for 10 min. At the end of the treatment (T1) or after 1 (T2) and 3 h (T3), EIT data were recorded. At the beginning of each step, closed tracheobronchial suctioning was performed. In the RM subgroup, tracheobronchial suctioning was followed by application of 30 cmH(2)O to the patient’s airway for 30 s. At each step, we assessed the change in end-expiratory lung impedance (ΔEELI) and in tidal impedance variation (ΔTIV), and the center of gravity (COG) through EIT. We also analysed arterial blood gases (ABGs). RESULTS: ΔTIV and COG did not differ between normosecretive and hypersecretive patients. Compared to T0, ΔEELI significantly increased in hypersecretive patients at T2 and T3, irrespective of the RM; on the contrary, no differences were observed in normosecretive patients. No differences of ABGs were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: In hypersecretive patients, HFCWO significantly improved aeration of the dorsal lung region, without affecting ABGs. The application of RM did not provide any further improvements.

In this study, we compared clinical outcomes and quality of life (QoL) in two group of patients undergoing APD, with and without exposure of RM. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study, comparing outcomes in two groups of APD patients monitored during 6 months with RM (group A: n = 35) or standard care (group B: n = 38 patients). In our clinical practice, we assign the RM system to patients who live more distant from the PD center or difficulty in moving. We evaluated emergency visits, hospitalizations, peritonitis, overhydration, and dropout. QoL was assessed with the Kidney Disease Quality of life-Short Form (KDQOL-SF). We included four additional questions focused on patient’s perception of monitoring, safety and timely problems solution (Do you think that home-therapy monitoring could interfere with your privacy? Do you think that your dialysis sessions are monitored frequently enough? Do you think that dialysis-related issues are solved timely? Do you feel comfortable carrying out your home-based therapy?). RESULTS: The case group presented a higher comorbidity score, according to Charlson Comorbidity Index (group A: 5.0; IQR 4.0–8.0 versus group B: 4.0; IQR 3.0–6.0) (p = 0.042). The results in group A showed a reduction in the urgent visits due to acute overhydration (group A: 0.17 ± 0.45 versus group B: 0.66 ± 1.36) (p: 0.042) and in the number of disease-specific hospitalization (group A n = 2.0; 18.2% versus group B n = 7.0; 77.8%) (p = 0.022). We did not find any difference between the two groups in terms of hospitalization because of all-cause, peritonitis, overhydration, and dropout.

Rather than focusing on their feasibility under EU law or national constitutional law, this article compares the proposals from an investor perspective against the backdrop of the following formal and functional legal characteristics that render assets ‘safe’: governing law, dispute settlement forum, investor protection, and investor representation in sovereign debt restructurings.

39337,Qualitätsmerkmale und Strukturvoraussetzungen für pädiatrische Lebertransplantationszentren,2013,"BACKGROUND: The band 9p21.3 contains an established genomic risk zone for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Since the initial 2007 Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium study (WTCCC), the increased CVD risk associated with 9p21.3 has been confirmed by multiple studies in different continents. However, many years later there was still no confirmed report of a corresponding association of 9p21.3 with hypertension, a major CV risk factor, nor with blood pressure (BP). THEORY: In this contribution, we review the bipartite haplotype structure of the 9p21.3 risk locus: one block is devoid of protein-coding genes but contains the lead CVD risk SNPs, while the other block contains the first exon and regulatory DNA of the gene for the cell cycle inhibitor p15. We consider how findings from molecular biology offer possibilities of an involvement of p15 in hypertension etiology, with expression of the p15 gene modulated by genetic variation from within the 9p21.3 risk locus. RESULTS: We present original results from a Colombian study revealing moderate but persistent association signals for BP and hypertension within the classic 9p21.3 CVD risk locus. These SNPs are mostly confined to a ‘hypertension island’ that spans less than 60 kb and coincides with the p15 haplotype block. We find confirmation in data originating from much larger, recent European BP studies, albeit with opposite effect directions. CONCLUSION: Although more work will be needed to elucidate possible mechanisms, previous findings and new data prompt reconsidering the question of how variation in 9p21.3 might influence hypertension components of cardiovascular risk.","Gallo, Juan E.; Ochoa, Juan E.; Warren, Helen R.; Misas, Elizabeth; Correa, Monica M.; Gallo-Villegas, Jaime A.; Bedoya, Gabriel; Aristizábal, Dagnóvar; McEwen, Juan G.; Caulfield, Mark J.; Parati, Gianfranco; Clay, Oliver K.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7491459/,449

However, scant attention has been devoted to how US mortality variability compares with other countries. OBJECTIVE: We examine trends in mortality and mortality variability in the US and 16 peer countries from 1980 through 2016. METHODS: We employ the Human Mortality Database and demographic techniques – with a focus on patterns in the interquartile (IQR), interdecile (IDR), and intercentile (ICR) ranges of survivorship – to better understand US mortality and mortality variability trends in comparative perspective. RESULTS: Compared to other high-income countries, the US: (1) mortality ranking has slipped for nearly all age groups; (2) is losing its old age mortality advantage; (3) has seen growth in relative age-specific mortality gaps from infancy through midlife; and (4) exhibits greater concentrations of deaths from infancy through adulthood, resulting in much greater mortality variability. CONCLUSIONS: We contribute to calls for renewed attention to the relatively low and lagging US life expectancy. The ICR draws particular attention to the comparatively high US early and midlife mortality. CONTRIBUTION: We find comparatively high variability in US mortality. Further reductions in early and midlife mortality could diminish variability, reduce years of potential life lost, and increase life expectancy. Consistent with previous research, we encourage policymakers to focus on reducing the unacceptably high early and midlife mortality in the US. And we urge researchers to more frequently monitor and track mortality variation in conjunction with mortality rates and life expectancy estimates.","Rogers, Richard G.; Hummer, Robert A.; Vinneau, Justin M.; Lawrence, Elizabeth M.",Demogr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7494211/,449

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses myriad challenges to constitutional regimes around the world. However, it is by no means the first time that public health emergencies have led to questions of constitutionalism. Past instances of disease outbreaks had already highlighted how emergency legal frameworks unfold when facing the challenge of containing their spread. Against this backdrop, the chapter focuses on pre-COVID-19 instances of cross-border epidemics and pandemics, such as A(H1N1) Influenza, Ebola and Zika, and some of their implications for constitutionalism. These examples of infectious disease outbreaks are assessed by resorting to three models-archetypes of constitutional emergencies as a theoretical background. As they show a coupling between the international and national levels, a brief glimpse at applicable international law regimes is put forward. Ultimately, public health emergencies are not taken as a new genus within already existing classifications. Nevertheless, this contribution shows how they do warrant more detailed analysis, given how their technical features put theories related to constitutionalism under extreme conditions to the test. The contribution was initially drafted before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Thus, it is a mostly retrospective analysis. Nevertheless, insights taken from outbreaks preceding COVID-19 can help build a broader outlook of the puzzle related to how the intertwinement between constitutionalism and public health emergencies can be addressed through a broader perspective not limited to one disease.","Villarreal, Pedro A.",Constitutionalism Under Extreme Conditions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7512496/,449

These challenges can be driven by changes or shocks in supply (economic shocks, growing shortages in available resources, technological innovations) or demand (demographic changes, public health threats like the Covid-19 pandemic). The Profiles analyse relevant policy measures to assess whether countries are well prepared to face health system shocks and strains. METHODS: Ensuring long-term stability of resources: the capacity to protect or generate adequate financial, physical and human resources, as well as information necessary to address a variety of major challenges. Responding efficiently: the ability to manage the health system with limited resources, through achieving efficiencies, while not sacrificing key priorities, benefits, access or entitlements. Strengthening governance: the capacity to steer the system in order to adapt it quickly to new objectives and priorities and to respond to major challenges through key governance tools. The profiles use a harmonised approach to analyse the degree of resilience in each country across these three dimensions through a range of quantitative and qualitative indicators. RESULTS: A matrix clusters the findings from the 30 Country Profiles in 2019 (pre Covid-19 outbreak) and identifies common resilience-related challenges and risks facing EU Member States. The matrix also captures examples of countries that are successfully deploying resilience-building policy strategies.

The development of a rapid, safe, effective and cost-efficient vaccine is crucial to protect pigs against PEDV infection. The COE antigen is regarded to be a major target for subunit vaccine development against PEDV infection. The naturally assembled COE protein forms a homotrimeric structure. In the present study, we successfully produced a trimeric COE protein as a native structure by fusion with the C-terminal isoleucine zipper trimerization (GCN4pII) motif in Nicotiana benthamiana, with a high expression level shown via semi-quantified Western blots. Trimeric COE protein was purified via immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), and its trimeric structure was successfully demonstrated by a cross-linking reaction, and a native PAGE gel. A crude extract containing the COE trimer was used for evaluating immunogenicity in mice. After 1 and 2 booster immunizations, the crude extract containing trimeric COE elicited elevated PEDV-specific humoral responses, as demonstrated by ELISA and Western blot analyses. Notably, a virus-neutralizing antibody assay indicated that the neutralization activities of sera of mice vaccinated with the crude extract containing COE-GCN4pII were similar to those of mice vaccinated with a commercial vaccine. These results suggest that crude extract containing trimeric COE is a promising plant-based subunit vaccine candidate for PEDV prevention.","Ho, Thuong Thi; Nguyen, Giang Thu; Pham, Ngoc Bich; Le, Van Phan; Trinh, Thi Bich Ngoc; Vu, Trang Huyen; Phan, Hoang Trong; Conrad, Udo; Chu, Ha Hoang",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7524870/,449

41193,Deutsche Gesellschaft für Neurologie (DGN): Kongress 2020 im digitalen Format,2020-10-23,"Malaysia is listed as one of Asia's developing countries with high-road accidents rate. The accident involves the most between the motorcyclist and other vehicles such as a passenger car which is 17 times safer than the motorcyclist. Current research reveals that the three major forms of incidents in Malaysia are single-motorcycle incidents, passenger car crashes and cars–motorcycles crash. In general, the lack of accuracy of road geometric design, traffic volumes and overlapping movements of vehicles was the main cause of road accidents in Malaysia, which caused drivers to make mistakes and errors due to road geometric characteristics and traffic environments. However, during our recent COVID-19 pandemic, the traffic volumes are relatively low in the whole country as the government announces the movement control order in March 2020. The country was almost completely lockdown (people and vehicles' movements were controlled). In contrast with the reduction of the traffic volumes, the number of crashes shows relatively high numbers. This phenomenon can be derived so that other factors cause vehicle crashes and fatalities should be considered. Several factors related to road geometric such as lane width, shoulder width, access point, curve length and tangent length are considered in developing profiles of operating speed for motorcycles and cars formed of tangents and curves. The analysis of the geometric factors and traffic environments took place at federal road F0050 from 21 to 25 km in Johor, Malaysia. This study was carried out using GPS (DG-200) where the data (vehicles tracked movements) on the continuous speed profiles used a current method of analysis to determine the profiles of road design consistency for motorcycles and cars. The profiles are used to measure the importance index of the integrated design consistency model of the road. The model depends on parameters such as the confine region of speed profiles, average speed, and velocity deviation standard of the profiles. Therefore, a special software of ACAD was used to build the profile of the consistency model. The design accuracy of the speed profile in traffic and safety assessments are affected by the integrated-consistency model. The highest number of accidents has been identified at 24 km at F0050 based on the area design consistency where poor design is the integrated quality consistency model for car and motorcycle. The study shows that crashes and fatalities are not fully affected by traffic volumes but road design performances and driving behaviors.","Prasetijo, Joewono; Zhang, Guohui; Jawi, Zulhaidi Mohd; Mahyeddin, Mohd Eizzuddin; Zainal, Zaffan Farhana; Isradi, Muhammad; Muthukrishnan, Narain",Innov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7573532/,449

41683,Mitteilungen der DGRh,2020-11-06,"Schistosomiasis japonica is an ancient parasitic disease that has severely impacted human health causing a substantial disease burden not only to the Chinese people but also residents of other countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and, before the 1970s, Japan. Since the founding of the new People’s Republic of China (P. R. China), effective control strategies have been implemented with the result that the prevalence of schistosomiasis japonica has decreased markedly in the past 70 years. Historically, the Dongting Lake region in Hunan province is recognised as one of the most highly endemic for schistosomiasis in the P.R. China. The area is characterized by vast marshlands outside the lake embankments and, until recently, the presence of large numbers of domestic animals such as bovines, goats and sheep that can act as reservoir hosts for Schistosoma japonicum. Considerable social, economic and environmental changes have expanded the Oncomelania hupensis hupensis intermediate snail host areas in the Dongting lake region increasing the potential for both the emergence of new hot spots for schistosomiasis transmission, and for its re-emergence in areas where infection is currently under control. In this paper, we review the history, the current endemic status of schistosomiasis and the control strategies in operation in the Dongting Lake region. We also explore epidemiological factors contributing to S. japonicum transmission and highlight key research findings from studies undertaken on schistosomiasis mainly in Hunan but also other endemic Chinese provinces over the past 10 years. We also consider the implications of these research findings on current and future approaches that can lead to the sustainable integrated control and final elimination of schistosomiasis from the P. R. China and other countries in the region where this unyielding disease persists.","Li, Fei-Yue; Hou, Xun-Ya; Tan, Hong-Zhuan; Williams, Gail M.; Gray, Darren J.; Gordon, Catherine A.; Kurscheid, Johanna; Clements, Archie C.

43121,Springer Medizin zeichnet beste Innovationen aus,2020-12-17,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially disrupted inpatient and outpatient neurosurgical care. METHODS: Patients who underwent a neurosurgical operation, inpatient consult, or outpatient appointment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center between March 23, 2019 and April 20, 2020 were identified. The March 23, 2020 Tennessee gubernatorial executive order was used to distinguish pre- and post-COVID cases. RESULTS: The total number of pre- and post-COVID cases was 4,152 and 195, respectively. Overall, a 45% reduction in median weekly operative case volume was demonstrated (82/week to 45/week; P = .001) after March 23. There was an observed downtrend in case volume in the weeks leading up to March 23. There was a 47% reduction for adult procedures (68/week to 36/week; P = .001) and 29% reduction for pediatrics (14/week to 10/week; P = .017). Among adult procedures, the most significant decreases were seen for spine surgeries (P = .008) and endovascular procedures (P = .036). Total weekly inpatient consults to adult neurosurgery decreased by 30% (97/week to 68/week; P < .001) with no significant change to pediatric consults. Adult and pediatric outpatient clinic visits decreased by 28% (552/week to 400/week; P = .021), with a 54% decrease for in-person encounters (551/week to 254/week; P = .001). Weekly Telehealth encounters increased from 0/week to 130/week. CONCLUSION: There was a significant reduction in pediatric and adult neurosurgical procedures, clinic visits, and adult inpatient consults during COVID-19. Telemedicine was increasingly used for assessment. Identifying neurosurgical procedures most impacted by COVID-19 delays may aid in the development of effective triage strategies for elective surgeries as they are reinstated.","Patel, Pious D; Kelly, Katherine A; Reynolds, Rebecca; Turer, Robert; Salwi, Sanjana; Rosenbloom, S.

43122,Neues aus der ästhetischen Dermatologie,2020-12-17,"INTRODUCTION: Recommendations regarding ventilation strategies in the setting of COVID-19, which may culminate in a clinical picture similar to ARDS, have not yet been well established. Prone positioning has shown benefit as an adjunct supportive measure for patients who develop ARDS. However, studies assessing the benefit of prone positioning have excluded patients with reduced intracranial compliance resulting in a unique predicament, whereby patients with concomitant neurological diagnoses and ARDS have no defined treatment algorithm or recommendations for management. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature, performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 guidelines, yielded 10 articles for analysis. Utilizing consensus from these articles, in combination with review of multi-institutional proning protocols for patients with non-neurologic conditions, a proning protocol for patients with intracranial pathology and concomitant ARDS was developed. RESULTS: Among the 10 studies included in final analysis, there was consensus that prone positioning should be considered when there is evidence of acute lung injury or ARDS in patients with neurologic injury. Patients may be proned with a speciality bed or manually on a standard bed with the assistance of seven to nine personnel, in the manner described herein. Special consideration for patients requiring frequent neurologic exams and patients at risk of cardiac arrest or seizure are discussed. CONCLUSION: While elevations in ICP and reductions in CPP do occur during proning, they may not occur to a degree that would warrant exclusion of prone ventilation as a treatment modality for patients with ARDS and concomitant neurological diagnoses. In cases where ICP, CPP, and PbtO2 can be monitored, prone-position ventilation should be considered a safe and viable therapy.","Gerges, Christina; Wright, James M; Shammassian, Berje H; Labak, Collin; Herring, Eric; Miller, Benjamin; Alkhachroum, Ayham; Rodgers, Richard B; Sedney, Cara L; Ngwenya, Laura B; Stippler, Martina; Sieg, Emily P; Babu, Maya A; Hoffer, Alan S; Hejal, Rana",Neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7717356/,449

During times of disasters or war, the number of cases and patterns may differ. We present the demographics of trauma cases admitted to a US level I trauma center before and after the implementation of social distancing guidelines (March 16, 2020) due to the COVID 19 pandemic. METHODS: We reviewed all the cases admitted to our level I trauma hospital ED for the period January- mid April 2020. We generated a battery of descriptive statistics to show the trends of case numbers and types over this period. RESULTS: A total of 944 cases for the period of Jan-mid Apr 2020, Average age 49 years, with 62% males and 78% whites. The total number of cases was comparable in January and February (262, 261). In March and mid-March to mid-April there was an increase in total number of cases (281, 274), especially during afternoon and evening hours. During the period January- mid April there was a decline in number of cases of motor vehicle accidents (89, 87, 80, 72) and falls (87, 77, 76, 60).

The disease spectrum varies from asymptomatic detection to severe disease. Data on community versus hospitalized cases are limited. We aim to evaluate and compare the epidemiological and clinical characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases primarily diagnosed in the ambulatory setting and compare their illness presentation. METHODS: We are prospectively enrolling a longitudinal cohort of laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 subjects and their close contacts. Suspect cases are defined as anyone who developed fever and/or Covid-19 like-symptoms in the post-Covid-19 era without proven SARS-CoV-2 detection. We consented and interviewed subjects over the phone to capture detailed sociodemographic data, medical and social histories, and clinical characteristics of the illness. RESULTS: From March 20 to June 16, 2020, 463 subjects were enrolled (Figure 1). Of those, 178 were SARS-CoV-2 positive [164 adults and 13 pediatric (< 18 years) cases] and 192 were COVID-19 suspected (111 adults and 78 pediatric cases). Adult confirmed cases were more likely to be Hispanic and have an underlying medical condition but less likely to be white compared to suspected cases (Table 1). Pediatric confirmed cases were more likely to be Hispanic and have smoke exposure, but less likely to have a travel history compared to suspected cases (Table 1). Both adult and pediatric confirmed subjects had fatigue, headache and cough as the most common symptoms reported. Cough, muscle aches and chest tightness were more likely to be reported in pediatric confirmed than suspected cases; whereas loss of taste, smell and appetite, diarrhea and fever ≥ 100.4 were documented more often in adult confirmed than suspected cases (Figure 2).

Adults and pediatrics, confirmed and suspected cases, by clinical presentation [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We observed differences of clinical presentation between confirmed and suspected cases among both pediatric and adult participants. Further research is needed to determine whether these differences are due to disease severity or absence of proven COVID-19. We are collecting serial nasal swabs, blood and stool specimens, on which future testing will confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected subjects. DISCLOSURES: Danielle A.

44600,Mitteilungen der ÖWAV,2021-01-14,"RATIONALE: Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) is a rare and special type of smooth muscle tumor originating in the uterus. It is classified as a benign disease according to its histological features but shows the behavioral characteristics of a malignant tumor. It is easily misdiagnosed and recurrent. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze clinicopathological data of 25 cases of IVL in order to enhance clinicians’ understanding of this rare disease. PATIENT CONCERNS: We screened and identified 25 cases of IVL at our hospital from October 2013 to January 2020. Five patients had tumors. DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis in each case was pathologically confirmed after surgical treatment. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were managed surgically. Although the surgical procedures were different, the surgical approach was geared towards achieving complete excision. Three patients received hormonal therapy with gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists after surgery. OUTCOMES: We retrospectively reviewed all medical records and analyzed the clinicopathologic features and clinical outcomes of this disease as well as the correlations between the clinical features and risk of recurrence. Neither the symptoms nor the preoperative imaging results were suggestive of IVL in any of the cases. Except for two patients who were lost to follow-up, twenty-three patients who were followed up are still alive. Three patients experienced a recurrence. LESSONS: The clinical manifestations and ultrasound images of IVL in the early stages are not typical; thus, IVL is easily misdiagnosed as uterine leiomyoma. Radiologists, pathologists, and surgeons should have a thorough understanding of IVL and a high index of vigilance for IVL in clinical practice. Surgery should always be aimed at achieving complete tumor excision. Patients with large lesions (≥7 cm) and lesions extending to the broad ligament may have an increased risk of recurrence. Early detection, diagnosis, and treatment are very important; once the diagnosis is confirmed, regular follow-ups are crucial.","Yu, Xiuzhang; Fu, Jing; Cao, Ting; Huang, Liyan; Qie, Mingrong; Ouyang, Yunwei",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7793403/,449

Comparatively analysing 1,119 Instagram posts across two time-stamps (2019 and 2020) and across 45 restaurants, as well as conducting five semi-structured interviews with restaurant managers, it is found that while the overall number of Instagram posts and likes on posts stayed relatively similar to the year prior, the number of comments increased significantly, suggesting a move towards a more didactic and dyadic form of Instagram communication. In addition, four digital service innovation strategies are identified: launching new service offerings and introducing new elements to existing service offerings, fostering social relationship with customers, exploring novel streams of revenue, and reinvigorating the brand’s image.

44672,Mitteilungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Epileptologie e. V.,2021-01-19,"Imbalance of macrophage polarization plays an indispensable role in acute lung injury (ALI), which is considered as a promising target. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is expressed in the macrophage, and has a pivotal role in secreting inflammatory cytokines. We reported that saquinavir (SQV), a first-generation human immunodeficiency virus-protease inhibitor, restricted exaggerated inflammatory response. However, whether MMP-9 could regulate macrophage polarization and inhibit by SQV is still unknown. We focused on the important role of macrophage polarization in CLP (cecal ligation puncture)-mediated ALI and determined the ability of SQV to maintain M2 over M1 phenotype partially through the inhibition of MMP-9. We also performed a limited clinical study to determine if MMP-9 is a biomarker of sepsis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased MMP-9 expression and recombinant MMP-9 (rMMP-9) exacerbated LPS-mediated M1 switching. Small interfering RNA to MMP-9 inhibited LPS-mediated M1 phenotype and SQV inhibition of this switching was reversed with rMMP-9, suggesting an important role for MMP-9 in mediating LPS-induced M1 phenotype. MMP-9 messenger RNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these 14 patients correlated with their clinical assessment. There was a significant dose-dependent decrease in mortality and ALI after CLP with SQV. SQV significantly inhibited LPS-mediated M1 phenotype and increased M2 phenotype in cultured RAW 264.7 and primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages as well as lung macrophages from CLP-treated mice. This study supports an important role for MMP-9 in macrophage phenotypic switching and suggests that SQV-mediated inhibition of MMP-9 may be involved in suppressing ALI during systemic sepsis.","Tong, Yao; Yu, Zhuang; Chen, Zhixia; Zhang, Renlingzi; Ding, Xibing; Yang, Xiaohu; Niu, Xiaoyin; Li, Mengzhu; Zhang, Lingling; Billiar, Timothy R.; Pitt, Bruce R.; Li, Quan",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798387/,449

A recent trend is to extract information from news as an additional source to forecast economic activity and financial variables. The goal is to evaluate if news can improve forecasts from standard methods that usually are not well-specified and have poor out-of-sample performance. In a currently on-going project, our goal is to combine a richer information set that includes news with a state-of-the-art machine learning model. In particular, we leverage on two recent advances in Data Science, specifically on Word Embedding and Deep Learning models, which have recently attracted extensive attention in many scientific fields. We believe that by combining the two methodologies, effective solutions can be built to improve the prediction accuracy for economic and financial time series. In this preliminary contribution, we provide an overview of the methodology under development and some initial empirical findings. The forecasting model is based on DeepAR, an auto-regressive probabilistic Recurrent Neural Network model, that is combined with GloVe Word Embeddings extracted from economic news. The target variable is the spread between the US 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity and the 3-Month Treasury Constant Maturity (T10Y3M).

One dynamic emergent in the literature is mistrust, which manifests in several forms in the policy-practice process. Education bureaucracies are perceived as placing little confidence in teachers, resulting in relatively rigid policy and syllabus documents. Similarly, such bureaucracies might be mistrusted by some practising teachers, while global oganisations, such as the United Nations, are mistrusted by many lay people, serving to compromise credibility in the resulting curricular and policy documents.

Then, dynamic stochastic baseline projections of these equilibrium rates and bank profit, and their projections under a counterfactual scenario of a negative interest rate, were produced for the period 2020–2024. The model predicts that a negative official cash rate (OCR) lowers the lending and deposit rates on average over the period Jun 2020 to Dec 2024; but the lending rate is higher than the deposit rate. It also increases the volatility of these rates relative to baseline projections. Negative OCR increases both incomes and costs; however, bank profit increases on average, by about 19% relative to baseline projections over the period Sep 2020 to Dec 2024.

This is primarily owing to the parallel infodemic that the population faced with disinformation and misinformation explosion in several platforms that an individual can access. MAIN BODY: The myriad of information that everyone in the world received acted as double-edged sword as some information helped individuals in allying the anxiety and stigma and motivated them for appropriate COVID-19 behavior; however, on the other hand, the same acted opposite and created a whole lot of negative problems in the community. The misinformation regarding the disease is not only limited to what has happened so far in the realm of prevention and control rather the same is also plaguing the efforts towards effective vaccine uptake. CONCLUSION: With the technological and media advancement, it is getting difficult to ward off every misinformation that is getting received at individual end which is obviously detrimental in the efforts toward effective vaccine acceptance; however, measures need to be taken at appropriate level to curb this menace of infodemic to relax the world from the clutch of this pandemic.

The aim of this study was to find out the prevalence of pathogens and to determine their antibiotic susceptibility in different ICUs of an Egyptian tertiary care hospital. This retrospective record-based cross-sectional study was conducted from the first of January to the last of December 2019 with a total of 45,221 diagnostic first-isolate culture/patient obtained from different ICUs in Zagazig University Hospitals. The antibiogram construction was done according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute instructions and a Web-based antibiogram at Stanford University. RESULTS: The positive blood isolate was the most prevalent infection site (32.37%) followed by sputum and urine isolates. Gram-negative microorganisms (74.41%) were the most common pathogens, with Klebsiella pneumoniae as the most frequently identified one with an incidence of 33.51% followed by Escherichia coli with 19.3% incidence. Antibiotic sensitivity showed that colistin is the most effective antibiotic with 96.2%, 94.7%, and 89.9% sensitivity for Klebsiella, E. coli, and Acinetobacter, respectively, while carbepenems sensitivity was extremely low, showing 19.5% and 19% imipenem and meropenem sensitivity for Klebsiella, 48% imipenem and 52.7% meropenem sensitivity for E. coli, 20.1% imipenem and 20.3% meropenem sensitivity for Acinetobacter, and 17.3% imipenem and 15.2% meropenem sensitivity for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

METHODS: College students completed a survey that asked questions about their usual sleep and diet patterns, and how these patterns have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures. These questions were answered on a scale, so when asked about changes in usual sleep patterns, students reported either sleeping fewer hours than usual, the same amount, or more hours. Regarding healthful diet, students reported either a less healthful diet than usual, no change in diet, or a more healthful diet. Students completed the survey in the spring of 2020, shortly following the widespread closures and stay home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed using SPSS 27 software. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference in means of reported diet changes among groups reporting changes in amount of sleep (P = 0.008). Further, Tukey's HSD showed that the difference was that students who reported sleeping the same amount as usual were more likely to report no change in diet than students who were sleeping less than usual (P = 0.005). There was also a slight, but significant correlation observed between changes in the amount of sleep and changes in the frequency of waking up during the night (P = 0.026; r = −0.159). CONCLUSIONS: Students who did not change the amount of time they slept during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely not to have changes in their diet either.

AIMS: Primary: to evaluate the durability of ustekinumab treatment in UC patients in clinical practice. Secondary: to assess the short-term response (at week 16) and the long-term effectiveness (at maximum follow-up) and to assess the safety of ustekinumab in clinical practice. METHODS: Patients included in the prospectively maintained ENEIDA registry who received at least one intravenous dose of ustekinumab due to active UC [Partial Mayo Score (PMS) >2] were included. Clinical activity and effectiveness were defined based on PMS. RESULTS: 95 patients were included (table 1). [Image: see text] At week 16, 53% of patients had clinical response (including 35% of patients in remission) (figure 1). [Image: see text] In the multivariate analysis, elevated serum C-reactive protein was the only variable significantly associated with clinical remission. Long-term remission is represented in figure 2. [Image: see text] 36% of patients discontinued the treatment with ustekinumab during a median follow-up of 31 weeks. The probability of maintaining ustekinumab treatment was 87% at week 16, 63% at week 56, and 59% at week 72 (figure 3); primary failure was the main reason for ustekinumab discontinuation. No variable was associated with risk of discontinuation. Three patients reported adverse events; one of them had a fatal severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

September 2021",2021-07-28,"Purpose: To evaluate the value of CEUS in differentiating malignant from benign pleural effusions (PEs). Methods: From 2008 to 2017, 83 patients with PEs of unknown cause were examined using B-mode thoracic ultrasound (B-TUS), CEUS, and cytological examination. The extent of enhancement of the pleural thickening, the presence of enhancement of septa or a solid mass within the PE, and the homogeneity of the enhancement in the associated lung consolidation, were examined. Subsequently, the diagnostic value of cytology, B-TUS, and CEUS in differentiating malignant from benign PEs was determined. Results: With CEUS, markedly enhanced pleural thickening and inhomogeneous enhanced lung consolidation were significantly more frequently associated with malignancy (p < 0.05). In the subgroup analysis, the use of CEUS increased the sensitivity from 69.2 to 92.3 in patients with initial negative cytology but clinical suspicion of malignant PE; it also increased the specificity from 63.0 to 90.0, the positive predictive value from 69.2 to 92.3, the negative predictive value from 63.0 to 90.0, and the diagnostic accuracy from 66.7 to 87.5, in the evaluation of PE malignancy. Conclusion: The use of clinically based B-TUS and CEUS as a complementary method to cytological evaluation may be beneficial for evaluating a PE of unknown cause.

The causes of LDH have not been fully elucidated but most likely involve a complex combination of mechanical and biological processes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a tool most frequently used for LDH because it can show abnormal soft tissue areas around the spine. Deep learning models may be trained to recognize images with high speed and accuracy to diagnose LDH. Although the deep learning model requires huge numbers of image datasets to train and establish the best model, this study processed enhanced medical image features for training the small-scale deep learning dataset. Methods: We propose automatic detection to assist the initial LDH exam for lower back pain. The subjects were between 20 and 65 years old with at least 6 months of work experience. The deep learning method employed the YOLOv3 model to train and detect small object changes such as LDH on MRI. The dataset images were processed and combined with labeling and annotation from the radiologist’s diagnosis record. Results: Our method proves the possibility of using deep learning with a small-scale dataset with limited medical images. The highest mean average precision (mAP) was 92.4% at 550 images with data augmentation (550-aug), and the YOLOv3 LDH training was 100% with the best average precision at 550-aug among all datasets. This study used data augmentation to prevent under- or overfitting in an object detection model that was trained with the small-scale dataset. Conclusions: The data augmentation technique plays a crucial role in YOLOv3 training and detection results. This method displays a high possibility for rapid initial tests and auto-detection for a limited clinical dataset.","Tsai, Jen-Yung; Hung, Isabella Yu-Ju; Guo, Yue Leon; Jan, Yih-Kuen; Lin, Chih-Yang; Shih, Tiffany Ting-Fang; Chen, Bang-Bin; Lung, Chi-Wen",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8416668/,449

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of cognitive telerehabilitation in adolescents with learning disabilities to overcome the treatment problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS Twenty-four patients diagnosed with Unspecified Learning Disability (mean ± SD age: 18.2 ± 2.9 years; 50% male) were enrolled in this study. The patients were assessed by a neuropsychological evaluation at the beginning and at the end of the program. All patients received cognitive treatment via a specific telehealth app to stimulate the cognitive skills related to learning. The treatment lasted four weeks, with a daily training (lasting up to 60 min), for five days a week. RESULTS Our young patients reported a statistically significant improvement in the main cognitive domains that are usually compromised in learning disabilities, including sustained and selective attention, shifting of attention, control of interference, memory and speed of information processing. Moreover, the patients showed a good usability and motivation during the training.

64412,A reliable parameter for primary closure of the free anterolateral thigh flap donor site.,2010,"Osteosarcoma (OS) metastatic disease is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Tumor resistance to chemotherapy has been one of the major areas of concern to clinicians and the topic of many laboratory investigators. Evaluation of mechanisms implicated in OS lung metastasis resistance to chemotherapy has been the focus of some of our most recent work. We have previously demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of aerosol gemcitabine (GCB) in OS lung metastases. However, a subset of cells fails to respond to GCB treatment and persists as isolated lung metastases in vivo. Autophagy, a physiological mechanism that supports nutritional deprivation under stressful conditions, has been implicated in tumor resistance to chemotherapy. We demonstrated the induction of autophagy by GCB in LM7 metastatic human OS cells and K7M3 metastatic murine OS cells. Inhibition of autophagy resulted in increased sensitivity to GCB in LM7 cells.

Defining the role autophagy plays in chemotherapy response in different tumor types has become of greater importance in order to identify the best suitable therapeutic approach.

66135,[The early days of aesthetic surgery: facelift pioneers Eugen Holländer (1867-1932) and Erich Lexer (1967-1937)].,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND The authors have previously shown that drug infusion systems with large common volumes exhibit long delays in reaching steady-state drug delivery and pharmacodynamic effects compared with smaller common-volume systems. The authors hypothesized that such delays can impede the pharmacologic restoration of hemodynamic stability. METHODS The authors created a living swine simulator of hemodynamic instability in which occlusion balloons in the aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC) were used to manipulate blood pressure. Experienced intensive care unit nurses blinded to the use of small or large common-volume infusion systems were instructed to maintain mean arterial blood pressure between 70 and 90 mmHg using only sodium nitroprusside and norepinephrine infusions. Four conditions (IVC or aortic occlusions and small or large common volume) were tested 12 times in eight animals. RESULTS After aortic occlusion, the time to restore mean arterial pressure to range (t1: 2.4 ± 1.4 vs. 5.0 ± 2.3 min, P = 0.003, average ± SD), time-out-of-range (tOR: 6.2 ± 3.5 vs. 9.5 ± 3.4 min, P = 0.028), and area-out-of-range (pressure-time integral: 84 ± 47 vs. 170 ± 100 mmHg · min, P = 0.018) were all lower with smaller common volumes. After IVC occlusion, t1 (3.7 ± 2.2 vs. 7.1 ± 2.6 min, P = 0.002), tOR (6.3 ± 3.5 vs. 11 ± 3.0 min, P = 0.007), and area-out-of-range (110 ± 93 vs. 270 ± 140 mmHg · min, P = 0.003) were all lower with smaller common volumes. Common-volume size did not impact the total amount infused of either drug. CONCLUSIONS Nurses did not respond as effectively to hemodynamic instability when drugs flowed through large common-volume infusion systems. These findings suggest that drug infusion system common volume may have clinical impact, should be minimized to the greatest extent possible, and warrants clinical investigations.","Pezone, Matthew J; Peterfreund, Robert A; Maslov, Mikhail Y; Govindaswamy, Radhika R; Lovich, Mark A",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000001075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26933793/,449

METHODS Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the grey literature were searched for papers from inception to 10 September 2020; the search was re-run in Medline up until the 9 December 2020. Screening, data extraction and quality grading were undertaken by two reviewers. Results were summarised using descriptive statistics, including a meta-analysis of overall mortality; the relationships between frailty and COVID-19 mortality were summarised narratively. RESULTS A total of 2,286 papers were screened resulting in 26 being included in the review. Most studies were from Europe, half from the UK, and one from Brazil; the median sample size was 242.5, median age 73.1 and 43.5% were female. In total, 22/26 used the Clinical Frailty Scale; reported mortality ranged from 14 to 65%. Most, but not all studies showed an association between increasing frailty and a greater risk of dying. Two studies indicated a sub-additive relationship between frailty, COVID-19 and death, and two studies showed no association. CONCLUSIONS Whilst the majority of studies have shown a positive association between COVID-19-related death and increasing frailty, some studies suggested a more nuanced understanding of frailty and outcomes in COVID-19 is needed. Clinicians should exert caution in placing too much emphasis on the influence of frailty alone when discussing likely prognosis in older people with COVID-19 illness.","Cosco, Theodore D; Best, John; Davis, Daniel; Bryden, Daniele; Arkill, Suzanne; van Oppen, James; Riadi, Indira; Wagner, Kevin R; Conroy, Simon",Age and ageing,https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951151/,449

Triaging individual patients to determine their suitability for telephone, video or face-to-face consultations is necessary. This is crucial in the context of COVID-19 to ensure doctor-patient safety. Telemedicine was shown to be safe and feasible in managing certain chronic diseases and providing patient education. When reviewing newly referred or long-term patients, different specialty clinics have different requirements for physical examination. Clinicians prefer face-to-face consultations at the initial visit to establish a doctor-patient relationship; telephone or video consultations are reasonable options for long-term patients where physical examination may not be needed. Video consultations, often aided by sophisticated devices and apps or medical assistants, are useful to facilitate remote physical examination.

74146,Innovative Surgical Approaches and Selection Criteria of Large Acne Keloidalis Nuchae Lesions.,2019,"We have used recent measurements of mammalian cone light responses and voltage-gated currents to calculate cone ATP utilization and compare it to that of rods. The largest expenditure of ATP results from ion transport, particularly from removal of Na+ entering outer segment light-dependent channels and inner segment hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, and from ATP-dependent pumping of Ca2+ entering voltage-gated channels at the synaptic terminal. Single cones expend nearly twice as much energy as single rods in darkness, largely because they make more synapses with second-order retinal cells and thus must extrude more Ca2+ In daylight, cone ATP utilization per cell remains high because cones never remain saturated and must continue to export Na+ and synaptic Ca2+ even in bright illumination. In mouse and human retina, rods greatly outnumber cones and consume more energy overall even in background light. In primates, however, the high density of cones in the fovea produces a pronounced peak of ATP utilization, which becomes particularly prominent in daylight and may make this part of the retina especially sensitive to changes in energy availability.","Ingram, Norianne T; Fain, Gordon L; Sampath, Alapakkam P",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2001776117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719136/,449

87782,Increase in FLAIR Signal of the Fluid Within the Resection Cavity as Early Recurrence Marker: Also Valid for Brain Metastases?,2017,"Rose rosette virus (RRV), belonging to the genus Emaravirus, is a highly destructive pathogen that causes rose rosette disease. The disease is a major concern for the rose industry in the U.S. due to the lack of highly sensitive methods for early detection of RRV. This is critical, as early identification of the infected plants and eradication is necessary in minimizing the risks associated with the spread of the disease. A highly reliable, specific and sensitive detection assay is thus required to test and confirm the presence of RRV in suspected plant samples. In this study a TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of RRV from infected roses, utilizing multiple gene targets. Four pairs of primers and probes; two of them (RRV_2-1 and RRV_2-2) based on the consensus sequences of the glycoprotein gene (RNA2) and the other two (RRV_3-2 and RRV_3-5) based on the nucleocapsid gene (RNA3) were designed. The specificity of the primers and probes was evaluated against other representative viruses infecting roses, belonging to the genera Alfamovirus, Cucumovirus, Ilarvirus, Nepovirus, Tobamovirus, and Tospovirus and one Emaravirus (Wheat mosaic virus). Dilution assays using the in vitro transcripts (spiked with total RNA from healthy plants, and non-spiked) showed that all the primers and probes are highly sensitive in consistently detecting RRV with a detection limit of 1 fg. Testing of the infected plants over a period of time (three times in monthly intervals) indicated high reproducibility, with the primer/probe RRV_3-5 showing 100% positive detection, while RRV_2-1, RRV_2-2 and RRV_3-2 showed 90% positive detection. The developed real-time RT-PCR assay is reliable, highly sensitive, and can be easily used in diagnostic laboratories for testing and confirmation of RRV.","Babu, Binoy; Jeyaprakash, Ayyamperumal; Jones, Debra; Schubert, Timothy S; Baker, Carlye; Washburn, Brian K; Miller, Steven H; Poduch, Kristina; Knox, Gary W; Ochoa-Corona, Francisco M; Paret, Mathews L",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.05.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27210549/,449

Our objective was to study the association of thrombus CT characteristics with outcome and treatment effect in patients with acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS We included 199 patients for whom thin-section NCCT and CTA within 30 minutes from each other were available in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) study. We assessed the following thrombus characteristics: location, distance from ICA terminus to thrombus, length, volume, absolute and relative density on NCCT, and perviousness. Associations of thrombus characteristics with outcome were estimated with univariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression as an OR for a shift toward better outcome on the mRS. Interaction terms were used to investigate treatment-effect modification by thrombus characteristics. RESULTS In univariate analysis, only the distance from the ICA terminus to the thrombus, length of >8 mm, and perviousness were associated with functional outcome. Relative thrombus density on CTA was independently associated with functional outcome with an adjusted common OR of 1.21 per 10% (95% CI, 1.02-1.43; P = .029). There was no treatment-effect modification by any of the thrombus CT characteristics. CONCLUSIONS In our study on patients with large-vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation, CT thrombus characteristics appear useful for predicting functional outcome. However, in our study cohort, the effect of intra-arterial treatment was independent of the thrombus CT characteristics. Therefore, no arguments were provided to select patients for intra-arterial treatment using thrombus CT characteristics.","Borst, J; Berkhemer, O A; Santos, E M M; Yoo, A J; den Blanken, M; Roos, Y B W E M; van Bavel, E; van Zwam, W H; van Oostenbrugge, R J; Lingsma, H F; van der Lugt, A; Dippel, D W J; Marquering, H A; Majoie, C B L M",AJNR.

However, its ability to cause severe disease is not homogeneous according to sex and the different age groups. Objective To determine perinatal characteristics, morbidity, mortality, and serological results in neonates from seropositive pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2. Methods We did a retrospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study. We included all newborns from positive pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2, between April 15 and May 10, 2020, who delivered in the National Perinatal Maternal Institute of Peru. The study extracted maternal and neonatal variables collected from the medical charts. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Fischer's exact test. Results One hundred fourteen neonates were identified, 36.8% IgM/IgG positive for SARS-CoV-2, 7% IgG, and 56.2% had negative serology. The obstetric complications were premature rupture of membranes (14.9%) and preterm birth (8,8%). 8.8% of newborns had an Apgar score of less than or equal to six minutes, and of those, only one persisted after five minutes; three newborns died. There was an association between the type of maternal immunoglobulin and the serology of the newborn (p < 0.05). No association was observed between perinatal results and maternal immunoglobulin type (p > 0.05) or serological results in the newborn for SARS-CoV-2 (p > 0.05). Conclusion 43.9% of seropositive mothers' neonates to SARS-CoV-2 had a positive serological result, more frequently type IgM/IgG. 10.5% of the neonates had some morbidity, more frequent prematurity, low birth weight, and 2.6% died. Perinatal results were not associated with the type of immunoglobulin of mothers seropositive to SARS-CoV-2; similarly, perinatal results were not associated with serological results in the newborn.","Dávila-Aliaga, Carmen; Espínola-Sánchez, Marcos; Mendoza-Ibáñez, Elina; Guevara-Ríos, Enrique; Torres-Marcos, Elsa; Hinojosa-Pérez, Rosmary; Espinoza-Vivas, Ylia; Álvarez-Carrasco, Ricardo; Velásquez-Vásquez, Carlos; Meza-Santibáñez, Luis; Gonzales-Carrillo, Oswaldo; Arango-Ochante, Pedro; Racchumí-Vela, Augusto; Saldaña-Díaz, Claudia",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2020.11.8084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382393/,449

We assessed the number of hospital admission per 100,000 inhabitants, mean inpatient spending, and inpatient mortality rate due to dementia during the first semester of 2019 and 2020. Data were stratified by geographic region and ethnoracial groups (black, mixed, and white) based on skin color. We observed an overall reduction in hospital admissions, mean inpatient spending, and mortality rate between the first semester of 2019 and 2020. However, the reduction of hospitalization rates among black and mixed people was 105.3% and 121.1% greater than in whites, respectively. Mortality rate was decreased by 9% in whites and was increased by 65% and 43% in the black and mixed population, respectively. In the first semester of 2020, black and mixed patients had a higher risk of losing their lives due to dementia than white people. This disparity was not observed in the same period of 2019. In 2020, the inpatient mortality ratio reached the highest values among black individuals in all regions but the North (no data available).

114323,Objective sensory and functional outcomes at the donor site following endoscopic-assisted sural nerve harvest.,2017,"Introduction: S-acylation is the attachment of fatty acids not only to cysteines of cellular, but also of viral proteins. The modification is often crucial for the protein´s function and hence for virus replication. Transfer of fatty acids is mediated by one or several of the 23 members of the ZDHHC family of proteins. Since their genes are linked to various human diseases, they represent drug targets.Areas covered: The authors explore whether targeting acylation of viral proteins might be a strategy to combat viral diseases. Many human pathogens contain S-acylated proteins; the ZDHHCs involved in their acylation are currently identified. Based on the 3D structure of two ZDHHCs, the regulation and the biochemistry of the palmitolyation reaction and the lipid and protein substrate specificities are discussed. The authors then speculate how ZDHHCs might recognize S-acylated membrane proteins of Influenza virus.Expert opinion: Although many viral diseases can now be treated, the available drugs bind to viral proteins that rapidly mutate and become resistant. To develop inhibitors for the genetically more stable cellular ZDHHCs, their binding sites for viral substrates need to be identified. If only a few cellular proteins are recognized by the same binding site, development of specific inhibitors may have therapeutic potential.","Gadalla, Mohamed Rasheed; Veit, Michael",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2020.1696306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31809605/,449

Laparoscopic gastric resection is used increasingly for the treatment of gastric cancer, but the incidence of internal hernia in the treated patients has not been studied. METHODS This study retrospectively reviewed 173 patients who underwent laparoscopic resection for gastric cancer at one institution, including distal and total gastric resections with antecolic Roux-en-Y reconstruction. RESULTS An internal hernia occurred in 4 (7%) of 58 patients whose jejunojejunal mesenteric defect was not closed a mean of 326 days after surgery. All the patients underwent reoperation with reduction and repair of the hernia. In 115 subsequent cases, with closure of the mesenteric defect, internal hernias did not occur (0/115 cases; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Based on the current recommendations for patients undergoing bariatric surgery, closure of this potential hernia defect is mandatory after laparoscopic gastrectomy with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction for gastric cancer.","Hosoya, Yoshinori; Lefor, Alan; Ui, Takashi; Haruta, Hidenori; Kurashina, Kentaro; Saito, Shin; Zuiki, Toru; Sata, Naohiro; Yasuda, Yoshikazu",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1739-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21573714/,449

120163,Understanding the unfavorable result after otoplasty: an integrated approach to correction.,2011,"18 years ago, in 2002, the world was astonished by the appearance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), supported by a zoonotic coronavirus, called SARS-CoV, from the Guangdong Province of southern China. After about 10 years, in 2012, another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world.

As a result, COVID-19 has dominated this year's headlines and commanded significant research attention. As we consider SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that scientists, governments, the media, and the general population also come to grips with the everyday cost of parasitic diseases. Plasmodium (malaria), schistosomes, filarial worms, hookworms, Ascaris, whipworms, and other protozoan and metazoan parasites take a tremendous toll on local communities. Yet, because most of these diseases are no longer endemic to developed countries, their research and intervention are not funded at levels that are proportional to their global morbidity and mortality.

Purpose To examine whether PDMP implementation is associated with changes in nonfatal and fatal overdoses; identify features of programs differentially associated with those outcomes; and investigate any potential unintended consequences of the programs. Data Sources Eligible publications from MEDLINE, Current Contents Connect (Clarivate Analytics), Science Citation Index (Clarivate Analytics), Social Sciences Citation Index (Clarivate Analytics), and ProQuest Dissertations indexed through 27 December 2017 and additional studies from reference lists. Study Selection Observational studies (published in English) from U.S. states that examined an association between PDMP implementation and nonfatal or fatal overdoses. Data Extraction 2 investigators independently extracted data from and rated the risk of bias (ROB) of studies by using established criteria. Consensus determinations involving all investigators were used to grade strength of evidence for each intervention. Data Synthesis Of 2661 records, 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. These articles examined PDMP implementation only (n = 8), program features only (n = 2), PDMP implementation and program features (n = 5), PDMP implementation with mandated provider review combined with pain clinic laws (n = 1), and PDMP robustness (n = 1). Evidence from 3 studies was insufficient to draw conclusions regarding an association between PDMP implementation and nonfatal overdoses. Low-strength evidence from 10 studies suggested a reduction in fatal overdoses with PDMP implementation. Program features associated with a decrease in overdose deaths included mandatory provider review, provider authorization to access PDMP data, frequency of reports, and monitoring of nonscheduled drugs. Three of 6 studies found an increase in heroin overdoses after PDMP implementation. Limitation Few studies, high ROB, and heterogeneous analytic methods and outcome measurement. Conclusion Evidence that PDMP implementation either increases or decreases nonfatal or fatal overdoses is largely insufficient, as is evidence regarding positive associations between specific administrative features and successful programs. Some evidence showed unintended consequences. Research is needed to identify a set of ""best practices"" and complementary initiatives to address these consequences.

The evidence reviews include 16 systematic reviews, 5 scoping reviews, and 1 evidence update. Per agreement within the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, new or revised treatment recommendations were only made after a systematic review. Systematic reviews were performed for the following topics: dispatch diagnosis of cardiac arrest, use of a firm surface for CPR, sequence for starting CPR (compressions-airway-breaths versus airway-breaths-compressions), CPR before calling for help, duration of CPR cycles, hand position during compressions, rhythm check timing, feedback for CPR quality, alternative techniques, public access automated external defibrillator programs, analysis of rhythm during chest compressions, CPR before defibrillation, removal of foreign-body airway obstruction, resuscitation care for suspected opioid-associated emergencies, drowning, and harm from CPR to victims not in cardiac arrest. The topics that resulted in the most extensive task force discussions included CPR during transport, CPR before calling for help, resuscitation care for suspected opioid-associated emergencies, feedback for CPR quality, and analysis of rhythm during chest compressions. After discussion of the scoping reviews and the evidence update, the task force prioritized several topics for new systematic reviews.","Olasveengen, Theresa M; Mancini, Mary E; Perkins, Gavin D; Avis, Suzanne; Brooks, Steven; Castrén, Maaret; Chung, Sung Phil; Considine, Julie; Couper, Keith; Escalante, Raffo; Hatanaka, Tetsuo; Hung, Kevin K C; Kudenchuk, Peter; Lim, Swee Han; Nishiyama, Chika; Ristagno, Giuseppe; Semeraro, Federico; Smith, Christopher M; Smyth, Michael A; Vaillancourt, Christian; Nolan, Jerry P; Hazinski, Mary Fran; Morley, Peter T",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084391/,449

Many studies have compared different thermometers in neonates, however, there is a lack of consensus regarding which of the currently available thermometers is most suitable for use in neonates. Objectives: The aim of this review was to identify and compare current methods available for temperature monitoring of neonates beyond the delivery room, including the accuracy, advantages and disadvantages of each. Methods: A recent search and narrative synthesis of relevant studies published between January 1, 1949 and May 5, 2021 on the OVID Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Results: A total of 160 papers were retrieved for narrative synthesis. The main methods available for temperature monitoring in neonates are human touch and mercury-in-glass, electronic, infrared tympanic and other infrared thermometers. Newer innovations that are also available include liquid crystal thermometers and the BEMPU TempWatch. This paper discusses the current evidence available regarding the utility of these devices, and identifies barriers to valid comparison of different thermometry methods. Conclusion: Many methods for temperature monitoring in neonates are currently available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. However, the accuracies of different devices are hard to determine due to variable methodologies used in relevant studies and hence, further research that addresses these gaps is needed.","Lei, Donna; Tan, Kenneth; Malhotra, Atul",Frontiers in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.732810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34504819/,449

This study assesses postoperative outcomes from a single surgeon experience with the THD device. METHODS From January 2009 to December 2011, 108 THD procedures were performed. With Doppler guidance, the THD device makes possible precise ligation of the branches of the superior hemorrhoidal artery. Patients were seen postoperatively at 3 weeks and 6 months. They underwent physical examination to determine whether there was recurrence of hemorrhoidal prolapse. They were asked to describe any bleeding, to rate pain using the visual analog scale, and to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 = highly satisfied). A phone interview was used for follow-up at 1 year to determine the rate of recurrent prolapse. RESULTS Of the 108 patients who underwent THD, two were lost to follow-up and excluded. All of the remaining 106 patients completed follow-up at 3 weeks and 6 months. At 3 weeks, 92% of patients had no pain and 88% were highly satisfied with the procedure at 3 weeks. This increased to 92% satisfaction at 1 year. Prolapse recurrence was 7.5% at 6 months and 10.3% at 1 year. Bleeding was the most common complication, but did not require re-intervention or transfusion. CONCLUSIONS THD is a same-day procedure for the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease that is safe and effective, and offers the potential for immediate return to normal activity.","LaBella, G D; Main, W P L; Hussain, L R",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-015-1269-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637412/,449

Glucosamine was derivatized at the C-2 nitrogen with long chain alkyl spacers linked to either pyridyl-tert-nitrogen-phenol tridentate chelates or cyclopentadienyl ligating groups. The metal complexes of the tridentate ligands were formed by refluxing with [Re(CO)(3)(H(2)O)(3)]Br, or with a base and [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(H(2)O)(3)](+). These ligands were found to be competent chelates in binding the [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+) core as radiolabeling yields ranged from 87 to 93% and the resulting complexes are stable to cysteine and histidine challenges for 24 h. The cyclopentadienyl analogues were formed using a double ligand transfer reaction for the rhenium complexes and a single ligand transfer for the technetium-99m complexes. All five rhenium complexes were tested as substrates of hexokinase; two of these complexes were tested as hexokinase inhibitors and they were found to be competent inhibitors, suggesting that they may be able to interact with hexokinase. MTT cytotoxicity studies were performed and the complexes tested were found to be non-toxic to the concentrations tested (100 microM or 1 mM). GLUT-1 mediated cell uptake studies were performed on all five technetium-99m complexes, and their cell entry was found to parallel their lipophilicities, suggesting that cellular uptake is by passive diffusion and is not mediated by GLUT-1.","Bowen, Meryn L; Chen, Zhen-Feng; Roos, Adrienne M; Misri, Ripen; Häfeli, Urs; Adam, Michael J; Orvig, Chris",Dalton transactions,https://doi.org/10.1039/b914309b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20449200/,449
138838,Renal denervation: unde venis et quo vadis?,2015,"PURPOSE Laparoscopic gastric wedge resection is a standard treatment for removing gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs). So far, however, there have been few reports of single-incision laparoscopic intragastric wedge resection. Our aim was to describe this procedure and our experience with it. METHODS From January 2010 to December 2013, a total of 21 consecutive patients with gastric SMTs underwent single-incision intragastric resection at our institution. Their clinicopathologic data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The patients consisted of nine men and 12 women with a mean age of 51.9 ± 12.9 years (22-69 years). Their mean body mass index was 22.6 ± 2.0 kg/m(2). Mean tumor size was 2.4 ± 0.7 cm, with the following anatomic distribution: esophagogastric junction in three patients, fundus in twelve, upper body in three, and lower body in two. Mean operating time was 68.6 ± 12.0 minutes. There were no conversions to open surgery and no major intraoperative complications. Time to resumption of water intake was 1.4 ± 0.5 days. Mean hospital stay was 4.9 ± 1.7 days. There were no recurrences or deaths during the mean 19-month follow-up. CONCLUSION Single-incision intragastric wedge resection is a feasible and safe procedure. It is especially efficient for treating small endophytic gastric SMTs located on the upper and mid portion of the stomach.","Choi, Chang In; Lee, Si Hak; Hwang, Sun Hwi; Kim, Dae Hwan; Jeon, Tae Yong; Kim, Dong Heon; Kim, Gwang Ha; Park, Do Youn",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2014.87.6.304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485238/,449

It has been mostly reported in immunocompromised patients or following penetrating foreign bodies. This report aims to add to the current veterinary literature on recommended diagnostic tools for splenic abscess, as well as to provide follow-up findings after successful surgical treatment. CASE PRESENTATION An 8-year-old male German shepherd dog was admitted to the clinic for evaluation of fever, anorexia, and lethargy for the previous 3 days. During the physical examination, a mass was palpated in the left cranioventral abdomen. Diagnostic imaging including radiography and ultrasonography revealed the presence of a large mass in the spleen and signs of peritonitis. Laboratory tests reflected highly septic pyogranulomatous inflammation and, together with imaging findings, raised a high suspicion of splenic abscess and septic peritonitis. Therapy included complete splenectomy and placement of peritoneal drainage. Bacteriological examination revealed severe infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. pseudintermedius. Histopathological evaluation of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of splenic abscess. CONCLUSION Early diagnosis of splenic abscess in small animals requires a high level of suspicion based on clinical and ultrasonographic findings. Immediate surgical intervention is preferable and confirms the diagnosis. Total splenectomy remains the most effective therapy. Although there are many predisposing factors for splenic abscess, the true etiology remains obscure.","Abdellatif, Ahmed; Günther, Charlotte; Peppler, Christine; Kramer, Martin",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-014-0201-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25319320/,449

Through its experiences, Thailand has actively assisted other developing countries in working towards UHC. However, Thailand is now facing new challenges such as increasing healthcare costs, differing service coverage and purchasing mechanisms among its three health care schemes, and the impact of a rapidly aging population on its health systems. Thailand requested technical support from the Japanese government. Japan achieved UHC in 1961 and its extensive experience of introducing and implementing UHC is a fitting example for Thailand and other countries struggling toward a stable health care system. Thus, the partnership project for Global Health and Universal Health Coverage was launched in July 2016 as a four-year flagship project for ""North-South-South Cooperation"".

It is having devastating effects on the people of all countries. In this regard, the phytochemicals of medicinal plants could be explored to prevent this disease. M. oleifera is a miracle plant with antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant properties because of its high content of flavonoids, glucosides and glucosinolates. Therefore, we constructed a library of 294 phytochemicals of M. oleifera and filtered it through the FAF-Drugs4. Further, molecular docking studies of filtered phytochemicals were performed with Mpro enzyme to investigate the binding interactions. Drug likeness properties, ADMET prediction were analyzed to determine the therapeutic aspect of these compounds. Based on the binding energy score of the top 4 compounds, the results indicate that Vicenin-2 has the highest binding affinity (-8.6 kcal mol-1) as compared to the reference molecule (-8.4 kcal mol-1). ADMET result reveals that all top four compounds have minimal toxic effects and good absorption. Further, 500 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the top four compounds showed that Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside and Vitexin have good stability with Mpro. These two compounds were then subjected for MMPBSA (last 50 ns) calculation to analyze the protein-ligand stability and dynamic behavior. Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside and Vitexin showed very good binding free energy i.e. -40.136 kJ mol-1 and -26.784 kJ mol-1, respectively.

146680,Thermoablation of Bone Tumors.,2016,"In silico models to predict which tumors will respond to a given drug are necessary for Precision Oncology. However, predictive models are only available for a handful of cases (each case being a given drug acting on tumors of a specific cancer type). A way to generate predictive models for the remaining cases is with suitable machine learning algorithms that are yet to be applied to existing in vitro pharmacogenomics datasets. Here, we apply XGBoost integrated with a stringent feature selection approach, which is an algorithm that is advantageous for these high-dimensional problems. Thus, we identified and validated 118 predictive models for 62 drugs across five cancer types by exploiting four molecular profiles (sequence mutations, copy-number alterations, gene expression, and DNA methylation). Predictive models were found in each cancer type and with every molecular profile. On average, no omics profile or cancer type obtained models with higher predictive accuracy than the rest. However, within a given cancer type, some molecular profiles were overrepresented among predictive models. For instance, CNA profiles were predictive in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) cell lines, but not in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines where gene expression (GEX) and DNA methylation profiles were the most predictive. Lastly, we identified the best XGBoost model per cancer type and analyzed their selected features. For each model, some of the genes in the selected list had already been found to be individually linked to the response to that drug, providing additional evidence of the usefulness of these models and the merits of the feature selection scheme.","Naulaerts, Stefan; Menden, Michael P; Ballester, Pedro J",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10060963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604779/,449

Endothelial-specific molecule 1 (endocan) plays a role in vascular pathology. We hypothesized serum endocan levels on admission are associated with primary composite end point (mortality and intensive care unit hospitalization) in COVID-19 patients. Patients (n = 80) with laboratory, clinical, and radiological confirmed COVID-19 were included in this cross-sectional study. Ten milliliter of peripheral venous blood were drawn within 24 hours of admission to estimate serum endocan levels. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM). Patients with the primary composite end point had significantly higher serum endocan levels than patients without (852.2 ± 522.7 vs 550.2 ± 440.8 ng/L, respectively; P < .01). In the logistic regression analysis, only increased serum endocan levels and increase in age were independent predictors of the primary composite end point (P < .05). In the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, we found that a serum endocan level of 276.4 ng/L had a 97% sensitivity and 85% specificity for prediction of the primary composite end point.

Given these roles and their relevance in the health professions, we sought to understand the methods and strategies used in the development of existing competency frameworks. Methods The Arksey and O'Malley framework was applied to undertake this scoping review. Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, and ERIC) and three grey literature sources (greylit.org, Trove and Google Scholar) were searched using keywords related to competency frameworks. Studies of all types were included that described the development of a competency framework in a healthcare profession. Studies were screened for inclusion, and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Data synthesis was both quantitative and qualitative. Results Among 5,710 citations, 190 were selected for analysis. The majority of studies were conducted in medicine and nursing professions. Group techniques were utilised in 140 studies (74%), literature reviews were conducted in 112 (59%), and 81 (43%) outlined some form of stakeholder deliberation. We found a significant degree of diversity in methodological strategies, inconsistent adherence to existing guidance on the selection of methods, who was involved, and based on the variation we observed in timeframes, form, choice, sequence, combination, function, application and reporting of methods and strategies, there is no apparent gold standard or standardised approach to competency framework development. Conclusions This review observed significant variation within the conduct and reporting of the competency framework development process. Such variation is a cause for concern, potentially resulting in the development of frameworks that may not have captured the complexities of clinical practice, which are therefore of limited value to the profession, and may unwillingly create and legitimise artificial outcomes. The results of this review suggest there is a need for improved guidance in the process for developing and reporting competency frameworks.","Batt, A.

This paper addresses farmers' (un)sustainabilities from a moral economy perspective, focusing on discussions about just prices. We argue that it is important to consider the historical perspective of food systems from a political economy point of view and to examine tensions and clashes between values and norms through the notion of moral economy. We analyse these perspectives through various case studies in different Spanish regions: farmers in Galicia, viticulturists in El Penedes and ""alternative"" provisioning systems in Catalonia. Furthermore, we combine the moral economy perspective with feminist and eco-feminist contributions that help us to understand one of farmers' most common demands: just prices that guarantee livelihoods and dignity. This paper also deals with the ambivalent role of the state as a price regulator and with farmers' aspirations of autonomy from the market and the state. The global health crisis caused by COVID-19 during the first half of 2020 stresses the need to continue exploring the (un)sustainabilities of our hegemonic agro-food system and the potentialities and limitations of counter-hegemonic food provisioning systems that try to build alternative food paths.","de la Piscina, P.

The aim of this literature review was to identify potential AGMPs in Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and provide evidence-based recommendations. METHODS: A literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane Review databases up to April 3, 2020. All titles and abstracts of retrieved studies were evaluated and all studies mentioning potential AGMPs were included for formal review. Full text of included studies were assessed by two reviewers and the quality of the studies was evaluated. Ten categories of potential AGMPs were developed and recommendations were provided for each category. RESULTS: Direct evidence indicates that CO2 laser ablation, the use of high-speed rotating devices, electrocautery and endotracheal suctioning are AGMPs. Indirect evidence indicates that tracheostomy should be considered as potential AGMPs. Nasal endoscopy and nasal packing/epistaxis management can result in droplet transmission, but it is unknown if these procedures also carry the risk of airborne transmission. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, special care should be taken when CO2 lasers, electrocautery and high-speed rotating devices are used in potentially infected tissue.

Recently, cytokine storm by the host immune system has been linked with high viral load, loss of lung function, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and subsequent fatal outcome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify potential FDA approved drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment using an in-silico analysis. METHODS: In this study, virtual screening of selected FDA approved drugs was performed by targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 and the key molecules involved in the 'Cytokine storm' in COVID-19 patients. Based on our preliminary screening supported by extensive literature search, we selected FDA approved drugs to target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and the key players of cytokine storm, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1ß. These compounds were examined based on systematic docking studies and further validated using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations. RESULTS: Based on the findings, Rifampicin and Letermovir appeared as the most promising drug showing a very good binding affinity with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1ß. However, it is pertinent to mention here that our findings need further validation by in vitro analysis and clinical trials. CONCLUSION: This study provides an insight into the drug repurposing approach in which several FDA approved drugs were examined to inhibit COVID-19 infection by targeting the main protease of SARS-COV-2 and the cytokine storm.","Pathak, Yamini; Mishra, Amaresh; Choudhir, Gourav; Kumar, Anuj; Tripathi, Vishwas",Pharmacol Rep,,449
235122,Rebuttal From Drs Bishop and Eberl,2021,"Deep Learning models are getting more and more popular but constraints on explainability, adversarial robustness and fairness are often major concerns for production deployment. Although the open source ecosystem is abundant on addressing those concerns, fully integrated, end to end systems are lacking in open source. Therefore we provide an entirely open source, reusable component framework, visual editor and execution engine for production grade machine learning on top of Kubernetes, a joint effort between IBM and the University Hospital Basel. It uses Kubeflow Pipelines, the AI Explainability360 toolkit, the AI Fairness360 toolkit and the Adversarial Robustness Toolkit on top of Elyra, Kubeflow, Kubernetes and JupyterLab. Using the Elyra pipeline editor, AI pipelines can be developed visually with a set of jupyter notebooks. We explain how we've created a COVID-19 deep learning classification pipeline based on CT scans. We use the toolkit to highlight parts of the images which have been crucial for the models decisions. We detect bias against age and gender and finally, show how to deploy the model to KFServing to share it across different hospital data centers of the Swiss Personalized Health Network. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

The underlying reasons why a smaller percentage of patients present with severe pulmonary symptoms whereas the majority is only mildly affected are to date not well understood. Comparing the immunological phenotype in healthy donors and patients with mild versus severe COVID-19 shows that in COVID-19 patients, NK-/B-cell activation and proliferation are enhanced independent of severity. As an important precondition for effective antibody responses, T-follicular helper cells and antibody secreting cells are increased both in patients with mild and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond this, T cells in COVID-19 patients exhibit a stronger activation profile with differentiation toward effector cell phenotypes. Importantly, when looking at the rates of pulmonary complications in COVID-19 patients, the chemokine receptor CCR4 is higher expressed by both CD4 and CD8 T cells of patients with severe COVID-19. This raises the hypothesis that CCR4 upregulation on T cells in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 promotes stronger T-cell attraction to the lungs leading to increased immune activation with presumably higher pulmonary toxicity. Our study contributes significantly to the understanding of the immunological changes during COVID-19, as new therapeutic agents, preferentially targeting the immune system, are highly warranted.","Spoerl, Silvia; Kremer, Anita N; Aigner, Michael; Eisenhauer, Nina; Koch, Pauline; Meretuk, Lina; Löffler, Patrick; Tenbusch, Matthias; Maier, Clara; Überla, Klaus; Heinzerling, Lucie; Frey, Benjamin; Lutzny-Geier, Gloria; Winkler, Thomas H; Krönke, Gerhard; Vetter, Marcel; Bruns, Heiko; Neurath, Markus F; Mackensen, Andreas; Kremer, Andreas E; Völkl, Simon",Eur. j. immunol,,449

As such, aerosol-to-hydrosol enrichment is required to produce a detectable viral sample for real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays. To meet this requirement, the efficient and non-destructive collection of airborne virus particles is needed, while the incoming air flow rate should be sufficiently high to quickly collect a large number of virus particles. To achieve this, we introduced a high air flow-rate electrostatic sampler (HAFES) that collected virus aerosols (human coronavirus 229E, influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2, and bacteriophage MS2) in a continuously flowing liquid. Viral collection efficiency was evaluated using aerosol particle counts, while viral recovery rates were assessed using real-time qRT-PCR and plaque assays. An air sampling period of 20 min was sufficient to produce a sample suitable for use in real-time qRT-PCR in a viral epidemic scenario.","Kim, Hyeong Rae; An, Sanggwon; Hwang, Jungho",J Hazard Mater,,449
267311,Mitteilungen der DGIM,2020,"This paper deals with a general SEIR model for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with the effect of time delay proposed. We get the stability theorems for the disease-free equilibrium and provide adequate situations of the COVID-19 transmission dynamics equilibrium of present and absent cases. A Hopf bifurcation parameter τ concerns the effects of time delay and we demonstrate that the locally asymptotic stability holds for the present equilibrium. The reproduction number is brief in less than or greater than one, and it effectively is controlling the COVID-19 infection outbreak and subsequently reveals insight into understanding the patterns of the flare-up. We have included eight parameters and the least square method allows us to estimate the initial values for the Indian COVID-19 pandemic from real-life data. It is one of India’s current pandemic models that have been studied for the time being. This Covid19 SEIR model can apply with or without delay to all country’s current pandemic region, after estimating parameter values from their data. The sensitivity of seven parameters has also been explored. The paper also examines the impact of immune response time delay and the importance of determining essential parameters such as the transmission rate using sensitivity indices analysis.

We analysed the demographic profile, history, functional assessment and all investigations of this study cohort. Out of the 2,165 patients provided consultation, there were 35 patients of post-COVID-19, which were included in the present study. These patients had a mean duration of 47 days from discharge to first visit to our hospital. Pre-existing respiratory comorbidity was present in 63%. History of hospitalisation was present in 52%. Fatigue (65%) was the most common symptom followed by breathlessness (60%), cough (45.71%) and chest pain (28.57%). Three patients had significant desaturation on 6-minute walk test and one patient had type 2 respiratory failure on presentation. Chest X-ray was abnormal in 34.28% (n=12). On CT thorax (n=17) the most common finding was diffuse reticulations (52.94%) followed by diffuse ground glass opacities (GGOs) (35.29%). One patient each were newly diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis and tubercular unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Conclusively, post-COVID-19 patients may have remnant symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness and cough. Also, patients with pre-existing respiratory diseases are more symptomatic and even may suffer from deterioration in the clinical course. Further we need to be alert of alternate diagnosis or infections like tuberculosis (TB) in these patients, especially in TB endemic countries like India. Simultaneously, the use of immunosuppressant drugs like steroids for COVID-19 management, predisposes to TB. A proper evaluation with holistic and standardised management plan is the need of the hour for post-COVID-19 patients, until its time course, evolution and manifestations are unravelled.","Goel, Nitin; Goyal, Nitesh; Kumar, Raj",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,449

Limited data are available for information and prognosis on COVID-19 patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we described the clinical characteristics and outcomes from two patients-a female aged 40-year-old and an 83-year-old male-who were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with history of chronic renal insufficiency. The female was admitted for dry cough and shortness of breath and the male was admitted for fever. The thorax computed tomography revealed patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacity in both scattered lobes and the throat swab sample for coronavirus nucleic acid was positive. They were diagnosed with COVID-19 and their renal function became progressively worse after infection with COVID-19. After symptomatic support treatment, in both the patients, renal function was obviously restored, and both recovered from this pneumonia and conformed to the discharge criteria. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection may aggravate renal function impairment. It is crucial to monitor changes of renal function in patients with COVID-19, especially those with primary kidney disease. Kidney protection interventions should be taken as early as possible, thereby improving the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Yiru; Lv, Yongman; Liu, Qingquan",Immun Inflamm Dis,,449

COVID-19 puts into question most of the global health assumptions and reaffirms the political intuitions of the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration on primary health care, which positioned health at the centre of a public sector-led project for economic transformation and human dignity, based on human rights. The new coronavirus imposes a new sense of purpose to health policymaking, which is not yet captured in the current failed global response to the pandemic.

This detection can remain positive for weeks without implying virus viability. Methods: We have performed cell culture to assess viral replication in 106 respiratory samples rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 105 patients with COVID-19. Fifty were samples from 50 patients with mild forms of COVID-19 who did not require hospital admission. Fifty-six samples were obtained from 55 hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia. Samples were obtained at different time points covering the time from clinical diagnosis to the follow up during hospital care. Results: In 49 samples (49/106, 46.2%) a cytopathic effect (CPE) was detected in cell culture. Our study demonstrates that while in patients with mild COVID-19, viral viability is maintained in fact up to 10 days in patients with severe COVID-19 the virus can remain viable for up to 32 days after the onset of symptoms. Patients with severe COVID-19 as compared with mild cases, presented infective virus in a significantly higher proportion in samples with moderate or low viral load (Ct value > 26): 22/46 (47.8%) versus 7/38 (18.4%), (p <0.01), respectively. Conclusions: Persistent SARS-CoV-2 replication could be demonstrated in severe COVID-19 cases for periods up to 32 days after the onset of symptoms and even at high Ct values. COVID-19 severity is a more determining factor for viral viability than the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms or the Ct value obtained in the RT-PCR assay.","Folgueira, M.

597156,President´s Corner (Mitteilungen der Deutschen Schmerzgesellschaft e.V.),2020-11-23,"BACKGROUND: Although COVID-19 pandemic significantly induces mortality, many of the patients who recovered present with other medical problems such as alopecias. Telogen effluvium is a common alopecia that is usually related to previous events such as acute febrile diseases, including COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the characteristics of telogen effluvium in COVID-19. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 526 patients with documented telogen effluvium that recovered from COVID-19. Demographic data, concurrent alopecia, associated diseases, and COVID-19 severity were recorded. Data were analyzed by appropriate statistical methods. RESULTS: The mean age of the 526 patients (410 females, 116 males) was 30.97 ± 9.592 years, with 7.65 ± 1.739 weeks of mean time of alopecia onset. In our patients vitamin D deficiency (24.3%), androgenetic alopecia (78.2%), and grade III disease severity were the most common findings. Alopecia onset was significantly earlier in the younger age group, females, in hypothyroidism, and more severe coronavirus infection. Higher grade coronavirus infection was significantly seen in males, higher ages, earlier onset, and androgenic alopecia. STUDY LIMITATIONS: Performing a single-center study and considering limited variables. CONCLUSION: Although Coronavirus 2 infection can be an important factor in telogen effluvium induction, other factors such as associated diseases, drug intake and emotional stress may also be involved. In the cases of early onset of alopecia, concomitant diseases such as hypothyroidism and severe coronavirus infections can occur, thus, the presence of various factors in telogen effluvium induction should be considered.","Babaei, Khaled; Kavoussi, Hossein; Rezaei, Mansour; Kavoussi, Reza",An Bras Dermatol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0365059621002294; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abd.2021.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0365059621002294?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34593265/,449
599875,Comparative effectiveness of membrane technologies and disinfection methods for virus elimination in water: A review,2021-08-14,"Murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus, MHV) is a collection of strains that induce disease in several organ systems of mice. Infection with neurotropic strains JHM and A59 causes acute encephalitis, and in survivors, chronic demyelination, the latter of which serves as an animal model for multiple sclerosis. The MHV receptor is a carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule, CEACAM1a; paradoxically, CEACAM1a is poorly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to speculation of an additional receptor. Comparison of highly neurovirulent JHM isolates with less virulent variants and the weakly neurovirulent A59 strain, combined with the use of reverse genetics, has allowed mapping of pathogenic properties to individual viral genes. The spike protein, responsible for viral entry, is a major determinant of tropism and virulence. Other viral proteins, both structural and nonstructural, also contribute to pathogenesis in the CNS. Studies of host responses to MHV indicate that both innate and adaptive responses are crucial to antiviral defense. Type I interferon is essential to prevent very early mortality after infection. CD8 T cells, with the help of CD4 T cells, are crucial for viral clearance during acute disease and persist in the CNS during chronic disease. B cells are necessary to prevent reactivation of virus in the CNS following clearance of acute infection. Despite advances in understanding of coronavirus pathogenesis, questions remain regarding the mechanisms of viral entry and spread in cell types expressing low levels of receptor, as well as the unique interplay between virus and the host immune system during acute and chronic disease.","Bender, Susan J.; Weiss, Susan R.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11481-010-9202-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20369302/,449

Compounds 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d exhibited notable antiviral activity against Coxsackie B4 virus, at EC(50) values ranging from 0.4 to 2.1 μg/mL. The selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic to antivirally effective concentration) values of these compounds were between 9 and 56. Besides, 6b, 6c and 6d also inhibited the replication of two other RNA viruses, Sindbis virus and respiratory syncytial virus, although these EC(50) values were higher compared to those noted for Coxsackie B4 virus.

The diagnosis of HCC remains challenging due to the low sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic method. Exosomes, which are abundant in various proteins from parent cells, play pivotal roles in intercellular communication and have been confirmed as promising sources of disease biomarkers. Herein, we performed a simple but robust proteomic profiling on exosomes derived from 1 μL of serum using a data-independent acquisition (DIA) method for the first time, to screen potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of HCC. Ten pivotal differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (von Willebrand factor (VWF), LGALS3BP, TGFB1, SERPINC1, HPX, HP, HBA1, FGA, FGG, and FGB) were screened as a potential candidate biomarker panel, which could completely discriminate patients with HCC from normal control (NC). Interestingly, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) revealed that the expression levels of four genes increased and those of six genes decreased in HCC tissues compared with normal tissues, which were in concordance with protein expression levels. In conclusion, we screened 10 exosomal proteins holding promise for acting as a potential candidate biomarker panel for detection of HCC through a simple but robust proteomic profiling.","Zhao, Liping; Shi, Jiahui; Chang, Lei; Wang, Yihao; Liu, Shu; Li, Yuan; Zhang, Tao; Zuo, Tao; Fu, Bin; Wang, Guibin; Ruan, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Yali; Xu, Ping",ACS Omega,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c05408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33458533/,449

The first MERS case of Korea was reported on 20 May 2015, and since then, the MERS outbreak in Korea has resulted in hundreds of confirmed cases and tens of deaths. Deadly infectious diseases such as MERS have significant direct and indirect social impacts, which include disease-induced mortality and economic losses. Also, a delayed response to the outbreak and underestimating its danger can further aggravate the situation. Hence, an analysis and establishing efficient strategies for preventing the propagation of MERS is a very important and urgent issue. In this paper, we propose a class of nonlinear susceptible-infectious-quarantined (SIQ) models for analyzing and controlling the MERS outbreak in Korea. For the SIQ based ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, we perform the task of parameter estimation, and apply optimal control theory to the controlled SIQ model, with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies. Simulation results show that the proposed SIQ model can explain the observed data for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the MERS outbreak very well, and the number of the MERS cases can be controlled reasonably well via the optimal control approach.","Ahn, Inkyung; Heo, Seongman; Ji, Seunghyun; Kim, Kyung Hyun; Kim, Taehwan; Lee, Eun Joo; Park, Jooyoung; Sung, Keehoon",J Theor Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317304666; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519317304666; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.10.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031518/,449

This study analyzed the mediation role of coping and affect in the relation between self-compassion and negative emotional symptoms during the quarantine decreed by Portuguese Health Authorities in the first phase of the coronavirus outbreak. A total of 428 Portuguese adults (75% women; M(age) = 40.8, SD = 11.6) completed an online survey comprised by the Self-Compassion Scale (predictor); Short Version of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (outcomes); The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; and Brief-COPE. These instruments were adapted to COVID 19’s epidemic. Parallel mediation analyses demonstrated that self-compassionate participants were at less risk of suffering from symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the quarantine. Plus, the relation between self-compassion and depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms were mediated by negative affect and dysfunctional coping style, but only for symptoms of depression. The findings support coping strategies and affect as links between self-compassion and distress but also the importance of separately analyzing the role of self-compassion, negative affect, and coping on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. Low self-compassion might increase negative affect, maintaining stress responses to face demanding events during the COVID-19 epidemic.

Both Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency have recently approved the first COVID‐19 vaccines, and a few more are going to be approved soon. METHODS: Several different approaches have been used to stimulate the immune system in mounting a humoral response. As more traditional approaches are under investigation (inactivated virus vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, recombinant virus vaccines), more recent and innovative strategies have been tried (non‐replicating viral vector vaccines, RNA based vaccines, DNA based vaccines). RESULTS: Since vaccinations campaigns started in December 2020 in both the US and Europe, gastroenterologists will be one of the main sources of information regarding SARS‐CoV 2 vaccination for patients in their practice, including vulnerable patients such as those with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), patients with chronic liver disease, and GI cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we must ourselves be well educated and updated in order to provide unambiguous counseling to these categories of vulnerable patients. In this commentary, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of both approved COVID‐19 vaccines and the ones still under development, and explore potential risks, benefits and prioritization of vaccination.","Spadaccini, Marco; Canziani, Lorenzo; Aghemo, Alessio; Lleo, Ana; Maselli, Roberta; Anderloni, Andrea; Carrara, Silvia; Fugazza, Alessandro; Pellegatta, Gaia; Galtieri, Piera Alessia; Hassan, Cesare; Greenwald, David; Pochapin, Mark; Wallace, Michael; Sharma, Prateek; Roesch, Thomas; Bhandari, Pradeep; Emura, Fabian; Raju, Gottumukkala S; Repici, Alessandro",United European Gastroenterol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34102015/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ueg2.12103,449

However, this has likely impacted access to care for patients experiencing other conditions. We aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on access to care for patients with urgent/emergent urological conditions throughout Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 33 urological units in the AGILE consortium, asking clinicians to report on the number of urgent/emergent urological patients seen and/or undergoing surgery over a 3-week period during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak and a reference week prior to the outbreak. ANOVA and linear regression models were used to quantify these changes. RESULTS: Data from 27 urological centres in Italy showed a decrease from 956 patients/week seen just prior to the outbreak to 291 patients/week seen by the end of the study period. There was a difference in the number of patients with urgent/emergent urological disease seen within/during the different weeks (all p values < 0.05). A significant decrease in the number of patients presenting with haematuria, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, scrotal pain, renal colic, or trauma and urgent/emergent cases that required surgery was reported (all p values < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In Italy, during the COVID-19 outbreak there has been a decrease in patients seeking help for urgent/emergent urological conditions. Restructuring of hospitals and clinics is mandatory to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the healthcare system should continue to provide adequate levels of care also to patients with other conditions.","Porreca, Angelo; Colicchia, Michele; D'Agostino, Daniele; Amenta, Michele; Corsaro, Alfio; Zaramella, Stefano; Zegna, Luisa; Gallo, Fabrizio; Schenone, Maurizio; Bozzini, Giorgio; Calori, Alberto; Pastore, Antonio L.; Al Salhi, Yazan; Sciorio, Carmine; Spirito, Lorenzo; Varca, Virginia; Marenghi, Carlo; Greco, Francesco; Altieri, Vincenzo M.; Verze, Paolo; Barba, Ciro; Antonelli, Alessandro; Cerruto, Maria A.; Falabella, Roberto; Di Bello, Silvana; Leonardo, Costantino; Tufano, Antonio; Volpe, Alessandro; Umari, Paolo; Parma, Paolo; Nidini, Mattia; Pini, Giovannalberto; Borghesi, Marco; Terrone, Carlo; Cacciamani, Giovanni E.; Sighinolfi, Maria C.; Busetto, Gian Maria; Wennberg, Alexandra M.; Finocchiaro, Marinella; Falsaperla, Mario; Oderda, Marco; Ceruti, Carlo; Rocco, Bernardo; Schiavina, Riccardo; Bianchi, Lorenzo; Mari, Andrea; Di Maida, Fabrizio; Dalpiaz, Orietta; Celia, Antonio; Pirozzi, Marco; Bove, Pierluigi; Iacovelli, Valerio; Cafarelli, Angelo; Cindolo, Luca; Ferrari, Giovanni; Gatti, Lorenzo; Pirola, Giacomo; Annino, Filippo; Pucci, Luigi; Romagnoli, Daniele; Artibani, Walter; Minervini, Andrea",Urol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434207/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000508512,449

The objective of this research article is to examine if current international investment law, especially its investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism, could provide necessary protection to Indigenous rights. We searched all publicly available ISDS cases from 2000 to 2020, and selected 10 typical ones for comprehensive case study by using various research methods such as doctrinal legal research and comparative analysis. Our research revealed that Indigenous peoples’ participation in the ISDS proceedings is legally restrained, time-consuming, and rarely favorably decided by the arbitral tribunals. Responsibility for such undesirable outcomes rests with all stakeholders involved in the process, while the consequences of post-arbitration tend to be “triple losing”. These findings highlight the quest for a more sustainable international investment regime that promotes Indigenous peoples’ wellbeing and environment protection. We argue that future reform could be promoted not only over ISDS procedural matters, but also by upgrading substantive rules in international investment agreements (IIAs), emphasizing free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC), and strengthening foreign investors’ corporate social responsibilities (CSR).","Wang, Chao; Ning, Jing; Zhang, Xiaohan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360089/,449

DESIGN & METHODS: A total of 2787 family and non-family visitors entering through the glass sliding door of 6 pediatric wards at a university children's hospital were observed for 4 h, respectively, before and after interventions between April 27 and May 20, 2018. In the first intervention, a visual stimulus emphasized the location of the hand sanitizer. In the second intervention, an additional auditory stimulus transmitted a cue through a motion sensor speaker. RESULTS: During the preliminary observation, the HHC rates of family and non-family visitors were 0.0% and 1.5%, respectively; after the visual stimulus, they were 0.6% and 5.4%, and after the audio-visual stimulus, 1.8% and 8.2%. There was a significant increase in the overall HHC with the visual (OR, 5.22; 95% CI, 1.76–20.90) and audio-visual (OR, 8.67; 95% CI, 3.08–33.70) stimuli (Fisher's exact test, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The HHC of family and non-family visitors entering pediatric wards was very low and the audio-visual stimulus was found to be more effective than was the visual stimulus alone.

Jahrestagung der Österreichischen Gesellschaft für Kinder- und Jugendheilkunde,2016-08-25,"Background: Healthcare systems globally have been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating the reorganization of surgical services to free capacity within healthcare systems. Objectives: To understand how surgical services have been reorganized during and following public health emergencies, and the consequences of these changes for patients, healthcare providers and healthcare systems. Methods: This rapid scoping review searched academic databases and grey literature sources to identify studies examining surgical service delivery during public health emergencies including COVID-19, and the impact on patients, providers and healthcare systems. Recommendations and guidelines were excluded. Screening was completed in partial (title, abstract) or complete (full text) duplicate following pilot reviews of 50 articles to ensure reliable application of eligibility criteria. Results: One hundred and thirty-two studies were included in this review; 111 described reorganization of surgical services, 55 described the consequences of reorganizing surgical services and six reported actions taken to rebuild surgical capacity in public health emergencies. Reorganizations of surgical services were grouped under six domains: case selection/triage, PPE regulations and practice, workforce composition and deployment, outpatient and inpatient patient care, resident and fellow education, and the hospital or clinical environment. Service reorganizations led to large reductions in non-urgent surgical volumes, increases in surgical wait times, and impacted medical training (i.e., reduced case involvement) and patient outcomes (e.g., increases in pain). Strategies for rebuilding surgical capacity were scarce, but focused on the availability of staff, PPE, and patient readiness for surgery as key factors to consider before resuming services. Conclusions: Reorganization of surgical services in response to public health emergencies appears to be context-dependent and has far-reaching consequences that must be better understood in order to optimize future health system responses to public health emergencies.","O'Rielly, C.; Ng Kamstra, J.; Kania-Richmond, A.; Dort, J.
