128,Clinical review: Mass casualty triage – pandemic influenza and critical care,2007-04-30,"Worst case scenarios for pandemic influenza planning in the US involve over 700,000 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. UK planning predicts a 231% occupancy of current level 3 (intensive care unit) bed capacity. Critical care planners need to recognise that mortality is likely to be high and the risk to healthcare workers significant. Contingency planning should, therefore, be multi-faceted, involving a robust health command structure, the facility to expand critical care provision in terms of space, equipment and staff and cohorting of affected patients in the early stages. It should also be recognised that despite this expansion of critical care, demand will exceed supply and a process for triage needs to be developed that is valid, reproducible, transparent and consistent with distributive justice. We advocate the development and validation of physiological scores for use as a triage tool, coupled with candid public discussion of the process.","Challen, Kirsty; Bentley, Andrew; Bright, John; Walter, Darren",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2206465/,82
671,Critical care services and the H1N1 (2009) influenza epidemic in Australia and New Zealand in 2010: the impact of the second winter epidemic,2011-06-09,"INTRODUCTION: During the first winter of exposure, the H1N1 2009 influenza virus placed considerable strain on intensive care unit (ICU) services in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ). We assessed the impact of the H1N1 2009 influenza virus on ICU services during the second (2010) winter, following the implementation of vaccination. METHODS: A prospective, cohort study was conducted in all ANZ ICUs during the southern hemisphere winter of 2010. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics, including vaccination status and outcomes, were collected. The characteristics of patients admitted during the 2010 and 2009 seasons were compared. RESULTS: From 1 June to 15 October 2010, there were 315 patients with confirmed influenza A, of whom 283 patients (90%) had H1N1 2009 (10.6 cases per million inhabitants; 95% confidence interval (CI), 9.4 to 11.9) which was an observed incidence of 33% of that in 2009 (P < 0.001). The maximum daily ICU occupancy was 2.4 beds (95% CI, 1.8 to 3) per million inhabitants in 2010 compared with 7.5 (95% CI, 6.5 to 8.6) in 2009, (P < 0.001). The onset of the epidemic in 2010 was delayed by five weeks compared with 2009. The clinical characteristics were similar in 2010 and 2009 with no difference in the age distribution, proportion of patients treated with mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU admission, or hospital mortality. Unlike 2009 the incidence of critical illness was significantly greater in New Zealand (18.8 cases per million inhabitants compared with 9 in Australia, P < 0.001). Of 170 patients with known vaccination status, 26 (15.3%) had been vaccinated against H1N1 2009. CONCLUSIONS: During the 2010 ANZ winter, the impact of H1N1 2009 on ICU services was still appreciable in Australia and substantial in New Zealand.

4440,Ventilatory support and mechanical properties of the fibrotic lung acting as a “squishy ball”,2020-02-04,"Protective ventilation is the cornerstone of treatment of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, no studies have yet established the best ventilatory strategy to adopt when patients with acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease (AE-ILD) are admitted to the intensive care unit. Due to the severe impairment of the respiratory mechanics, the fibrotic lung is at high risk of developing ventilator-induced lung injury, regardless of the lung fibrosis etiology. The purpose of this review is to analyze the effects of mechanical ventilation in AE-ILD and to increase the knowledge on the characteristics of fibrotic lung during artificial ventilation, introducing the concept of “squishy ball lung”. The role of positive end-expiratory pressure is discussed, proposing a “lung resting strategy” as opposed to the “open lung approach”. The review also discusses the practical management of AE-ILD patients discussing illustrative clinical cases.","Marchioni, Alessandro; Tonelli, Roberto; Rossi, Giulio; Spagnolo, Paolo; Luppi, Fabrizio; Cerri, Stefania; Cocconcelli, Elisabetta; Pellegrino, Maria Rosaria; Fantini, Riccardo; Tabbì, Luca; Castaniere, Ivana; Ball, Lorenzo; Malbrain, Manu L.

4480,A randomised placebo controlled trial of anakinra for treating pustular psoriasis: statistical analysis plan for stage two of the APRICOT trial,2020-02-10,"BACKGROUND: The number of patients with long-term chronic diseases is increasing. These patients place a strain on health care systems and health care professionals (HCPs). Presently, we aimed to systematically review the literature on HCPs’ experiences working with patients with long-term chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHOD: A systematic search of papers published between 2002 and July 2019 was conducted in the Embase, AMED, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and COCHRANE databases to identify studies reporting qualitative interviews addressing HCPs’ experiences working with adults with COPD, CKD or type 2 diabetes. An interdisciplinary research group were involved in all phases of the study. With the help of NVivo, extracts of each paper were coded, and codes were compared across papers and refined using translational analysis. Further codes were clustered in categories that in turn formed overarching themes. RESULTS: Our comprehensive search identified 4170 citations. Of these, 20 papers met our inclusion criteria. Regarding HCPs’ experiences working with patients with COPD, CKD, or type 2 diabetes, we developed 10 sub-categories that formed three overarching main themes of work experiences: 1) individualizing one’s professional approach within the clinical encounter; 2) managing one’s emotions over time; 3) working to maintain professionalism. Overall these three themes suggest that HCPs’ work is a complex balancing act depending on the interaction between patient and professional, reality and professional ideals, and contextual support and managing one’s own emotions. CONCLUSION: Few qualitative studies highlighted HCPs’ general working experiences, as they mainly focused on the patients’ experiences or HCPs’ experiences of using particular clinical procedures. This study brings new insights about the complexity embedded in HCPs’ work in terms of weighing different, often contrasting aspects, in order to deliver appropriate practice. Acknowledging, discussing and supporting this complexity can empower HCPs to avoid burning out. Leaders, health organizations, and educational institutions have a particular responsibility to provide HCPs with thorough professional knowledge and systematic support.

6692,Approach to neuromuscular disorders in the intensive care unit,2005,"Non-neoformans cryptococci have been generally regarded as saprophytes and rarely reported as human pathogens. However, the incidence of infection due to these organisms has increased over the past 40 years, with Cryptococcus laurentii and Cryptococcus albidus, together, responsible for 80% of reported cases. Conditions associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity are important risks for non-neoformans cryptococcal infections and prior azole prophylaxis has been associated with antifungal resistance. The presence of invasive devices was a significant risk factor for Cryptococcus laurentii infection (adjusted OR = 8.7; 95% CI = 1.48–82.9; p = 0.003), while predictors for mortality included age ≥45 years (aOR = 8.4; 95% CI = 1.18–78.82; p = 0.004) and meningeal presentation (aOR = 7.0; 95% CI = 1.85–60.5; p= 0.04). Because clinical manifestations of non-neoformans cryptococcal infections are most often indistinguishable from Cryptococcus neoformans, a high index of suspicion remains important to facilitate early diagnosis and prompt treatment for such infections.","Khawcharoenporn, T.; Apisarnthanarak, A.; Mundy, L.

11211,Clinical Profile of Critical Pertussis in Children at a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in Northern India,2020-03-30,"OBJECTIVES: Work stress is common in healthcare and reliably predicts negative outcomes, including burnout and lower quality of life (QOL). However, few studies have investigated factors that might attenuate the impact of stress on these negative outcomes. We investigated whether the tendency to be kind to the self during times of difficulty—self-compassion—might buffer the effect of work stress on outcomes. METHODS: Registered nurses (n = 801), physicians (n = 516), and medical students (n = 383) were recruited using convenience sampling in New Zealand. Following consent, participants (N = 1700) completed a survey including the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Self-Compassion Scale–Short Form. RESULTS: Across groups, greater work stress consistently predicted greater burnout and lower QOL, while greater self-compassion predicted lower burnout and better QOL. Self-compassion moderated the relationship between stress and burnout in nurses (albeit in the opposite direction to what had been predicted), but not in doctors or medical students. CONCLUSIONS: While self-compassion predicted better outcomes (and may thus represent a target to enhance wellbeing), it strengthened the association between stress and burnout in nurses. How self-compassion impacts the experience of stress and its correlates and why it does so differently in different groups of professionals remains unclear.","Dev, Vinayak; Fernando, Antonio T.; Consedine, Nathan S.",Mindfulness (N Y),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223415/,82
11527,Contemporary strategies to improve clinical trial design for critical care research: insights from the First Critical Care Clinical Trialists Workshop,2020-02-18,"BACKGROUND: Male patients undergoing bariatric surgery have (historically) been considered higher risk than females. The aim of this study was to examine the disparity between genders undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures and assess gender as an independent risk factor. METHODS: The MBSAQIP® Data Registry Participant User Files for 2015–2017 was reviewed for patients having primary SG and RYGB. Patients were divided into groups based on gender and procedure. Variables for major complications were grouped together, including but not limited to PE, stroke, and MI. Univariate and propensity matching analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 429,664 cases, 20.58% were male. Univariate analysis demonstrated males were older (46.48 ± 11.96 vs. 43.71 ± 11.89 years, p < 0.0001), had higher BMI (46.58 ± 8.46 vs. 45.05 ± 7.75 kg/m(2), p < 0.0001), and had higher incidence of comorbidities. Males had higher rates of major complications (1.72 vs. 1.05%; p < 0.0001) and 30-day mortality (0.18 vs. 0.07%, p < 0.0001). Significance was maintained after subgroup analysis of SG and RYGB. Propensity matched analysis demonstrated male gender was an independent risk factor for RYGB and SG, major complications [2.21 vs. 1.7%, p < 0.0001 (RYGB), 1.12 vs. 0.89%, p < 0.0001 (SG)], and mortality [0.23 vs. 0.12%, p < 0.0001 (RYGB), 0.10 vs. 0.05%; p < 0.0001 (SG)]. CONCLUSION: Males continue to represent a disproportionately small percentage of bariatric surgery patients despite having no difference in obesity rates compared to females. Male gender is an independent risk factor for major post-operative complications and 30-day mortality, even after controlling for comorbidities.","Dugan, Nicholas; Thompson, Kyle J.; Barbat, Selwan; Prasad, Tanushree; McKillop, Iain H.; Maloney, Sean R.; Roberts, Amanda; Gersin, Keith S.; Kuwada, Timothy S.; Nimeri, Abdelrahman",Surg Endosc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224103/,82
11529,Comparison of Conventional Intensive Care Scoring Systems and Prognostic Scores Specific for Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Predicting One-Year Mortality,2020-05-12,"Mycobacterial pathogens can be categorized into three broad groups: Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex causing tuberculosis, M. leprae and M. lepromatosis causing leprosy, and atypical mycobacteria, or non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), responsible for a wide range of diseases. Among the NTMs, M. ulcerans is responsible for the neglected tropical skin disease Buruli ulcer (BU). Most pathogenic mycobacteria, including M. leprae, evade effector mechanisms of the humoral immune system by hiding and replicating inside host cells and are furthermore excellent modulators of host immune responses. In contrast, M. ulcerans replicates predominantly extracellularly, sheltered from host immune responses through the cytotoxic and immunosuppressive effects of mycolactone, a macrolide produced by the bacteria. In the year 2018, 208,613 new cases of leprosy and 2713 new cases of BU were reported to WHO, figures which are notoriously skewed by vast underreporting of these diseases.","Röltgen, Katharina; Pluschke, Gerd; Spencer, John Stewart; Brennan, Patrick Joseph; Avanzi, Charlotte",Semin Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224112/,82

The results show that the improvement of the effectiveness of internal control has a significant promoting effect on innovation performance, and promotes enterprises to strengthen CSR performance. Meanwhile, CSR activities take a significant intermediary effect in the process of improving innovation performance through internal control. Finally, it is suggested that state-owned enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises should communicate and cooperate, strengthen the construction of internal control system, and improve innovation performance and CSR practices. Furthermore, the intermediary effect of CSR activities in the process of improving innovation performance through internal control should be brought into play, so as to return the expectations and demands of stakeholders.","Li, Xiao",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7289431/,82

How long-lived cells deal with ageing-related damage is poorly understood. Here we show that polyploid cells accumulate in the adult fly brain and that polyploidy protects against DNA damage-induced cell death. Multiple types of neurons and glia that are diploid at eclosion, become polyploid in the adult Drosophila brain. The optic lobes exhibit the highest levels of polyploidy, associated with an elevated DNA damage response in this brain region. Inducing oxidative stress or exogenous DNA damage leads to an earlier onset of polyploidy, and polyploid cells in the adult brain are more resistant to DNA damage-induced cell death than diploid cells. Our results suggest polyploidy may serve a protective role for neurons and glia in adult Drosophila melanogaster brains.","Nandakumar, Shyama; Grushko, Olga; Buttitta, Laura A",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7447450/,82
13507,Pediatric Resident Engagement With an Online Critical Care Curriculum During the Intensive Care Rotation*,2020-06-25,"Wine production is an ancient human activity that generates several by-products, which include some constituents known for their potential in health care and for their role in the food or cosmetic industries. Any variety of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) contains nutrients and bioactive compounds available from their juice or solid parts. Grape seed extract has demonstrated many activities in disease prevention, such as antioxidant effects, which make it a potential source of nutraceuticals. Grape seed is a remarkable winery industry by-product due to the bioactivity of its constituents. Methods for recovery of oil from grape seeds have evolved to improve both the quantity and quality of the yield. Both the lipophilic and hydrophilic chemicals present in the oil of V. vinifera L. make this wine by-product a source of natural nutraceuticals. Food and non-food industries are becoming novel targets of oil obtained from grape seeds given its various properties. This review focuses on the advantages of grape seed oil intake in our diet regarding its chemical composition in industries not related to wine production and the economic and environmental impact of oil production.","Martin, Maria E; Grao-Cruces, Elena; Millan-Linares, Maria C; Montserrat-de la Paz, Sergio",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7599587/,82

The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a diuretic strategy to overcome positive fluid balance in patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Design: Multicenter, single-blind, randomized-controlled study. Patients were randomized into a diuretic (furosemide) or a control group. Patients were eligible in case of fluid overload defined as in-ICU weight increase ≥ 3%, invasive mechanical ventilation (FiO(2) ≤ 60% and PEEP ≤ 10 cm H(2)O on inclusion) and hemodynamic stabilization. The primary outcome was fluid balance, defined as weight variation from reference weight to successful extubation. The main secondary outcome was the safety of diuretic. RESULTS: 171 patients were randomized. After 5 exclusions, 166 patients were included in the analysis: 77 in the diuretic and 89 in the control group. Fluid balance was 1.4 [− 2.5 to 4.5] kg in the diuretic and 6.4 [0.5–11.2] kg in the control group (p < 0.001). In the multiple imputation analysis, fluid balance was significantly decreased in the diuretic group (mean difference = − 4.8 95% CI [− 7.3 to − 2.5], p < 0.001). Eleven (14%) patients died in the diuretic group and 16 (18%) patients in the control group (p = 0.5).

Almost no research in public health, to our knowledge, has explored conversational structure on social media among posts sent by different accounts. METHODS: Starting with 1,017,176 tweets by relevant users, we constructed 2 corpuses of multi-tweet conversations. The first was 1,814 conversations that included VSN members directly, whereas the second was 2,283 conversations mentioning vaccines or vaccine denialism. The tweets and user metadata were then analyzed using an adaptation of rhetorical structure theory. RESULTS: In the studied data, VSN members tweeted 12,677 times within conversations, compared to their 37,587 lone tweets. Their conversations were shorter than those in the comparison corpus (P < 0.0001), and they were involved in fewer multilogues (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: While there is diversity among organizations, most were tied to the pre-social media broadcast model. In the future, they should try to converse more, rather than tweet more, and embrace best practices in risk communication.","Manheim, David; Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7943953/,82

Transcutaneous Capnography (TcpCO(2)) can be used as an objective tool to assess a patient’s ventilatory status. This study was designed to assess for any correlation of continuous monitoring of TcpCO(2) with the respiratory clinical scores and deterioration in children admitted for acute respiratory distress. A prospective observational study over one year on children aged 2 weeks to 5 years admitted with acute respiratory distress or failure secondary to Bronchiolitis and Reactive airway disease was performed. Continuous TcpCO(2) monitoring for upto 48 h was recorded. Investigators, bedside physicians, respiratory therapists, and nurses were blinded from the transcutaneous trends at the time of data collection. Total of 813 TcpCO(2) measurements at standard intervals of 30 min were obtained on 38 subjects. Subjects with abnormal TcpCO(2) (> 45 mmHg) were younger (6.9 ± 5.2 vs. 23.05 ± 17.7 months,) and were more likely to be on higher oxygen flow rate (0.52 L/min/kg vs 0.46 lier/min/kg, p = 0.004) and higher FiO(2) (38.4 vs 33.6, p < 0.001 using heated high flow nasal cannula. No difference was found in bronchiolitis score or PEW score in subjects with normal and abnormal TcpCO(2). A small but statistically significant increase in TcpCO(2) was observed at the escalation of care. Even though odds of escalation of care are higher with abnormal TcpCO(2) (OR 1.92), this difference did not reach statistical significance. pCO(2) can provide additive information for non-invasive clinical monitoring of children requiring varying respiratory support; however, it does not provide predictive value for escalation or de-escalation of care.","Shaikh, Nadia; Tripathi, Sandeep; Whelan, Aviva; Ford, Jessica; Kim, Minchul; Deshpande, Girish",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083923/,82
17244,The effect of care provided by paediatric critical care transport teams on mortality of children transported to paediatric intensive care units in England and Wales: a retrospective cohort study,2021-05-03,"PURPOSE: Most HER2 positive invasive cancers are either intrinsic non-responsive or develop resistance when treated with 1st line HER2 targeting drugs. Both 1st and 2nd line treatments of HER2 positive cancers are aimed at targeting the HER2 receptor directly, thereby strongly limiting the treatment options of HER2/ErbB2 inhibition resistant invasive cancers. METHODS: We used phenotypic high throughput microscopy screening to identify efficient inhibitors of ErbB2-induced invasion using 1st line HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab- and pertuzumab-resistant, p95-ErbB2 expressing breast cancer cells in conjunction with the Prestwick Chemical Library®. The screening entailed a drug’s ability to inhibit ErbB2-induced, invasion-promoting positioning of lysosomes at the cellular periphery, a phenotype that defines their invasiveness. In addition, we used high throughput microscopy and biochemical assays to assess the effects of the drugs on lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and autophagy, two features connected to cancer treatment. Using 2nd line HER2 inhibitor lapatinib resistant 3-dimensional model systems, we assessed the effects of the drugs on ErbB2 positive breast cancer spheroids and developed a high-throughput invasion assay for HER2 positive ovarian cancer organoids for further evaluation. RESULTS: We identified Auranofin, Colchicine, Monensin, Niclosamide, Podophyllotoxin, Quinacrine and Thiostrepton as efficient inhibitors of invasive growth of 2nd line HER2 inhibitor lapatinib resistant breast cancer spheroids and ovarian cancer organoids. We classified these drugs into four groups based on their ability to target lysosomes by inducing autophagy and/or LMP, i.e., drugs inducing early LMP, early autophagy with late LMP, late LMP, or neither. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that targetable lysosome-engaging cellular pathways downstream of ErbB2 contribute to invasion. They support lysosomal trafficking as an attractive target for therapy aiming at preventing the spreading of cancer cells. Since these drugs additionally possess anti-inflammatory activities, they could serve as multipurpose drugs simultaneously targeting infection/inflammation and cancer spreading.

The objective of this study is to identify and characterize the associations between a neonatal or pediatric ICU hospitalization and the short- and long-term cognition of survivors. The databases Cochrane Library, Medline, EBSCO, Embase, and Google Scholar and the journals JAMA Pediatrics, Journal of Pediatrics, Pediatrics, Archives of Disease in Childhood, Academic Pediatrics, Pediatric Critical Care Medicine and Child Development were searched until April 2021. Retrieved article references were analyzed. Included articles investigated cognition as an outcome of ICU hospitalization in non-preterm neonatal or pediatric patients. Case studies and studies analyzing diagnosis or treatment interventions were excluded. Four prospective cohort or case-control studies and two retrospective cohort studies were included, totaling 2172 neonatal and 42368 pediatric patients. Quality assessment using the BMJ Criteria and Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk-of-Bias tool displayed good results. Significant negative associations were found between neonatal cognition and length-of-ICU-stay at 9- (p<0.001) and 24 months (p<0.01), and between pediatric cognition and length-of-ICU-stay at discharge (p<0.001). Additional weeks on the neonatal ICU increased odds of impairment at 9- (OR 1.08, 95%CI 1.034–1.112) and 24 months (OR 1.11, 95%CI 1.065–1.165). Conclusion: There is a significant negative correlation between NICU and PICU hospitalization and the short- and long-term cognitive status. Future research must identify patient- and hospital-related risk factors and develop management strategies.","Royer, Ana Sánchez-Moreno; Busari, Jamiu O.",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8192269/,82

Despite past failures, TCVs have gained renewed enthusiasm for their potential to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibition. Telomerase stands as an attractive target for TCVs due to its almost universal presence in cancer and its essential function promoting tumor growth. Herein, we review tumor telomerase biology that may affect the efficacy of therapeutic vaccination and provide insights on optimal vaccine design and treatment combinations. Tumor types possessing mechanisms of increased telomerase expression combined with an immune permissive tumor microenvironment are expected to increase the therapeutic potential of telomerase-targeting cancer vaccines. Regardless, rational treatment combinations, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are likely necessary to bring out the true clinical potential of TCVs.","Ellingsen, Espen Basmo; Mangsbo, Sara M.; Hovig, Eivind; Gaudernack, Gustav",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8288190/,82

22209,Large-scale implementation of a critical care surge capacity management program,2010-03-01,"Background: Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) results in transient muscle inflammation, strength loss, and muscle soreness and may cause subsequent exercise avoidance. Research has recently proven that skeletal muscle can also release extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the circulation following a bout of exercise. However, EV’s potential role, including as a biomarker, in the response to eccentric resistance exercise stimulus remains unclear. Methods: Twelve (younger, n=7, 27.0±1.5years and older, n=5, 63.0±1.0years) healthy, physically active males, undertaking moderate, regular physical activity (3–5 times per week) performed a unilateral high intensity eccentric exercise protocol. Venous plasma was collected for assessment of EVs and creatine kinase (CK) prior to EIMD, immediately after EIMD, and 1–72h post-EIMD, and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) were assessed at all time points, except 1 and 2h post-EIMD. Results: A significant effect of both time (p=0.005) and group (p<0.001) was noted for MVIC, with younger participants’ MVIC being higher throughout. Whilst a significant increase was observed in DOMS in the younger group (p=0.014) and in the older group (p=0.034) following EIMD, no significant differences were observed between groups. CK was not different between age groups but was altered following the EIMD (main effect of time p=0.026), with increased CK seen immediately post-, at 1 and 2h post-EIMD. EV count tended to be lower in older participants at rest, relative to younger participants (p=0.056), whilst EV modal size did not differ between younger and older participants pre-EIMD. EIMD did not substantially alter EV modal size or EV count in younger or older participants; however, the alteration in EV concentration (ΔCount) and EV modal size (ΔMode) between post-EIMD and pre-EIMD negatively associated with CK activity. No significant associations were noted between MVIC or DOMS and either ΔCount or ΔMode of EVs at any time point. Conclusion: These findings suggest that profile of EV release, immediately following exercise, may predict later CK release and play a role in the EIMD response. Exercise-induced EV release profiles may therefore serve as an indicator for subsequent muscle damage.","Kyriakidou, Yvoni; Cooper, Isabella; Kraev, Igor; Lange, Sigrun; Elliott, Bradley T.",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8507150/,82

Of those that infect humans, it is estimated that roughly 20 % are of nonhuman primate origin. The same ease characterizes pathogen transmission in the other direction, from humans to nonhuman primates. This latter problem has increasingly serious ramifications for conservation efforts, as growing numbers of ecotourists and researchers serve as potential vectors of disease. Here, we present an analysis of major cross-species transmission events between human and nonhuman primates. In particular, we consider HIV and malaria as case studies in which nonhuman primate pathogens emerged and became permanent fixtures in human populations. The human practices that facilitate such events are considered, as well as the evolutionary consequences of these events. In addition, we describe human-to-nonhuman primate transmission events and discuss the potential of human pathogens to adapt to nonhuman primate hosts. The topic of emerging infections is addressed, in both human and nonhuman species, in light of changing patterns of contact and novel adaptations on the part of pathogens and hosts.","Harper, Kristin N.; Zuckerman, Molly K.; Turner, Bethany L.; Armelagos, George J.","Primates, Pathogens, and Evolution",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120702/,82

Until the invention of the electron microscope, it was impossible to visualize a virus. The first viruses to be visualized were bacteriophage, which appeared to have a head and tail-like structure. Only the nucleic acid entered the bacterial cell through the tail. Animal viruses were described as spherical or rod-shaped; they were bound to receptors and were taken up by the cell. After the crystallization of the tobacco mosaic virus, there was much discussion as to whether viruses were “living” organisms; the controversy continues to this day. Although viruses were defined in part on the basis of size and filterability, viruses much larger than the traditional viruses have recently been isolated. Studies of viral replication indicate that most viruses self-assemble as a result of interactions between the viral proteins to form a viral capsid that interacts with the nucleic acid to form the whole. The viral replication cycle and synthesis is presented in this chapter. Viral classification into a Linnaean scheme has been proposed, but newer methods using nucleic acid homologies are changing classification. Viruses are spread in the human population by various means, including airborne particles, fecal-oral contact, clothing, insects, and contact with other animals (zoonosis).","Taylor, Milton W.",Viruses and Man: A History of Interactions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122971/,82
26205,Evolution of Intensive Care Unit Nursing,2017-10-06,"L-type lectins possess a luminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that binds to high-mannose-type oligosaccharides in aCa(2+)-dependent manner. The L-type CRD is named after the lectins found in abundance in the seeds of leguminous plants, such as concanavalin A from jack beans. The history of L-type lectins is as old as discovery of plant lectins from seeds of leguminous plants in nineteenth century. The structural motifs of L-type lectins are now known to be present in a variety of glycan-binding proteins from other eukaryotic organisms. The domain is present in plant, fungal, and animal proteins, but plant and animal L-type lectins have divergent sequences and different molecular properties. While plant lectins are secreted-soluble proteins and found at high level in specialised tissues, animal L-type lectins are (often membrane-bound) luminal proteins that are found at low levels in many different cell types. This observation suggests that animal L-type lectins have different functions. The crystal structures of some of the legume seed lectins show structural similarities among these lectins and to some other lectins, including the galectins and a variety of other lectins. Therefore, the term “L-lectins” has been designated as a classification for all lectins with this legume seed lectin-like structure. The L-type lectin-like domain has an overall globular shape composed of a β-sandwich of two major twisted antiparallel β-sheets. The β-sandwich comprises a major concave β-sheet and a minor convex β-sheet, in a variation of the jelly roll fold (Velloso et al. 2002, 2003; Satoh et al. 2006, 2007).","Gupta, G.

From isolation of people in case of an epidemic (Ebola, Coronavirus, ..) to mineworkers or scientist in the Antarctic environment, it is currently well established that extreme isolation is a stressor element which negatively affects human creating stress and social conflict. Living in outer space is one of the most extreme forms of isolation that can be used as a test bench for isolation research. Crews in space are expected to be able to manage independently stress and social conflict problems to be highly reliable and autonomous. Human natural language (NL) has the potential of being a valuable source of information on crew-members stress and reliability in isolation. Based on the use of NL, the PSI (Performance and Stress in Isolation) research group is developing an Artificial Intelligent tool for the autonomous monitoring of stress and reliability. In order to develop this tool, the first step (here presented) is to investigate the correlation of NL with stress and reliability within the PSI experiment. The experiment consisted of three tasks to be performed periodically during the isolation: 1. Analysis of free written communication (NL); 2. Short self-reference questionnaire; and 3. Detection of heart rate and blood pressure values.

Our results show that the participating companies had issues with shared libraries as follows: coupling among teams, delays on fixes due to overhead on libraries development teams, and need to maintain many versions of the libraries. Our results highlight that the use of shared libraries may hinder agility on microservices. Thus, their use should be restricted to situations where shared libraries cannot be replaced by a microservice and the costs of replicating the code on each service is very high.","de Toledo, Saulo S.; Martini, Antonio; Sjøberg, Dag I.

METHODS: A retrospective, hospital based observation case series was performed on patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to Intensive Care Unit between 03/20/20 and 04/20/20. Inclusion criteria were: 1) Blood Glucose >250mg/dL; 2) Serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L; 3) Anion Gap >10; 4) serum pH < 7.3; 4) ketonemia or ketonuria; and 5) positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Hyperosmolality, on the other hand, was defined as an effective/calculated plasma osmolality >304 mOsm/kg. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU during the study period, 12 of them had either isolated DKA or DKA/HHS. Baseline demographics, lab values and outcome are summarized in Table 1. Six of the patients had isolated DKA and six had combined DKA and HHS.

Of the 12 patients, 10 patients (83%) had a history of DM, nine were type 2 and only one type 1; two patients were newly diagnosed DM, presenting as DKA, presumptively precipitated by COVID-19. Five patients (42%) had a BMI >30 kg/m2. As for ethnicity; seven were Hispanic (59%), four African American (33%), and one Caucasian (8%). Patients with combined DKA/HHS, higher BMI, higher HbA1c, severe acidosis tended to have higher mortality. The striking feature was that isolated DKA or combined DKA/HHS was the initial presentation for COVID-19 for most of the cases. Table 1: Demographic characteristic, inflammatory markers and outcome. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our observational retrospective case series reinforces the need to watch for new onset DM and monitor blood sugar closely in those with known diabetes mellitus during SARS-CoV-2 infection, in order to avoid such serious complications as DKA and HHS.

We augment an inductive logic programming learner with 2 novel contributions. First, we define a distance measure between candidate concept representations that improves the efficiency of search for target concept and generalization. Second, we leverage richer human inputs in the form of advice to improve the sample efficiency of learning. We prove that the proposed distance measure is semantically valid and use that to derive a PAC bound. Our experiments on diverse learning tasks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","Das, Mayukh; Ramanan, Nandini; Doppa, Janardhan Rao; Natarajan, Sriraam",Front Robot AI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7805948/,82
48984,Fever in Intensive Care Unit,2020-08-01,"This chapter examines the journey of Magical Realism to India through a comparative reading of Indian and Latin American fictional works that share several similar aesthetic and stylistic features as well as political and ideological agendas. Latin America did not view the East as a source of imperial powers, as it did Europe. Nevertheless, the East influenced the shaping of an eclectic imaginary that was consciously used by Latin American modernistas. Thus began an intense engagement between these two worlds. An example of this sustained engagement was the overwhelming response of Indian writers to Magical Realism provided by García Márquez’s novels. Therefore, Latin American literature, starting from the Boom, became a turning point for Indian vernacular literatures. The Subaltern for a long time occupied a central place in Indian prose and poetry, and this mode has given voice to the subaltern aesthetic subject that became a source for representing alterity. This is the reason for the strong and lasting impact of Latin American fiction on Indian literary scene.","Maurya, Vibha",Transpacific Literary and Cultural Connections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978883/,82

Preliminary data on changes in radiation dose to the US population indicate that this increase has been driven largely by medical imaging, to which cardiovascular imaging modalities-such as nuclear stress testing, invasive coronary angiography, and cardiovascular CT-contribute greatly. Given the putative association between low-dose radiation exposure and cancer risk, which most experts agree is supported by the available evidence, the 'radiation issue' in medical imaging has garnered increasing interest. This opinion piece focuses on changes in the use of and doses from medical imaging, the relationship between radiation dose and cancer risk and the controversy surrounding this subject, and clinical implications of radiation exposure from imaging tests.","Einstein, Andrew J",Nature reviews.

62051,The role of physiotherapy in a neonatal intensive care unit.,1988,"Background To assess and limit the SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk from symptomless individuals in the hospital setting, molecular and serological screening of staff and patients attending a tertiary hospital in China was conducted. Methods SARS-CoV-2 RNA was tested by quantitative RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were screened initially with two lateral flow immunoassays (LFIs) and further confirmed with three chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs). The assay performance was assessed using archived samples from 32 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 80 healthy individuals. Results Between April 24 and May 8, 2020, 16,043 subjects (7,392 medical staff, 4,714 inpatients, 1,209 chaperones, 1,705 outpatients, and 1,023 fever clinic patients) were screened. No subject tested positive for viral RNA. Seventy-three (0.46%) tested positive for IgM or IgG on the initial LFI screening, of whom 63 were investigated with CLIAs: 2 (0.01%) were confirmed as seroreactive and 18 (0.11%) were indeterminate. Unconfirmed seroreactivity was significantly more frequent in fever clinic patients. The CLIAs showed similar (95.0-100%) IgM or IgG specificity but higher IgG sensitivity (93.75-96.88% vs. 31.25-81.25%) than the LFIs. The confirmed seropositive cases included a previously discharged COVID-19 patient and an undiagnosed symptomless patient showing detectable IgM and IgG over 35 days of follow-up. No transmission was evidenced within the corresponding family cluster. Conclusions Low SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and limited exposure risk were observed. Seroprevalence varied between 0.012% and 0.12% according to the testing algorithm and the confirmation criteria used, indicating that quality standards for serological tests are needed. Protective immunity in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who recovered needs to be investigated further, but the associated risk of transmission appeared limited.","Huang, Jun; Zhang, Lu; Wu, Shengjun; Lu, Jie; Li, Fengying; Cheng, Yulan; Zhang, Qi; Li, Guiling; Yu, Haitao; Le, Zhian; He, Xiaowen; Ding, Yanjun; Candotti, Daniel; Xie, Xinyou; Zhang, Jun",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-7163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987250/,82

Although traumatic diaphragmatic hernia is treated with surgical repair, a laparoscopic approach is infrequently employed. Here we present the case of a 66-year-old man with a bruise on the left side of his back. CT revealed a left pneumothorax and left rib fractures. He was urgently hospitalized and relieved with conservative treatment. However, on day 4 of hospitalization, an incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia containing the transverse colon was observed on CT. The herniated viscera of the abdominal cavity were reduced laparoscopically, and the hernial orifice was repaired with direct closure. One-lung ventilation was used to limit the movement of the affected diaphragm, enabling effective laparoscopic suturing. The patient had an uneventful recovery period and was discharged 8 days postoperatively. The absence of diaphragmatic herniation recurrence was confirmed 6 months after surgery.","Nishikawa, Saki; Miguchi, Masashi; Nakahara, Hideki; Urushihara, Takashi; Egi, Hiroyuki; Shorin, Daiki; Fukuda, Hideki; Itamoto, Toshiyuki",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790052/,82

What is inescapable is that COVID-19 has an age-related risk component and the latest data shows that risks start to rise for people from midlife onwards. As governance agencies, professional practice, and academia work towards assessing, communicating, and addressing this risk, we ask: are existing gerontological conceptualisations of ageism appropriate for this exceptional situation and what is being (re)produced in terms of an aged subjectivity? Following van Dyk's (2016) critique of gerontology's 'othering' through both 'glorification' (third age) and 'abjection' (fourth age), a content analysis of statements and policy documents issued in response to COVID-19 provides evidence of well-meaning and inadvertent ageism through homogenizing language, the abjection/glorification binary within 'old age', and the power binary constructed between age and an age-neutral midlife.

67725,A Case Report of Spontaneous Nasal Septal Abscess in a Child.,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND Nurses play an important role in pharmaceutical care. They are involved in: detecting clinical change; communicating/discussing pharmacotherapy with patients, their advocates, and other healthcare professionals; proposing and implementing medication-related interventions; and ensuring follow-up of patients and medication regimens. To date, a framework of nurses' competences on knowledge, skills, and attitudes as to interprofessional pharmaceutical care tasks is missing. OBJECTIVES To reach agreement with experts about nurses' competences for tasks in interprofessional pharmaceutical care. METHODS A two-phase study starting with a scoping review followed by five Delphi rounds was performed. Competences extracted from the literature were assessed by an expert panel on relevance by using the RAND/UCLA method. The experts (n = 22) involved were healthcare professionals, nurse researchers, and educators from 14 European countries with a specific interest in nurses' roles in interprofessional pharmaceutical care. Descriptive statistics supported the data analysis. RESULTS The expert panel reached consensus on the relevance of 60 competences for 22 nursing tasks. Forty-one competences were related to 15 generic nursing tasks and 33 competences were related to seven specific nursing tasks. CONCLUSIONS This study resulted in a competence framework for competency-based nurse education. Future research should focus on imbedding these competences in nurse education. A structured instrument should be developed to assess students' readiness to achieve competence in interprofessional pharmaceutical care in clinical practice.","Dijkstra, Nienke E; De Baetselier, Elyne; Dilles, Tinne; Van Rompaey, Bart; da Cunha Batalha, Luis M; Filov, Izabela; Grøndahl, Vigdis Abrahamsen; Heczkova, Jana; Helgesen, Ann Karin; Jordan, Sue; Kafková, Zuzana; Karnjus, Igor; Kolovos, Petros; Langer, Gero; Lillo-Crespo, Manuel; Malara, Alba; Padyšáková, Hana; Prosen, Mirko; Pusztai, Dorina; Talarico, Francesco; Tziaferi, Styliani; Sino, Carolien G M",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34274774/,82

This article looks at the role that arts, culture, and creativity play in promoting social cohesion and community well-being. It presents research on the role that a community arts center plays in an ethnic enclave that is under stress of immigration and gentrification. Method. An academic-community research partnership conducted this research. A mixed-methods approach was used. Twenty-four interviews were conducted with stakeholders (including community leaders, neighborhood residents, and business owners). Surveys (n = 102) were done of community members and those who participate in the Center activities. Results. Interviewees and survey respondents point to the importance of the ethnic enclave as a close-knot community that helps to foster a sense of belonging, security, and cultural identity. Arts, culture, and creativity plays a role in maintaining this sense of social cohesion, despite the threat of gentrification. Engagement in the arts and creative practice are important for buffering the stress of immigration. Discussion. The center has an important role as a critical cultural, civic, and creative space for the neighborhood and the broader community who sees the ethnic enclave as their cultural home.","Rubin, Carolyn Leung; Chomitz, Virginia Rall; Woo, Cynthia; Li, Giles; Koch-Weser, Susan; Levine, Peter",Health promotion practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839921996336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942652/,82

METHODS A nationwide questionnaire survey on line was administered to medical staffs involved in COVID-19 treatment on February 28th, 2020. The questionnaire included drug treatment, respiratory support therapy, sedation and analgesia, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), etc. RESULTS There were 1 103 respondents, of whom 699 (504 doctors and 195 nurses) participated in the treatment of COVID-19. Finally, 432 doctors and 170 nurses from 9 provinces submitted valid questionnaires. The results of the questionnaire surveys of doctors and nurses were basically the same. Considering that doctors dominated in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, the results of the questionnaires of doctors were mainly analyzed. The doctors participating in the survey were mainly from Hubei (29.2%), followed by Henan (24.5%), Guizhou (22.7%), and Guangxi (14.6%), etc. 55.4% of the doctors came from tertiary three hospitals, and most of them have senior titles (56.4%). 232 doctors (53.7%) participated in the treatment of mild COVID-19, and 200 doctors (46.3%) participated in the treatment of severe and critically ill patients. More than 95% of the doctors expressed that they would carry out antiviral treatment for patients with COVID-19 regardless of disease severity. The main antiviral drugs included α-interferon (69.5%), lopinavir/ritonavir (65.0%), abidol (60.0%), and ribavirin (55.7%). The choice of antiviral drugs was highly consistent with the national treatment programs of COVID-19. At the same time, 95.5% of doctors would routinely prescribe antibiotics to severe and critically ill patients. 94.0% of doctors agreed to prescribe low-dose glucocorticoid therapy to severe and critically ill patients. About 2/3 of doctors would perform lung recruitment or prone position treatment for critical patients with invasive ventilation. 79.0% of doctors preferred to use deep sedation for patients with invasive ventilation. About 1/3 of doctors believed that CRRT should be initiated early, and nearly 1/3 of doctors suggested that ECMO should be used more aggressively in critically ill patients. CONCLUSIONS Medical staffs are familiar with the national treatment plan of COVID-19 and willing to follow it. However, as a new disease, we have limited knowledge about COVID-19 and there are still many controversies. Further practical training is needed to make clinicians more aware of the disease, and more evidence-based evidence is needed to guide clinical treatment.","Liu, Shaohua; Ding, Xianfei; Cao, Junzi; Zhang, Shuguang; Sun, Tongwen",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200313-00338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32527340/,82

Parents' management of their child's hearing aids (HAs) and regular follow-up with healthcare providers HA are fundamental components of effective intervention. OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this systematic review was to synthesise the current literature on HA use in the paediatric population, and the secondary objective was to review the factors associated with HA use. METHODS Electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LLBA from 2005 to 2019, were searched. Two reviewers individually screened potentially relevant articles over two phases. RESULTS Fifteen studies met this review criteria. Four studies reported HA use based on data logging records. In nine studies, the amount of HA use was evaluated based on parents' reports, and three studies concluded that parents overestimate their child's HA use. Age, degree of HL and parents' education level were the most frequently reported factors associated with a child's amount of HA use. CONCLUSIONS The results of this review will provide a foundation for future studies on the importance of monitoring HA use and the impact of consistent HA use on the language development of children with HL.","Salamatmanesh, Mina; Sikora, Lindsey; Bahraini, Sayna; MacAskill, Melissa; Lagace, Josée; Ramsay, Tim; Fitzpatrick, Elizabeth M",International journal of audiology,https://doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2021.1962014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407727/,82

To date, no series of LESS inguinal hernia repair has been published or documented. This study aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of LESS technique for inguinal hernia repairs. METHODS Between December 2008 and March 2009, LESS procedures for inguinal hernia repair through a transumbilical incision were performed for 16 patients with symptomatic inguinal hernias. The initial 9 cases were performed by a transabdominal preperitoneal method and the remaining 7 were completed with a totally extraperitoneal approach. All procedures were accessed with our homemade single port for simultaneous passage of laparoscope and instruments. RESULTS All procedures were completed successfully without conversion to standard laparoscopic or open surgery. These patients ranged in age from 21 to 80 years (median, 46.5 y) with a male to female ratio of 15:1. A total of 24 inguinal hernias, including 3 complicated types, were repaired. The median operative time was 83.5 minutes (range, 52 to 150 min). Two of the 16 patients suffered postoperative complications (12.5%). Most patients were discharged home on the second postoperative day. No port-related complications occurred. The cosmetic results were excellent. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, LESS procedures for inguinal hernia repair shows this technique to be both safe and feasible, even for complicated cases.

The aim of the study was to evaluate lung function and sleep-disordered breathing in children with achondroplasia. An interview, clinical examination, lung function tests with blood gases, and a polygraphic sleep study were obtained as part of routine annual evaluation in consecutive children with achondroplasia. We included 30 children (median age 3.0 years, range: 0.4-17.1) over a period of 21 months. Habitual snoring and witnessed apneas were observed in 77% and 33% of the patients, respectively. Prior to the sleep study, 10/29 (34%) patients had undergone upper airway surgery and 5/29 (17%) craniocervical decompression operation. Arterial blood gases were abnormal in two (7%) patients. Sleep findings were abnormal in 28/30 (93%) patients. Eleven (37%) patients had an apnea index≥1 event/hr and 26 (87%) had an apnea-hypopnea index≥5 events/hr. The ≥3% desaturation index was >5/hr in 22 (73%) patients. Sixteen (53%) patients had a minimal pulse oximetry<90% but only two (7%) patients had a maximal transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure>50 mmHg during sleep. As a consequence, the following therapeutic interventions were performed: upper airway surgery in four patients and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in five other patients, resulting in an improvement in sleep studies in all nine patients. Systematic sleep studies are recommended in children with achondroplasia because of the high prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. Upper airway surgery and NPPV are effective treatments of sleep-disordered breathing.","Julliand, Sébastien; Boulé, Michèle; Baujat, Geneviève; Ramirez, Adriana; Couloigner, Vincent; Beydon, Nicole; Zerah, Michel; di Rocco, Federico; Lemerrer, Martine; Cormier-Daire, Valérie; Fauroux, Brigitte",American journal of medical genetics.

84648,The Ventilator Management Team: Repurposing Anesthesia Workstations and Personnel to Combat COVID-19.,2020-07-17,"BACKGROUND In the subcategorization of atypical glandular cells (AGCs), origin of cells should be mentioned to estimate lesion sites for diagnosis. However, cases without subcategorization are often encountered due to limited reproducibility. We evaluated whether the subcategorization of AGC based on the Bethesda terminology can estimate lesion sites. METHODS We retrospectively investigated cases whose cervical smears were interpreted as AGC and underwent pathological assessment at our institution between June 2009 and September 2017. AGC was subcategorized based on the Bethesda System. Not-otherwise-specified (NOS) was subcategorized into endocervical cells (NOS-EC), endometrial cells (NOS-EM), or glandular cells (NOS-G). Favor neoplastic (FN) was subcategorized into endocervical cells (FN-EC) or glandular cells (FN-G). FN-G was further subcategorized into endometrial cells (FN-EM) or unknown origin (FN-UO). Clinicopathological data were retrieved from the medical records. RESULTS Of 88 AGC cases, there were 30 NOS-EC (34.1%), 2 NOS-EM (2.3%), 25 FN-EC (28.4%), 22 FN-EM (25.0%), and 9 FN-UO (10.2%). A significantly higher proportion of neoplastic lesions occurred in FN than in NOS (P <.001). The concordance of AGC subclass and lesion site was 88.0%, 70.7%, and 77.3% in FN-EC, FN-G, and FN-EM, respectively. The concordance of FN-EM and lesion site increased to 88.9% in patients aged >50 years. Of nine cases of FN-UO, six experienced nonendometrioid endometrial cancer and extrauterine malignancy. CONCLUSION Subcategorization of NOS and FN would be useful in estimating neoplastic lesions. Further subcategorization into FN-EC, FN-EM, and FN-UO would similarly be beneficial in estimating the lesion site, especially for small endometrial and extrauterine lesions.","Kawano, Kouichiro; Yamaguchi, Tomohiko; Nasu, Hiroki; Nishio, Shin; Ushijima, Kimio",Diagnostic cytopathology,https://doi.org/10.1002/dc.24549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668085/,82

PATIENTS AND METHODS Seven children with nonfunctioning kidneys, three with multicystic dysplastic kidneys, two with end-stage renal nephropathy due to vesicoureteral reflux, and two with giant hydronephrosis were qualified to nephrectomy or nephroureterectomy. The surgery was performed transperitoneally using single incision access laparoscopy. The operative time was in the range of 50-90 min. RESULTS There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The patients were discharged on the third postoperative day. The incision scars were hidden inside the umbilicus. CONCLUSIONS Nephrectomy or nephroureterectomy using a single transumbilical port in children is a feasible and efficacious technique. The advantages are shortened convalescence, excellent cosmetic results, and reduction of potential wounds complications. However, clear indication of single site laparoscopic procedures in children remains to be clarified.","Urbanowicz, Wiesław; Sulisławski, Janusz; Wolnicki, Michał",Central European journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.5173/ceju.2011.04.art12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578903/,82

The purpose of this study is to review the potential of dHACM to facilitate post-surgical and myelomeningocele wound repair. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was conducted to identify studies investigating dHACM use in pediatric and surgical wound care published from inception to October 2020. For each study, patient characteristics, wound characteristics, and outcomes following dHACM application were documented and assessed. Of the 190 articles reviewed, 15 publications were included in the final analysis. Results demonstrated that the average wound healing time varied across clinical indications (e.g., 14 days for trauma reconstruction to 116 days for Moh's surgery repair). Across indications, pediatric patients had shorter healing periods compared to adults (P < 0.01). Chronic wounds (> four weeks old) were documented in both adult (n = 3) and pediatric (n = 2) wound repair publications; all chronic surgical wounds demonstrated complete wound closure with dHACM. No complications from dHACM use were reported. Advantages of dHACM included increased patient satisfaction, cost-savings, and faster wound healing. We then present two cases of myelomeningocele wound repair facilitated successfully by dHACM. Overall, dHACM proves to successfully expedite wound repair in pediatric patients with chronic or complicated wounds such as those from myelomeningocele repair. It is important for surgeons to consider wound duration, size, and patient age to better predict graft success in enhancing wound repair.","Chen, Jonlin; Lopez, Christopher D; Girard, Alisa O; Abousy, Mya; Redett, Richard J; Groves, Mari; Yang, Robin",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00381-021-05352-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34609611/,82

SARS-CoV and MERS induce weak IFN responses; hence, the clinical trials which included recombinant IFN accompanied with other antiviral drugs exhibited improved results in terms of shortening the duration of illness. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the type I IFN response in COVID-19 patients to determine whether it is sufficient to eliminate or reduce the severity of the infection, and whether it can be recommended as a potential therapy. Total RNA samples were converted to cDNA and used as templates to evaluate the gene expression levels of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)3 and IFN-β in COVID-19 patients or control. The results showed that IRF3 gene expression was upregulated ~250-fold compared with the negative samples. In contrast, IFN-β expression increased slightly in COVID-19 patients. Consistent with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS, COVID-19 infection does not induce an efficient IFN response to reduce the severity of the virus. This may be attributed to an incomplete response of IRF3 in activating the IFN-β promoter in the infected patients. The results suggest IFN-β or α may be used as potential treatments.","Salman, Ahmed Abdulwahid; Waheed, Mohammed Hussein; Ali-Abdulsahib, Akeel Abd; Atwan, Zeenah Weheed",Biomedical reports,https://doi.org/10.3892/br.2021.1419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786172/,82

Using a large series of experimental aneurysms treated with the WEB, we had the following objectives: 1) to compare angiographic outcomes as measured by the WEB Occlusion Scale with histologic results, and 2) to assess interobserver and intraobserver agreement of the WEB Occlusion Scale. MATERIALS AND METHODS Intracranial aneurysms were created in 80 rabbits and treated with WEB devices. Animals were sacrificed at last follow-up for histologic evaluation. DSA was performed just after the deployment of the device and at follow-up. Four investigators independently and retrospectively graded the DSA twice according to the WEB Occlusion Scale. One histopathologist blinded to the angiographic results graded the occlusion according to a 4-point scale patterned on the WEB Occlusion Scale. Intra- and interobserver agreement were evaluated for DSA. Follow-up angiographic grading and histologic reference were compared to determine the WEB Occlusion Scale accuracy for complete (with or without recess filling) versus incomplete occlusion and adequate (complete occlusion or neck remnant) versus inadequate occlusion. RESULTS Inter- and intraobserver weighted κ for the angiographic WEB Occlusion Scale were, respectively, 0.76 and 0.76, indicating substantial agreement. The sensitivity and specificity of the WEB Occlusion Scale for complete occlusion at follow-up compared with the histologic reference standard were, respectively, 75% and 83.3%, with an overall accuracy of 80%. Similarly, for adequate occlusion at follow-up, sensitivity was 97.7%, specificity was 64.9%, and overall accuracy was 82.5%. CONCLUSIONS The WEB Occlusion Scale appears to be consistent, reliable, and accurate compared with a histologic reference standard.","Rouchaud, A; Brinjikji, W; Ding, Y-H; Dai, D; Zhu, Y Q; Cloft, H J; Kallmes, D F; Kadirvel, R",AJNR.

88430,Left ventricular systolic dysfunction identification using artificial intelligence-augmented electrocardiogram in cardiac intensive care unit patients.,2020-11-02,"CD4+ T-cell depletion is the hallmark of AIDS pathogenesis. Multiple mechanisms may contribute to the death of productively infected CD4+ T cells and innocent-bystander cells. In this study, we characterize a novel mechanism in which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection preferentially depletes peripheral memory CD4+ T cells before the completion of reverse transcription. Using a recombinant HIV-1 carrying the green fluorescent protein reporter gene, we demonstrate that memory CD4+ T cells were susceptible to infection-induced cell death at a low multiplicity of infection. Infected memory CD4+ T cells underwent rapid necrotic cell death. Killing of host cells was dependent on X4 envelope-mediated viral fusion, but not on virion-associated Vpr or Nef. In contrast to peripheral resting CD4+ T cells, CD4+ T cells stimulated by mitogen or certain cytokines were resistant to HIV-1-induced early cell death. These results demonstrate that early steps in HIV-1 infection have a detrimental effect on certain subsets of CD4+ T cells. The early cell death may serve as a selective disadvantage for X4-tropic HIV-1 in acute infection but may play a role in accelerated disease progression, which is associated with the emergence of X4-tropic HIV-1 in the late stage of AIDS.","Zhou, Yan; Shen, Lin; Yang, Hung-Chih; Siliciano, Robert F",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00773-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18596085/,82

OBJECTIVE The study was aimed at providing the statistical and machine learning-based analysis to investigate the influence of climatic factors on frequency of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Iran. METHOD The data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and some climatic factors related to 31 provinces of Iran between 04/03/2020 and 05/05/2020 was gathered from official resources. In order to investigate the important climatic factors on the frequency of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in all studied cities, a model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed. RESULTS The proposed ANN model showed accuracy rates of 87.25%and 86.4%in the training and testing stage, respectively, for classification of COVID-19 confirmed cases. The results showed that in the city of Ahvaz, despite the increase in temperature, the coefficient of determination R2 has been increasing. CONCLUSION This study clearly showed that, with increasing outdoor temperature, the use of air conditioning systems to set a comfort zone temperature is unavoidable. Thus, the number of positive cases of COVID-19 increases. Also, this study shows the role of closed-air cycle condition in the indoor environment of tropical cities.","Jamshidnezhad, Amir; Hosseini, Seyed Ahmad; Ghavamabadi, Leila Ibrahimi; Marashi, Seyed Mahdi Hossaeini; Mousavi, Hediye; Zilae, Marzieh; Dehaghi, Behzad Fouladi",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-210463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633338/,82
88685,Remote Telesimulation: Standardizing Clinical Research Staff Training From a Distance.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND With the development of high-resolution cross-sectional imaging, anatomic identification of most areas of infection has become routine. Imaging a site of infection allows for diagnosis and treatment. In the past, molecular imaging for infection involved mainly the use of radiolabeled leukocytes for functional targeting at infection sites. With the recent development of functional nuclear imaging, bacterial and viral metabolism can also be imaged directly for potential identification of early infection. METHODS Review of pertinent English-language literature. RESULTS Cross-sectional imaging is used routinely to identify and treat sources of infection in patients with fever, leukocytosis, or unexplained hemodynamic instability. Although ultrasound is preferred for the identification of biliary or hepatic sepsis, computed tomography (CT) has proved to be accurate for the identification and treatment of intra-abdominal fluid collections and abscesses. Biologic imaging is a non-invasive technique that identifies sites of infection in cases in which no definite abnormality is identified via cross-sectional imaging. This is made possible by imaging the accumulation of radioisotopes that have been attached to white blood cells or glucose. Biologic imaging is useful for the identification of anatomic sites where there is inflammation or high metabolic demand. However, a drawback of biologic imaging is that it is not specific for infection. Techniques that image microbes directly increase the specificity of imaging results significantly and can be used to quantify and track infectious processes. For example, radiolabeling of antimicrobial proteins and antibiotics is one technique that has been demonstrated to identify areas of infection accurately in animals but is not currently being used clinically in humans. With the advent of gene therapy, many researchers are inserting the herpes viral thymidine kinase gene into both viruses and bacteria. This allows for tracking of the infectious process by imaging the accumulation of radiolabeled thymidine analogues. CONCLUSION This review summarizes standard imaging for infection as it is currently practiced clinically. We will also explore the promising new methods of microbial imaging that are likely to become standards in clinical care in the near future.","Ady, Justin; Fong, Yuman",Surgical infections,https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2014.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25402672/,82
92553,Anaesthesia for ophthalmic procedures in patients with thyroid eye disease.,2020-11-16,"We previously showed that newly formed vessels in ischemic rat brain have high blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability at 3 weeks after stroke due to a lack of major endothelial tight junction proteins (TJPs), which may exacerbate edema in stroke patients. Atorvastatin was suggested a dose-dependent pro-angiogenic effect and ameliorating BBB permeability beyond its cholesterol-lowering effects. This study examined our hypothesis that, during vascular remodeling after stroke, treatment with atorvastatin could facilitate BBB maturation in remodeling vasculature in ischemic brain. Adult spontaneously hypertensive rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion with reperfusion (MCAO/RP). Atorvastatin, at dose of 3 mg/kg, was delivered daily starting at 14 days after MCAO/RP onset for 7 days. The rats were studied at multiple time points up to 8 weeks with multimodal-MRI, behavior tests, immunohistochemistry, and biochemistry. The delayed treatment of atorvastatin significantly reduced infarct size and BBB permeability, restored cerebral blood flow, and improved the neurological outcome at 8 weeks after MCAO/RP. Postmortem studies showed that atorvastatin promoted angiogenesis and stabilized the newly formed vessels in peri-infarct areas. Importantly, atorvastatin facilitated maturation of BBB properties in the new vessels by promoting endothelial tight junction (TJ) formation. Further in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that proliferating peri-vascular pericytes expressing neural-glial antigen 2 (NG2) mediated the role of atorvastatin on BBB maturation through regulating endothelial TJ strand formations. Our results suggested a therapeutic potential of atorvastatin in facilitating a full BBB integrity and functional stroke recovery, and an essential role for pericyte-mediated endothelial TJ formation in remodeling vasculature.","Yang, Yirong; Yang, Lisa Y; Salayandia, Victor M; Thompson, Jeffrey F; Torbey, Michel; Yang, Yi",Translational stroke research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12975-020-00883-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423214/,82

A total of 33 severe confirmed cases (20 male patients and 13 female patients) were enrolled in the present study between January 31, 2020 and March 10, 2020. Chest imaging findings and clinical data were collected and analyzed. The median age was 65 years (age range, 25‑90 years). As of April 7, 2020, 24 patients were discharged, and 9 patients died. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 28 patients had fever, 17 patients had a cough and 15 patients had shortness of breath. Of these, 29 patients had underlying health conditions. Ground glass opacities, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening were the most common and typical chest computerized tomography (CT) scan abnormalities. A total of 6/33 (18.2%) patients had 1 affected lobe, 6/33 (18.2%) patients had 2 affected lobes, 5/33 (15.2%) patients had 3 affected lobes, 9/33 (27.3%) patients had 4 affected lobes and 7/33 (21.2%) patients had 5 affected lobes in the initial chest CT scan. The mean interval time between two consecutive CT examinations was 4.5 days (range, 3‑9 days). Most severe patients exhibited some degree of aggravation based on the CT findings in the 3 weeks from illness onset. After 3 weeks from illness onset, these severe survivors demonstrated improvements in the chest CT findings, which included complete absorption or only a few remaining fibrous stripes. Chest CT manifestations of patients infected with novel coronavirus pneumonia were diverse and varied. Severe patients had imaging features of rapid progression and slow absorption.

In this study, we survey neurohospitalists to characterize practice changes and the impact of the pandemic on their well-being. Methods A 22-item survey was distributed to neurohospitalists through the Neurohospitalist Society and the American Academy of Neurology Neurohospitalist, Stroke & Vascular Neurology, and Critical Care & Emergency Neurology Sections. Results After 2 weeks of collection, 123 responses were received, with 57% of respondents practicing in academic settings, 23% in private practice, and 7% in community hospitals. A minority of neurohospitalists (8%) were redeployed to care for COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 medicine patients. The most common neurologic diagnoses they reported in COVID-19 patients were delirium (85%), cerebrovascular events (75%), and seizure (35%); however, most neurohospitalists (59%) had evaluated fewer than 10 patients with COVID-19. Respondents observed that fewer patients with unrelated neurological diseases were admitted to the hospital compared to before the pandemic. Neurohospitalists experienced changes in administrative (27%), educational (15%), and research duties (11%), and had overall worse well-being and work-life balance (77%). Conclusions The most common neurologic diagnoses seen in COVID-19 patients by neurohospitalists in this sample are delirium, cerebrovascular disease, and seizure. Though the majority of survey respondents reported not being primary frontline providers, they report key clinical and operational roles during the pandemic, and report worse well-being as compared to before the pandemic.

Only a small proportion are found to have cancer. There is a call for change in the management of these referrals, particularly following coronavirus. Allied health professionals (AHPs) are being encouraged by the NHS to extend their clinical practice to address increased demand. Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs) may offer a solution to some of the 2WW pathway's challenges. RECENT FINDINGS Recent evidence highlights problems with the pathway and reasons for change. Hoarse voice is consistently found to be the most common presenting symptom. Emerging evidence suggests SLTs can extend their scope of practice to manage new hoarse voice referrals. A pilot project is described. Outcomes from this and other ongoing studies explore efficacy and investment required to make this proposal an achievable prospect for the future.

Laparoscopic surgery generates end products that can have potentially harmful effects for the surgical team from short- or long-time exposure. In view of the current SARS-CoV-2 circumstances, controversy has risen concerning the safety of surgical smoke (SS) and aerosols and the perception of an increased risk of exposure during laparoscopic surgery. Methods. The present qualitative systematic review was conducted according to Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies (MOOSE). A literature search was performed from March 2020 up to May 10, 2020, using the PubMed database, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to assess the risk of airborne transmission of viruses and the potential health risk of surgical smoke- and aerosol-generating procedures produced during laparoscopic surgery. The keywords were introduced in combination to obtain better search results. Application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria identified 44 relevant articles. Results. Genetic material from certain viruses, or the virus itself, has been detected in SS and aerosols. However, in the current SARS-CoV-2, as in other coronavirus situations, studies analyzing the presence of airborne transmission of viruses in surgical smoke are lacking. Conclusion. Despite the lack of clear evidence regarding the risk of diseases as the result of smoke- and aerosol-generating procedures during laparoscopic surgery, further investigation is needed. Meanwhile, all available precautions must be taken.","Pasquier, Jorge; Villalta, Oscar; Sarria Lamorú, Sunaymy; Balagué, Carmen; Vilallonga, Ramon; Targarona, Eduardo M",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350621992309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33573518/,82
112027,Recruitment manoeuvres for adults with acute lung injury receiving mechanical ventilation.,2009,"KEY POINTS One in two female athletes chronically take a combined, monophasic oral contraceptive pill (OCP). Previous thermoregulatory investigations proposed that an endogenous rhythm of the menstrual cycle still occurs with OCP usage. Forthcoming large international sporting events will expose female athletes to hot environments differing in their thermal profile, yet few data exist on how trained women will respond from both a thermoregulatory and performance stand-point. In the present study, we have demonstrated that a small endogenous rhythm of the menstrual cycle still affects Tcore and also that chronic OCP use attenuates the sweating response, whereas behavioural thermoregulation is maintained. Furthermore, humid heat affects both performance and thermoregulatory responses to a greater extent than OCP usage and the menstrual cycle does. ABSTRACT We studied thermoregulatory responses of ten well-trained ( V ̇ O 2 max , 57 ± 7 mL min-1 kg-1 ) women taking a combined, monophasic oral contraceptive pill (OCP) (≥12 months) during exercise in dry and humid heat, across their active OCP cycle. They completed four trials, each of resting and cycling at fixed intensities (125 and 150 W), aiming to assess autonomic regulation, and then a self-paced intensity (30-min work trial) to assess behavioural regulation. Trials were conducted in quasi-follicular (qF) and quasi-luteal (qL) phases in dry (DRY) and humid (HUM) heat matched for wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) (27°C). During rest and exercise at 125 W, rectal temperature was 0.15°C higher in qL than qF (P = 0.05) independent of environment (P = 0.17). The onset threshold and thermosensitivity of local sweat rate and forearm blood flow relative to mean body temperature was unaffected by the OCP cycle (both P > 0.30). Exercise performance did not differ between quasi-phases (qF: 268 ± 31 kJ, qL: 263 ± 26 kJ, P = 0.31) but was 5 ± 7% higher during DRY than during HUM (273 ± 29 kJ, 258 ± 28 kJ; P = 0.03). Compared to matched eumenorrhoeic athletes, chronic OCP use impaired the sweating onset threshold and thermosensitivity (both P < 0.01). In well-trained, OCP-using women exercising in the heat: (i) a performance-thermoregulatory trade-off occurred that required behavioural adjustment; (ii) humidity impaired performance as a result of reduced evaporative power despite matched WBGT; and (iii) the sudomotor but not behavioural thermoregulatory responses were impaired compared to matched eumenorrhoeic athletes.","Lei, Tze-Huan; Cotter, James D; Schlader, Zachary J; Stannard, Stephen R; Perry, Blake G; Barnes, Matthew J; Mündel, Toby",The Journal of physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp276233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320879/,82
112177,Multimodality Monitoring in the Neurocritical Care Unit.,2018,"To greatly expand the druggable genome, fast and accurate predictions of cryptic sites for small molecules binding in target proteins are in high demand. In this study, we have developed a fast and simple conformational sampling scheme guided by normal modes solved from the coarse-grained elastic models followed by atomistic backbone refinement and sidechain repacking. Despite the observations of complex and diverse conformational changes associated with ligand binding, we found that simply sampling along each of the lowest 30 modes is near optimal for adequately restructuring cryptic sites so they can be detected by existing pocket finding programs like fpocket and concavity. We further trained machine-learning protocols to optimize the combination of the sampling-enhanced pocket scores with other dynamic and conservation scores, which only slightly improved the performance. As assessed based on a training set of 84 known cryptic sites and a test set of 14 proteins, our method achieved high accuracy of prediction (with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve > 0.8) comparable to the CryptoSite server. Compared with CryptoSite and other methods based on extensive molecular dynamics simulation, our method is much faster (1-2 hours for an average-size protein) and simpler (using only pocket scores), so it is suitable for high-throughput processing of large datasets of protein structures at the genome scale.

BACKGROUND Both ANL and healthy work environment (HWE) contribute to staff and patient outcomes. Our 1st study of these 2 variables revealed a positive relationship. Will this be upheld in a pandemic year? METHODS More than 5000 nurses from a national sample participated in a cross-sectional, correlational, descriptive study using the Authentic Nurse Leadership Questionnaire, the Critical Elements of a Healthy Work Environment Scale, and a pandemic impact on practice question. RESULTS Overall, nurses perceived ANL and HWE were present despite a high level of pandemic impact; however, when clinical nurses were separated from managers/directors, HWE was not present for frontline nurses. The moderate correlation of ANL and HWE was replicated in this larger study. CONCLUSIONS This is the 2nd study of the positive relationship between ANL and HWE using these models, supporting ANL as an essential standard of a HWE. ANL was present for clinical nurses in a pandemic year signaling that nurse leaders rose to meet frontline leadership needs. HWE was present overall, but not for clinical nurses. Leadership is essential to work environments and outcomes especially in times of crisis and significant change.","Raso, Rosanne; Fitzpatrick, Joyce J; Masick, Kevin; Giordano-Mulligan, Marie; Sweeney, Cynthia D",The Journal of nursing administration,https://doi.org/10.1097/nna.0000000000001010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882553/,82

122903,Digital scrapbooking as a standard of care in neonatal intensive care units: initial experience.,2012,"BACKGROUND The digestibility of starch is important for the nutritive value of staple food. Although several genes are responsible for resistant starch (RS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS), gaps persist concerning the molecular basis of RS and SDS formation due to the complex genetic mechanisms of starch digestibility. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to identify new genes for starch digestibility in rice and interprete the genetic mechanisms of RS and SDS by GWAS. METHODS Genome-wide association studies were conducted by associating the RS and SDS phenotypes of 104 re-sequenced rice lines to an SNP dataset of 2,288,867 sites using a compressed mixed linear model. Candidate genes were identified according to the position of the SNPs based on data from the MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project. RESULTS Seven quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected to be associated with the RS content, among which the SNP 6 m1765761 was located on Waxy. Starch branching enzymes IIa (BEIIa) close to QTL qRS-I4 was detected and further identified as a specific candidate gene for RS in INDICA. Two QTLs were associated with SDS, and the LOC_Os09g09360 encoding lipase was identified as a causal gene for SDS. CONCLUSIONS GWAS is a valid strategy to genetically dissect the formation of starch digestion properties in rice. RS formation in grains is dependent on the rice type; lipid might also contribute to starch digestibility and should be an alternative factor to improve rice starch digestibility.","Zhang, Ning; Wang, Maike; Fu, Ji; Shen, Yi; Ding, Yi; Wu, Dianxing; Shu, Xiaoli; Song, Wenjian",Genes & genomics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13258-020-00981-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901332/,82
123102,Intensive care management of life-threatening avian influenza A (H5N1).,2008,"OBJECTIVE To determine the rate of influenza vaccination and the factors associated with the vaccination's acceptance among nurses in Hong Kong. DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS Nurses practicing between 2003 and 2007. METHODS A questionnaire was sent to all nurses registered with any of the 3 nursing associations that participated in this study. RESULTS A total of 941 completed questionnaires were available for analysis, though not all nurses responded to every question (response rate, 33.5%-36.3%). Vaccination rates in 2006 and 2007 were 57.2% and 46.2%, respectively. Nurses who were vaccinated in 2006 were more likely to get vaccinated in 2007 (P<.01); 56% of the nurses perceived influenza vaccine as being effective against influenza. The perceived effectiveness of influenza vaccine was a consistent predictor of rates of vaccination in 2006 (odds ratio [OR], 8.47 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 6.13-11.70]; P<.01) and 2007 (OR, 6.05 [95% CI, 3.79-9.67]; P<.01). Concern about contracting avian influenza was a predictor of the vaccination rate in 2006 but not in 2007 (OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.03-2.09]; P<.05), as was the perceived lack of control over avian influenza infection (OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.06-2.18]; P<.05). CONCLUSIONS The overall influenza vaccination rate for nurses in Hong Kong was about 50%. It was affected by the perceived threat of an impending outbreak. The attitudes of nurses toward the effectiveness of and rationale for vaccination were a major barrier to increasing the rate of vaccination.","Tam, Dennise K P; Lee, Shui-Shan; Lee, Sing",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1086/527507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18205529/,82
123506,Evaluation of the effectiveness of the Nutritional Risk Screening System 2002 (NRS-2002) in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit.,2021-10-04,"Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus-2) has been spreading rapidly in the sense of a global pandemic. This poses significant challenges for clinicians and hospitals and is placing unprecedented strain on the healthcare systems of many countries. The majority of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) present with only mild symptoms such as cough and fever. However, about 6 % require hospitalization. Early clarification of whether inpatient and, if necessary, intensive care treatment is medically appropriate and desired by the patient is of particular importance in the pandemic. Acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency with dyspnea and high respiratory rate (> 30/min) usually leads to admission to the intensive care unit. Often, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/consolidations or even pulmonary emboli are already found on imaging. As the disease progresses, some of these patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mortality reduction of available drug therapy in severe COVID-19 disease has only been demonstrated for dexamethasone in randomized controlled trials. The main goal of supportive therapy is to ensure adequate oxygenation. In this regard, invasive ventilation and repeated prone positioning are important elements in the treatment of severely hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Strict adherence to basic hygiene, including hand hygiene, and the correct wearing of adequate personal protective equipment are essential when handling patients. Medically necessary actions on patients that could result in aerosol formation should be performed with extreme care and preparation.","Kluge, S; Janssens, U; Welte, T; Weber-Carstens, S; Schälte, G; Spinner, C D; Malin, J J; Gastmeier, P; Langer, F; Wepler, M; Westhoff, M; Pfeifer, M; Rabe, K F; Hoffmann, F; Böttiger, B W; Weinmann-Menke, J; Kersten, A; Berlit, P; Haase, R; Marx, G; Karagiannidis, C",Pneumologie,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1334-1925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450783/,82
124855,A comparison of gradual sedation levels using the Comfort-B scale and bispectral index in children on mechanical ventilation in the pediatric intensive care unit.,2013,"PURPOSE Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) can occur after elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. Effective treatment approaches to prevent the development of CPSP in this population have not been extensively investigated. The impact of multimodal strategies to prevent CPSP following elective mid/hindfoot surgery is unknown because of both the heterogeneity of acute pain management and the lack of a recognized definition particular to this surgery. This review aimed to identify and evaluate current pain management strategies after elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. SOURCES Manual and electronic searches (MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were conducted of literature published between 1990 and July 2017. Comparative studies of adults undergoing elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed studies and assessed their methodological quality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We found seven randomized-controlled trials meeting our inclusion criteria. Interventions focused on regional anesthesia techniques such as continuous popliteal sciatic and femoral nerve blockade. Participants were typically followed up to 48 hr postoperatively. Only one study assessed pain six months following elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. CONCLUSION There is an overwhelming lack of evidence regarding CPSP and its management for patients undergoing elective mid/hindfoot and ankle surgery. The lack of a recognized and standard definition of CPSP after this group of surgeries precludes accurate and consistent evaluation.","Stiegelmar, Cierra; Li, Yibo; Beaupre, Lauren A; Pedersen, M Elizabeth; Dillane, Derek; Funabashi, Martha",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-019-01370-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31020631/,82

The new developed method allows for the quantitation of anthraquinone at 5 μg kg-1 concentration levels, four times lower than the current maximum residue limit for coffee and tea in the European Union (20 μg kg-1). Alongside, a new automated extraction method has also been developed. Finally, a pilot monitoring programme of 90 coffee and tea samples from several countries within the European Union has been performed, in which anthraquinone has been detected in a concentration range of 5.1-18.8 μg kg-1 in 32% of the monitored samples, below the current 20 μg kg-1 maximum residue limit, and in 48% of the monitored tea samples, revealing the need for including anthraquinone in a more extensive monitoring programme of tea.","Díaz-Galiano, Francisco José; Murcia-Morales, Maria; Gómez-Ramos, María Del Mar; Ferrer, Carmen; Fernández-Alba, Amadeo R",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0ay01962c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305763/,82

Methods: 29 patients with 2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in January 2020 were selected as the study subjects. Clinical data were collected and the general information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin. In most patients, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased (15/29). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil), serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT findings of typical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow coexists with the solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the three groups (P<0.05), among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mild group. However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count and LDH among the three groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral pneumonia. High resolution CT is of great value in the differential diagnosis of this disease. The increased expression of IL-2R and IL-6 in serum is expected to predict the severity of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia and the prognosis of patients.","Chen, L; Liu, H G; Liu, W; Liu, J; Liu, K; Shang, J; Deng, Y; Wei, S",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.03.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164089/,82

151835,Recommendations From the Professional Advisory Committee on Nursing Practice in the Care of ECMO-Supported Patients.,2021-02-16,"In late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, which is responsible for a new human disease called COVID-19. Among all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, 14% were hospitalized, with 2% admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly across the world, with more than one hundred million confirmed cases and more than 2,500,000 dead. In March 2020, the Hospital of Valenciennes had to admit hundreds of COVID-19 patients, and its capacity was almost exceeded [2]. More recently, in France, thousands of critically ill patients had to be admitted to ICUs. In Europe, the next wave of COVID-19 pandemic could be more severe than the first one, and we already know that, in the case of increasing numbers of critically ill, some of them will die as a result of the unavailability of mechanical ventilators [3]. This shortage may be lessened if one ventilator could service more than one patient. The main worry is that this concept could be not useful and systematically deleterious for the patient. Some concepts have already been proposed to ventilate differently two circuits with a single ventilator, with several limitations like the lack of individualization of ventilation of each circuit [4-6]. More recently, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Clarke et al. [7] described a new concept able to deliver specific ventilation for two different lung tests with a single ventilator. Again, Levin et al. [8] have recently shown that a similar concept of differential ventilation using a single ventilator with flow control valves is feasible in humans.","Hureau, Maxence; Versyck, Maaike; Fontainre, Sylvie; Lambiotte, Fabien; El Beki, Nabil; Saint Leger, Piehr",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,https://doi.org/10.5114/ait.2021.104140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006043/,82

Quality of life might become the most challenging long term complication. The JUBILE study describes the quality of life of people living with type 1 diabetes for more than 40 years. METHODS Patients were recruited from thirty five French regional or university hospitals: patients and physicians completed questionnaires, validated by the Delphi method. From 1200 questionnaires circulated, 808 patients and their physicians returned questionnaires. RESULTS The duration of type 1 diabetes was 49±6 years (mean±SD), age at diagnosis 15±10 years, HbA1c 7.4±0.9 % [58±10 mmol/mol] and 52% were men. Macrovascular disease was present in 32%, 46% had no or only mild non proliferative retinopathy. Insulin pumps were used by 25% and insulin pen/syringe users injected 3.9±2.1 times per day. Blood glucose was self-monitored at least 5 times per day by 67% of patients. Men had 1.8±1.2 children, women 1.4±1.0. More than half (55%) of this population was working, 38% had a university degree. Patients still had a busy life, going out (59%), eating out (82%), playing sports (38%) and travelling (66%).

We conducted a pooled analysis and systematic review to summarise the findings of these articles. Besides, we aimed to determine the predictors of severe COVID-19 infection in SLE by comparing the mild to moderate cases with the severe to critical ones. METHOD All case reports and case series pertaining to COVID-19 in SLE were retrieved from Pubmed, Wiley Online Library, Springer Link, Science Direct and Web of Science databases using 'lupus', 'systemic lupus erythematosus', 'coronavirus', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'SLE' and ""Covid-19"" as keywords. The following data were extracted from the selected articles: country, age of the patient and the characteristics of SLE such as disease duration, organ or system involved, baseline medications and the severity of the COVID-19 infection. Data extracted from the articles were utilised to perform the pooled analysis. RESULTS A total of 24 articles with 48 patients met the eligibility criteria. The median age at diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was 41 years (IQR: 11-66 years). The median SLE disease duration prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 9 years (IQR: 0-30 years). A total of 22 (45.83%) patients had severe to critical COVID-19. This pooled data did not demonstrate any difference in the baseline medications between the 2 groups. Patients with lupus nephritis were significantly more prone to develop severe to critical disease (p = 0 .036) with an odds ratio of 5.40 (95% confidence interval of 1.120-26.045).

158476,Experience in the management of severe COVID-19 patients in an intensive care unit.,2020,"Advances in endovascular therapies during the past decade have broadened the options for treating peripheral vascular disease percutaneously. Endovascular treatment offers a lower risk alternative to open surgery in many patients with multiple comorbidities. Noninvasive physiological tests and arterial imaging precede an endovascular intervention and help localize the disease and plan the procedure. The timing and need for revascularization are broadly related to the 3 main clinical presentations of claudication, critical limb ischemia, and acute limb ischemia. Many patients with claudication can be treated by exercise and medical therapy. Endovascular procedures are considered when these fail to improve quality of life and function. In contrast, critical limb ischemia and acute limb ischemia threaten the limb and require more urgent revascularization. In general, endovascular treatments have greater long-term durability for aortoiliac disease than femoral popliteal disease. Infrapopliteal revascularization is generally reserved for critical and acute limb ischemia. Balloon angioplasty and stenting are the mainstays of endovascular therapy. New well-tested innovations include drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons. Adjunctive devices for crossing chronic total occlusions or debulking plaque with atherectomy are less rigorously studied and have niche roles. Patients receiving endovascular procedures need a structured surveillance plan for follow-up care. This includes intensive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors to prevent myocardial infarction and stroke, which are the main causes of death. Limb surveillance aims to identify restenosis and new disease beyond the intervened segments, both of which may jeopardize patency and lead to recurrent symptoms, functional impairment, or a threatened limb.","Thukkani, Arun K; Kinlay, Scott",Circulation research,https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.116.303503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25908731/,82

Oral anticoagulants represent the standard preventive treatment, but they involve severe drawbacks, including intracerebral bleedings. Since in patients affected by nonvalvular AF, the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) is the primary source of thromboembolism, percutaneous closure of the LAA is a viable option for people unsuitable for long-term anticoagulant therapy. However, the complexities related to the implant procedure, occlusion devices and the anatomical variability hinder the pre-operative planning, resulting in unexpected outcomes. In this context, in-silico models may represent a powerful support tool providing clinicians with more detailed information. Nevertheless, few works focusing on numerical modeling of LAA occlusion devices have been presented so far, and a detailed process to assess the model credibility, verifying that different sources of uncertainty did not affect the prediction, is missing. This work aims to illustrate a process that allows to build and validate the numerical model of a commercial occlusion device starting from only one sample available and without data provided by the manufacturer. To better identify potential uncertainties, the validation followed a step-by-step process that led from individual device behavior assessment to interaction with deformable conduit evaluation.","Zaccaria, Alissa; Danielli, Francesca; Gasparotti, Emanuele; Fanni, Benigno Marco; Celi, Simona; Pennati, Giancarlo; Petrini, Lorenza",Medical engineering & physics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medengphy.2020.05.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709261/,82

We present a base mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India and its neighbor, Pakistan. The base model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is parameterized using cumulative COVID-19 mortality data from each of the two countries. The model was used to assess the population-level impact of the control and mitigation strategies implemented in the two countries (notably community lockdowns, use of face masks, and social-distancing). Numerical simulations of the basic model indicate that, based on the current baseline levels of the control and mitigation strategies implemented, the pandemic trajectory in India is on a downward trend (as characterized by the reproduction number of the disease dynamics in India below, but close to, unity). This downward trend will be reversed, and India will be recording mild outbreaks (i.e., pandemic waves), if the control and mitigation strategies are relaxed from their current levels (e.g., relaxed to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are increased by 20% or 40% from their current baseline values). Our simulations suggest that India could record up to 460,000 cumulative deaths by early September 2021 under the baseline levels of the control strategies implemented (up to 25,000 of the projected deaths could be averted if the control and mitigation measures are strengthened to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are reduced by 20% from their baseline values). Our simulations show that the pandemic in Pakistan is much milder, with an estimated projected cumulative mortality of about 24,000 by early September 2021 under the baseline scenario. The basic model was extended to assess the impact of back-and-forth mobility between the two countries. Simulations of the resulting metapopulation model, which uses a Lagrangian mobility framework (based on residence-time spent in each country), shows that the burden of the pandemic in Pakistan increases with increasing values of the average time residents of India spend in Pakistan. In particular, it is shown that the India-to-Pakistan mobility pattern may trigger a significant fourth wave of the pandemic in Pakistan (under certain mobility scenarios and mitigation levels), with daily mortality peaking in mid-August to mid-September of 2021. It is also shown that extending the current travel restrictions by at least three months would significantly enhance the prospect of eliminating the pandemic in both countries. On the other hand, it is shown that, in addition to causing future multiple waves of the pandemic, easing the current levels of control and mitigation measures in the two countries (including travel restrictions) would result in delaying pandemic elimination in India and Pakistan to November and July 2022, respectively.","Brozak, S.

The aim of our study was to further develop the flow cytometry assay for potential use as a confirmatory test and to standardize its parameters and results for reliable inter-laboratory use. We have optimized the protocol, established the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and tested reproducibility using pre-COVID plasma samples and convalescent, SARS-CoV-2 individual plasma samples. The flow-based assay was simplified and standardized by cultivating the 293T cells in suspension and expressing results in Mean Equivalent Soluble Fluorochrome (MESF) using an internal antibody positive control. The ROC curve was determined with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 and the assay specificity and sensitivity were established at 100% and 97.7% respectively. Reproducibility was good as determined on multiple cytometers, on different days, and with data acquisition as far as 72h post-staining. The optimized and standardized assay could be used as a high throughput confirmation confirmatory assay in flow cytometry laboratories involved in serological testing.","Simard, Carl; Richard, Jonathan; Bazin, Renee; Finzi, Andres; Trepanier, Patrick",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.21250770,82

To study meeting effectiveness and meeting inclusiveness, we first conducted a large-scale email survey (N=4,425; after filtering N=3,290) at a large technology company (pre-COVID-19); using this data we derived a multivariate model of meeting effectiveness and show how it correlates with meeting inclusiveness, participation, and feeling comfortable to contribute. We believe this is the first such model of meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness. The large size of the data provided the opportunity to analyze correlations that are specific to sub-populations such as the impact of video. The model shows the following factors are correlated with inclusiveness, effectiveness, participation, and feeling comfortable to contribute in meetings: sending a pre-meeting communication, sending a post-meeting summary, including a meeting agenda, attendee location, remote-only meeting, audio/video quality and reliability, video usage, and meeting size. The model and survey results give a quantitative understanding of how and where to improve meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness and what the potential returns are. Motivated by the email survey results, we implemented a post-meeting survey into a leading computer-mediated communication (CMC) system to directly measure meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness (during COVID-19). Using initial results based on internal flighting we created a similar model of effectiveness and inclusiveness, with many of the same findings as the email survey. This shows a method of measuring and understanding these metrics which are both practical and useful in a commercial CMC system.","Cutler, Ross; Hosseinkashi, Yasaman; Pool, Jamie; Filipi, Senja; Aichner, Robert; Tu, Yuan; Gehrke, Johannes",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09803v1.pdf,82

Recently, the world faced a serious pandemic, Corona virus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus as a global health emergency. The COVID-19 started in late December of 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Around the world during this time, individuals use social media to share their opinions about the pandemic. Because of the lack of information about the virus, people switched to micro-blogging platforms such as Twitter. In this study, we utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques for opinion mining to extract negative and positive sentiments/tweets on COVID-19. We investigate NLP based sentiment analysis using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with Long-Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs).

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus which possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that encodes various structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins. Due to the zoonotic nature of SARS-CoV-2 and current transmission trend, scientists must identify effective therapeutics against the virus. Ligand-based drug designing is a computational approach based on the principle that similar compounds exhibit similar activities;hence, it is employed to identify, screen, or design drug-like molecules based on the existing drug molecules. The present chapter provides an overview of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, viral drug targets and dives deeply into the computational approach of ligand-based drug designing (LBDD). The chapter aims to provide a detailed methodology of LBDD and the current research endeavors that have utilized the technique to identify, screen, or design potential drug molecules against SARS-CoV-2.","Singh, E.; Khan, R.

Managers are at risk of suffering from mental disorders during the pandemic because they face particular hardship. Objective: We aim to predict mental disorder (anxiety and depression) symptoms of managers across countries using country-level COVID-19 statistics. Methods: A two-wave online survey of 406 managers from 26 countries was finished in May and July 2020. We used logistic panel regression models for our main analyses and performed robustness checks using ordinary least squares regressions. In the sample of 406 managers from 26 countries, 26.5% of managers reached the cut-off levels for anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7) and 43.5% did so for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ- 9) symptoms. Findings: We found that cumulative COVID-19 statistics (e.g., cumulative cases, cumulative cases per million, cumulative deaths, and cumulative deaths per million) predicted managers' anxiety and depression symptoms positively, whereas daily COVID-19 statistics (daily new cases, smoothed daily new cases, daily new deaths, smoothed daily new deaths, daily new cases per million, and smoothed daily new cases per million) predicted anxiety and depression symptoms negatively. In addition, the reproduction rate was a positive predictor, while stringency of governmental lockdown measures was a negative predictor. Individually, we found that the cumulative count of deaths is the best single predictor of both anxiety and depression symptoms. Conclusions: Cumulative COVID-19 statistics predicted managers' anxiety and depression symptoms positively, while non-cumulative daily COVID-19 statistics predicted anxiety and depression symptoms negatively. Cumulative count of deaths is the best single predictor of both anxiety and depression symptoms. Reproduction rate was a positive predictor, while stringency of governmental lockdown measures was a negative predictor.","Li, L.; Zhang, S.

181595,Rehabilitation of intubated COVID-19 patients in a Singapore regional hospital with early intensive care unit and sustained post-intensive care unit rehabilitation,2021,"To help contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and to protect front-line workers, new antiviral measures are required. Antiviral nanoparticles are one such possible measure. Metal nanoparticles made from a variety of metals including gold, silver, and copper can kill or disable viruses that cause significant health problems in humans (such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV, or influenza). To promote interaction between nanoparticles and viruses the stabilizing ligands on the nanoparticle surface should be optimized for docking with proteins. The enormous chemical space of possible nanoparticle ligands makes this optimization experimentally and computationally intractable. Here we present a datamining-based study that searched for nanoparticle ligands that have previously been used, and computationally tested these for their ability to dock with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. These ligands will coat future antiviral nanoparticles to be used outside of the body, not as drugs. The best of these ligands identified were: nitric acid (score: 0.95), phosphoroselenoic acid (score: 0.88), hydroxyammonium (score: 0.83), pyrophosphoric acid (score: 0.81). Inspection of the best of these ligands has suggested design principles for future antiviral nanoparticle ligands, and we suggest further ligands based on these principles. These results will be used to inspire further in vitro and in silico experimentation to accelerate the development of antiviral nanoparticles.

In vitro translation of synthetic transcripts generated from this plasmid was not accompanied by detectable processing activity of the nascent polypeptide unless the translation was carried out in the presence of microsomal membrane preparations. The processed products so obtained closely resembled in size those expected from cleavage at predicted glutamine-serine (Q/S) dipeptides and included a protein with a size of 35 kDa (p35) that corresponds to the predicted size of 3CLP. Efficient processing was dependent on the presence of membranes during translation; processing was found to occur when microsomes were added posttranslationally, but only after extended periods of incubation. C-terminal deletion analysis of the encoded polyprotein fragment revealed that cleavage activity was dependent on the presence of most but not all of the downstream and adjacent hydrophobic region MP2. Dysfunctional mutagenesis of the putative active-site cysteine residue of 3CLP to either serine or alanine resulted in polypeptides that were impaired for processing, while mutagenesis at the predicted Q/S release sites implicated them in the release of the p35 protein. Processed products of the wild-type protein were active in trans cleavage assays, which were used to demonstrate that the IBV 3CLP is sensitive to inhibition by both serine and cysteine protease class-specific inhibitors. These data reveal the identity of the IBV 3C-like proteinase, which exhibits characteristics in common with the 3C proteinases of picornaviruses.","Tibbles, K W; Brierley, I; Cavanagh, D; Brown, T D",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8627718/,82

The aim of this study was to evaluate resident performance and outcomes in patients undergoing SLC performed by residents vs. staff colorectal surgeons. A retrospective case-control study was conducted, including 220 patients who underwent elective surgical intervention with multiport laparoscopic colectomy (MLC, n=141) or SLC (n=79) for colon cancer over a 24-month period at Yao Municipal Hospital (Yao, Japan). Data on patient demographics, operative data, oncological outcomes and short-term outcomes were evaluated for statistical significance. To investigate issues regarding the surgical procedures, the entire operation was recorded on video for all patients and was divided into 6 procedures, with each procedure measured in seconds. Senior-level residents were able to safely perform MLC under appropriate experienced supervision. For SLC, 1 case required conversion to an open procedure. No case required additional trocar placement. The mean operative times were similar for the staff and resident groups for total colon cancer (192.5 and 217.5 min, respectively; P=0.88), whereas the operative times of the staff group for right-sided colon cancer were significantly longer, and the operative times of the resident group for left-sided colon cancer were significantly longer. In addition, the overall perioperative outcomes, including blood loss, number of harvested lymph nodes, length of the surgical margin and complications, were similar between the two groups. When video recordings were evaluated by dividing the surgical process for the right colon into 4 procedures and that for the left colon into 6 procedures, the results demonstrated that the residents required more time to close the mesenteric margin for the left colon compared with the staff performing the same procedure (3,470.1±1,258.5 vs. 5,218.6±2,341.2 sec; P=0.01). Therefore, senior-level residents were able to safely perform SLC under appropriate experienced supervision. For the left colon, the main challenge for the residents appeared to be the closure of the mesenteric margin. Our data support that it is possible to train senior residents to complete a SLC safely and with the same efficacy as staff surgeons.","Tokuoka, Masayoshi; Ide, Yoshihito; Hirose, Hajime; Takeda, Mitsunobu; Hashimoto, Yasuji; Matsuyama, Jin; Yokoyama, Shigekazu; Fukushima, Yukio; Sasaki, Y O",Molecular and clinical oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26807224/,82

METHODS Two metal catalysts Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 were pressed into wafers. One hundred microL 10(6) TCID50/mL SARS-CoV, 100 microL 10(6) PFU/mL recombinant baculovirus expressing hamster's prion protein (haPrP) protein and roughly 10(6) E. coli were slowly dropped onto the surfaces of the catalyst wafers and exposed for 5 and 20 min, respectively. After eluted from the surfaces of wafers, the infectivity of viruses and propagation of bacteria were measured. The expression of PrP protein was determined by Western blot. The morphological changes of bacteria were observed by electronic microscopy. RESULTS After exposure to the catalysts surfaces for 5 and 20 min, the infectivity of SARS-CoV in Vero cells and baculovirus in Sf9 cells dropped down to a very low and undetectable level, and no colony was detected using bacteria culture method. The expression of haPrP protein reduced to 21.8% in the preparation of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus exposed for 5 min and was undetectable exposed for 20 min. Bacterial membranes seemed to be cracked and the cytoplasm seemed to be effluent from cell bodies. CONCLUSION Exposures to the surfaces of Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 destroy the replication and propagation abilities of SARS-CoV, baculovirus and E. coli. Inactivation ability of metal catalysts needs to interact with air, utilizing oxygen molecules in air. Efficiently killing viruses and bacteria on the surfaces of the two metal catalysts has a promising potential for air-disinfection in hospitals, communities, and households.","Han, Jun; Chen, Lan; Duan, Shu-Min; Yang, Qing-Xiang; Yang, Min; Gao, Chen; Zhang, Bao-Yun; He, Hong; Dong, Xiao-Ping",Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16131020/,82

In the present study, expression of recombinant human FV (HFV) glycoprotein and analyses of oligosaccharide modifications and precursor cleavage indicated that the protein was localized to the ER. HFV glycoproteins encoding seven different dilysine motif mutations were then expressed. The results indicated that disruptions of the dilysine motif resulted in higher levels of forward transport of the HFV glycoprotein from the ER through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. We conclude that the dilysine motif is responsible for ER sorting of the FV glycoprotein.

Method This retrospective study included all laparoscopic cholecystectomy cases attempted in Dhulikhel hospital during the year 2015 and 2016. Records of all patients were reviewed to find out demography of the patients, indications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, rate of conversion to open, underlying reasons for conversion and postoperative complications. Result Out of 644 cases of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 452 (70.18%) were female and 192 (29.81%) were male with the mean age of 39 years. Over all conversion rate to open cholecystectomy was 1.86% with the frozen calot's triangle as the most common reason for conversion. The overall postoperative complication was found to be 1.24% with no major bile duct injury. Acute cholecystitis is a significant preoperative predictor for the conversion into open cholecystectomy. Conclusion Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can safely be done with low conversion rate and complication.

Objective: To rapidly review literature and society guidelines and create expert consensus to provide guidance regarding management of outpatient gynecology scenarios via telemedicine. Search strategy: Searches were conducted in Medline and Cochrane databases from inception through April 15, 2020. Selection criteria: Literature searches were conducted for articles on telemedicine and abnormal uterine bleeding, chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis, vaginitis, and postoperative care. Searches were restricted to available English language publications. Data collection and analysis: Expedited literature review methodology was followed and 10 943 citations were single-screened. Full-text articles and relevant guidelines were reviewed and narrative summaries developed. Main results: Fifty-one studies on the use of telemedicine in gynecology were found. Findings were reported for these studies and combined with society guidelines and expert consensus on four topics (abnormal uterine bleeding, chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis, vaginal discharge, and postoperative care). Conclusions: Guidance for treating gynecological conditions via telemedicine based on expedited literature review, review of society recommendations, and expert consensus is presented. Due to minimal evidence surrounding telemedicine and gynecology, a final consensus document is presented here that can be efficiently used in a clinical setting.","Grimes, Cara L.; Balk, Ethan M.; Dieter, Alexis A.; Singh, Ruchira; Wieslander, Cecilia K.; Jeppson, Peter C.; Aschkenazi, Sarit O.; Kim, Jin Hee; Truong, Mireille D.; Gupta, Ankita S.; Keltz, Julia G.; Hobson, Deslyn T.G.; Sheyn, David; Petruska, Sara E.; Adam, Gaelen; Meriwether, Kate V.",Int.

215971,Ultrasound applications to support nursing care in critically ill COVID-19 patients,2020,"Ultrasound imaging of the lung and associated tissues may play an important role in the management of patients with COVID-19-associated lung injury. Compared with other monitoring modalities, such as auscultation or radiographic imaging, we argue lung ultrasound has high diagnostic accuracy, is ergonomically favourable and has fewer infection control implications. By informing the initiation, escalation, titration and weaning of respiratory support, lung ultrasound can be integrated into COVID-19 care pathways for patients with respiratory failure. Given the unprecedented pressure on healthcare services currently, supporting and educating clinicians is a key enabler of the wider implementation of lung ultrasound. This narrative review provides a summary of evidence and clinical guidance for the use and interpretation of lung ultrasound for patients with moderate, severe and critical COVID-19-associated lung injury. Mechanisms by which the potential lung ultrasound workforce can be deployed are explored, including a pragmatic approach to training, governance, imaging, interpretation of images and implementation of lung ultrasound into routine clinical practice.","Smith, M J; Hayward, S A; Innes, S M; Miller, A S C",Anaesthesia,,82

In particular, this paper looks at the deep convolutional neural networks VGG16 and VGG19, InceptionResNetV2 and InceptionV3, as well as Xception, all followed by a flat multi-layer perceptron and a final 30% drop-out. The paper has found that the best performing network is VGG16 with a final $30$% drop-out trained over 3 classes (COVID-19, No Finding, Other Pneumonia). It has an internal cross-validated accuracy of $93.9(\pm3.4)$%, a COVID-19 sensitivity of $87.7(-1.9,+2)$%, and a No Finding sensitivity of $96.8(\pm0.8)$%. The respective external cross-validated values are $84.1(\pm13.5)$%, $87.7(-1.9,2)$%, and $96.8(\pm0.8)$%. The model optimizer was Adam with a 1e-4 learning rate, and categorical cross-entropy loss. It is hoped that, once this research will be put to practice in hospitals, healthcare professionals will be able in the medium to long-term to diagnosing through machine learning tools possible pneumonia, and if detected, whether it is linked to a COVID-19 infection, allowing the detection of new possible COVID-19 foyers after the end of possible""stop-and-go""lockdowns as expected by until a vaccine is found and widespread. Furthermore, in the short-term, it is hoped practitioners can compare the diagnosis from the deep convolutional neural networks with possible RT-PCR testing results, and if clashing, a Computed Tomography could be performed as they are more accurate in showing COVID-19 pneumonia.","Moutounet-Cartan, Pierre G.

222641,Long-term mortality of elderly patients after intensive care unit admission for COVID-19,2021,"Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Ag) that can be performed at point of care (POC) can supplement molecular testing and help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Deployment of an Ag RDT requires an understanding of its operational and performance characteristics under real-world conditions and in relevant subpopulations. We evaluated the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card in a high-throughput, drive-through, free community testing site in Massachusetts using anterior nasal (AN) swab reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for clinical testing. Individuals presenting for molecular testing in two of seven lanes were offered the opportunity to also receive BinaxNOW testing. Dual AN swabs were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic children (&#8804;18 years of age) and adults. BinaxNOW testing was performed in a testing pod with temperature/humidity monitoring. One individual performed testing and official result reporting for each test, but most tests had a second independent reading to assess interoperator agreement. Positive BinaxNOW results were scored as faint, medium, or strong. Positive BinaxNOW results were reported to patients by phone, and they were instructed to isolate pending RT-PCR results. The paired RT-PCR result was the reference for sensitivity and specificity calculations. Of 2,482 participants, 1,380 adults and 928 children had paired RT-PCR/BinaxNOW results and complete symptom data. In this study, 974/1,380 (71%) adults and 829/928 (89%) children were asymptomatic. BinaxNOW had 96.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.0 to 99.3) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI, 98.6 to 100.0) specificity in adults within 7 days of symptoms and 84.6% (95% CI, 65.1 to 95.6) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI, 94.5 to 100.0) specificity in children within 7 days of symptoms. Sensitivity and specificity in asymptomatic adults were 70.2% (95% CI, 56.6 to 81.6) and 99.6% (95% CI, 98.9 to 99.9), respectively, and in asymptomatic children, they were 65.4% (95% CI, 55.6 to 74.4) and 99.0% (95% CI, 98.0 to 99.6), respectively. By cycle threshold (CT ) value cutoff, sensitivity in all subgroups combined (n = 292 RT-PCR-positive individuals) was 99.3% with CT values of &#8804;25, 95.8% with CT values of &#8804;30, and 81.2% with CT values of &#8804;35. Twelve false-positive BinaxNOW results (out of 2,308 tests) were observed; in all 12, the test bands were faint but otherwise normal and were noted by both readers. One invalid BinaxNOW result was identified. Interoperator agreement (positive versus negative BinaxNOW result) was 100% (n = 2,230/2,230 double reads). Each operator was able to process 20 RDTs per hour. In a separate set of 30 specimens (from individuals with symptoms &#8804;7 days) run at temperatures below the manufacturer's recommended range (46 to 58.5°F), sensitivity was 66.7% and specificity 95.2%.

Specifically, we consider a modified susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered (SAIR) epidemic model over multiple zones. Agents choose whether to activate (i.e., interact with others), how many other agents to interact with, and which zone to move to in a time-scale which is comparable with the epidemic evolution. We define and analyze the notion of equilibrium in this game, and investigate the transient behavior of the epidemic spread in a range of numerical case studies, providing insights on the effects of the agents' degree of future awareness, strategic migration decisions, as well as different levels of lockdown and other interventions. One of our key findings is that the strategic behavior of agents plays an important role in the progression of the epidemic and can be exploited in order to design suitable epidemic control measures.","Elokda, Ezzat; Bolognani, Saverio; Hota, Ashish R.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03182v1.pdf,82

Based on its genetic proximity, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to have originated from bat-derived CoV and transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediate mammalian host, probably Malayan pangolin. Further, spike protein S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 has acquired polybasic furin cleavage site which is absent in bat and pangolin suggesting natural selection either in an animal host before zoonotic transfer or in humans following zoonotic transfer.

241052,Pathophysiological Mechanisms and Neurological Manifestations in COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between the presence of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the risk of subsequent reinfection remains unclear. METHODS: We investigated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in seropositive and seronegative health care workers attending testing of asymptomatic and symptomatic staff at Oxford University Hospitals in the United Kingdom. Baseline antibody status was determined by anti-spike (primary analysis) and anti-nucleocapsid IgG assays, and staff members were followed for up to 31 weeks. We estimated the relative incidence of PCR-positive test results and new symptomatic infection according to antibody status, adjusting for age, participant-reported gender, and changes in incidence over time. RESULTS: A total of 12,541 health care workers participated and had anti-spike IgG measured; 11,364 were followed up after negative antibody results and 1265 after positive results, including 88 in whom seroconversion occurred during follow-up. A total of 223 anti-spike-seronegative health care workers had a positive PCR test (1.09 per 10,000 days at risk), 100 during screening while they were asymptomatic and 123 while symptomatic, whereas 2 anti-spike-seropositive health care workers had a positive PCR test (0.13 per 10,000 days at risk), and both workers were asymptomatic when tested (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.44; P = 0.002). There were no symptomatic infections in workers with anti-spike antibodies. Rate ratios were similar when the anti-nucleocapsid IgG assay was used alone or in combination with the anti-spike IgG assay to determine baseline status. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of anti-spike or anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibodies was associated with a substantially reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the ensuing 6 months.

Observational studies, however, are subject to biases, even when there is no true effect. Cluster randomized trials provide a means to conduct valid hypothesis tests of the effect of interventions on community transmission. While they may only require a short duration, they often require large sample sizes to achieve adequate power. However, the sample sizes required for such tests in an outbreak setting are largely undeveloped and the question of whether these designs are practical remains unanswered. We develop approximate sample size formulae and simulation-based sample size methods for cluster randomized trials in infectious disease outbreaks. We highlight key relationships between characteristics of transmission and the enrolled communities and the required sample sizes, describe settings where cluster randomized trials powered to detect a meaningful true effect size may be feasible, and provide recommendations for investigators in planning such trials. The approximate formulae and simulation banks may be used by investigators to quickly assess the feasibility of a trial, and then more detailed methods may be used to more precisely size the trial. For example, we show that community-scale trials requiring 220 clusters with 100 tested individuals per cluster are powered to identify interventions that reduce transmission by 40% in one generation interval, using parameters identified for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. For more modest treatment effects, or settings with extreme overdispersion of transmission, however, much larger sample sizes are required.","Sheen, Justin K; Haushofer, Johannes; Metcalf, C.

256607,Symptom management and supportive care of serious COVID-19 patients and their families in India,2020,"Strategies adopted globally to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 have primarily involved lockdown measures with substantial economic and social costs with varying degrees of success. Morbidity patterns of COVID-19 variants have a strong association with age, while restrictive lockdown measures have association with negative mental health outcomes in some age groups. Reduced economic prospects may also afflict some age cohorts more than others. Motivated by this, we propose a model to describe COVID-19 community spread incorporating the role of age-specific social interactions. Through a flexible parameterisation of an age-structured deterministic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed (SEIR) model, we provide a means for characterising different forms of lockdown which may impact specific age groups differently. Social interactions are represented through age group to age group contact matrices, which can be trained using available data and are thus locally adapted. This framework is easy to interpret and suitable for describing counterfactual scenarios, which could assist policy makers with regard to minimising morbidity balanced with the costs of prospective suppression strategies. Our work originates from an Irish context and we use disease monitoring data from February 29th 2020 to January 31st 2021 gathered by Irish governmental agencies. We demonstrate how Irish lockdown scenarios can be constructed using the proposed model formulation and show results of retrospective fitting to incidence rates and forward planning with relevant ``what if/instead of'' lockdown counterfactuals with uncertainty quantification. Our formulation is agnostic to a specific locale, in that lockdown strategies in other regions can be straightforwardly encoded using this model. The methods we describe are made publicly available online through an accessible and easy to use web interface.","Jaouimaa, Fatima-Zahra; Dempsey, Daniel; Osch, Suzanne van; Kinsella, Stephen; Burke, Kevin; Wyse, Jason; Sweeney, James",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06377v1.pdf,82

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between January 23rd 2020 and April 6th 2020 at Wuhan JinYinTan Hospital and The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. RESULTS: Among 210 patients, 131 were males (62.4%). The median Age was 64 years (IQR: 56-71). Of 92 (43.8%) patients who developed AKI during hospitalization, 13 (14.1%), 15 (16.3%) and 64 (69.6%) were classified as being at stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 54 patients (58.7%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. Age, sepsis, nephrotoxic drug, invasive mechanical ventilation and elevated baseline serum creatinine levels were associated with the occurrence of AKI. Renal recovery during hospitalization was identified among 16 patients with AKI (17.4%), who had a significantly shorter time from admission to AKI diagnosis, lower incidence of right heart failure and higher ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen. Of 210 patients, 93 deceased within 28 days of ICU admission. AKI stage 3, critical disease, greater Age and the lowest ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen being < 150 mmHg were independently associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Covid-19, the incidence of AKI was high. Our findings of the risk factors of the development of AKI and factors associated with renal function recovery may inform clinical management of patients with critical illness of Covid-19.","Sang, Ling; Chen, Sibei; Zheng, Xia; Guan, Weijie; Zhang, Zhihui; Liang, Wenhua; Zhong, Ming; Jiang, Li; Pan, Chun; Zhang, Wei; Xia, Jiaan; Chen, Nanshan; Wu, Wenjuan; Wu, Hongkai; Xu, Yonghao; Liu, Xuesong; Liu, Xiaoqing; He, Jianxing; Li, Shiyue; Zhang, Dingyu; Zhong, Nanshan; Li, Yimin",BMC Pulm Med,,82

Given that the activities of daily living require a normally functioning cognitive system, the study of cognitive-functional interaction under social isolation is relevant. The object of this work was to obtain information on the cognitive-functional impact of social isolation, analyze the changes induced in daily routines and habits, and assess the cognitive adjustment of the adult population to the isolation requirements. We carried out an online adult population survey, that combined multiple choice or binary questions following a Likert ordinal scale, performing a percentage analysis as well as a principal component analysis of the results. We surveyed 1095 subjects, 68% of which were residents of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA), of an average age of 52.7 ± 12.8 years, and 15.6 ± 2.2 years of education. All age groups reported attention and memory impairment, more significant in lower age groups and women. The principal component analysis showed an associated correlation of the functional challenge brought about by social isolation on the executive system, with the negative impact on cognitive functions such as attention and memory. Social isolation significantly impacted on the attentional, mnesic and executive cognitive systems, ratifying the role of cognitive abilities in the generation of means and strategies to overcome unusual situations, and highlighting the importance of cognitive-functional interaction.","Labos, E.; Zabala, K.; Renato, A.; Trojanowski, S.; Del Rio, M.; Fustinoni, O.; Vázquez, N.",Medicina (B Aires),,82

This paper aims to evaluate lymphocyte subsets in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and as predictive factors for severe disease. PATIENT AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 bilateral pneumonia recruited at hospital admission. Demographics, medical history, and data regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded. Patients systematically underwent complete laboratory tests, including parameters related to COVID-19 as well as lymphocyte subsets study at the time of admission. Severe disease criteria were established at admission, and patients were classified on remote follow-up according to disease evolution. Linear regression models were used to assess associations with disease evolution, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and the corresponding Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used to evaluate predictive values. RESULTS: Patients with critical COVID-19 showed a decrease in CD3+CD4+ T cells count compared to non-critical (278 (485 IQR) vs. 545 (322 IQR)), a decrease in median CD4+/CD8+ ratio (1.7, (1.7 IQR) vs. 3.1 (2.4 IQR)), and a decrease in median CD4+MFI (21,820 (4491 IQR) vs. 26,259 (3256 IQR)), which persisted after adjustment. CD3+CD8+ T cells count had a high correlation with time to hospital discharge (PC = -0.700 (-0.931, -0.066)). ROC curves for predictive value showed lymphocyte subsets achieving the best performances, specifically CD3+CD4+ T cells (AUC = 0.756), CD4+/CD8+ ratio (AUC = 0.767), and CD4+MFI (AUC = 0.848). CONCLUSIONS: A predictive value and treatment considerations for lymphocyte subsets are suggested, especially for CD3CD4+ T cells. Lymphocyte subsets determination at hospital admission is recommended.","Calvet, Joan; Gratacós, Jordi; Amengual, María José; Llop, Maria; Navarro, Marta; Moreno, Amàlia; Berenguer-Llergo, Antoni; Serrano, Alejandra; Orellana, Cristóbal; Cervantes, Manel",Viruses,,82

METHODS: We studied 35 COVID patients at hospital admission testing by cytofluorimetry a large panel of lymphocyte subpopulations and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A and the soluble receptor of IL-17A (IL-17RA). KEY FINDINGS: At hospital admission, total lymphocytes and most T and B subpopulations were reduced in 50-80% of patients, with close relationship to disease severity. While activated T helper 1 (TH1) and TH17 cells resulted normal or higher. Serum IL-6 was increased in all patients, while TNF-&#945; and IL-17A were higher in advanced stages. A patient subset with low severity had very high IL-17RA levels. Tocilizumab treatment caused an increase of IL-17A in 3/6 patients and a reduction in 3 others, while the lymphocyte number increased in 3 patients and did not change in the others. SIGNIFICANCE: Cytofluorimetry revealed a functional exhaustion of most lymphocyte populations in COVID patients not involving activated TH1 and TH17. Consequently, there was a relevant cytokines production that contributes to impair the respiratory inflammation. The increase of TH17 and IL-17 in a subset of cases and the evidence of a significant increase of IL-17RA (that prevents the interaction of IL-17 with the cell receptor) in patients with low severity suggest that some patients could benefit from monoclonal antibodies treatment targeting IL-17 pathway. Immunocytofluorimetric markers may contribute to a personalized therapy in COVID patients.","Cacciapuoti, Sara; De Rosa, Annunziata; Gelzo, Monica; Megna, Matteo; Raia, Maddalena; Pinchera, Biagio; Pontarelli, Agostina; Scotto, Riccardo; Scala, Emanuele; Scarano, Francesco; Scalia, Giulia; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Gentile, Ivan; Parrella, Roberto",Life Sci,,82

275259,Outcomes of intensive care unit patients with COVID-19: a nationwide analysis in Russia,2020,"Introduction: In SARS-CoV2 infection multi-organ involvement of heart, kidney pancreas and liver are reported. Most studies suggest that though mild derangements of liver function may be experienced by most COVID-19 patients but significant liver injury is not common. The aim of this study was to describe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to this level 4 COVID hospital and find out their relation to the liver parameters. Materials and Methods: COVID-19 patients admitted in this level -4 COVID hospital during the study period were classified as mild (Group 1,n=42), moderate (Group 2,n=40) and severe (Group 3,n=35) cases as per national guidelines. Serum samples were analyzed using biochemistry autoanalyzer. Serum levels of total and direct bilirubin, Alanine Transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate Transaminase (AST), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALKP), total protein and albumin were assayed. Results: Patients with higher BMI (Body mass index) had developed greater COVID-19 related complications and hence had to be admitted either in HDU (Group 2) or in ICU (Group 3) set up. Total and direct serum bilirubin levels were normal and almost similar in the various study groups. The primary liver enzymes ALT and AST were raised in the entire study population. However differences between the study groups were statistically insignificant. ALKP was within normal reference range for all the cases. Serum total Protein levels were within normal physiological limits in all the three groups. However serum albumin levels were reduced significantly in Groups 3 and 2 in comparison to Group 1. Conclusion: Derangements of LFT in COVID-19 Patients are common especially in patients with severe disease but its long term impact is unknown. Hence, further investigation and long term follow up of recovered COVID-19 cases is warranted to understand the pathophysiology and implication of liver injury that occurs both in overt and covert forms during infection.","Mukherjee, Kheya; Banerjee, Abhra; Bhattacharjee, Debojyoti; De, Suparna; Biswas, Ajay; Garai, Debanjan; Chakraborty, Roopsa; Manna, Asis",J Assoc Physicians India,,82

Here, we evaluated the performance of two quantitative antigen (Ag) tests, the Roche and Lumipulse Ag tests, using automated platforms. METHODS: We collected 637 nasopharyngeal swab samples from 274 individuals. Samples were subjected to quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), the Roche Ag test and Lumipulse Ag test. RESULTS: When RT-qPCR was used as a reference, the overall concordance rate of the Roche Ag test was 77.1% (491/637) with 70.0% (341/487) sensitivity and 100% specificity (150/150). When inconclusive results of the Lumipulse Ag test were excluded, the overall concordance rate of the Lumipulse Ag test was 88.3% (467/529) with 84.8% (330/389) sensitivity and 97.9% (137/140) specificity. The overall concordance rate between the Roche and Lumipulse Ag tests was 97.9% (518/529) with 96.7% (322/333) sensitivity and 100% (196/196) specificity. Quantitative Ag levels determined using the Roche and Lumipulse Ag tests were highly correlated (R2 = 0.922). The Roche and Lumipulse Ag tests showed high concordance up to nine days after symptom onset, with progressively lower concordance after that. CONCLUSIONS: The Roche and Lumipulse Ag tests showed equivalent assay performance and represent promising approaches for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019.","Hirotsu, Yosuke; Sugiura, Hiroki; Maejima, Makoto; Hayakawa, Miyoko; Mochizuki, Hitoshi; Tsutsui, Toshiharu; Kakizaki, Yumiko; Miyashita, Yoshihiro; Omata, Masao",Int J Infect Dis,,82
286001,Where have the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions gone during COVID-19 lockdown?,2020,"In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are major risk factors for critical disease progression. However, the underlying causes and the effects of the main anti-hypertensive therapies-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)-remain unclear. Combining clinical data (n = 144) and single-cell sequencing data of airway samples (n = 48) with in vitro experiments, we observed a distinct inflammatory predisposition of immune cells in patients with hypertension that correlated with critical COVID-19 progression. ACEI treatment was associated with dampened COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and with increased cell intrinsic antiviral responses, whereas ARB treatment related to enhanced epithelial-immune cell interactions. Macrophages and neutrophils of patients with hypertension, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited higher expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CCL3 and CCL4 and the chemokine receptor CCR1. Although the limited size of our cohort does not allow us to establish clinical efficacy, our data suggest that the clinical benefits of ACEI treatment in patients with COVID-19 who have hypertension warrant further investigation.","Trump, Saskia; Lukassen, Soeren; Anker, Markus S; Chua, Robert Lorenz; Liebig, Johannes; Thürmann, Loreen; Corman, Victor Max; Binder, Marco; Loske, Jennifer; Klasa, Christina; Krieger, Teresa; Hennig, Bianca P; Messingschlager, Marey; Pott, Fabian; Kazmierski, Julia; Twardziok, Sven; Albrecht, Jan Philipp; Eils, Jürgen; Hadzibegovic, Sara; Lena, Alessia; Heidecker, Bettina; Bürgel, Thore; Steinfeldt, Jakob; Goffinet, Christine; Kurth, Florian; Witzenrath, Martin; Völker, Maria Theresa; Müller, Sarah Dorothea; Liebert, Uwe Gerd; Ishaque, Naveed; Kaderali, Lars; Sander, Leif-Erik; Drosten, Christian; Laudi, Sven; Eils, Roland; Conrad, Christian; Landmesser, Ulf; Lehmann, Irina",Nat. biotechnol,,82
286719,Macrophage Activation in COVID-19 Patients in Intensive Care Unit,2020,"Early detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are priorities during the pandemic. Symptomatic and suspected asymptomatic individuals should be tested for COVID-19 to confirm infection and to be excluded from social interactions. As molecular testing capacity is overloaded during the pandemic, rapid antigen tests, such as lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs), can be a useful tool as they allow greater test availability and obtain results in a very short time. This short review aims to present the analytical properties of LFIAs in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. Lateral flow immunoassay is a method that combines thin-layer chromatography and indirect immunochemical sandwich method and allows the detection of a specific SARS-CoV-2 antigen in nasopharyngeal swabs. Swab specimens should be adequately collected and tested as soon as possible. Users should pay attention to quality control and possible interferences. Antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 show high sensitivity and specificity in cases with high viral loads, and should be used up to five days after the onset of the first symptoms of COVID-19. False positive results may be obtained when screening large populations with a low prevalence of COVID-19 infection, while false negative results may happen due to improper specimen collection or insufficient amount of antigen in the specimen. So as to achieve reliable results, a diagnostic accuracy study of a specific rapid antigen test should be performed.","Somborac Bacura, Anita; Dorotic, Marija; Grosic, Leonarda; Dzimbeg, Monika; Dodig, Slavica",Biochem Med (Zagreb),,82

We aimed to compare trauma volumes, patient characteristics, and trauma mechanisms at a large, urban Level 1 trauma center in the United States during a state-wide ""State of Emergency"" and ""stay-at-home"" order to corresponding historic dates. All adult trauma activations from March 1 through April 30, 2020 and a historic control from March 1 through April 30, 2018 and 2019 were reviewed in the institution's trauma registry. Trauma volumes, patient characteristics, and trauma mechanisms were compared over time as increasingly stricter COVID-related restrictions were enacted in the Commonwealth of Virginia. After declaration of a state-wide ""Public Health Emergency"" on March 17, 2020, the daily number of trauma activations significantly declined to a mean of 4.7 (standard deviation, SD = 2.6), a decrease by 43% from a mean of 8.2 (SD = 0.3) for the same dates in 2018 and 2019. Trauma activations during COVID restrictions vs. historic control were characterized by significantly higher prevalence of chronic alcohol use (15.5% vs. 6.8%, p < 0.01), higher median (25th - 75th percentile) Injury Severity Score of 9 (5 - 16) vs. 6 (4 - 14), p = 0.01, and shorter median (25th - 75th percentile) length of hospital stay of 2 (1 - 6) days vs. 3 (1 - 7) days, p = 0.03.

Chest radiograph (CXR) has been playing a crucial role in COVID-19 patient triaging, diagnosing and monitoring, particularly in the United States. Considering the mixed and unspecific signals in CXR, an image retrieval model of CXR that provides both similar images and associated clinical information can be more clinically meaningful than a direct image diagnostic model. In this work we develop a novel CXR image retrieval model based on deep metric learning. Unlike traditional diagnostic models which aims at learning the direct mapping from images to labels, the proposed model aims at learning the optimized embedding space of images, where images with the same labels and similar contents are pulled together. It utilizes multi-similarity loss with hard-mining sampling strategy and attention mechanism to learn the optimized embedding space, and provides similar images to the query image. The model is trained and validated on an international multi-site COVID-19 dataset collected from 3 different sources. Experimental results of COVID-19 image retrieval and diagnosis tasks show that the proposed model can serve as a robust solution for CXR analysis and patient management for COVID-19. The model is also tested on its transferability on a different clinical decision support task, where the pre-trained model is applied to extract image features from a new dataset without any further training. These results demonstrate our deep metric learning based image retrieval model is highly efficient in the CXR retrieval, diagnosis and prognosis, and thus has great clinical value for the treatment and management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhong, Aoxiao; Li, Xiang; Wu, Dufan; Ren, Hui; Kim, Kyungsang; Kim, Younggon; Buch, Varun; Neumark, Nir; Bizzo, Bernardo; Tak, Won Young; Park, Soo Young; Lee, Yu Rim; Kang, Min Kyu; Park, Jung Gil; Kim, Byung Seok; Chung, Woo Jin; Guo, Ning; Dayan, Ittai; Kalra, Mannudeep K.; Li, Quanzheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03663v1.pdf,82

For example, single-cell DNA sequencing is to sequence the DNA from every single cell. Increasing in complexity, single-cell multi-omics sequencing, or single-cell multimodal omics sequencing, is to profile in parallel multiple layers of omics information from a single cell. In practice, single-cell multi-omics sequencing actually detects multiple traits such as DNA, RNA, methylation information and/or protein profiles from the same cell for many individuals in a tissue sample. Multi-omics sequencing has been widely applied to systematically unravel interplay mechanisms of key components and pathways in cell. This survey overviews recent developments in single-cell multi-omics sequencing, and their applications to understand complex diseases in particular the COVID-19 pandemic. We also summarize machine learning and bioinformatics techniques used in the analysis of the intercorrelated multilayer heterogeneous data. We observed that variational inference and graph-based learning are popular approaches, and Seurat V3 is a commonly used tool to transfer the missing variables and labels. We also discussed two intensively studied issues relating to data consistency and diversity and commented on currently cared issues surrounding the error correction of data pairs and data imputation methods.

Brick-and-mortar grocery stores, restaurants, and pharmacies are providing fast delivery services to satisfy the growing home delivery demand. Motivated by a large meal and grocery delivery company, we model and solve a multiperiod driver dispatching and routing problem for last-mile delivery systems where on-time performance is the main target. The operator of this system needs to dispatch a set of drivers and specify their delivery routes in a stochastic environment, in which random demand arrives over a fixed number of periods. The resulting dynamic program is challenging to solve due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a novel approximation framework to approximate the value function via a simplified dispatching program. We then develop efficient exact algorithms for this problem based on Benders decomposition and column generation. We validate the superior performance of our framework and algorithms via extensive numerical experiments. Tested on a real-world data set, we quantify the value of adaptive dispatching and routing in on-time delivery and highlight the need of coordinating these two decisions in a dynamic setting. We show that dispatching multiple vehicles with short trips is preferable for on-time delivery, as opposed to sending a few vehicles with long travel times.","Liu, Sheng; Luo, Zhixing",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13058v1.pdf,82

Enveloped viruses are most commonly known to cause emerging and recurring infectious diseases. Viral and cell membrane fusion is the major key event in case of enveloped viruses that required for their entry into the cell. Viral fusion proteins are playing important role in fusion process and in infection establishment. Because of this, fusion process targeting antivirals become an interest to fight against viral diseases caused by enveloped virus. Lower respiratory tract infections casing viruses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) are examples of such enveloped viruses that are at top in public health issues. Here, we summarized the viral fusion protein targeted antiviral peptides along with their mechanism and specific design to combat viral fusion process. The pandemic COVID-19, severe respiratory syndrome disease is outbreak worldwide. There are no definitive drugs yet but few are in on-going trial. Here, an approach of fragment based drug design (FBDD) methodology was used to identify the broad spectrum agent target to the conserved region of fusion protein of SARS CoV-2. Three dipeptides (DL, LQ and ID) were chosen from the library and designed by the systematic combination along with their possible modifications of amino acids to the target sites. Designed peptides were docked with targeted fusion protein after energy minimization. Results show strong and significant binding affinity (DL = -60.1 kcal/mol; LQ = -62.8 kcal/mol; ID= -71.5 kcal/mol) during interaction. Any one of the active peptides from the developed libraries may help to block competitively the target sites to successfully control COVID-19.","Manna, Sounik; Chowdhury, Trinath; Baindara, Piyush; Mandal, Santi M",,,82

This stationary phase materials combined the features of large surface areas and adsorption affinity of ZIF-8, and also the multiple chiral binding sites of BSA, which contributes to the &#960;-interaction and hydrophobic interaction with the analytes. The separation performance of BSA@ZIF-8-OT chiral columns was evaluated with a miniaturized capillary electrochromatography and amperometric detection (mini-CEC-AD) system; in particular, nine groups of model molecules, including homologues, structural isomers, and chiral compounds, were baseline separated under the certain optimum conditions. The RSDs of run-to-run, day-to-day, column-to-column, and batch-to-batch reproducibility were less than 13.8 %. Furthermore, the prepared OT columns were successfully applied to fast analysis of ephedrine isomers in Chinese herb ephedra, and the LODs achieved 1.5-2.0 ng mL-1 (S/N=3) by an electrophoretic stacking technique of moving chemical reaction boundary. This mini-CEC-AD system with BSA@ZIF-8-OT chiral columns provides a promising potential in pharmaceutical analysis due to its fast, sensitive, enantioselective, and low-cost characteristics.","Wang, Tingting; Wang, Ying; Zhang, Yulian; Cheng, Yuhuan; Ye, Jiannong; Chu, Qingcui; Cheng, Guifang",J Chromatogr A,,82

Objective: To assess whether helmet noninvasive ventilation can increase the days free of respiratory support in patients with COVID-19 compared with high-flow nasal oxygen alone. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter randomized clinical trial in 4 intensive care units (ICUs) in Italy between October and December 2020, end of follow-up February 11, 2021, including 109 patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen &#8804;200). Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to receive continuous treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation (positive end-expiratory pressure, 10-12 cm H2O; pressure support, 10-12 cm H2O) for at least 48 hours eventually followed by high-flow nasal oxygen (n = 54) or high-flow oxygen alone (60 L/min) (n = 55). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who required endotracheal intubation within 28 days from study enrollment, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 28, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 60, in-ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, 60-day mortality, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay. Results: Among 110 patients who were randomized, 109 (99%) completed the trial (median age, 65 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 55-70]; 21 women [19%]). The median days free of respiratory support within 28 days after randomization were 20 (IQR, 0-25) in the helmet group and 18 (IQR, 0-22) in the high-flow nasal oxygen group, a difference that was not statistically significant (mean difference, 2 days [95% CI, -2 to 6]; P = .26). Of 9 prespecified secondary outcomes reported, 7 showed no significant difference. The rate of endotracheal intubation was significantly lower in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (30% vs 51%; difference, -21% [95% CI, -38% to -3%]; P = .03). The median number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation within 28 days was significantly higher in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (28 [IQR, 13-28] vs 25 [IQR 4-28]; mean difference, 3 days [95% CI, 0-7]; P = .04). The rate of in-hospital mortality was 24% in the helmet group and 25% in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (absolute difference, -1% [95% CI, -17% to 15%]; P > .99). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemia, treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation, compared with high-flow nasal oxygen, resulted in no significant difference in the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days. Further research is warranted to determine effects on other outcomes, including the need for endotracheal intubation.

300147,Aggravated Respiratory Failure From COVID-19 Infection: Patient Care Management From Nurses in the Intensive Care Unit,2021,"PURPOSE: To examine the protective effects of Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) in angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced inflammation and fibrosis on Human Tenon's capsule Fibroblasts (HTFs) and Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages (MPMs). This study also investigated the potential mechanism of action of ISL. METHOD: Methyl-thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to test ISL toxicity. An ELISA and an RT-qPCR assay detected the inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-6, COX-2, and ICAM-1). A Western blot investigated the expression levels of inflammation-related signals [nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³)], and fibrogenesis, including fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#945;-SMA)]. Protein expressions of &#945;-SMA were measured by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Pre-treatment with ISL (10 or 20â¯µM) dose-dependently decreased the mRNA levels of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, ICAM-1, and COX-2 induced by ANG II (1â¯µg/ml) in both MPMs and HTFs. ANG II remarkably increased the amount of P65 in the nuclei and decreased the amount of P65 in the cytoplasm. Additionally, ANG II reduced PPARÎ³ expression levels in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, these effects which were induced by ISL were remarkably neutralized by ISL pre-treatment. Finally, ANG II markedly elevated the expression of fibronectin and &#945;-SMA. CONCLUSION: ISL could alleviate ANG II-induced fibrogenesis by inhibiting the NF-&#954;B/PPARÎ³ inflammatory pathway. In addition, ISL may be a potential agent for the treatment of conjunctival fibrosis. Most importantly, the NF-&#954;B/PPARÎ³ signaling pathway could be an effective therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of conjunctival fibrosis after glaucoma surgery.","Ye, Huifang; Xi, Yang; Chen, Xiong; Shen, Lijun; Le, Rongrong",Exp Eye Res,,82

This study uses a selection of companies provided by CommonWealth magazine to classify the listed companies in Taiwan as CSR and non-CSR companies. The event study approach is applied to examine the change in the stock prices of CSR companies after the first COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan. The empirical results indicate that the stock prices of all companies generated significantly negative abnormal returns and negative cumulative abnormal returns after the outbreak. Compared with all companies and with non-CSR companies, CSR companies were less affected by the outbreak; their stock prices were relatively resistant to the fall and they recovered faster. In addition, the cumulative impact of the COVID-19 on the stock prices of CSR companies is smaller than that of non-CSR companies on both short- and long-term bases. However, the stock price performance of non-CSR companies was not weaker than that of CSR companies during times when the impact of the pandemic was lower or during the price recovery phase.","Lee, Kuo-Jung; Lu, Su-Lien",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,82

Design/methodology/approach: Through doctrinal and legal study and content analysis, this paper analyses the important relevant legal provisions under International human rights law and applies these provisions to the reality of managing the COVID-19 crisis to identify the most prominent human rights violations during the COVID-19 outbreak. This research paper considered as a review paper in that it provides a review of the most prominent measures taken during the COVID-19 crisis, which constitutes violations of international human rights law. Findings: It is concluded that some measures that have been taken by countries to confront the COVID-19 pandemic have constituted violations of human rights and did not comply with the legal conditions to restrict human rights. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown the ugly fractures in health-care systems, health inequities, racism and discrimination, Undermining the right to freedom of expression and the right to access information, gross negligence in protecting detainees from COVID-19 infection, all of these constitute clear violations of the principles of international human rights law. Research limitations/implications: The spread of COVID-19 has not stopped, and its effects still continue, including human rights violations. Therefore, this paper cannot enumerate all human rights violations that occur during the spread of COVID-19. Practical implications: Based on the results in this paper, governments need to be more prepared to face any health crisis at all levels including health care, which would reduce human rights violations. Social implications: This research paper reflects positively on the social reality, as the adoption of its recommendations leads to the provision of adequate health care to all members of society in accordance with the principles of human rights, granting them the right to access information, protecting their right to freedom of expression, reducing the phenomenon of racism and discrimination and providing adequate health care to all detainees. Originality/value: This paper studies an up-to-date topic that we are still living and seeing its effects.

A Discrete-Choice Experiment Examining General Population Preferences for Intensive Care Bed Prioritization in a Pandemic,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 infection affects numerous organs, including the central nervous system. The neuroinvasive abilities and neuroinflammation may lead to short- and long-term neurological manifestations. Among neurological disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been described in a few case-based observational studies during the acute phase of COVID-19 hospitalization. We present a case of a patient who developed seizures and PRES after recovering from an acute severe COVID-19 infection. A 90-year-old African American female with multiple comorbidities and a severe COVID-19 infection was discharged home in stable condition after two weeks of hospitalization. A week later, she developed new-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures requiring readmission to the hospital. The patient's clinical course and brain imaging supported PRES. Her mentation returned to baseline with supportive care and anticonvulsant treatment. Follow-up brain MRI four months later demonstrated resolution of FLAIR signal abnormalities confirming PRES. SARS-CoV-2 insult on the cerebrovascular endothelial cells likely continued and despite the clinical recovery eventually resulted in PRES. We believe that this is the first case describing the presentation of PRES after recovery from severe acute COVID-19 infection.

323989,Shelf Life of Critical Care Knowledge,2021,"Background: COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which can develop into a hyper-inflammatory late phase or “cytokine storm” that poses high risk of death It has been proposed that the management of this cytokine storm is crucial to increase the survival rate of COVID-19 patients However, to date there are no diagnostic criteria based on inflammatory markers that could be used to select the COVID-19 patients at risk of developing a cytokine storm or effective interventions that can decreased mortality in these patients Methods: We carried out a quasi-experimental study to test whether high dose corticosteroid pulse therapy with either dexametaxona or methylprednisolone were associated with reduced mortality in patients at risk of cytokine storm and assess which laboratory markers can be used to pre-select these patients To control the development and progression of this hyper-inflammtory phase, 64 patients (20 1%) were treated with high dose corticosteroid pulse therapy (HDCPT) by using either dexametaxona or methylprednisolone daily for 2-5 days at doses of at least 30mg or 125mg respectively To determine diagnostic criteria that can be used to defined patients at risk of cytokine storm, we carried out a 30-day time course analysis of laboratory markers between survivors and non-survivors A multivariate Cox regression (controlling for co-morbidities and therapies) was carried out to determine whether HDCPT (among other interventions) was associated with decreased mortality in both the full cohort, and in a subgroup containing the patients with the derived criteria Findings: Out of 500 patients originally recruited, 381 met the inclusion criteria of SARS-COV-19 detection by PCR or serology (n=272, 71 2%) or high clinical suspicion (n= 46, 16 9 %), defined as having bilateral pulmonary infiltrate or lymphopenia with according clinical profile HDCPT was the only intervention that showed a significant decrease in mortality (odds ratio = 0 093 [95% CI 0 023 – 0 38];P 0 001) Based on our 30-day time course analyses, we suggest the following criteria to determine which patients are at a risk of cytokine storm and therefore should be given HDCPT: IL-6 = 40 pg/ml and/or two of the following: C-reactive protein = 100 mg/L, D-dimer = 1000 ng/ml, ferritin = 500 ng/ml and lactate dehydrogenase = 300 U/L Multivariate Cox regression by pre-selecting the patients using this criteria evidenced also a decreased mortality rate with HDCPT with a lower odds ratio (odds ratio = 0 081 [95% CI 0 011 – 0 56];P = 0 011) Conclusions: Preventing and/or controlling the development of the cytokine storm in patients at high-inflammatory risk with HDCPT is a widely available therapy to increase survival rate in these patients We estimate a 14 2% [95% CI 0 792 - 0 975] increase of survival rate We also suggest some initial clinical variables that can aid with the identification of the patients who will benefit from this intervention","López-Zúñiga, Miguel Ángel Moreno-Moral Aida Ocaña-Granados Ana Padilla-Moreno Francisco Castillo-Fernández Alba María Guillamón-Fernández Dionisio Sanchez-Palop María Martínez-Colmenero Justo Pimentel-Villar María Amparo Blázquez-Roselló Sara Moreno-Sánchez José Juan López-Vílchez Maria Prior-Sánchez Inmaculada Jódar-Moreno Rosario Ramírez-Sánchez Carolina López Ruz Miguel Angel",,,82

334236,Performance of intensive care unit severity scoring systems across different ethnicities in the USA: a retrospective observational study,2021,"Objective In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused a disease outbreak that soon became a global pandemic. Dentists are potentially exposed to infectious microorganisms, including SARS-CoV-2, by virtue of the transmission routes and work environment. This study aims to determine the infection load in a dental healthcare setting during the onset of the pandemic in the UK, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of recommended test regimens in order to estimate potential risks for caregivers and patients in a dynamically changing pandemic environment.Methods Twenty-four persons (dental personnel of one dental office and family contacts) were included in this pilot study, and their infection load was determined between March and May 2020 using antigen and antibody tests.Results Of the 24 subjects, three tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were quarantined accordingly. After six weeks, they tested negative for the virus, had built antibodies and had no remaining symptoms, enabling an efficient return to work.Conclusion This paper outlines the results of COVID-19 testing in a dental practice during the onset of the pandemic, and discusses possible strategies and protocols to gain certainty in the dental practice, assessing possible testing scenarios that can be performed in a primary healthcare setting.","Greenwall, Linda; Cebula, Marcus; Greenwall Cohen, Joseph; Effenberger, Susanne",Br. dent. j,,82

344935,Exceptional circumstances,2020,"The emergence of the Coronavirus Disease -19 (COVID-19) pandemic, has had a tremendous global impact, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide and especially in the United States, where nearly one third of the cases are located. Although involvement of the lower respiratory track accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality seen, the virus involves several organ systems and the syndrome exhibits clinical diversity with a wide range of symptoms and manifestations. The involvement of elements of the hematopoietic system is prominent in severe cases and associated with poor outcomes and mortality. Lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and a prothrombotic state are common manifestations of COVID-19 and have important treatment and prognostic implications. Better understanding of the mechanisms of the pathophysiology of COVID-19-induced hematological abnormalities may ultimately result in better ways to treat them and decrease the associated morbidity and mortality.","Mina, Alain; van Besien, Koen; Platanias, Leonidas C",Leuk Lymphoma,,82

The detection of helium for a low density planet would be strong evidence for the presence of a primary atmosphere accreted from the protoplanetary nebula because large amounts of helium are not expected in the secondary atmospheres of rocky planets. We used Keck+NIRSPEC to obtain high-resolution transit spectroscopy of the planets GJ1214b, GJ9827d, and HD97658b around the 10,833 Ang He triplet feature. We did not detect helium absorption for any of the planets despite achieving a high level of sensitivity. We used the non-detections to set limits on the planets' thermosphere temperatures and atmospheric loss rates by comparing grids of 1D models to the data. We also performed coupled interior structure and atmospheric loss calculations, which suggest that the bulk atmospheres (winds) of the planets would be at most modestly enhanced (depleted) in helium relative to their primordial composition. Our lack of detections of the helium triplet for GJ1214b and GJ9827d are inconsistent with the predictions of models for the present day mass loss on these planets at more than 5 sigma confidence. Higher signal-to-noise data would be needed to detect the helium feature predicted for HD97658b. We identify uncertainties in the EUV fluxes of the host stars and the lack of detailed mass loss models specifically for cool and metal-enhanced atmospheres as the main limitations to the interpretation of our results. Ultimately, our results suggest that the upper atmospheres of sub-Neptune planets are fundamentally different than those of gas giant planets.","Kasper, David; Bean, Jacob L.; Oklopvci'c, Antonija; Malsky, Isaac; Kempton, Eliza M.-R.; D'esert, Jean-Michel; Rogers, Leslie A.; Mansfield, Megan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12968v1.pdf,82

The pulmotropic virus causes loss of oxygenation in severe cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and need for mechanical ventilation. This work seeks to introduce placental extract-derived biologically active components as a therapeutic option and highlights their mechanism of action relevant to COVID-19 virus. Human placenta has been used in clinical practice for over a century and there is substantial experience in clinical applications of placental extract for different indications. Aqueous extract of human placentacontains growth factors, cytokines/chemokines, natural metabolic and other compounds, anti-oxidants, amino acids, vitamins, trace elements and biomolecules, which individually or in combination show accelerated cellular metabolism, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, cellular proliferation and stimulation of tissue regeneration processes. Placental extract treatment is proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach consideringthe above properties which could protect against initial viral entry and acute inflammation of alveolar epithelial cells, reconstitute pulmonary microenvironment and regenerate the lung. We reviewed useful therapeutic information of placental biomolecules in relation to COVID-19 treatment. We propose the new approach of using placental growth factors, chemokines and cytokine which will execute antiviral activity in coordination with innate and humoral immunity and improve patient's immunological responses to COVID-19. Executing a clinical trial using placental extract as preventive, protective and/or therapeutic approach for COVID-19treatment could advance the development of a most promising therapeutic candidate that can join the armamentaria against the COVID-19 virus.","Joshi, Meghnad G; Kshersagar, Jeevitaa; Desai, Shashikant R; Sharma, Shimpa",Placenta,,82

The importance of these protein modifications for the viral life cycle is underscored by the discovery that many viruses encode deconjugases that reverse their functions. The structural and functional characterization of these viral enzymes and the identification of their viral and cellular substrates is providing valuable insights into the biology of viral infections and the host's antiviral defense. Given the growing body of evidence demonstrating their key contribution to pathogenesis, the viral deconjugases are now recognized as attractive targets for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.","Masucci, Maria Grazia",Biomolecules,,82

The immune pathology behind COVID-19 is complex and involves the activation and interaction of multiple systems including, but not limited to, complement, inflammasomes, endothelial as well as innate and adaptive immune cells to bring about a convoluted profile of inflammation, coagulation and tissue damage. To date, therapeutic approaches have focussed on inhibition of coagulation, untargeted immune suppression and/or cytokine-directed blocking agents. Regardless of recently achieved improvements in individual patient outcomes and survival rates, improved and focussed approaches targeting individual systems involved is needed to further improve prognosis and wellbeing.

METHODS: Publicly available data from The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic were accessed between 9 September 2020 and 14 September 2020. For each state and the District of Columbia, % infection, % death, and % population proportion for subgroups of race (African American/black (AA/black), Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), and white) and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic) were recorded. Crude and normalised disparity estimates were generated for COVID-19 infection (CDI and NDI) and mortality (CDM and NDM), computed as absolute and relative difference between % infection or % mortality and % population proportion per state. Choropleth map display was created as thematic representation proportionate to CDI, NDI, CDM and NDM. RESULTS: The Hispanic population had a median of 158% higher COVID-19 infection relative to their % population proportion (median 158%, IQR 100%-200%). This was followed by AA, with 50% higher COVID-19 infection relative to their % population proportion (median 50%, IQR 25%-100%). The AA population had the most disproportionate mortality, with a median of 46% higher mortality than the % population proportion (median 46%, IQR 18%-66%). Disproportionate impact of COVID-19 was also seen in AI/AN and Asian populations, with 100% excess infections than the % population proportion seen in nine states for AI/AN and seven states for Asian populations. There was no disproportionate impact in the white population in any state. CONCLUSIONS: There are racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 infection/mortality, with distinct state-wise patterns across the USA based on racial/ethnic composition. There were missing and inconsistently reported racial/ethnic data in many states. This underscores the need for standardised reporting, attention to specific regional patterns, adequate resource allocation and addressing the underlying social determinants of health adversely affecting chronically marginalised groups.","Xian, Zhaoying; Saxena, Anshul; Javed, Zulqarnain; Jordan, John E; Alkarawi, Safa; Khan, Safi U; Shah, Karan; Vahidy, Farhaan S; Nasir, Khurram; Dubey, Prachi",BMJ Open,,82

METHODS: These guidelines were written following multidisciplinary agreement between Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Respiratory Medicine and the Department of Anaesthetics and Critical Care Medicine in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. A literature review was performed and a guideline for elective tracheostomy insertion in patients with COVID-19 proposed.

However, a heart transplant (HT) after such support remains challenging. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the immediate and long-term results following an HT in the cohort of patients who had a TAH-t implant. METHODS: A total of 73 patients were implanted with the TAH-t between 1988 and 2019 in our centre. Of these 73 consecutive patients, 50 (68%) received an HT and are included in this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. RESULTS: In the selected cohort, in-hospital mortality after an HT was 10% (n = 5). The median intensive care unit stay was 33 days (range 5-278). The median hospital stay was 41 days (range 28-650). A partial or total pericardiectomy was performed during the HT procedure in 21 patients (42%) due to a severe pericardial reaction. Long-term survival rates after an HT at 5, 10 and 12 years were 79.1 ± 5.9% (n = 32), 76.5 ± 6.3% (n = 22) and 72.4 ± 7.1% (n = 12), respectively, which was similar to the long-term survival for a primary HT without TAH-t during the same period (n = 686). An HT performed within 3-6 months post-TAH-t implantation appeared to provide the best survival (P = 0.007). Eight (16%) patients required chronic dialysis during the subsequent follow-up period, with 3 patients requiring a kidney transplant. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term outcomes with the SynCardia TAH-t as a bridge to transplant in patients with severe biventricular failure are very encouraging. Our review noted that an HT following TAH-t can be technically challenging, especially in the case of a severe pericardial reaction, with potential pitfalls that should be recognized preoperatively.","David, Charles-Henri; Lacoste, Philippe; Nanjaiah, Prakash; Bizouarn, Philippe; Lepoivre, Thierry; Michel, Magali; Pattier, Sabine; Toquet, Claire; Périgaud, Christian; Mugniot, Antoine; Al Habash, Ousama; Petit, Thierry; Groleau, Nicolas; Rozec, Bertrand; Trochu, Jean Noel; Roussel, Jean Christian; Sénage, Thomas",Eur. j. cardiothorac. surg,,82

A partial least-square-based path analysis revealed direct effects of attitude and subjective norm in predicting intention to adopt preventive behavior. In addition, perception of e-government information and services and perception of social media were found to be significant predictors of attitude toward preventive behavior.

DESIGN: We conducted a rapid review of systematic reviews. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and risk of bias evaluation. A standardised extraction form was used. Data are reported narratively. INTERVENTIONS: We included systematic reviews of digital health interventions aiming to prevent, detect or manage mental health problems in individuals with a pre-existing chronic disease, including chronic mental health illnesses, published in 2010 or after. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reports on mental health outcomes (eg, anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms). RESULTS: We included 35 reviews, totalling 702 primary studies with a total sample of 50 692 participants. We structured the results in four population clusters: (1) chronic diseases, (2) cancer, (3) mental health and (4) children and youth. For populations presenting a chronic disease or cancer, health provider directed digital interventions (eg, web-based consultation, internet cognitive-behavioural therapy) are effective and safe. Further analyses are required in order to provide stronger recommendations regarding relevance for specific population (such as children and youth). Web-based interventions and email were the modes of administration that had the most reports of improvement. Virtual reality, smartphone applications and patient portal had limited reports of improvement.

376872,Nosocomial Covid-19 Infection in an Lvad Patient,2021,"Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is ongoing globally. Limited data are available for children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: A retrospective case study was conducted in one designated hospital for children with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan. Results: Out of the 74 children with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the median age was 5.8 years, with no notable variation based on gender. All of the children had had direct exposure to at least one family member with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common symptoms were cough in 41 (55.4%) and fever in 38 (51.4%). Typical CT patterns of viral pneumonia were exhibited in 40 (54.1%) children, including ground-glass opacity and interstitial abnormalities. However, 17 (23.0%) children were classified as asymptomatic carriers, with neither symptoms nor radiological findings. Also, 68 (91.9%) children recovered fully and showed negative results on RT-PCR assay by nasopharyngeal swabs during our observation period. In contrast to the negative result for nasopharyngeal swab, 34% of the anal swabs showed a continued positive result. The mean hospitalization days of the children discharged after full recovery was 10.0 days. Conclusion: Within family clusters that had SARS-CoV-2 infection, children had mild or even asymptomatic illness. Although CT is highly sensitive, it should be avoided in follow-up of the disease in consideration of the radiological hazards and limited clinical benefits for mild illness in children. Furthermore, it is advocated that both nasopharyngeal and anal swabs should be confirmed negative for viral load prior to declaring full recovery so as to avoid oral-fecal transmission. Asymptomatic children with family clusters are potentially a little-known source of COVID-19. This therefore warrants an urgent reassessment of the transmission dynamics of the current outbreak.","Sun, Dan; Zhu, Feng; Wang, Cheng; Wu, Jing; Liu, Jie; Chen, Xue; Liu, Zhisheng; Wu, Zubo; Lu, Xiaoxia; Ma, Jiehui; Peng, Hua; Xiao, Han",Front.

384386,"Clinical and Scientific Rationale for the ""MATH+"" Hospital Treatment Protocol for COVID-19",2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Malnutrition is associated with poor prognosis of different diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association of malnutrition with long-term mortality of older adults with ischemic stroke in China. METHODS: We selected patients aged &#8805;65 years with first-ever ischemic stroke from the Nanjing Stroke Registry Program. Malnutrition was defined according to the controlling nutritional status score (CONUT), the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), and the prognostic nutritional index score (PNI), respectively. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions and competing risk regressions were performed to explore the relationship between malnutrition and the risk of mortality in older adults with ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Among 1065 enrolled patients, 60.5%, 46.7%, and 30.6% of patients were malnourished according to CONUT, GNRI, and PNI score. During a median follow-up of 4.74 (3.73-5.82) years, 205 (19.2%) patients died. In multivariate analysis, malnutrition (severe risk versus normal nutrition) was associated with significantly increased risk for mortality by the CONUT (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 4.615, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.373-15.514, P = 0.013), GNRI (adjusted HR 3.641, 95% CI 1.924-6.891, P < 0.001), and PNI score (adjusted HR 1.587, 95% CI, 1.096-2.297, P = 0.014). Furthermore, adding the malnutrition indexes to models modestly improved the predictive ability of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that malnutrition was highly prevalent in older Chinese adults with ischemic stroke and associated with increased mortality. Further research is required to evaluate the efficacy of nutritional management in these patients.","Yuan, Kang; Zhu, Shuanggen; Wang, Huaiming; Chen, Jingjing; Zhang, Xiaohao; Xu, Pengfei; Xie, Yi; Zhu, Xinyi; Zhu, Wusheng; Sun, Wen; Xu, Gelin; Liu, Xinfeng",Clin Nutr,,82

This study was constructed using a cross-sectional design with 1060 participants recruited from among junior high school students around Taiwan using stratified and cluster sampling methods. Taiwan's first COVID-19 case was diagnosed on 28 January 2020. New cases exploded rapidly in February, and as a result, participants were surveyed during March 2 through 27 March 2020. The prevalence of Internet addiction was found to be 24.4% during this period. High impulsivity, high virtual social support, older in age, low subjective well-being, low family function, and high alexithymia was all independently predictive in the forward logistic regression analyses. The prevalence rate of Internet addiction was high among junior high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak.

However, the application of SSBs is impeded by uncontrollable Li dendrite growth and short circuiting, the mechanism of which remains elusive. Herein, we conceptualize a scheme to visualize Li deposition in the confined space inside carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to mimic Li deposition dynamics inside solid electrolyte (SE) cracks, where the high-strength CNT walls mimic the mechanically strong SEs. We observed that the deposited Li propagates as a creeping solid in the CNTs, presenting an effective pathway for stress relaxation. When the stress-relaxation pathway is blocked, the Li deposition-induced stress reaches the gigapascal level and causes CNT fracture. Mechanics analysis suggests that interfacial lithiophilicity critically governs Li deposition dynamics and stress relaxation. Our study offers critical strategies for suppressing Li dendritic growth and constructing high-energy-density, electrochemically and mechanically robust SSBs.","Chen, Jingzhao; Zhao, Chao; Xue, Dingchuan; Zhang, Liqiang; Yang, Tingting; Du, Congcong; Zhang, Xuedong; Fang, Ruyue; Guo, Baiyu; Ye, Hongjun; Li, Hui; Dai, Qiushi; Zhao, Jun; Li, Yanshuai; Harris, Stephen J; Tang, Yongfu; Ding, Feng; Zhang, Sulin; Huang, Jianyu",Nano lett,,82

Mechanical ventilation may amplify ventilator-associated complications and extendresourceutilization.A better understanding of prognostic indicators could help in the planning and distribution of resources, particularly in resource-limited areas. We analyzed laboratory studies of intubated COVID-19 patients with the goal of identifying biomarkers that may predictextubationsuccess and survival to discharge. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on all COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation between January 3, 2020, and January 7, 2020, in a single academic tertiary care center in Northeastern New York State. The electronic medical record was used to collect 14 laboratory variables at three time points: admission, intubation, andextubation (including terminal extubation) for all intubated intensive care unit (ICU) patients treated for COVID-19. Mean laboratory values were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed with the two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results Seventy-two patients met the inclusion criteria. Forty-three patients were male. The mean age was 61 years. The overall mortality was 50%. On admission, intubated patients who survived had significantly higher platelet counts (p=0.024),and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC;p=0.047).Notably, ferritin(p=0.018)and aspartate transaminase (AST;p=0.0045) levels were lower in survivors. At the time of intubation, survivors again had a higher platelet count (p=0.024) and ALC(p=0.037) levels. They had a lower D-dimer (p=0.0014), ferritin (p=0.0015), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH;p=0.0145), and AST (p=0.018) compared to intubated patients who died. Atextubation, survivors had higher platelet count (p=0.0002), ALC (p=0.0013), andneutrophil/lymphocyteratio (NLR;p=0.0024). Survivors had lower d-dimer (p=0.035), ferritin (p=0.0012), CRP (p=0.045), LDH (p=0.002), AST (p&lt;0.001), and ALK (p=0.0048). Conclusions Biomarkers associated with increased risk of mortality include platelet count, ALC, lymphocyte percentage, NLR, D-dimer, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), AST, alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALK). This study provides additional evidence that these biomarkers have prognostic value in patients with severe COVID-19. The goal is to find objective surrogate markers of disease improvement or success ofextubation. When considered within the larger body of data, it is our hope that a mortality risk calculator can be generated for intubated COVID-19 patients.","Topp, G.; Bouyea, M.; Cochran-Caggiano, N.; Ata, A.; Torres, P.; Jacob, J.; Wales, D.",Cureus,,82

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of new-onset occupational HE during the COVID-19 outbreak in healthcare workers (HCWs) and the clinical course, clinical features, and risk factors of occupational hand eczema (HE). A total of 159 volunteer HCWs (female: n=112;male: n=47, mean age=35.55+/-7.03 years) working in a pandemic hospital were included. Participants were questioned in terms of daily hand hygiene, use of gloves, and signs and symptoms associated with HE before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. HCWs were divided into two groups classified as non-COVID and COVID, according to the unit they worked in. In our study, 55 participants reported new-onset signs and/or symptoms associated with HE during the COVID-19 pandemic. 59 participants described an increase in signs and/or symptoms associated with HE. The presence of newly-formed or increased signs and/or symptoms associated with HE was found to be 71.7%. A significant increase in dryness, itching, pain/burning, erythema, and scaling was observed (P<0.05). No difference was found between the COVID and non-COVID groups in terms of newly formed and/or increased signs and symptoms (P>0.05). The study included a limited number of participants, and the participants self-reported the signs and symptoms associated with HE. During the COVID-19 period, there has been a significant increase in the signs and symptoms of occupational HE as a result of increased hand hygiene practices in HCWs.","Dogan, E. I.; Kurt, B.

With the rapid increase in the number of infections, an increase is observed in the number of children with COVID-19. Most research findings are regarding adult cases, which are not always transferrable to children. Evidence-based studies are still expected to formulate clinical decisions for pediatric patients. In this review, we included 2597 pediatric patients that reported recently and evaluated the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of children with COVID-19. We found that even lymphopenia was the most common lab finding in adults; it infrequently occurred in children (9.8%). Moreover, elevated creatine kinase MB isoenzyme was much more commonly observed in children (27.0%) than that in adults, suggesting that heart injury would be more likely to occur in pediatric patients. Our analysis may contribute to determine the spectrum of disease in children and to develop strategies to control the disease transmission.","Cui, Xiaojian; Zhang, Tongqiang; Zheng, Jiafeng; Zhang, Jiayi; Si, Ping; Xu, Yongsheng; Guo, Wei; Liu, Zihui; Li, Wenliang; Ma, Jia; Dong, Cuicui; Shen, Yongming; Cai, Chunquan; He, Sijia",J. med. virol,,82

404399,[Rational therapeutic decisions in intensive care patients],2020,"The ocular surface, which is constantly exposed to the external environment, is one of the most sensitive zones and any complications which have a detrimental impact on it leading to re-duced vision and/or blindness, severely impact the quality of life. The most commonly afflicted parts of the eye are the conjunctiva, eyelid, and cornea due to their position. Since the eye is moder-ately susceptible to microbial infection from bacteria, fungi or even viruses;there has been much speculation about whether or not the novel coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can lead to ocular disor-ders. Given the high rate of transmission for this disease, it is of great importance to evaluate the risk of disease communication from the eye, such as by conjunctival and/ lacrimal discharge. While there are many articles on the topic exploring the ocular aspect of COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2 infection;there is a significant volume of data that may or may-not seem contradictory at first glance. This is primarily due to the still-emerging nature of this disease and new data that is being unearthed every day. The problem is compounded by the fact that despite the over-all concordance, the different clinical teams have varying diagnostic criteria. This review attempts to consolidate the data available thus far regarding the risk of COVID-19 transmission from conjunctival/lacrimal discharge apart from the known modes of transmission, thereby allowing us to speculate whether additional protective measures are required to combat the zoonotic coronavirus pandemic currently ravaging the world.","Sanyal, S.; Law, S.",Current Biotechnology,,82

408726,Waiting for the surge: COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit - An overview,2020,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on orthopaedic and trauma surgery training in Europe by conducting an online survey among orthopaedic trainees. METHODS: The survey was conducted among members of the Federation of Orthopaedic and Trauma Trainees in Europe (FORTE). It consisted of 24 questions (single-answer, multiple-answer, Likert scales). Orthopaedic trainees' demographic data (six questions), clinical role changes (four questions), institutional changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic (nine questions), and personal considerations (five questions) were examined. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-seven trainees from 23 European countries completed the survey. Most trainees retained their customary clinical role (59.8%), but a significant number was redeployed to COVID-19 units (20.9%). A drastic workload decrease during the pandemic was reported at most institutions. Only essential activities were performed at 57.1% of institutions and drastic disruptions were reported at 36.0%. Of the respondents, 52.1% stated that faculty-led education was restricted and 46.3% pursued self-guided learning, while 58.6% stated that surgical training was significantly impaired. Concerns about the achievement of annual training goals were expressed by 58.2% of the participants, while 25.0% anticipated the need for an additional year of training. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic significantly affected orthopaedic and trauma training in Europe. Most trainees felt the decrease in clinical, surgical, and educational activities would have a detrimental effect on their training. Many of them consulted remote learning options to compensate training impairment, stating that after the COVID-19 pandemic electronic educational approaches may become more relevant in future.","Megaloikonomos, Panayiotis D; Thaler, Martin; Igoumenou, Vasilios G; Bonanzinga, Tommaso; Ostojic, Marko; Couto, André Faria; Diallo, Jasmin; Khosravi, Ismail",Int Orthop,,82

A growing literature suggests that exposure to pollution can cause respiratory illness and increase deaths among the elderly. However, little is known about whether increases in pollution could cause additional or more severe infections from COVID-19, which typically manifests as a respiratory infection. During the pandemic, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rolled back enforcement of environmental regulation, causing an increase in pollution in counties with more TRI sites. We use the variation in pollution and a difference in differences design to estimate the effects of increased pollution on county-level COVID-19 deaths and cases. We find that counties with more Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) sites saw a 11.8 percent increase in pollution on average following the EPA's rollback of enforcement, compared to counties with fewer TRI sites. We also find that these policy-induced increases in pollution are associated with a 53 percent increase in cases and a 10.6 percent increase in deaths from COVID-19.","Persico, Claudia L; Johnson, Kathryn R",J Environ Econ Manage,,82

416853,All that covers does not protect!! Is an aerosol box safe enough?,2020,"COVID-19 has caused a global rush of universities to transfer their courses online to maintain continuity in student teaching and learning. The study presented in this article investigated the preparedness of academics in Small Island Developing State (SIDS) universities for shifting to emergency online teaching. To examine the impact of preparedness and other factors on the efficacy of academic staff in performing their work duties during the pandemic, the research team collected data from 75 respondents who filled in a questionnaire. In addition, they conducted semi-structured online interviews with a subsample of 5 respondents. They found that most academics had the necessary tools and infrastructure to teach online, including access to reasonably fast internet connections. However, many of them lacked adequate training in applying the use of technology to teaching, which limited their preparedness for developing e-learning activities. Thus, the study found that, insufficient competence in using educational technologies and inadequate university support impacted academics' work efficacy significantly. This impact was less pronounced for staff who had prior online teaching experience, which suggests that their pre-pandemic experiences lessened their dependence on support for online teaching when the sudden need arose. The authors' thematic analysis similarly found academics' uneven familiarity with technology and the need for more ""at-the-elbow"" technological support during crises to be significant, as well as a need for more leadership to deal with complex situations. Based on their findings, the authors conclude that greater preparedness for online teaching - and thus improved efficacy - might be achieved through a balanced mix of independent learning (by doing) on the part of academic staff and customised and targeted formal professional learning (through training provided by the university).","Seetal, Isma; Gunness, Sandhya; Teeroovengadum, Viraiyan",Int Rev Educ,,82

Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 0.6 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg nicotine for 28 days, and their hearts were isolated at end-point for assessment of myocardial susceptibility to I/R injury ex vivo. Rat heart mitochondria were also isolated from a subset of rats for analysis of mitochondrial ROS production and permeability transition. Compared to the vehicle controls, rat hearts isolated from nicotine-administered rats exhibited poorer left ventricular function that worsened over the course of I/R. Coronary flow rate was also severely impaired in the nicotine groups at baseline and this worsened after I/R. Nicotine administration significantly increased mitochondrial ROS production and permeability transition relative to the vehicle controls. Interestingly, pre-incubation of isolated mitochondria with ROS scavengers (superoxide dismutase and mitoTEMPO) significantly abolished nicotine-induced increase in mitochondria permeability transition in isolated rat heart mitochondria. Overall, our data showed that prolonged nicotine administration enhances myocardial susceptibility to I/R injury in rats and this is associated with mitochondrial-ROS-driven increase in mitochondrial permeability transition.","Ramalingam, Anand; Mohd Fauzi, Norsyahida; Budin, Siti Balkis; Zainalabidin, Satirah",Basic clin. pharmacol. toxicol,,82

Here, we analyzed fecal and saliva samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected and post COVID-19 patients and controls considering multiple influencing factors during hospitalization. Design16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on fecal and saliva samples from 108 COVID-19 and 22 post COVID-19 patients, 20 pneumonia controls and 26 asymptomatic controls. Patients were recruited over the first and second corona wave in Germany and detailed clinical parameters were considered. Serial samples per individual allowed intra-individual analysis. ResultsWe found the gut and oral microbiota to be altered depending on number and type of COVID-19-associated complications and disease severity. The occurrence of individual complications was correlated with low-risk (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausznitzii) and high-risk bacteria (e.g., Parabacteroides). We demonstrated that a stable gut bacterial composition was associated with a favorable disease progression. Based on gut microbial profiles, we identified a model to estimate mortality in COVID-19. ConclusionGut microbiota are associated with the occurrence of complications in COVID-19 and may thereby influencing disease severity. A stable gut microbial composition may contribute to a favorable disease progression and using bacterial signatures to estimate mortality could contribute to diagnostic approaches. Importantly, we highlight challenges in the analysis of microbial data in the context of hospitalization.","Schult, David; Reitmeier, Sandra; Koyumdzhieva, Plamena; Middelhof, Moritz; Erber, Johanna; Schneider, Jochen; Krager, Juliane; Frolova, Marina; Horstmann, Julia; Fricke, Lisa; Steiger, Katja; Jesinghaus, Moritz; Janssen, Klaus-Peter; Protzer, Ulrike; Neuhaus, Klaus; Schmid, Roland M; Haller, Dirk; Quante, Michael",,,82

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the number and the findings of outpatient visits in DTC subjects referred between March 11, 2020, and May 31, 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic at the Radiometabolic Unit of the University of Naples Federico II. Office visits scheduled in March and May 2020 were converted in teleconsultation reaching all patients planned for an in-ward access to advise them to use the TMS for all clinical necessity. The number and the findings of DTC patients evaluated by in-ward access in the corresponding period of 2019 were also assessed for direct comparison. RESULTS: The number of outpatient visits performed by TMS during the pandemic (n = 445) and by in-ward access in the corresponding period of 2019 (n = 525) was comparable with only 15% of outpatient evaluations missed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the utility of telemedicine tools to avoid the potential negative impact of interruption or postponement of diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures. Therefore, investments in medical network system development, including the implementation of telehealth approaches, should be encouraged at national and international levels.","Klain, Michele; Nappi, Carmela; Maurea, Simone; De Risi, Marina; Volpe, Fabio; Caiazzo, Elisa; Piscopo, Leandra; Manganelli, Mariarosaria; Schlumberger, Martin; Cuocolo, Alberto",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,82

439066,Flattening the Curve: Minimizing the Impact of COVID-19 on a Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Fellowship Training Program,2020,"Hypertension is the most prevalent health condition worldwide, affecting ~1 billion people. Gordon's syndrome is a form of secondary hypertension that can arise due to a number of possible mutations in key genes that encode proteins in a pathway containing the With No Lysine [K] (WNK) and its downstream target kinases, SPS/Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress responsive kinase 1 (OSR1). This pathway regulates the activity of the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC), which is responsible for NaCl reabsorption in the distal nephron. Therefore, mutations in genes encoding proteins that regulate the NCC proteins disrupt ion homeostasis and cause hypertension by increasing NaCl reabsorption. Thiazide diuretics are currently the main treatment option for Gordon's syndrome. However, they have a number of side effects, and chronic usage can lead to compensatory adaptations in the nephron that counteract their action. Therefore, recent research has focused on developing novel inhibitory molecules that inhibit components of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC pathway, thereby reducing NaCl reabsorption and restoring normal blood pressure. In this review we provide an overview of the currently reported molecular inhibitors of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC pathway and discuss their potential as treatment options for Gordon's syndrome.","Brown, Archie; Meor Azlan, Nur Farah; Wu, Zhijuan; Zhang, Jinwei",Acta pharmacol.

Two generalized estimating equations models were developed, and the results indicated that most sociodemographic factors contributing to severe household food insecurity during the pandemic were similar to those before the pandemic. However, having children enrolled in schools did not protect families from food insecurity during COVID-19. Furthermore, among previously food-secure households, those that were relatively disadvantaged transitioned into food insecurity during COVID-19. As the pandemic persists, more coordinated efforts to ensure all households with children receive adequate nutrition are desperately needed.","Morales, Danielle Xiaodan Morales Stephanie Alexandra Beltran Tyler Fox",Social Currents,,82

As the COVID-19 pandemic began to sweep across the US it elicited a wide spectrum of responses, both online and offline, across the population. Here, we analyze around 13 million geotagged tweets in 49 cities across the US from the first few months of the pandemic to assess regional dependence in online sentiments with respect to a few major COVID-19 related topics, and how these sentiments correlate with policy development and human mobility. In this study, we observe universal trends in overall and topic-based sentiments across cities over the time period studied. We also find that this online geolocalized emotion is significantly impacted by key COVID-19 policy events. However, there is significant variation in the emotional responses to these policies across the cities studied. Online emotional responses are also found to be a good indicator for predicting offline local mobility, while the correlations between these emotional responses and local cases and deaths are relatively weak. Our findings point to a feedback loop between policy development, public emotional responses, and local mobility, as well as provide new insights for integrating online and offline data for crisis management.","Feng, Shihui; Kirkley, Alec",Sci Rep,,82

We explored the inclusion of pregnant women in treatment trials of COVID-19 by reviewing ten international clinical trial registries at two timepoints in 2020. We identified 155 COVID-19 treatment studies of non-biological drugs for the April 7-10, 2020 timepoint, of which 124 (80%) specifically excluded pregnant women. The same registry search for the July 10-15, 2020 timepoint, yielded 722 treatment studies, of which 538 (75%) specifically excluded pregnant women. We then focused on studies that included at least one of six drugs (remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon beta, corticosteroids, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin) under evaluation for COVID-19. Of 176 such studies, 130 (74%) listed pregnancy as an exclusion criterion. Of 35 studies that evaluated high-dose vitamin treatment for COVID-19, 27 (77%) excluded pregnant women. Despite the surge in treatment studies for COVID-19, the proportion excluding pregnant women remains consistent.

To train and test our approach, we curate a new video-based dataset of 4,000 real-world Facebook news posts for analysis. Our multi-modal approach achieves 60.5% classification accuracy on random mismatches between caption and appearance, compared to accuracy below 50% for uni-modal models.

445942,Correction to: Inhaled nitric oxide in patients admitted to intensive care unit with COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased demand for mechanical ventilators and concerns of a ventilator shortage. Several groups have advocated for 1 ventilator to ventilate 2 or more patients in the event of such a shortage. However, differences in patient lung mechanics could make sharing a ventilator detrimental to both patients. Our previous study indicated failure to ventilate in 67% of simulations. The safety problems that must be solved include individual control of tidal volume (VT), individual measurement of VT, individualization of PEEP settings, and individual PEEP measurement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential solutions developed at our institution. METHODS: Two separate lung simulators were ventilated with a modified multiplex circuit using pressure control ventilation. Parameters of the lung models used for simulations (resistance and compliance) were evidence-based from published studies. Individual circuit-modification devices were first evaluated for accuracy. Devices were an adjustable flow diverter valve, a prototype dual volume display, a PEEP valve, and a disposable PEEP display. Then the full modified multiplex circuit was assessed by ventilating 6 pairs of simulated patients with different lung models and attempting to equalize ventilation. Ventilation was considered equalized when VT and end-expiratory lung volume were within 10% for each simulation. RESULTS: The adjustable flow diverter valve allowed volume adjustment to 1 patient without affecting the other. The average error of the dual volume display was -17%. The PEEP valves individualized PEEP, but the PEEP gauge error ranged from 17% to 41%. Using the multiplex circuit, ventilation was equalized regardless of differences in resistance or compliance, reversing the ""failure modes"" of our previous study. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this simulation-based study indicate that devices for individual control and display of VT and PEEP are effective in extending the usability and potential patient safety of multiplex ventilation.","Sorg, Morgan E; Branson, Richard D; Hatipoglu, Umur; Chatburn, Robert L",Respir Care,,82

STUDY DESIGN: We contacted non-pregnant patients at an urban, safety-net hospital-based primary care clinic who had been prescribed DMPA intramuscular (IM) in the past year to gauge interest in self-administered DMPA-SC. Interested patients received a prescription for DMPA-SC and a telehealth appointment with a clinic provider to learn self-injection. We recorded patient interest in DMPA-SC, completed appointments, and completed first injections. We conducted initial outreach in May, 2020 and recorded appointment attendance and completed injections through August, 2020. RESULTS: Of 90 eligible patients (age 17-54), we successfully contacted and discussed DMPA-SC with 70 (78%). Twenty-six (37%) patients expressed interest in DMPA-SC and scheduled telehealth appointments to learn to self-administer the medication. Fifteen (58%) of those interested (21% of the total) successfully self-injected DMPA-SC. Of the 44 (63%) patients not interested in DMPA-SC, the three most common reasons were fear of self-injection (n = 23 [52%]), wanting to stop DMPA (n = 11 [25%]), and satisfaction with DMPA-IM (n = 6 [14%]). CONCLUSION: There is interest in and successful initiation of self-administered DMPA-SC among patients at an urban safety net hospital-based primary care clinic who have used DMPA-IM in the last year. IMPLICATIONS: Our data provide evidence for the interest and successful first injection rate after offering self-administered DMPA-SC to patients on DMPA-IM. Expanding coverage of self-administered DMPA-SC could increase patient-centeredness and accessibility of contraception as well as reduce patient anxiety around COVID-19 transmission without losing contraceptive access.","Katz, Micah; Newmark, Rebecca L; Aronstam, Alison; O039,; Grady, Niamh; Strome, Sara; Rafie, Sally; Karlin, Jennifer",Contraception,,82

In this regard, this paper reports on findings of a project aimed at identifying factors influencing support for local, sustainable food production, and distribution systems. In the first phase, local residents and international students in Cape Breton, Canada, were surveyed prior to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to assess their attitudes and values relative to shopping at farmers markets and buying local. In the second phase, mid-pandemic, text mining of Twitter data was used to gauge sentiments related to these same activities. The results of our explanatory analysis suggest that the top two factors influencing decisions to buy local farm products were food attributes and supporting community economic development. In contrast to previous studies, we included an alternate sample group, namely, international students, and explored the relevance of the social aspect of buying local, e.g., meeting the farmer. Among our findings from the application of a logistics regression model to our survey data (N = 125) is the suggestion that the senior non-international student residents of the Cape Breton Island were more probable to be in the category of consumers whose perception of an authentic buy-local experience was limited to distribution channels that allowed for the social aspect of buying local, e.g., meeting the farmer.","Ashtab, Sahand Campbell Robert",Sustainability,,82

466465,The consequences of a year of the COVID-19 pandemic for the mental health of young adult twins in England and Wales,2021,"The pseudovirus strategy makes studies of highly pathogenic viruses feasible without the restriction of high-level biosafety facility, thus greatly contributing to virology and is used in the research studies of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated a dual-color pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 virus using a human immunodeficiency virus-1 pseudovirus production system and the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, of which the membrane was labeled with a lipophilic dye (DiO) and the genomic RNA-related viral protein R (Vpr) of the viral core was fused with mCherry. With this dual-color labeling strategy, not only the movement of the whole virus but also the fate of the labeled components can be traced. The pseudovirions were applied to track the viral entry at a single-particle level in four types of the human respiratory cells: nasal epithelial cells (HNEpC), pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC), bronchial epithelial cells (BEP-2D), and oral epithelial cells (HOEC). Pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 entered into the host cell and released the viral core into the cytoplasm, which clearly indicates that the host entry mainly occurred through endocytosis. The infection efficiency was found to be correlated with the expression of the known receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting 2 (ACE2) on the host cell surface. We believe that the dual-color fluorescently labeled pseudovirus system created in this study can be applied as a useful tool for many purposes in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.","Ma, Yingxin; Mao, Guobin; Wu, Guoqiang; Chen, Minghai; Qin, Fujun; Zheng, Luping; Zhang, Xian-En",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,82

467364,How likely are COVID-19 interventions to benefit the sickest patients?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic related to 1) levels of worry, risk perception, and social distancing; 2) longitudinal effects on wellbeing; and 3) effects of worry, risk perception, and social distancing on wellbeing. METHODS: We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of wellbeing over five years (2015-2020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n=1071, aged 60-71) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26-April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19. RESULTS: 1) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. 2) Wellbeing remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. 3) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four wellbeing measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher wellbeing. DISCUSSION: In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their wellbeing as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower wellbeing. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.","Kivi, Marie; Hansson, Isabelle; Bjälkebring, Pär",,,82

METHODS: This retrospective single-center study consecutively enrolled patients who presented with STEMI and scheduled for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) during the outbreak of COVID- 19. Due to the delay in the reporting of the PCR test results, our postprocedural triage regarding COVID-19, followed by the isolation strategy, was based on lung CT scan results. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with STEMI referred to our center. PPCI was done for 44 (91%) of these patients. The mean symptom-to-device time was 490.93 ± 454.608 minutes, and the mean FMC-to-device time was and 154.12 ± 36.27 minutes. Nine (18%) patients with STEMI were diagnosed as having typical/indeterminate features indicating COVID-19 involvement. During hospitalization, 1 (2.0%) patient died of cardiogenic shock. The study population was followed for 35.9 ± 12.7 days. Two patients expired in another centers due to COVID-19. No CCL staff members were infected by COVID-19 during the study period.

But little is known about the true frequency of DVT in patients who attend emergency department (ED) and are diagnosed with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics and outcomes of DVT in patients with COVID-19 attending the ED before hospitalization. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with DVT in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, case group) during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. We compared DVT-COVID-19 patients with COVID-19 without DVT patients (control group). Relative frequencies of DVT were estimated in COVID and non-COVID patients visiting the ED and annual standardized incidences were estimated for both populations. Sixty-three patient characteristics and four outcomes were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS: We identified 112 DVT in 74 814 patients with COVID-19 attending the ED [1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23-1.80]. This relative frequency was similar than that observed in non-COVID patients [2109/1 388 879; 1.52; 95% CI, 1.45-1.69; odds ratio (OR) = 0.98 [0.82-1.19]. Standardized incidence of DVT was higher in COVID patients (98,38 versus 42,93/100,000/year; OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 2.03-2.38). In COVID patients, the clinical characteristics associated with a higher risk of presenting DVT were older age and having a history of venous thromboembolism, recent surgery/immobilization and hypertension; chest pain and desaturation at ED arrival and some analytical disturbances were also more frequently seen, d-dimer >5000 ng/mL being the strongest. After adjustment for age and sex, hospitalization, ICU admission and prolonged hospitalization were more frequent in cases than controls, whereas mortality was similar (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.77-2.45). CONCLUSIONS: DVT was an unusual form of COVID presentation in COVID patients but was associated with a worse prognosis.","Jiménez, Sònia; Miró, Òscar; Llorens, Pere; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco J; Burillo-Putze, Guillermo; Piñera, Pascual; Martín, Alfonso; Alquézar, Aitor; García-Lamberechts, Eric J; Jacob, Javier; Grima, María L L; Millán, Javier; Molina, Francisca; Albero, Patricia B; Cardozo, Carlos; Mòdol, Josep M; Aguirre, Alfons; Gaya, Ruth; Adroher, María; Llauger, Lluís; Díaz, Juan J L; González, Nayra C; Aragües, Paula L; Gómez, Ana P; Del Castillo, Juan G",Eur J Emerg Med,,82
472376,"Early indicators of intensive care unit bed requirement during the COVID-19 epidemic: A retrospective study in Ile-de-France region, France",2020,"BACKGROUND: Almost a year after the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many hospitalized COVID-19 patients have recovered. However, little is known about the long-term follow-up (> 2 months) of discharged patients. METHODS: This study enrolled 527 discharged COVID-19 patients from 05 February to 11 March 2020. Basic characteristics, imaging features, nucleic acid detection results, and antibody levels of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 527 discharged patients, 32 (6.1%) had re-detectable positive (RP) nucleic acid results for SARS-CoV-2 during follow-up examinations, with 11 and four detections entailing stool samples and anal swabs, respectively, rather than respiratory samples. Juveniles were more susceptible to ""infection recurrence"" than other age groups, with shorter time spans for re-detectable positive (RP) RNA tests (an average of 8.8 days [6.0-9.0 days]), while the reverse was true for the middle-aged group (17.5 days on average [14.0-17.5 days]). Similar improvements in the imaging features of both RP and no RP (NRP) groups were observed. Negative antibody detections in patients at 3 and 6 months after discharge were 14.2% and 25.0%, respectively. Cases evidencing negative antibodies were more common among juvenile patients (40% vs. 15.6%, P=0.03) 6 months post-discharge. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 6.1% of 527 discharged patients showed RP status, which may be easier to be identified from stool samples than from other samples. Given the dropping rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, reinfection may happen, especially in juvenile patients (aged<18 years). These findings have implications for the long-term management of recovered COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Jintao; Xu, Jiawei; Zhou, Shengyu; Wang, Chunting; Wang, Ximing; Zhang, Wei; Ning, Kang; Pan, Yun; Liu, Tian; Zhao, Jiping; Dong, Liang",Int J Infect Dis,,82

The pandemic has adversely affected frontline health workers and patients, owing to poor preparedness. The study explored the triggers of mental health problems among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. An exploratory qualitative approach was utilised in the study. Forty individual semi-structured interviews were held with frontline healthcare workers. A thematic approach underpinned by some aspects of interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) and the Silences Framework (SF) was utilised. The research found that triggers of mental health problems among frontline health workers in private care homes and domiciliary care agencies are fear of infection and infecting others, lack of recognition/disparity between National Health Service (NHS) and social care, lack of guidance, unsafe hospital discharge, death and loss of professionals and residents, unreliable testing and delayed results and shortage of staff. It is important to support frontline workers in private care homes and domiciliary care agencies.","Nyashanu, Mathew; Pfende, Farai; Ekpenyong, Mandu S",Heal. soc. care community,,82

However, the economic and social costs of some of these measures, especially lockdowns, has been high. An alternative and widely discussed public health strategy for the COVID-19 pandemic would have been to 'shield' those most vulnerable to COVID-19, while allowing infection to spread among lower risk individuals with the aim of reaching herd immunity. Here we retrospectively explore the effectiveness of this strategy, showing that even under the unrealistic assumption of perfect shielding, hospitals would have been rapidly overwhelmed with many avoidable deaths among lower risk individuals. Crucially, even a small (20%) reduction in the effectiveness of shielding would have likely led to a large increase (>150%) in the number of deaths compared to perfect shielding. Our findings demonstrate that shielding the vulnerable while allowing infections to spread among the wider population would not have been a viable public health strategy for COVID-19, and is unlikely to be effective for future pandemics.","Smith, Cameron A.; Yates, Christian A.; Ashby, Ben",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07300v1.pdf,82

This paper through a multi-disciplinary dialogue between human geography and theology explores the interrelations between place, space and the spiritual. It identifies the bricolage mechanisms that were developed rapidly by churches to shift towards providing virtual church services. This was an uncommon practice by Christian denominations in the UK. COVID-19 changed the rules requiring new practices to emerge resulting in a new form of infrasecular space to emerge. Such rapid transformations through the provision of online services and virtual embeddedness blurred the lines between sacred and secular spaces. During virtual services, the minister’s home is temporally linked to the homes of congregants forming an intersacred space. Homes and spaces within homes are transformed into temporary sacred spaces.","Bryson, John R.; Andres, Lauren; Davies, Andrew",Tijdschr. Econ. Soc. Geogr.,,82

We aimed to determine the proportion IgG seronegative and predictors for seronegativity among persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We analyzed serologic data collected from health care workers and first responders in New York City and the Detroit metropolitan area with history of a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result and who were tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at least 2 weeks after symptom onset. RESULTS: Of 2,547 persons with previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 160 (6.3%) were seronegative. Of 2,112 previously symptomatic persons, the proportion seronegative slightly increased from 14 to 90 days post symptom onset (p=0.06). The proportion seronegative ranged from 0% among 79 persons previously hospitalized to 11.0% among 308 persons with asymptomatic infections. In a multivariable model, persons taking immunosuppressive medications were more likely to be seronegative (31.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7%-64.7%), while participants of non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (versus non-Hispanic White) (2.7%, 95% CI 1.5%-4.8%), with severe obesity (versus under/normal weight) (3.9%, 95% CI 1.7%-8.6%), or with more symptoms were less likely to be seronegative. CONCLUSIONS: In our population with previous RT-PCR confirmed infection, approximately one in 16 persons lacked IgG antibodies. Absence of antibodies varied independently by illness severity, race/ethnicity, obesity, and immunosuppressive drug therapy. The proportion seronegative remained relatively stable among persons tested up to 90 days post symptom onset.","Petersen, Lyle R; Sami, Samira; Vuong, Nga; Pathela, Preeti; Weiss, Don; Morgenthau, Beth Maldin; Henseler, Rebecca A; Daskalakis, Demetre C; Atas, Jenny; Patel, Anita; Lukacs, Susan; Mackey, Lisa; Grohskopf, Lisa A; Thornburg, Natalie; Akinbami, Lara J",Clin. infect. dis,,82
488413,Brain MRI Findings in Patients in the Intensive Care Unit with COVID-19 Infection,2020,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global crisis. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 requires the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme, a target of the antiviral drug remdesivir. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, both in the apo form at 2.8-angstrom resolution and in complex with a 50-base template-primer RNA and remdesivir at 2.5-angstrom resolution. The complex structure reveals that the partial double-stranded RNA template is inserted into the central channel of the RdRp, where remdesivir is covalently incorporated into the primer strand at the first replicated base pair, and terminates chain elongation. Our structures provide insights into the mechanism of viral RNA replication and a rational template for drug design to combat the viral infection.","Yin, Wanchao; Mao, Chunyou; Luan, Xiaodong; Shen, Dan-Dan; Shen, Qingya; Su, Haixia; Wang, Xiaoxi; Zhou, Fulai; Zhao, Wenfeng; Gao, Minqi; Chang, Shenghai; Xie, Yuan-Chao; Tian, Guanghui; Jiang, He-Wei; Tao, Sheng-Ce; Shen, Jingshan; Jiang, Yi; Jiang, Hualiang; Xu, Yechun; Zhang, Shuyang; Zhang, Yan; Xu, H Eric",Science,,82

SETTING: A 1,000-bed academic medical center in Northern Israel has faced two extreme challenges since 2006: operating under missile attack during the 2006 Second Lebanon War, and rapid establishment of a scalable infrastructure for COVID-19 patients. The first challenge led to construction of a dual-use facility: a parking lot during peacetime, and a fully functioning fortified underground emergency hospital (FUEH) in times of emergency. Several drills have confirmed readiness for various scenarios including conventional and unconventional warfare, and treating isolated patients during the Ebola and SARS threats. RESULTS: The hospital achieved preparedness for patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic, including all facilities and personnel, including infrastructure, laboratories, and innovations, to maintain standard patient care and separate COVID-19 treatment facilities. The hospital's second challenge represented by the COVID-19 pandemic led to adaptation of the FUEH as a key strategic facility in Northern Israel for treating hundreds of COVID-19 patients. Each solution was supported by innovations targeted for specific purposes and needs. CONCLUSIONS: The function and unique mechanisms used to leverage use of a dual facility was proven viable for several emergency conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Infrastructure and technological flexibility is essential when planning for handling different emergencies situations.","Halberthal, Michal; Berger, Gidon; Hussein, Khetam; Reisner, Shimon; Mekel, Michal; Horowitz, Netanel A; Shachor-Meyouhas, Yael; Geffen, Yuval; Hyams, Gila; Beyar, Rafael",Am J Disaster Med,,82

Virus neutralisation assays were performed using sera from ferrets which received two doses of the INO-4800 COVID-19 vaccine, and Australian virus isolates (VIC01, SA01 and VIC31) which either possess or lack this mutation but are otherwise comparable. Through this approach, supported by biomolecular modelling of this mutation and the commonly-associated P314L mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, we have shown that there is no experimental evidence to support this speculation. We additionally demonstrate that the putative elastase cleavage site introduced by the D614G mutation is unlikely to be accessible to proteases.","McAuley, Alexander J; Kuiper, Michael J; Durr, Peter A; Bruce, Matthew P; Barr, Jennifer; Todd, Shawn; Au, Gough G; Blasdell, Kim; Tachedjian, Mary; Lowther, Sue; Marsh, Glenn A; Edwards, Sarah; Poole, Timothy; Layton, Rachel; Riddell, Sarah-Jane; Drew, Trevor W; Druce, Julian D; Smith, Trevor R F; Broderick, Kate E; Vasan, S S",NPJ Vaccines,,82

513135,"Impact of comprehensive molecular testing to reduce antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia (RADICAP): a randomised, controlled, phase IV clinical trial protocol",2020,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage has been employed by several researchers as an alternative early warning indicator of virus spreading in communities, covering both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. A factor that can seriously mislead the quantitative measurement of viral copies in sewage is the adsorption of virus fragments onto the highly porous solids suspended in wastewater, making them inaccessible. This depends not only on the available amount of suspended solids, but also on the amount of other dissolved chemicals which may influence the capacity of adsorption. On this account, the present work develops a mathematical framework, at various degrees of spatial complexity, of a physicochemical model that rationalizes the quantitative measurements of total virus fragments in sewage as regards the adsorption of virus onto suspended solids and the effect of dissolved chemicals on it. The city of Thessaloniki in Greece is employed as a convenient case study to determine the values of model variables. The present data indicate the ratio of the specific absorption (UV254/DOC) over the dissolved oxygen (DO) as the parameter with the highest correlation with viral copies. This implies a strong effect on viral inaccessibility in sewage caused (i) by the presence of humic-like substances and (ii) by virus decay due to oxidation and metabolic activity of bacteria. The present results suggest days where many fold corrections in the measurement of viral copies should be applied. As a result, although the detected RNA load in June 2020 is similar to that in April 2020, virus shedding in the city is about 5 times lower in June than in April, in line with the very low SARS-CoV-2 incidence and hospital admissions for COVID-19 in Thessaloniki in June.","Petala, M; Dafou, D; Kostoglou, M; Karapantsios, Th; Kanata, E; Chatziefstathiou, A; Sakaveli, F; Kotoulas, K; Arsenakis, M; Roilides, E; Sklaviadis, T; Metallidis, S; Papa, A; Stylianidis, E; Papadopoulos, A; Papaioannou, N",Sci Total Environ,,82

516812,A case report of COVID-19 colitis and a sports medicine driven community outreach program that contributed to a successful outcome,2021,"BACKGROUND: Unavailability or saturation of the intensive care unit may be associated with the fatality of COVID-19. Prioritizing the patients for hospitalization and intensive care may be critical for reducing the fatality of COVID-19. This study aimed to develop and validate a new integer-based scoring system for predicting patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care, using only the predictors available upon triage. METHODS: This is a retrospective study using cohort data from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that included all admitted patients with COVID-19 between January 19 and June 3, 2020, in South Korea. The primary outcome was patients requiring intensive care defined as actual admission to the intensive care unit; at any time use of an extracorporeal life support device, mechanical ventilation, or vasopressors; and death. Patients admitted until March 20 were included for the training dataset to develop the prediction models and externally validated for the patients admitted afterward. Two logistic regression models were developed with different predictors and the predictive performance was compared: one with patient-provided variables and the other with added radiologic and laboratory variables. An integer-based scoring system was developed based on the developed logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 5193 patients were considered, with 4663 patients included after excluding patients with age under 18 or insufficient data. For the training dataset, 3238 patients were included. Of the included patients, 444 (9.5%) patients required intensive care. The model developed with only the clinical variables showed an area under the curve of 0.884 for the validation set. The performance did not differ when radiologic and laboratory variables were added. Seven variables were selected for developing an integer-based scoring system: age, sex, initial body temperature, dyspnea, hemoptysis, history of chronic kidney disease, and activities of daily living. The area under the curve of the scoring system was 0.880. CONCLUSIONS: An integer-based scoring system was developed for predicting patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care, with high performance. This system may aid decision support for prioritizing the patient for hospitalization and intensive care, particularly in a situation with limited medical resources.","Heo, JoonNyung; Han, Deokjae; Kim, Hyung-Jun; Kim, Daehyun; Lee, Yeon-Kyeng; Lim, Dosang; Hong, Sung Ok; Park, Mi-Jin; Ha, Beomman; Seog, Woong",J Intensive Care,,82

COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits, and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection. International cooperation is an important starting point, as heavily affected nations can serve as an example to find out ways to safely preserve health activity during pandemic.","Indini, Alice; Aschele, Carlo; Bruno, Daniele; Cavanna, Luigi; Clerico, Mario; Fiorentini, Giammaria; Fioretto, Luisa; Giordano, Monica; Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Ortega, Cinzia; Pinotti, Graziella; Scanni, Alberto; Zamagni, Claudio; Blasi, Livio; Grossi, Francesco",Eur J Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311643/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804920301659; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920301659?v=s5,82

Those whose families have undertaken intra- or intergenerational social mobility and who have made a home in a place, Ingleby Barwick in Teesside, that seems to be of them and for them—an in-between place that is seen as “not quite” middle or working class. This paper draws data from a research project that adopted a qualitative phenomenological approach to uncover the meaning of experiences for participants. Methods included focus groups and semi-structured interviews through which 70 local people contributed their thoughts, hopes, concerns, and stories about their lives now and what they aspire to for the future. Places, such as the large private housing estate in the Northeast of England on which this research was carried out, make up significant sections of the UK population, yet tend to be understudied populations, often missed by a sociological gaze attracted to extremes. It was anticipated that in Ingleby Barwick, where social mobility allows access to this relatively exclusive estate, notions of individualism and deservingness that underlie meritocratic ideology (Mendick et al., 2015; Littler, 2018) would be significant, a supposition borne out in the findings. “Making it” to Ingleby was, and continues to be, indicative to many of meritocratic success, making it “a moral place for moral people” (McEwan, 2019). Consequently, the threat then posed by economic precarity, of restricting access to the transitions and lifestyles that create the “distinction” (Bourdieu, 1984) required to denote fit to this place, is noted to be very real in a place ironically marked by many outside it as fundamentally unreal.","McEwan, Kathryn",Front Sociol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2020.534515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869480/,82
593633,Long-term outcome after intensive care for COVID-19: differences between men and women—a nationwide cohort study,2021-02-25,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Understanding of the fundamental processes underlying the versatile clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is incomplete without comprehension of how different immune cells are recruited to various compartments of virus-infected lungs, and how this recruitment differs among individuals with different levels of disease severity. As in other respiratory infections, leukocyte recruitment to the respiratory system in people with COVID-19 is orchestrated by specific leukocyte trafficking molecules, and when uncontrolled and excessive it results in various pathological complications, both in the lungs and in other organs. In the absence of experimental data from physiologically relevant animal models, our knowledge of the trafficking signals displayed by distinct vascular beds and epithelial cell layers in response to infection by SARS-CoV-2 is still incomplete. However, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus elicit partially conserved inflammatory responses in the different respiratory epithelial cells encountered early in infection and may trigger partially overlapping combinations of trafficking signals in nearby blood vessels. Here, we review the molecular signals orchestrating leukocyte trafficking to airway and lung compartments during primary pneumotropic influenza virus infections and discuss potential similarities to distinct courses of primary SARS-CoV-2 infections. We also discuss how an imbalance in vascular activation by leukocytes outside the airways and lungs may contribute to extrapulmonary inflammatory complications in subsets of patients with COVID-19. These multiple molecular pathways are potential targets for therapeutic interventions in patients with severe COVID-19.","Alon, Ronen; Sportiello, Mike; Kozlovski, Stav; Kumar, Ashwin; Reilly, Emma C.; Zarbock, Alexander; Garbi, Natalio; Topham, David J.",Nat Rev Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-00470-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33214719/,82

METHODS: With a two-stage cluster random sampling method, we surveyed 1,011 Chinese community-dwelling adults (38.8% men; 41.2 years old on average with an SD of 15.8) in June and July of 2020. RESULTS: Our psychometric evaluation results showed that the Chinese version of CAS and OCS retained their original one-dimensional structure and demonstrated measurement invariance across genders. In line with validation studies of the CAS and OCS in other languages, subsequent analyses also provided support to our Chinese version with respect to their satisfactory internal consistency (α = .87 and .73), respectively, and good concurrent validity (i.e., positive associations with negative feelings, excessive time-consumption, subjective distress, and functioning impairment). LIMITATIONS: Due to constraints of time and cross-sectional design, we only validated CAS and OCS among Chinese adults and did not evaluate their test-retest reliability nor predictive validity. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the practical benefits of understanding the source of mental symptoms during the pandemic, we recommend the use of CAS and OCS in Chinese communities to facilitate early identification and intervention for those who require clinical attention due to their COVID-19 related anxiety and obsessive thoughts.","CHEN, Juliet Honglei; TONG, Kwok Kit; SU, Xiaoyu; YU, Eilo Wing-yat; WU, Anise M.S.",J Affect Disord,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032721009095; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721009095?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.104,82

However, the infection spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and its comprehensive protein-level interactions with hosts remain unclear. There is a massive amount of under-utilized data and knowledge about RNA viruses highly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 and proteins of their hosts. More in-depth and more comprehensive analyses of that knowledge and data can shed new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 pandemic and reveal potential risks. In this work, we constructed a multi-layer virus-host interaction network to incorporate these data and knowledge. We developed a machine learning-based method to predict virus-host interactions at both protein and organism levels. Our approach revealed five potential infection targets of SARS-CoV-2 and 19 highly possible interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins in the innate immune pathway.","Du, Hangyu; Chen, Feng; Liu, Hongfu; Hong, Pengyu",Patterns (N Y),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100242; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921000623?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33817672/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666389921000623,82

METHODS: Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis of patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary oncologic center acquired over a 2-month period were reviewed independently by two readers and scored for new imaging abnormalities compared with a prior scan. CT scans were included if the study was performed between − 3 and 45 days from the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Clinical information was gathered from the medical records. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients (34 male, 29 female; mean age 60.6 years, range 24.4–85.0 years) were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Aside from new ground glass opacities seen at the lung bases (29/63, 46.0%), the most common findings were new thickening of the stomach, small bowel or colon or fluid-filled colon (14/63, 22.2%), new small volume ascites (7/63, 14.3%), gallbladder distention in those without prior cholecystectomy (3/43, 7.0%), and single cases each of acute pancreatitis (1/63, 1.6%) as well as new portal vein thrombosis (1/63, 1.6%). CONCLUSION: Aside from lung base ground glass opacities, the most common new imaging abnormality on abdominopelvic CT in patients with COVID-19 finding in our cohort was abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract, followed by small volume ascites, gallbladder distention, and isolated cases of pancreatitis and portal vein thrombosis. These findings overlap with those previously reported that did not have a prior scan for comparison, and provide supportive evidence that some of these findings may be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Taya, Michio; Paroder, Viktoriya; Redelman-Sidi, Gil; Gangai, Natalie; Golia Pernicka, Jennifer S.; Gollub, Marc J.; Javed-Tayyab, Sidra; Petkovska, Iva; Bates, David D.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 100 radiographs (50 [mean age 59.4 ± 17.3, range 22-87; 30 women] performed with the modified technique in April 2020, randomized with 50 [mean age 59 ± 21.6, range 19-100; 31 men] using the standard technique was completed by three thoracic radiologists to assess image quality. Radiation exposure estimates to patient and staff were calculated. A survey was created and sent to 32 x-ray technologists to assess their perceptions of the modified technique. Unpaired Ttests were used for numerical data. A P value < .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The entrance dose for a 50th percentile patient was the same between techniques, measuring 169 µGy. The measured technologist exposure from the modified technique assuming a 50th percentile patient and standing 6 feet to the side of the glass was 0.055 µGy, which was lower than standard technique technologist exposure of 0.088 µGy. Of the 100 portable chest radiographs evaluated by three reviewers, two reviewers rated all images as having diagnostic quality, while the other reviewer believed two of the standard images and one of the modified technique images were non-diagnostic. A total of 81% (26 of 32) of eligible technologists completed the survey. Results showed acceptance of the modified technique with the majority feeling safer and confirming conservation of PPE. Most technologists did not feel the modified technique was more difficult to perform. CONCLUSIONS: The studies acquired with the new technique remained diagnostic, patient radiation doses remained similar, and technologist dose exposure were decreased with modified positioning. Perceptions of the new modified technique by frontline staff were overwhelmingly positive.","Gange, Christopher P.; Pahade, Jay K.; Cortopassi, Isabel; Bader, Anna S.; Bokhari, Jamal; Hoerner, Matthew; Thomas, Kelly M.; Rubinowitz, Ami N.",Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33778645/; https://doi.org/10.1148/ryct.2020200420,82

Although this is vitally important, critical interventions that occur in the emergency department (ED) can have a profound impact on the individual patient and the healthcare system as a whole. Much has been written regarding care in large centers, but there has been little discussion regarding similar patients in community settings. Prior to the pandemic, large centers were able to accept patients that outstripped the resources in community hospital settings, but currently we foresee that many community centers will begin to manage more complex cases without referral. As physicians in a medium‐sized community academic center, we aim to enumerate community‐hospital‐relevant guidance for ED care that focuses on adherence to available evidence‐based medicine, including early aggressive supplemental oxygenation, awake proning, and methods to improve oxygenation and ultimately delay intubation as long as safely possible. Equally importantly, it was recognized early that adjustments to medication regimens (eg, sedation) and personal protective equipment (PPE) use must be made in the ED to conserve those same resources for long‐term use in inpatient units and improve the functionality of the hospital system as a whole. It is our hope that this article may serve as a framework for similar community‐based hospitals to create their own protocols to optimize resource utilization, staff safety, and patient care.","Hiller, Hugh M.; Taha, Sammy; Donham, Benjamin P.; Hackett, Anthony J.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33392544/; https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12251,82

The case described herein concerns a 16-year-old girl, with grade II obesity, without other known pathological antecedents or cardiac pathology diagnosis given an annual history of cardiological investigations. She was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The anamnesis showed that the cardiological investigations performed in the past were completed due to the medical history antecedents of her sister, who had been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, having undergone the placement of an ICD and a heart transplant. Numerous investigations were performed during hospitalization, which revealed high levels of high-sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), creatine kinase (CK) and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Dynamic electrocardiographic evaluations showed ventricular extrasystoles, without clinical manifestations. The patient presented stage 2 arterial hypertension (AHT) during hospitalization. A cardiac ultrasound was also performed, which revealed suspected mild subacute viral myocarditis with cardiomyopathy, and antihypertensive medication was initiated. A heart MRI was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, refuting the suspicion of viral subacute myocarditis. After discharge, as the patient developed gait disorders with an impossible heel strike upon walking and limitation of the extension of the arms and ankles, was hospitalized in the Neurology Department. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were dynamically performed, and because the rhythm disorders persisted, the patient was transferred to the Cardiology Department. On Holter monitoring, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) was detected, so antiarrhythmic treatment was initiated, and placement of an ICD was subsequently decided and was diagnosed with EDMD. Genetic tests were also performed, and a mutation of the lamin A/C gene was detected (LMNA gene exon 2, variant c448A > C (p.Thr150pro), heterozygous form, AD).","Dumitru, Irina Magdalena; Vlad, Nicoleta Dorina; Rugina, Sorin; Onofrei, Nicoleta; Gherca, Sabina; Raduna, Marian; Trana, Aurel; Dumitrascu, Mirela; Popovici, Elena; Bajdechi, Mircea; Zekra, Lucia; Cernat, Roxana Carmen",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356086/; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12071070,82

This epidemic, which has a high mortality rate, affects the health systems and the economies of countries significantly. Therefore, ending the epidemic is one of the most important priorities of all states. For this, automatic diagnosis and detection systems are very important to control the epidemic. In addition to the recommendation of the “reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)” test, additional diagnosis and detection systems are required. Hence, based on the fact that the COVID-19 virus attacks the lungs, automatic diagnosis and detection systems developed using X-ray and CT images come to the fore. In this study, a high-performance detection system was implemented with three different CNN (ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionResNetV2) models and X-ray images of three different classes (COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia). The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and ant colony algorithm (ACO) was applied among the feature selection methods, and their performances were compared. The results were obtained using support vector machines (SVM) and a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier using the 10-fold cross-validation method. The highest overall accuracy performance was 99.83% with the SVM algorithm without feature selection. The highest performance was achieved after the feature selection process with the SVM + PSO method as 99.86%. As a result, higher performance with less computational load has been achieved by realizing the feature selection.

Given the speed of research and development trajectories of AI-enabled applications in psychotherapy and the practice of mental healthcare, it is likely that therapeutic chatbots, avatars, and socially assistive devices will soon translate into clinical applications much more broadly. While AI applications offer many potential opportunities for psychotherapy, they also raise important ethical, social, and clinical questions that have not yet been adequately considered for clinical practice. In this article, we begin to address one of these considerations: the role of transference in the psychotherapeutic relationship. Drawing on Karen Barad’s conceptual approach to theorizing human–non-human relations, we show that the concept of transference is necessarily reconfigured within AI-human psychotherapeutic encounters. This has implications for understanding how AI-driven technologies introduce changes in the field of traditional psychotherapy and other forms of mental healthcare and how this may change clinical psychotherapeutic practice and AI development alike. As more AI-enabled apps and platforms for psychotherapy are developed, it becomes necessary to re-think AI-human interaction as more nuanced and richer than a simple exchange of information between human and nonhuman actors alone.","Holohan, Michael; Fiske, Amelia",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34646209/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.720476,82
606302,COVID‐19 highlights the need to optimize critical care resource use: The role of a respiratory‐led multidisciplinary team,2021-05-28,"On March 23 2020, the UK enacted an intensive, nationwide lockdown to mitigate transmission of COVID-19. As restrictions began to ease, more localized interventions were used to target resurgences in transmission. Understanding the spatial scale of networks of human interaction, and how these networks change over time, is critical to targeting interventions at the most at-risk areas without unnecessarily restricting areas at low risk of resurgence. We use detailed human mobility data aggregated from Facebook users to determine how the spatially-explicit network of movements changed before and during the lockdown period, in response to the easing of restrictions, and to the introduction of locally-targeted interventions. We also apply community detection techniques to the weighted, directed network of movements to identify geographically-explicit movement communities and measure the evolution of these community structures through time. We found that the mobility network became more sparse and the number of mobility communities decreased under the national lockdown, a change that disproportionately affected long distance connections central to the mobility network. We also found that the community structure of areas in which locally-targeted interventions were implemented following epidemic resurgence did not show reorganization of community structure but did show small decreases in indicators of travel outside of local areas. We propose that communities detected using Facebook or other mobility data be used to assess the impact of spatially-targeted restrictions and may inform policymakers about the spatial extent of human movement patterns in the UK. These data are available in near real-time, allowing quantification of changes in the distribution of the population across the UK, as well as changes in travel patterns to inform our understanding of the impact of geographically-targeted interventions.","Gibbs, Hamish; Nightingale, Emily; Liu, Yang; Cheshire, James; Danon, Leon; Smeeth, Liam; Pearson, Carl A.

607001,Ultrasound findings in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in early and late stages: Two case-reports,2020-05-04,"BACKGROUND: Many people use opioids and are at risk of overdose. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to counter the effects of opioid overdose. There is an increased availability of naloxone in New York City; however, many who use opioids decline no-cost naloxone even when offered. Others may have the medication but opt not to carry it and report that they would be reluctant to administer it if they were to witness an overdose. OBJECTIVE: We aim to better understand why people who use opioids may be reluctant to accept, carry, and administer naloxone, and to inform the development of messaging content that addresses barriers to its acceptance and use. METHODS: We conducted formative qualitative interviews with 20 people who use opioids who are 18 years and older in New York City. Participants were recruited via key informants and chain referral. RESULTS: Participants cited 4 main barriers that may impede rates of naloxone acceptance, possession, and use: (1) stigma related to substance use, (2) indifference toward overdose, (3) fear of negative consequences of carrying naloxone, and (4) fear of misrecognizing the need for naloxone. Participants also offered suggestions about messaging content to tackle the identified barriers, including messages designed to normalize naloxone possession and use, encourage shared responsibility for community health, and elicit empathy for people who use drugs. Taken together, participants’ narratives hold implications for the following potential messaging content: (1) naloxone is short-acting, and withdrawal sickness does not have to be long-lasting; (2) it is critical to accurately identify an opioid-involved overdose; (3) anyone can overdose; (4) naloxone cannot do harm; and (5) the prompt administration of the medication can help ensure that someone can enjoy another day. Finally, participants suggested that messaging should also debunk myths and stereotypes about people who use drugs more generally; people who use opioids who reverse overdoses should be framed as lay public health advocates and not just “others” to be managed with stigmatizing practices and language. CONCLUSIONS: It must be made a public health priority to get naloxone to people who use opioids who are best positioned to reverse an overdose, and to increase the likelihood that they will carry naloxone and use it when needed. Developing, tailoring, and deploying messages to address stigma, indifference toward overdose, fear and trepidation about reversing an overdose, and fear of police involvement may help alleviate fears among some people who are reluctant to obtain naloxone and use the medication on someone in an overdose situation.","Bennett, Alex S; Freeman, Robert; Des Jarlais, Don C; Aronson, Ian David",JMIR Form Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/22411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355094/,82

Nurses are particularly prone to stress because they directly care for individuals with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. The aims of this study were (a) to explore the association between the mental health promotion strategies used by nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak and their symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress; (b) to compare the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress of mental health nurses to those of non-mental health nurses; and (c) to compare the frequency of use of mental health strategies of mental health nurses to those of non-mental health nurses. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 821 nurses. Univariate and multivariate regression models were developed to identify potential protective factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. The chi-square test was also used to compare the use of strategies among mental health and non-mental health nurses. Portuguese nurses demonstrated high symptoms of depressive symptoms, stress, and anxiety. Healthy eating, physical activity, rest between shifts, maintaining social contacts, verbalizing feelings/emotions, and spending less time searching for information about COVID-19 were associated with better mental health. Mental health nurses had less depression, anxiety, and stress, and used more strategies to promote mental health than other nurses. We consider it important to promote nurses’ mental health literacy by encouraging them to develop skills and strategies aimed at improving their resilience and ability to deal with difficult situations while caring for the population.","de Pinho, Lara Guedes; Sampaio, Francisco; Sequeira, Carlos; Teixeira, Laetitia; Fonseca, César; Lopes, Manuel José",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33801740/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073490,82
607357,The ten reasons why corticosteroid therapy reduces mortality in severe COVID-19,2020-10-07,"Large-scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method—referred to as mixture-model approach—for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test’s ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods at exactly the low cumulative incidence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys.","Bouman, Judith A.; Riou, Julien; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian; Regoes, Roland R.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33635863/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008728,82
608083,Elderly adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit: A narrative review,2021-09-09,"Wheeze, a common symptom in pre-school children, is a continuous high-pitched sound, with a musical quality, emitting from the chest during expiration. A pragmatic clinical classification is episodic (viral) wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze. Diagnostic difficulties include other conditions that give rise to noisy breathing which could be misinterpreted as wheeze. Most preschool children with wheeze do not need rigorous investigations. Primary prevention is not possible but avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke exposure should be strongly encouraged. Bronchodilators provide symptomatic relief in acute wheezy episodes but the evidence for using oral steroids is conflicting for children presenting to the Emergency Department [ED]. Parent initiated oral steroid courses cannot be recommended. High dose inhaled corticosteroids [ICS] used intermittently are effective in children with frequent episodes of moderately severe episodic (viral) wheeze or multiple-trigger wheeze, but this associated with short term effects on growth and cannot be recommended as a routine. Maintenance treatment with low to moderate continuous ICS in pure episodic (viral) wheeze is ineffective. Whilst low to moderate dose regular ICS work in multi-trigger wheeze, the medication does not modify the natural history of the condition. Even if there is a successful trial of treatment with ICS, a break in treatment should be given to see if the symptoms have resolved or continuous therapy is still required. Maintenance as well as intermittent Montelukast has a role in both episodic and multi trigger wheeze. Good multidisciplinary support and education is essential in managing this common condition.","Bhatt, Jayesh M.; Smyth, Alan R.",Paediatr Respir Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172678/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054210000692; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054210000692; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prrv.2010.09.001,82
608191,Empowering Communication in Emergency Contexts: Reflections From the Italian Coronavirus Outbreak,2020-05-01,"To fight against the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the development of an effective and safe vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is required. As potential pandemic vaccines, DNA/RNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines and protein-based vaccines have been rapidly developed to prevent pandemic spread worldwide. In this study, we designed plasmid DNA vaccine targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S protein) as pandemic vaccine, and the humoral, cellular, and functional immune responses were characterized to support proceeding to initial human clinical trials. After intramuscular injection of DNA vaccine encoding S protein with alum adjuvant (three times at 2-week intervals), the humoral immunoreaction, as assessed by anti-S protein or anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody titers, and the cellular immunoreaction, as assessed by antigen-induced IFNγ expression, were up-regulated. In IgG subclass analysis, IgG2b was induced as the main subclass. Based on these analyses, DNA vaccine with alum adjuvant preferentially induced Th1-type T cell polarization. We confirmed the neutralizing action of DNA vaccine-induced antibodies via two different methods, a binding assay of RBD recombinant protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and pseudovirus assay. Further B cell epitope mapping analysis using a peptide array showed that most vaccine-induced antibodies recognized the S2 and RBD subunits, but not the S1 subunit. In conclusion, DNA vaccine targeting the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 might be an effective and safe approach to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hayashi, Hiroki; Sun, Jiao; Yanagida, Yuka; Otera, Takako; Kubota-Kotetsu, Ritsuko; Shioda, Tatsuo; Ono, Chikako; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Arase, Hisashi; Yoshida, Shota; Nakamaru, Ryo; Ide, Ryoko; Tenma, Akiko; Kawabata, Sotaro; Ehara, Takako; Sakaguchi, Makoto; Tomioka, Hideki; Shimamura, Munehisa; Okamoto, Sachiko; Amaishi, Yasunori; Chono, Hideto; Mineno, Junichi; Komatsuno, Takano; Saito, Yoshimi; Rakugi, Hiromi; Morishita, Ryuichi; Nakagami, Hironori",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.21.347799,82

METHODS: We reviewed the case records of patients admitted to the Persahabatan Hospital (RSP), Jakarta, Indonesia, with influenza A(H5N1) confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Twenty-two previously well patients, aged 3 to 47 years (median 24.5 years), were identified. All attended a clinic or hospital after a median of 2 days of illness (range 0–7). Times to first dose of oseltamivir (three died before receiving oseltamivir) were 2 to 12 days (median 7 days), administered mostly (n = 15) at RSP. Nineteen patients required mechanical ventilation. Deaths numbered 18 (case fatality = 82%) occurring within hours to 6 days of RSP admission, corresponding to 6 to 16 days of illness. Admission hyperglycemia (≥ 140 mg/dL), unrelated to steroids or known underlying diabetes mellitus, and elevated D-dimer levels (0.81–5.2 mg/L, upper limit of normal < 0.5 mg/L) were present in 14/21 (67%) and 20/21 (95%) patients, respectively. Fibrinogen concentrations were mostly low/normal at 129.9 to 517.9 mg/dL (median 241.1, normal 200–400 mg/dL), whereas C-reactive protein (9/11) and ferritin (6/8) levels were increased. Risk factors for death (univariate analysis) included: (1) increased D-dimers, (2) hyperglycema, (3) increased urea, (4) more extensive chest radiograph shadowing, and (5) lower admission oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and effective treatment of human influenza A(H5N1) infection remains challenging. Most patients were referred late with advanced disease. Oseltamivir had limited clinical impact. Elevated D-dimer levels, consistent with fibrinolysis, and hyperglycemia warrant more research to determine their underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment.","Soepandi, Priyanti Z.; Burhan, Erlina; Mangunnegoro, Hadiarto; Nawas, Arifin; Aditama, Tjandra Yoga; Partakusuma, Lia; Isbaniah, Fathiyah; Ikhsan, Mukhtar; Swidarmoko, Boedi; Sutiyoso, Agung; Malik, Suhud; Benamore, Rachel; Baird, J.

Of course there are signs of it, the scientists can predict, alarming speeches can be made. But there are always alarmist people around, maybe that is why sometimes even the most serious warnings may be not considered by the authorities on time. The first patients may be lost without a proper diagnosis. When everybody realizes that there may be a big problem in the horizon, sometimes it is too late. That is why it is very important to monitor contagious diseases and follow the warnings and releases of national and international disease control centers and other related organizations. China celebrated Lunar New Year with more than 40 thousand families on the 18 of January 2020. Nobody seem to be expecting this emerging new viral pneumonia outbreak appeared in Wuhan, in the last days of 2019, will break the chains and turn out to be a pandemic! But maybe this time it was not too late. There were four important pandemics within the last century: Spanish Flu, Hong Kong Flu, Asian Flu and Swine Flu. Each left different story behind. Millions of people had infected, hundreds, thousands of people died. This time, the Modern World had different tools to limit the SARS CoV2 outbreak. The national and international institutions of our globe were all communicating and taking precautions in a very fast manner than ever. However, this time, unexpectedly, the SARS-CoV-2 contagion was also faster. Besides the international organizations like WHO, UNESCO and UNICEF, the roles of local authorities, health ministries, disease control centers, health protection agencies, research centers and universities are all very important in different operational levels to control and survive from the pandemic.

At present, there are no effective treatments or vaccine for this disease, which constitutes a serious global health crisis. As the pandemic still spreading around the globe, it is of interest to use computational methods to identify potential inhibitors for the virus. The crystallographic structures of 3CLpro (PDB: 6LU7) and RdRp (PDB 6ML7) were used in virtual screening of 50000 chemical compounds obtained from the CAS Antiviral COVID19 database using 3D-similarity search and standard molecular docking followed by ranking and selection of compounds based on their binding affinity, computational techniques for the sake of details on the binding interactions, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity prediction; we report three 4-(morpholin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine derivatives; two compounds (2001083-68-5 and 2001083-69-6) with optimal binding features to the active site of the main protease and one compound (833463-19-7) with optimal binding features to the active site of the polymerase for further consideration to fight COVID-19. The structural stability and dynamics of lead compounds at the active site of 3CLpro and RdRp were examined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Essential dynamics demonstrated that the three complexes remain stable during simulation of 20 ns, which may be suitable candidates for further experimental analysis. As the identified leads share the same scaffold, they may serve as promising leads in the development of dual 3CLpro and RdRp inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

609906,Clinically significant anticardiolipin antibodies associated with COVID-19(),2020-05-29,"Detecting viral antigens at low concentrations in field samples can be crucial for early veterinary diagnostics. Proximity ligation assays (PLAs) in both solution and solid‐phase formats are widely used for high‐performance protein detection in medical research. However, the affinity reagents used, which are mainly poly‐ and monoclonal antibodies, play an important role in the performance of PLAs. Here, we have established the first homogeneous and solid‐phase proximity‐dependent DNA aptamer ligation assays for rapid and accurate detection of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). NDV is detected by a pair of extended DNA aptamers that, upon binding in proximity to proteins on the envelope of the virus, are joined by enzymatic ligation to form a unique amplicon that can be sensitively detected using real‐time PCR. The sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the assays were validated using 40 farm samples. The results demonstrated that the developed homogeneous and solid‐phase PLAs, which use NDV‐selective DNA aptamers, are more sensitive than the sandwich enzymatic‐linked aptamer assay (ELAA), and have a comparable sensitivity to real‐time reverse transcription PCR (rRT‐PCR) as the gold standard detection method. In addition, the solid‐phase PLA was shown to have a greater dynamic range with improved lower limit of detection, upper‐ and lower limit of quantification, and minimal detectable dose as compared with those of ELAA and rRT‐PCR. The specificity of PLA is shown to be concordant with rRT‐PCR.","Marnissi, Boutheina; Khalfaoui, Khouloud; Ebai, Tonge; Marques Souza de Oliveira, Felipe; Ghram, Abdeljelil; Kamali‐Moghaddam, Masood; Hmila, Issam",FEBS Open Bio,https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.13117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595202/,82

Coronaviruses possess the largest genomes (26.4 to 31.7 kb) among all known RNA viruses, with G + C contents varying from 32% to 43%. Phylogenetically, three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, with Betacoronavirus consisting of subgroups A, B, C were known to exist but now a new genus D also exists,namely the Deltacoronavirus. In such a situation, it becomes highly important for efficient classification of all virus data so that it helps us in suitable planning,containment and treatment. The objective of this paper is to classify SARS corona-virus nucleotide sequences based on parameters such as sequence length,percentage similarity between the sequence information,open and closed gaps in the sequence due to multiple mutations and many others.By doing this,we will be able to predict accurately the similarity of SARS CoV-2 virus with respect to other corona-viruses like the Wuhan corona-virus,the bat corona-virus and the pneumonia virus and would help us better understand about the taxonomy of the corona-virus family.

There is a belief among veterinary practitioners and even educational institutions that the vaccines made in Brazil against canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine adenovirus (CAV) are ineffective or only partially effective. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at comparing the immunity of two multivalent vaccines in adult dogs in the city of Uberlândia, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. METHODS: The study was carried out at the Animal Protection Association and a total of 60 adult mongrel dogs were selected and divided into two groups. Group A was immunized with two doses of Elevencell(®) vaccine and Group B received two doses of imported vaccine from the United States; each group was made up of 14 females and 14 males. RESULTS: In group A, the Elevencell vaccine generated a protective antibody titre against CDV in 26 out of 28 subjects (92.85%), CPV in 24 out of 28 subjects (85.71%) and CAV in 26 out of 28 subjects (92.85%). In group B, the imported US vaccine generated a protective antibody titre against CDV in 22 out of 28 subjects (78.57), CPV in 21 out of 28 subjects (75%) and CAV in 25 out of 28 subjects (89.28%). There was no statistical difference between titres generated between vaccine types for any of the three diseases tested.

The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to play a critical role in disease pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 not only activates antiviral immune responses, but can also cause uncontrolled inflammatory responses characterized by marked pro-inflammatory cytokine release in patients with severe COVID-19, leading to lymphopenia, lymphocyte dysfunction, and granulocyte and monocyte abnormalities. These SARS-CoV-2-induced immune abnormalities may lead to infections by microorganisms, septic shock, and severe multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, mechanisms underlying immune abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 must be elucidated to guide clinical management of the disease. Moreover, rational management of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which includes enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment.

According to phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome, replicase transcriptase complex, spike protein, partial S1 gene and M protein, B1648 strain clustered with the non-Massachusetts type strains NGA/A116E7/2006, UKr 27-11, QX-like ITA/90254/2005, QX-like CK/SWE/0658946/10, TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05. Based on the partial S1 fragment, B1648 clustered with the strains TN20/00, RF-27/99, RF/06/2007 and SLO/266/05 and, further designated as B1648 genotype. The full-length genome of B1648 shared the highest sequence homology with UKr 27-11, Gray, JMK, and NGA/A116E7/2006 (91.2% to 91.6%) and was least related with the reference Beaudette and Massachusetts strains (89.7%). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses indicated that B1648 strain may have played an important role in the evolution of IBV in Europe and North Africa. Further, the nephropathogenicity determinants might be located on the 1a, spike, M and accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b). Overall, strain B1648 is distinct from all the strains reported so far in Europe and other parts of the world.","Reddy, Vishwanatha R.A.P.; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Roukaerts, Inge D.M.; Zeller, Mark; Matthijnssens, Jelle; Nauwynck, Hans J.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26262637/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7082827,82
623732,Enhancing Sibling Presence in Pediatric ICU,2005-12-12,"BACKGROUND: The international healthcare response to COVID-19 has been driven by epidemiological data related to case numbers and case fatality rate. Second order effects have been less well studied. This study aimed to characterise the changes in emergency activity of a high-volume cardiac catheterisation centre and to cautiously model any excess indirect morbidity and mortality. METHOD: Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome fulfilling criteria for the heart attack centre (HAC) pathway at St. Bartholomew’s hospital, UK. Electronic data were collected for the study period March 16th – May 16th 2020 inclusive and stored on a dedicated research server. Standard governance procedures were observed in line with the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society audit. RESULTS: There was a 28% fall in the number of primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during the study period (111 vs. 154) and 36% fewer activations of the HAC pathway (312 vs. 485), compared to the same time period averaged across three preceding years. In the context of ‘missing STEMIs’, the excess harm attributable to COVID-19 could result in an absolute increase of 1.3% in mortality, 1.9% in nonfatal MI and 4.5% in recurrent ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: The emergency activity of a high-volume PCI centre was significantly reduced for STEMI during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19. Our data can be used as an exemplar to help future modelling within cardiovascular workstreams to refine aggregate estimates of the impact of COVID-19 and inform targeted policy action.","Chen, Yang; Rathod, Krishnaraj S.; Hamshere, Stephen; Choudry, Fizzah; Akhtar, Mohammed M.; Curtis, Miles; Amersey, Rajiv; Guttmann, Oliver; O'Mahony, Constantinos; Jain, Ajay; Wragg, Andrew; Baumbach, Andreas; Mathur, Anthony; Jones, Daniel A.",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcha.2021.100736; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352906721000245?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352906721000245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644297/,82

Given a draft genome, one first task is to determine its phylogenetic context, that is, to place it relative to the set of related reference genomes. We provide a new interactive graphical tool that addresses this task using Mash sketches to compare against all bacterial and archaeal representative genomes in the Genome Taxonomy Database taxonomy, all within the framework of SplitsTree5. The phylogenetic context of the query sequences is then displayed as a phylogenetic outline, a new type of phylogenetic network that is more general than a phylogenetic tree, but significantly less complex than other types of phylogenetic networks. We propose to use such networks, rather than trees, to represent phylogenetic context, because they can express uncertainty in the placement of taxa, whereas a tree must always commit to a specific branching pattern. We illustrate the new method using a number of draft genomes of different assembly quality.","Bagci, Caner; Bryant, David; Cetinkaya, Banu; Huson, Daniel H",Genome Biol Evol,https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evab213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34519776/,82

Research indicates that efforts to enhance resilience can contribute to meeting these objectives. We employed meta-analytical approach to examine evidence on resilience in community-living older adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We searched electronic databases until 13 January 2020 for observational studies investigating factors associated with resilience in this population. Articles had to provide quantitative data based on standardized assessment and include samples where mean participants' age and lower 95% confidence interval was >55 years. We included 49 studies reported in 43 articles and completed 38 independent meta-analysis, 27 for personal and 11 for contextual factors associated with resilience. RESULTS A range of personal and contextual factors were significantly associated with resilience, with effects sizes predominantly small to moderate (0.1<r˂0.49). Factors reflecting psychological and physical wellbeing and access to/quality of social support were associated with higher resilience. Factors indicative of poorer psychological wellbeing and social challenges were associated with lower resilience. Longitudinal evidence was limited. The level of between study heterogeneity was substantial to considerable. Where relevant analysis was possible, the identified publication bias was also considerable. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS The quality of the available evidence, as well as issues related to measurement of resilience, indicate the need for further work relative to its conceptualization and assessment. The presented findings have important clinical implications, particularly within the context of the COVID-19 impact on resilience in older adults.","Górska, Sylwia; Singh Roy, Anusua; Whitehall, Lucy; Irvine Fitzpatrick, Linda; Duffy, Nichola; Forsyth, Kirsty",The Gerontologist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346489/; https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnab110,82

One hundred and two patients diagnosed with critical SARS were admitted to hospitals of Shanxi Province, from March 7, 2003 to June 4, 2003. The patients were prospectively studied after admission to access their short term outcomes and the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes, defined as death. All the demographic and clinical characteristics were studied and univariate and multivariate Logistic regression were employed to access the risk factors. The results showed that of the 102 cases, 23 patients died, with a crude mortality rate of 22.5%. Multivariate Logistic regression revealed that age above 50 [odds ratio (OR) 1. 10, 95% confidence internal (CI) 1.03 to 1.16,P=0.004], lymphopenia at early stage (OR 14.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 11.97,P=0.01) were independently associated with mortality. On the other side, psychotherapy (OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06,P<0.001) was independently associated with aliveness. It was concluded that critical SARS is a new disease entity that carries significant mortality and morbidity.

628780,Global Distribution of Infectious Diseases Requiring Intensive Care,2006-08-05,"Background This study reports the accelerometer-based physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in hypertensive older adults. Methods Thirty-five hypertensive older adults were included in this observational study. Accelerometer-based PA and SB measures were assessed before (January to March 2020) and during (June 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. Linear mixed models were used to assess within-group changes in PA and SB measures, adjusted by accelerometer wear time. Results Before COVID-19 pandemic participants presented: 5809 steps/day (SE = 366), 303.1 min/day (SE = 11.9) of light PA, 15.5 min/day (SE = 2.2) of moderate-vigorous PA, and 653.0 min/day (SE = 12.6) of SB. During COVID-19 pandemic there was a decrease in steps/day (β = −886 steps/day, SE = 361, p = 0.018), in moderate-vigorous PA (β = −2.8 min/day, SE = 2.4, p = 0.018), and a trend in light PA (β = −26.6 min/day, SE = 13.4, p = 0.053). In addition, SB increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (β = 29.6 min/day, SE = 13.4, p = 0.032). The magnitude of changes was greater on the weekend, mainly for steps/day (β = −1739 steps/day, SE = 424, p < 0.001) and the SB pattern (more time spent in bouts of ≥10 and 30 min, less breaks/day and breaks/h). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic may elicit unhealthy changes in movement behavior in hypertensive older adults. Lower PA, higher and more prolonged SB on the weekend are the main features of the behavioral changes.","Browne, Rodrigo A.V.; Macêdo, Geovani A.D.; Cabral, Ludmila L.P.; Oliveira, Gledson T.A.; Vivas, Andres; Fontes, Eduardo B.; Elsangedy, Hassan M.; Costa, Eduardo C.",Exp Gerontol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2020.111121; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531556520304691?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132145/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0531556520304691,82

We prospectively examined immune cell populations in peripheral blood taken at baseline of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Len-dex) therapy and reviewed clinical and microbiology records in 90 patients with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM). Risk factors for infection were analyzed using logistic regression. During a median of 11 cycles of Len-dex treatment, 52 (57.8%) patients experienced at least 1 infection episode. Of a total of 92 episodes of infection, 58 (63%) episodes were clinically defined, 29 (31.5%) episodes were microbiologically defined, and 5 (5.4%) episodes were fever of unknown origin. Severe episodes were more frequently observed during the first 3 cycles. After adjusting for risk factors for infection based on univariate analyses, multivariate analyses showed that lower Hb (< 10 g/dL) was a clinically independent factor associated with occurrence of infections. Lower frequency (P = 0.044) and absolute count (P = 0.014) of circulating CD3(+)CD4(+)CD161(+) cells prior to Len-dex treatment were also associated with the occurrence of infection, especially during the first 3 cycles of Len-dex therapy. In addition to several clinical predictive factors, we found that CD3(+)CD4(+)CD161(+) cells may provide additional information for predicting the occurrence of infection in the early period of Len-dex therapy.

This cross‐cultural survey study examined the pushing (threat perception) and pulling (moral identity) factors that predicted prosocial acts and hoarding, and subsequently psychological well‐being. Data were collected from 9 April to 14 May 2020 from 251 participants in the United Kingdom (UK), 268 in the United States (US), 197 in Germany (DE), and 200 in Hong Kong (HK). Whereas threat perception was associated positively with both prosocial acts and hoarding, benevolent moral identity was associated positively with the former but not the latter behaviour. We also observed cross‐cultural differences, such that both effects were stronger in more individualistic (UK, US) countries than less individualistic (HK, DE) ones.

Our aim was to compare the change in the care delivered in a rheumatology nursing consultation before and during the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive and observational study. Patient care was registered before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. The variables collected were age, sex, prevalent rheumatic disease, type of visit and reason for consultation. RESULTS: 254 consecutive patients were included before the COVID-19 pandemic for 20 days and 251 patients during COVID-19 for 10 working days. The mean age was 61 years before and 57 during the pandemic. Of both groups, 74% were women. The most frequently attended pathologies before and during COVID-19 were rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathies. Scheduled face-to-face visits decreased during COVID-19 (46.5% versus 1.6%), with an increased number of phone scheduled visits (2.8% versus 52.2%) and spontaneous consultations either by phone or e-mail (28.3% versus 45%). The type of scheduled visits during COVID-19 were for stable diseases (20% versus 37%) and monitoring (12% versus 38%). The reason for spontaneous consultation increased during COVID-19 and were mainly doubts regarding prevention measures and treatment optimization (13.8% versus 31.1%).

This includes, for instance, varying the conditions of learning to allow for more active, effortful, or challenging, contexts. In the current paper, we introduce data that show that, on the contrary, learning to know when to take the easy road may be crucial when it comes to avoiding “laboring in vain.” We presented participants with prior problems – either easy or difficult – followed by choices of selecting an easy or a difficult current problem. Our primary goal was to examine the notion that past failures (which are more likely on the difficult prior items) may be a basis for allowing learners to then choose the easy rather than the difficult current problem. In other words, if one has labored in vain already, the easier items may now be more desirable. In addition, we compare the selections that are made between incremental and entity perspectives, given their fundamentally opposing views on effort. Our results showed that, interestingly, incremental theorists, who generally are proponents of effort, were more likely to select the easy problems, but only when they had experienced failure on prior, and similar, difficult tasks. We interpret these data to suggest that those holding an incremental view may be more in tune with their past efforts, resulting in a Metacognition-by-Experience, or ME strategy, and also hint at its generalizability through cross-cultural comparisons.

Advanced age, male gender, and the presence of comorbidities have emerged as risk factors for severe illness or death from COVID-19 in observation studies. Hypertension is one of the most common comorbidities in patients with COVID-19. Indeed, hypertension has been shown to be associated with increased risk for mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for intensive care unit admission, and disease progression in COVID-19 patients. However, up to the present time, the precise mechanisms of how hypertension may lead to the more severe manifestations of disease in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. This review aims to present the biological plausibility linking hypertension and higher risk for COVID-19 severity. Emphasis is given to the role of the renin-angiotensin system and its inhibitors, given the crucial role that this system plays in both viral transmissibility and the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension. We also describe the importance of the immune system, which is dysregulated in hypertension and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the potential involvement of the multifunctional enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), that, in addition to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), may contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 entrance into target cells.

Objective Identify and compare changes in T2DM outcomes prior to (August 2019 through February 2020) and during (March 2020 through October 2020) the COVID-19 PHE. Secondary objectives were to identify and compare pay-for-performance metrics and additional fee-for-service submitted in these patients. Methods This study examined changes in T2DM outcomes at one primary care office within a community health system. Pharmacists started regularly using Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) services during the COVID-19 PHE to reduce in-person visits. Patients with an initial A1C greater than or equal to 8% were included. Data collected included comorbidities, change in A1C, and diabetes and statin medication therapy adherence. Percentage of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) measures met, and billing code frequencies were also assessed. Results In the pre COVID-19 PHE group (N=30), the average three and six month A1C reductions were 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively, while the reductions were 2.0% and 2.2% in the during COVID-19 PHE group (N=61). The percentage of patients appropriately initiated or maintained on statins was 96.2% in the pre COVID-19 PHE group versus 82.6% in the during COVID-19 PHE group.

Unfortunately no treatment therapy or vaccine is yet available to counter the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which substantiates the need to expand research efforts in this direction. The indispensable function of the main protease in virus replication makes this enzyme a promising target for inhibitors screening and drug discovery to treat novel coronavirus infection. The recently concluded α-ketoamide ligand-bound X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) (PDB ID: 6Y2F) from Zhang et al. has revealed the potential inhibitor binding mechanism and the molecular determinants responsible for substrate binding. METHODS: For the study, we have targeted the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) for the screening of FDA approved antiviral drugs and carried out molecular docking based virtual screening. Further molecular dynamic simulation studies of the top three selected drugs carried out to investigated for their binding affinity and stability in the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) active site. The phylogenetic analysis was also performed to know the relatedness between the SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from different countries. RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals that the virus is closely related to the Bat-SL-CoV and does not exhibit any divergence at the genomic level. Molecular docking studies revealed that among the 77 drugs, screened top ten drugs shows good binding affinities, whereas the top three drugs: Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Tipranavir, and Raltegravir were undergone for molecular dynamics simulation studies for their conformational stability in the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) protein. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study among the library of FDA approved antiviral drugs, the top three inhibitors Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Tipranavir, and Raltegravir show the best molecular interaction with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. However, the in-vitro efficacy of the drug molecules screened in this study further needs to be corroborated by carrying out a biochemical and structural investigation.","Kumar, Yogesh; Singh, Harvijay; Patel, Chirag N.",J Infect Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32561274/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120305268?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120305268; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.016,82

Thus, the aim of this study was to establish a nomogram to detect COVID-19. METHODS: A nomogram was established using data collected from 457 patients (181 with COVID-19 and 276 with influenza A or B infection) at China. The nomogram used age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. RESULTS: Our nomogram predicted probabilities of COVID-19 with an AUROC of 0.913 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.883–0.937), greater than that of the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (0.849, 95%CI, 0.812–0.880; p = 0.0007), lymphocyte percentage (0.808, 95%CI, 0.768–0.843; p < 0.0001), monocyte count (0.780, 95%CI, 0.739–0.817; p < 0.0001), or age (0.656, 95%CI, 0.610–0.699; p < 0.0001). The predicted probability conformed to the real observation outcomes of COVID-19, according to the calibration curves. CONCLUSIONS: We found that age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count are risk factors for the early-stage prediction of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus. As such, our research provides a useful test for doctors to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza.","Wang, Linghang; Liu, Yao; Zhang, Ting; Jiang, Yuyong; Yang, Siyuan; Xu, Yanli; Song, Rui; Song, Meihua; Wang, Lin; Zhang, Wei; Han, Bing; Yang, Li; Fan, Ying; Cheng, Cheng; Wang, Jingjing; Xiang, Pan; Pu, Lin; Xiong, Haofeng; Li, Chuansheng; Zhang, Ming; Tan, Jianbo; Chen, Zhihai; Liu, Jingyuan; Wang, Xianbo",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32490031/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa169,82

Using a large dataset of genome-wide RNA-seq profiles derived from human dermal fibroblasts (GSE113957) we investigated whether age affects the expression of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) genes and ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Older age was associated with increased expression of PRR genes, ACE2 and four genes that encode proteins that have been shown to interact with SAR2-CoV-2 proteins. Assessment of PRR expression might provide a strategy for stratifying the risk of severe COVID-19 disease at both the individual and population levels.","Bickler, Stephen W.; Cauvi, David M.; Fisch, Kathleen M.; Prieto, James M.; Gaidry, Alicia D.; Thangarajah, Hariharan; Lazar, David; Ignacio, Romeo; Gerstmann, Dale R.; Ryan, Allen F.; Bickler, Philip E.; De Maio, Antonio",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.134403,82

The work presented herein focused on developing biodegradable, antiviral, and antibacterial cellulose nonwovens (AVAB-CNWs) as a multi-functional bioprotective layer for better protection against coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and addressing environmental concerns raised by the piling of COVID-19 related wastes. Both guanidine-based polymer and neomycin sulfate (NEO) were reactive-modified and covalently grafted onto the surface of cellulose nonwovens, thereby conferring outstanding antiviral and antibacterial activities to the nonwovens without deteriorating the microstructure and biodegradability. Through adjusting the grafting amount of active components and selecting appropriate reagents for pretreatment, the antimicrobial activity and hydrophobicity for self-cleaning of the nonwovens can be tuned. More importantly, we demonstrated for the first time that such multi-functional nonwovens are capable of inactivating SARS-CoV-2 instantly, leading to high virucidal activity (>99.35%), which is unachievable by conventional masks used nowadays. Meanwhile, the robust breathability and biodegradability of AVAB-CNWs were well maintained. The applications of the as-prepared nonwovens as high-performance textile can be readily extended to other areas in the fight against COVID-19.","Deng, Chao; Seidi, Farzad; Yong, Qiang; Jin, Xiangyu; Li, Chengcheng; Zhang, Xing; Han, Jingquan; Liu, Yuqian; Huang, Yang; Wang, Yuyan; Yuan, Zhenghong; Xiao, Huining",J Hazard Mater,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127391; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389421023591; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389421023591?v=s5,82

644304,What’s new in ECMO for COVID-19?,2020-11-12,"BACKGROUND: The first case of COVID‐19 in Israel was reported on February 21, 2020. Shaare Zedek (SZ), a 1000‐bed tertiary care medical centre in Jerusalem, Israel, cared for a significant number of these patients. While attention focused on COVID‐19 patients, uninfected patients were admitted to decreasing numbers of available internal medicine (IM) beds as IM departments were converted to COVID‐19 isolation wards. As a result of the increase in COVID‐19 patients, closure of IM wards, re‐assignment of staff and dynamic changes in available community placement options, we investigated the impact of the outbreak on IM patient not admitted for COVID‐19. METHODS: We reviewed IM admissions during March 15‐April 30, 2020 for patients without COVID‐19. Characteristics assessed included number of admissions, age, length of stay, mortality rate, number of discharges, number discharged home and functional status of the patients. Data were compared with the previous 3 years (2017‐2019) during the same time period. RESULTS: During March 15‐April 30, 2020 there were 409 patients admitted to IM compared with a mean of 557 over the previous 3 years. Fewer patients were admitted to the ED and the IM wards during the outbreak. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regards to gender, in‐hospital mortality rate, number discharged, number discharged home and patient functional level. Patients admitted during the outbreak to IM were younger (74.85 vs 76.86 years) and had a mean shorter hospital length of stay (5.12 vs 7.63 days) compared with the previous 3 years. CONCLUSION: While the characteristics of patients admitted to IM during the outbreak were similar, hospital length of stay was significantly shorter. Internal management processes, as well as patient preferences may have contributed to this observation. An infectious disease outbreak may have a significant effect on uninfected admitted patients.","Mendlovic, Joseph; Weiss, Gali; Da’as, Nael; Yinnon, Amos; Katz, David E.",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32738812/,82

However, in the context of a pandemic with a highly transmissible coronavirus, implementation of nutrition practice may be difficult. A multicenter electronic survey involving 62 dieticians was conducted, in order to understand barriers associated with dieticians’ adherence to nutrition guidelines for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. 69% of dieticians felt under stress when performing nutrition care, and 90% took supplements to boost their own immunity against the coronavirus. The concerns related to clinical practice included a lack of clear guidelines (74%), a lack of access to medical records (55%), inadequate experience or knowledge (48%), and a lack of self-efficacy/confidence (29%) in performing nutritional care. Half (52%) of the dieticians had performed nutrition education/counseling, 47% had monitored a patient’s body weight, and 76% had monitored a patient’s dietary intake. An adjusted linear regression showed that guideline adherence independently predicted the dieticians’ nutrition care behaviors of nutrition counselling (ß: 0.24 (0.002, 0.08); p = 0.04), and monitoring of body weight (ß: 0.43 (0.04, 0.11); p = 0.001) and dietary intake (ß: 0.47(0.03, 0.10); p = 0.001) of COVID-19 patients.

The large variations in case fatality ratio among different geographical regions suggests that the human susceptibility against this virus varies substantially. Several studies from different parts of the world showed a significant association of ABO blood group and COVID-19 susceptibility. It was shown that individuals with blood group O are at the lower risk of coronavirus infection. To establish the association of ABO blood group in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, we for the first time analysed SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies as well as blood groups among 509 random individuals from three major districts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh region of India. . Interestingly, we found neutralising antibodies in significantly higher percentage of people with blood group AB (0.36) followed by B (0.31), A (0.22) and lowest in people with blood group O (0.11). This indicates that people with blood group AB are at comparatively higher risk of infection than other blood groups. Further, in line to previous reports we too observed that people with blood group O have significantly decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, among the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with blood group AB has highest, whilst blood group O has lowest risk of infection.","Singh, P. P.; Srivastava, A. K.; Upadhyay, S.

653779,Cross-infection of Adenovirus among Medical Staff: A Warning from Intensive Care Unit in a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital in China,2020-07-02,"BACKGROUND: Costs of care are important to patients making cancer treatment decisions, but clinicians often do not feel prepared to discuss treatment costs. We aim to (1) assess the impact of a conversation-based decision aid (Option Grid) containing cost information about slow-growing prostate cancer management options, combined with urologic surgeon training, on the frequency and quality of patient-urologic surgeon cost conversations, and (2) examine the impact of the decision aid and surgeon training on decision quality. METHODS: We will conduct a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial in outpatient urology practices affiliated with a large academic medical center in the USA. We will randomize five urologic surgeons to four intervention sequences and enroll their patients with a first-time diagnosis of slow-growing prostate cancer independently at each period. Primary outcomes include frequency of cost conversations, initiator of cost conversations, and whether or not a referral is made to address costs. These outcomes will be collected by patient report (post-visit survey) and by observation (audio-recorded clinic visits) with consent. Other outcomes include the following: patient-reported decisional conflict post-visit and at 3-month follow-up, decision regret at 3-month follow-up, shared decision-making post-visit, communication post-visit, and financial toxicity post-visit and at 3-month follow-up; clinician-reported attitudes about shared decision-making before and after the study, and feasibility of sustained intervention use. We will use hierarchical regression analysis to assess patient-level outcomes, including urologic surgeon as a random effect to account for clustering of patient participants. DISCUSSION: This study evaluates a two-part intervention to improve cost discussions between urologic surgeons and patients when deciding how to manage slow-growing prostate cancer. Establishing the effectiveness of the strategy under study will allow for its replication in other clinical decision contexts. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT04397016.

653782,Rethinking the respiratory paradigm of COVID-19: a ‘hole’ in the argument,2020-06-02,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an economically important disease of poultry that also serve as model for the understanding of other coronaviruses associated diseases. IB is considered as a major challenge to the poultry industry worldwide as a result of its effect on egg production, weight gain as well as mortality. Different IBV genotypes continue to emerge, thus, the need for broad based vaccines to curb the disease. Based on bioinformatic data obtained in this study, sets of monovalent (either M41 or CR88) and bivalent DNA vaccines encoding the S1 glycoprotein from two different strains namely, M41 and CR88 were developed. The candidate vaccine was further encapsulated with a chitosan-saponin nanoparticle with the view to enhance its immunogenicity. Following in vitro characterization of the constructs, the vaccine candidates were tested in specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens. Analysis of humoral responses revealed a significant increase in anti-IBV antibody after immunization with the bivalent DNA plasmid (pBudCR88-S1/M41-S1). Likewise, cell mediated immune (CMI) response was significantly higher in vaccinated groups as compared to the unvaccinated chickens. Vaccinated chickens exhibited milder clinical signs as well as tracheal and kidney lesion scores following virus challenge as compared to the control groups. Additionally, encapsulation of the bivalent DNA vaccine with chitosan-saponin nanoparticles was found to improve protection against challenge with IBV strains M41 and CR88 as revealed by a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in oropharyngeal and cloacal virus sheddings following challenges with each of the two viruses. In contrast, monovalent IB-DNA vaccines were protective against homologous virus challenge. Moreover, nanoencasulation of the candidate vaccine was demostrated to abrogate the need for booster vaccination. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the immunogenic potentials of a bivalent IB-DNA vaccine and the use of chitosan-saponin nanoparticle to enhance its response. This development could serve as alternative strategy for the control of IB in poultry.","Bande, Faruku; Arshad, Siti Suri; Bejo, Mohd Hair; Omar, Abdul Rahman; Moeini, Hassan; Khadkodae, Saed; Wei, Tan Sheau; Keong, Yeap Swee; Abba, Yusuf; Anka, Ibrahim Abubakar",Microb Pathog,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401020309268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068733/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104560; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401020309268?v=s5,82

In Portugal, RSV cases are detected through the ISS using the European Union (EU) influenza-like illness (ILI) case definition. AIM: To investigate clinical predictors for RSV infection and how three case definitions (EU ILI, a modified EU acute respiratory infection, and one respiratory symptom) performed in detecting RSV infections in Portugal. METHODS: This observational retrospective study used epidemiological and laboratory surveillance data (October 2010–May 2018). Associations between clinical characteristics and RSV detection were analysed using logistic regression. Accuracy of case definitions was assessed through sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A 0.05 significance level was accepted. RESULTS: The study involved 6,523 persons, including 190 (2.9%) RSV cases. Among 183 cases with age information, RSV infection was significantly more frequent among individuals < 5 years (n = 23; 12.6%) and ≥ 65 years (n = 45; 24.6%) compared with other age groups (p < 0.0001). Cough (odds ratio (OR): 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2–6.5) was the best RSV-infection predictor considering all age groups, while shortness of breath was particularly associated with RSV-positivity among ≤ 14 year olds (OR: 6.7; 95% CI: 2.6–17.4 for 0–4 year olds and OR: 6.7; 95% CI: 1.5–28.8 for 5–14 year olds). Systemic symptoms were significantly associated with RSV-negative and influenza-positive cases. None of the case definitions were suitable to detect RSV infections (AUC = 0.51). CONCLUSION: To avoid underestimating the RSV disease burden, RSV surveillance within the Portuguese sentinel ISS would require a more sensitive case definition than ILI and, even a different case definition according to age.","Sáez-López, Emma; Pechirra, Pedro; Costa, Inês; Cristóvão, Paula; Conde, Patrícia; Machado, Ausenda; Rodrigues, Ana Paula; Guiomar, Raquel",Euro Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31718741/; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2019.24.45.1900140,82

A systematic review and meta analysis,2021-05-14,"The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a global health care crisis in recent times. Emerging research suggest an unanticipated impact of COVID-19 on mental and/or psychological health of both the general community and affected individuals. The fear of the COVID-19 epidemic and the consequent lockdown and economic crisis has led to globally increased psychological distress. The biological bases of immediate and new onset of psychiatric symptoms in individuals with COVID-19 are not yet known. COVID-19 infection may lead to activated immune-inflammatory pathways and cytokine storm. Activated immune-inflammatory pathways, especially chronic low-grade inflammation, are associated with major psychiatric disorders in at least a subset of individuals. We propose that both the (sub)chronic inflammatory response and cytokine storm might crucially be involved in the immediate manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with COVID-19 infection as well as heightened expression of psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 infected individuals with prior psychiatric conditions. These events might expand concepts in psychoneuroimmunology, with the importance of chronic-low grade inflammation augmented by the cytokine storm hypothesis. Additionally, this might augment and refine diagnosis and prognostic management as well as treatment.","Debnath, Monojit; Berk, Michael; Maes, Michael",Brain Behav Immun Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666354620300612; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100096; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354620300612?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566934/,82

In the current exploratory study, we introduce an information-selective symmetric reversal bandit task to model such situations and obtained choice data on this task from 24 participants. To arbitrate between different decision-making strategies that participants may use on this task, we developed a set of probabilistic agent-based behavioral models, including exploitative and explorative Bayesian agents, as well as heuristic control agents. Upon validating the model and parameter recovery properties of our model set and summarizing the participants’ choice data in a descriptive way, we used a maximum likelihood approach to evaluate the participants’ choice data from the perspective of our model set. In brief, we provide quantitative evidence that participants employ a belief state-based hybrid explorative-exploitative strategy on the information-selective symmetric reversal bandit task, lending further support to the finding that humans are guided by their subjective uncertainty when solving exploration-exploitation dilemmas.

The simplified model is a discrete time-invariant linear system that has cumulative infectious incidence, infected population, asymptomatic population, exposed population, and infectious pressure as the state variables. Since the system matrix of the model depends on a number of transition rates, structural properties of the model are investigated for suitable parameter ranges. It is concluded that the model becomes unobservable for some parameter values. Two contrasting approaches to the initial state estimation are considered. One is a version of Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother and another is based on solving a batch nonlinear optimization problem. The benefits and shortcomings of the considered estimation techniques are analyzed and compared.","Runvik, Håkan; Medvedev, Alexander; Eriksson, Robin; Engblom, Stefan",IFAC-PapersOnLine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896321003256; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405896321003256,82

We determined the levels of inflammatory cytokines in patients with COVID-19 and their relationships with ARDS and extrapulmonary MOD. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of 94 COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS were analyzed. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α]) were measured on days 1, 3, and 5 following admission. Seventeen healthy volunteers were recruited as controls. Correlations in the levels of inflammatory cytokines with clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed, furthermore, we also explored the relationships of different cytokines with ARDS and extrapulmonary MOD. RESULTS: The ARDS group had higher serum levels of all 4 inflammatory cytokines than the controls, and these levels steadily increased after admission. The ARDS group also had higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 than the non-ARDS group, and the levels of these cytokines correlated significantly with coagulation parameters and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The levels of IL-6 and TNF-α correlated with the levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen, and were also higher in ARDS patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). All 4 inflammatory cytokines had negative correlations with PaO(2)/FiO(2). IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α had positive correlations with the APACHE-II score. Relative to survivors, non-survivors had higher levels of IL-6 and IL-10 at admission, and increasing levels over time. CONCLUSIONS: The cytokine storm apparently contributed to the development of ARDS and extrapulmonary MOD in COVID-19 patients. The levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 correlated with DIC, and the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were associated with AKI. Relative to survivors, patients who died within 28 days had increased levels of IL-6 and IL-10.","Wang, Jiajia; Yang, Xinjing; Li, Yongsheng; Huang, Jian-an; Jiang, Junhong; Su, Nan",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-021-01588-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088317/,82

In the United States, hospitals with high readmission rates are subject to federal financial penalties. This concern calls for incentives for healthcare facilities to reduce their readmission rates by predicting patients who are at high risk of readmission. Conventional practices involve the use of rule-based assessment scores and traditional statistical methods, such as logistic regression, in developing risk prediction models. The recent advancements in machine learning driven by improved computing power and sophisticated algorithms have the potential to produce highly accurate predictions. However, the value of such models could be overrated. Meanwhile, the use of other flexible models that leverage simple algorithms offer great transparency in terms of feature interpretation, which is beneficial in clinical settings. This work presents an overview of the current trends in risk prediction models developed in the field of readmission. The various techniques adopted by researchers in recent years are described, and the topic of whether complex models outperform simple ones in readmission risk stratification is investigated.","Teo, Kareen; Yong, Ching Wai; Chuah, Joon Huang; Hum, Yan Chai; Tee, Yee Kai; Xia, Kaijian; Lai, Khin Wee",Arab J Sci Eng,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13369-021-06040-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422543/,82
668205,"COVID-19 in critical care: epidemiology of the first epidemic wave across England, Wales and Northern Ireland",2020-10-09,"Cells of all mammals recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a foreign material. In response, they release interferons (IFNs) and activate a ubiquitously expressed pseudokinase/endoribonuclease RNase L. RNase L executes regulated RNA decay and halts global translation. Here we developed a biosensor for 2’,5’-oligoadenylate (2-5A), the natural activator of RNase L. We found that 2-5A was acutely synthesized by cells in response to dsRNA sensing, which immediately triggered cellular RNA cleavage by RNase L and arrested host protein synthesis. However, translation-arrested cells still transcribed IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and secreted IFNs of types I and III (IFN-β and IFN-λ). Our data suggests that IFNs escape from the action of RNase L on translation. We propose that 2-5A/RNase L pathway serves to rapidly and accurately suppress basal protein synthesis, preserving privileged production of defense proteins of the innate immune system. RNase L is a mammalian enzyme that can stop global protein synthesis during interferon response. Cells must balance the need to make interferons (which are proteins) with the risk to lose cell-wide translation due to RNase L. This balance can most simply be achieved if RNase L was activated late in the interferon response. However, we show by engineering a biosensor for the RNase L pathway, that on the contrary, RNase L activation precedes interferon synthesis. Further, translation of interferons evades the action of RNase L. Our data suggest that RNase L facilitates a switch of protein synthesis from homeostasis to specific needs of innate immune signaling.","Chitrakar, Alisha; Rath, Sneha; Donovan, Jesse; Demarest, Kaitlin; Li, Yize; Sridhar, Raghavendra Rao; Weiss, Susan R.; Kotenko, Sergei V.; Wingreen, Ned S.; Korennykh, Alexei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/476341,82

As of July 9, 2020, Utah had reported 27,356 confirmed COVID-19 cases. To better understand how area-level deprivation might reinforce ethnic, racial, and workplace-based COVID-19 inequities (3), the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) analyzed confirmed cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), COVID-19 hospitalizations, and SARS-CoV-2 testing rates in relation to deprivation as measured by Utah's Health Improvement Index (HII) (4). Age-weighted odds ratios (weighted ORs) were calculated by weighting rates for four age groups (≤24, 25-44, 45-64, and ≥65 years) to a 2000 U.S. Census age-standardized population. Odds of infection increased with level of deprivation and were two times greater in high-deprivation areas (weighted OR = 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.99-2.17) and three times greater (weighted OR = 3.11; 95% CI = 2.98-3.24) in very high-deprivation areas, compared with those in very low-deprivation areas. Odds of hospitalization and testing also increased with deprivation, but to a lesser extent. Local jurisdictions should use measures of deprivation and other social determinants of health to enhance transmission reduction strategies (e.g., increasing availability and accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 testing and distributing prevention guidance) to areas with greatest need. These strategies might include increasing availability and accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 testing, contact tracing, isolation options, preventive care, disease management, and prevention guidance to facilities (e.g., clinics, community centers, and businesses) in areas with high levels of deprivation.","Lewis, Nathaniel M.; Friedrichs, Mike; Wagstaff, Shelly; Sage, Kylie; LaCross, Nathan; Bui, David; McCaffrey, Keegan; Barbeau, Bree; George, Andrea; Rose, Carolyn; Willardson, Sarah; Carter, Amy; Smoot, Christopher; Nakashima, Allyn; Dunn, Angela",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970656/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6938a4,82

Logistic regression was used to explore the association between an increase in substance use since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and exposure to cable news or social media together with COVID-19 knowledge, while controlling for covariates. Results: In the multivariable-adjusted models, participants with the highest exposure to social media (at least daily) and low knowledge of COVID-19 were 9.9 times more likely to experience an increase in substance use since the pandemic began (OR = 9.90, 95% CI = 4.27–23.06).

This survey study sought to identify practice changes, understand current personal protection equipment (PPE) use, and determine how caring for patients with COVID-19 differs for vascular surgeons practicing in states with high COVID-19 case numbers versus low case numbers. METHODS: A fourteen-question online survey regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons’ current practice was sent to 365 vascular surgeons across the country via REDCap from 4/14/2020 to 4/21/2020 with responses closed on 4/23/2020. The survey response was analyzed with descriptive statistics. Further analyses were performed to evaluate whether responses from states with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and California) differed from those with lower case numbers (all other states). RESULTS: A total of 121 vascular surgeon responded (30.6%) to the survey. All high-volume states were represented. The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE The majority of respondents worked in an academic setting (81.5%) and were performing only urgent and emergent cases (80.5%) during preparation for the surge. This did not differ between high case and low COVID case states (p=0.285). High case states were less likely to perform a lower extremity intervention for critical limb ischemia (60.8% vs. 77.5%, p=0.046), but otherwise case types did not differ. Most attendings work with residents (90.8%) and limited their exposure to procedures on suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases (56.0%). Thirty-eight percent of attendings have been redeployed within the hospital to a vascular access service, and/or other service outside of vascular surgery. This was more frequent in high case volume states compared to low case volume states (p=0.039). The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE (71.4%) and N95 masks (86.4%), and 21% of vascular surgeons feel that they do not have adequate PPE to perform clinical their duties. CONCLUSION: The initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced elective cases with primarily only urgent and emergent cases being performed. A minority of vascular surgeons have been redeployed outside of their specialty, however, this is more common among states with high case numbers. Adequate PPE remains an issue for almost a quarter of vascular surgeons who responded to this survey.","Latz, Christopher A.; Boitano, Laura T.; Png, C. Y.

Despite having marked physicochemical properties, Nbs are derived from camelids and may require “humanization” to improve translational potentials for clinical trials. Here we have systematically analyzed the sequence and structural properties of Nbs based on NGS (next-generation sequencing) databases and high-resolution structures. Our analysis reveals substantial framework diversities and underscores the key differences between Nbs and human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We identified conserved residues that may contribute to enhanced solubility, structural stability, and antigen-binding, providing insights into Nb humanization. Based on big data analysis, we developed “Llamanade”, a user-friendly, open-source to facilitate rational humanization of Nbs. Using Nb sequence as input, Llamanade provides information on the sequence features, model structures, and optimizes solutions to humanize Nbs. The full analysis for a given Nb takes less than a minute on a local computer. To demonstrate the robustness of this tool, we applied it to successfully humanize a cohort of structurally diverse and highly potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Nbs. Llamanade is freely available and will be easily accessible on a web server to support the development of a rapidly expanding repertoire of therapeutic Nbs into safe and effective trials.","Sang, Zhe; Xiang, Yufei; Bahar, Ivet; Shi, Yi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.03.455003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373858/,82

The Spanish experience,2020-09-08,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, a novel coronavirus strain. Some studies suggest that COVID‐19 could be an immune‐related disease, and failure of effective immune responses in initial stages of viral infection could contribute to systemic inflammation and tissue damage, leading to worse disease outcomes. T cells can act as a double‐edge sword with both pro‐ and anti‐roles in the progression of COVID‐19. Thus, better understanding of their roles in immune responses to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is crucial. T cells primarily react to the spike protein on the coronavirus to initiate antiviral immunity; however, T‐cell responses can be suboptimal, impaired or excessive in severe COVID‐19 patients. This review focuses on the multifaceted roles of T cells in COVID‐19 pathogenesis and rationalizes their significance in eliciting appropriate antiviral immune responses in COVID‐19 patients and unexposed individuals. In addition, we summarize the potential therapeutic approaches related to T cells to treat COVID‐19 patients. These include adoptive T‐cell therapies, vaccines activating T‐cell responses, recombinant cytokines, Th1 activators and Th17 blockers, and potential utilization of immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with anti‐inflammatory drugs to improve antiviral T‐cell responses against SARS‐CoV‐2.","Toor, Salman M.; Saleh, Reem; Sasidharan Nair, Varun; Taha, Rowaida Z.; Elkord, Eyad",Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935333/,82
688289,Adapting in the COVID-19 Era,2020-12-11,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences and lessons learnt by the study team and participants of the Workplace-based HIV self-testing among Men trial during the COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda. DESIGN: An explorative qualitative study comprising two virtual focus group discussions (FGDs) with 12 trial team members and 32 in-depth participant interviews (N=44). Data were collected via telephone calls for in-depth interviews or Zoom for FGDs and manually analysed by inductive content analysis. SETTING: Fourteen private security companies in two Uganda districts. PARTICIPANTS: Members of the clinical trial study team, and men working in private security companies who undertook workplace-based HIV testing. RESULTS: The key themes for participants experiences were: ‘challenges in accessing HIV treatment and care, and prevention services’, ‘misinformation’ and ‘difficulty participating in research activities’. The effects on HIV treatment and prevention resulted from; repercussions of the COVID-19 restrictions, participants fear of coinfection and negative experiences at health facilities. The difficulty in participating in research activities arose from: fear of infection with COVID-19 for the participants who tested HIV negative, transport difficulties, limited post-test psychosocial support and lack of support to initiate pre-exposure prophylaxis. The key study team reflections focused on the management of the clinical trial, effects of the local regulations and government policies and the need to adhere to ethical principles of research. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the need to organise different forms of HIV support for persons living with HIV during a pandemic. Additionally, the national research regulators and ethics committees or review boards are strongly urged to develop policies and guidelines for the continuity of research and clinical trials in the event of future shocks. Furthermore, this study calls on the appropriate government agencies to ensure public and researchers’ preparedness through continuing education and support.

688742,Role of Noninvasive Oxygen Therapy Strategies in COVID-19 Patients: Where are We Going?,2020-10-11,"Viral noncoding (nc) RNAs have been shown to play important roles in viral life cycle. Many viruses employ different mechanism to produce ncRNAs. Here, we report that coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces a novel ncRNA in virus-infected cells. This ncRNA consists of 563 nucleotides excluding a poly(A) tail, is mainly derived from the 3′-untranslated region of IBV genome, and contains a 63-nt-long of terminal leader sequence derived from the 5′ end of the viral genome. Using mutagenesis and reverse genetics, we reveal that this ncRNA is a subgenomic RNA generated by discontinuous transcription mechanism.","An, Hongliu; Cai, Zhichao; Yang, Yuying; Wang, Zhaoxiong; Liu, Ding Xiang; Fang, Shouguo",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221830391X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.12.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616206/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268221830391X,82
