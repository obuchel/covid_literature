Numerous studies have shown the significant roles of miRNAs in regulating immune cells including natural killer (NK) cells. However, little is known about the role of miRNAs in NK cells with aging. We previously demonstrated that the aged C57BL/6 mice have significantly decreased proportion of mature (CD27(−)CD11b(+)) NK cells compared with young mice, indicating impaired maturation of NK cells with aging. Here, we performed deep sequencing of CD27(+) NK cells from young and aged mice. Profiling of the miRNome (global miRNA expression levels) revealed that 49 miRNAs displayed a twofold or greater difference in expression between young and aged NK cells. Among these, 30 miRNAs were upregulated and 19 miRNAs were downregulated in the aged NK cells. We found that the expression level of miR‐l8la‐5p was increased with the maturation of NK cells, and significantly decreased in NK cells from the aged mice. Knockdown of miR‐181a‐5p inhibited NK cell development in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, miR‐181a‐5p is highly conserved in mice and human. MiR‐181a‐5p promoted the production of IFN‐γ and cytotoxicity in stimulated NK cells from both mice and human. Importantly, miR‐181a‐5p level markedly decreased in NK cells from PBMC of elderly people. Thus, our results demonstrated that the miRNAs profiles in NK cells change with aging, the decreased level of miR‐181a‐5p contributes to the defective NK cell development and function with aging. This opens new strategies to preserve or restore NK cell function in the elderly.","Lu, Jiao; Li, Shan; Li, Xiaopeng; Zhao, Wenming; Duan, Xuefeng; Gu, Xiuling; Xu, Jianqiao; Yu, Bolan; Sigal, Luis J.; Dong, Zhongjun; Xie, Lixin; Fang, Min",Aging Cell,679,4

Operationalizing this vision, which aims to support those who serve/have served and their families as they navigate life during and post-service, requires the support of service providers (SPs). Training SPs to deliver complementary resilience-training programs Reaching In… Reaching Out (RIRO; for adults working with parents of young children) and Bounce Back and Thrive! (BBT; for parents of children aged 0–8 years of age) may support this vision. Objective: To assess the appropriateness of RIRO/BBT trainer training for SPs, and RIRO and BBT resilience-training for military populations and families. Methods: This qualitative descriptive study involved the delivery of RIRO/BBT trainer training to SPs (n = 20), followed by focus groups (n = 6) with SPs and organisational leaders (n = 4). Focus groups were recorded, and data were transcribed and thematically-analysed. Results: Several themes emerged: (1) RIRO/BBT trainer training enabled SPs to model resilience and deliver the resilience-training programs, (2) training was appropriate and adaptable for the CAF and SMs/CMFs, and (3) training could support the development of resilient communities. Discussion: RIRO/BBT trainer training and RIRO and BBT resilience-training programs use a holistic, integrated, experiential, and community approach to resilience-building and align with CAF and VAC initiatives. Once contextualised, such programs could support resilience-building in the military context.","Mikolas, Cynthia; Winfield, Hope; Smith-MacDonald, Lorraine; Pike, Ashley; Jones, Chelsea; Lee, Melina; Griffiths, Jennifer; Perry, Ryan; Olson, David M.; Heber, Alexandra; Olson, Joanne; Sevigny, Phillip R.; Brémault-Phillips, Suzette",Front Public Health,679,4

We challenge this perspective by integrating person–environment fit and conservation of resources theories and providing an integrative model that examines how and when corporate volunteering climate produces positive and negative consequences for employees. Using a two‐wave time‐lagged study of 283 employees in 42 companies, our multilevel model shows that positive emotions mediate the relationship between corporate volunteering climate and work engagement, and perceived role overload mediates the relationship between corporate volunteering climate and work–family conflict. Employees’ communal orientation moderates the positive relationship between corporate volunteering climate and positive emotions, whereas competitive orientation moderates the positive relationship between corporate volunteering climate and perceived role overload. Communal orientation moderates the indirect effect between corporate volunteering climate and work engagement via positive emotions, but competitive orientation moderates the indirect effect between corporate volunteering climate and work–family conflict via perceived role overload. Our study provides balanced insights to help understand the benefits and costs of corporate volunteering climate in work and non‐work domains.","Zhang, Zhe; Wang, Juan; Jia, Ming",,679,4

Main funding source(s): Horizon 2020 European Commission Project H2020-MSCA-ITN-2016 BACKGROUND: Although the cardiac burden of COVID-19 has been demonstrated, follow-up imaging studies are scarce. The aim was to use speckle-tracking deformation imaging (STE) to prospectively assess cardiac function during intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalisation, comparing ventricular and atrial function of COVID-10 patients that died and those that were discharged. METHODS: In a single-centre, COVID-19 patients (n = 41) (71% male, aged 65 ± 11 years) were prospectively followed with echocardiography as part of ICU treatment. The left and right ventricles (LV, RV, respectively) were studied with STE in the 4-chamber cardiac view. The endpoint was defined as death or ICU discharge. Average values of the strain parameters from the first and final scans in the ICU, respectively, were calculated for the two outcome groups. RESULTS: Endpoint was not reached in 15% (n = 6) at the time of analysis. The remaining patients (n = 32) were 69% male, aged 66 (interquartile range (IQR) 60-72) years, and with an ICU mortality 26% (n = 9). The median spent in ICU was 24 (IQR 15-43) days. On average, echocardiography was performed three times during ICU hospitalisation, amounting to 103 examinations. The changes in cardiac strain are shown in Table 1. The change in LV longitudinal strain during ICU hospitalisation is shown in Figure 1. CONCLUSION: Worsening of LV strain and lack of improvement of RV strain is linked to higher mortality in the ICU. The assessment of cardiac function might contain prognostic information in COVID-19 patients that are admitted to the ICU.","Loncaric, F; Fernandes, JF; Sitges, M; Stessel, B; Dubois, J; Van Halem, K; Herbots, L; Bijnens, B",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,679,3

Fungal pathogens are responsible for a variety of conditions, including superficial diseases, allergic pathologies and potentially lethal invasive infections. Neutrophils and eosinophils have been implicated as effector cells in several pathologies. Neutrophils are major effector cells involved in the control of fungal infections and exhibit a plethora of antifungal mechanisms, such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, degranulation, extracellular vesicle formation, and DNA extracellular trap (ET) release. Eosinophils are polymorphonuclear cells classically implicated as effector cells in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases and helminthic infections, although their roles as immunomodulatory players in both innate and adaptive immunity are currently recognized. Eosinophils are also endowed with antifungal activities and are abundantly found in allergic conditions associated with fungal colonization and sensitization. Neutrophils and eosinophils have been demonstrated to release their nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in response to many pathogens and pro-inflammatory stimuli. ETs have been implicated in the killing and control of many pathogens, as well as in promoting inflammation and tissue damage. The formation of ETs by neutrophils and eosinophils has been described in response to pathogenic fungi. Here, we provide an overview of the mechanisms involved in the release of neutrophil and eosinophil ETs in response to fungal pathogens. General implications for understanding the formation of ETs and the roles of ETs in fungal infections are discussed.","Silva, Juliana da Costa; Thompson-Souza, Glaucia de Azevedo; Barroso, Marina Valente; Neves, Josiane Sabbadini; Figueiredo, Rodrigo Tinoco",Front Microbiol,679,3

Instrumental observations made by the Geophysical Monitoring Center (GMC) at the Institute of Geosphere Dynamics (IGD), Russian Academy of Sciences, show that the quarantine-related decrease in production activity caused significant changes in the amplitude and spectral characteristics of acoustic noise above the city, as compared to the long-term averages. During the quarantine period, the amplitude of the main spectral components and the average amplitude of acoustic noise decreased by more than two times. The diurnal variation of the amplitude of noise caused by production activities in the daytime was much less evident. Our findings can be useful in determining the characteristics of technogenic noise sources and assessing its contribution to the total acoustic noise level of the city.","Spivak, A. A.; Loktev, D.

These are often rounded in morphology and frequently bilateral, multilobar, posterior, peripheral, and basilar in distribution. The various atypical CT features of COVID-19 are seldom described in the literature. The study aims to enumerate the atypical pulmonary CT features in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in correlation with the disease severity. RESULTS: A total of 298 confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) who underwent chest CT scans were retrospectively evaluated. The cohort included 234 (78.5%) men and 64 (21.5%) women and the mean age was 53.48 ± 15.74 years. The most common presenting symptoms were fever [n = 197 (66.1%)] and cough [n = 139 (46.6%)]. Out of 298 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, 218 cases (73.1%) showed typical CT features while 63 cases (21.1%) showed atypical CT features with concurrent classical findings and the remaining 17 cases (5.8%) were normal. Among the atypical CT features, the most common was pulmonary cysts [n = 27 (9%)]. The other features in the order of frequency included pleural effusion [n = 17 (5.7%)], nodules [n = 13 (4.3%)], bull’s eye/target sign[n = 4 (1.3%)], cavitation [n = 3 (1.0%)], spontaneous pneumothorax [n = 2 (0.6%)], hilar lymphadenopathy [n = 2 (0.6%)], spontaneous pneumo-mediastinum with subcutaneous emphysema [n = 1 (0.3%)], Halo sign [n = 1 (0.3%)], empyema [n = 1 (0.3%)] and necrotizing pneumonia with abscess [n = 1 (0.3%)]. CONCLUSION: CT imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia while in a vast majority of cases is classical, atypical diverse patterns are also encountered. A comprehensive knowledge of various atypical presentations on imaging plays an important role in the early diagnosis and management of COVID-19.","Gurumurthy, Balasubramanian; Das, Sudha Kiran; Hiremath, Rudresh; Shetty, Sachin; Hiremath, Aniketh; Gowda, Thasmai",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,679,15

The trajectory of this point over time provides an alternative scale-free indication of the state of the outbreak. This technique offers an alternative to the mainstream epidemic curves that plot the number of cases against time and can reveal trends not easily detected in conventional data displays. Because it relies on relative proportions rather than absolute numbers of patients in different categories, this method is more robust to errors caused by low diagnosis and detection rates.

To uncover cellular protein responses in PCV2-infected PK-15 cells, the comprehensive proteome profiles were analyzed utilizing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF identification. Multiple comparisons of 2-DE revealed that the majority of changes in protein expression occurred at 48-96 h after PCV2 infection. A total of 34 host-encoded proteins, including 15 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated proteins, were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis. According to cellular function, the differential expression proteins could be sorted into several groups: cytoskeleton proteins, stress response, macromolecular biosynthesis, energy metabolism, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, signal transduction, gene regulation. Western blot analysis demonstrated the changes of alpha tubulin, beta actin, and cytokeratin 8 during infection. Colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation analyses confirmed that the cellular alpha tubulin interacts with the Cap protein of PCV2 in the infected PK-15 cells.

The extent to which this change in health news consumption practice impacts health knowledge is not known. This study investigates the relationship between most trusted information source and COVID-19 knowledge. METHODS A cross-sectional online survey was sent to a convenience sample from a list of adults on a central Pennsylvania health system's marketing database 25-31 March 2020. Respondents were grouped by their trusted news sources and comparison of respondent COVID-19 knowledge was made between these groups for 5948 respondents. RESULTS Those who selected government health websites as their most trusted source were more likely to answer COVID-19 questions correctly than those who selected other internet news sources or television news (OR 1.21, p < .05; 1.08, p > .05; and 0.87, p < .05, respectively). Those who used Facebook as an additional source of news in any way were less likely to answer COVID-19 questions correctly than those who did not (OR 0.93, p < .05).

Nevertheless, most of the work conducted so far has mainly focused on iPSC models from patients with familial AD (fAD), while actually sporadic AD (sAD) is more prevalent and represents over 90% of the AD cases in the population. The development of more sAD models is therefore key for studying this multifactorial disorder. In fact, probing the unique genomes of sAD patients and their interaction with AD-associated environmental factors could contribute to a better understanding of this disease. However, initial iPSC-based models for sAD have shown a high degree of variability and inconsistencies in terms of AD hallmarks. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies that have been conducted for sAD so far. In addition, we critically assess important sources of variability related to the model in addition to those that might be explained by the heterogeneous nature of sAD. These considerations might aid in developing more consistent iPSC models of sAD, which could help in developing a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.","Riemens, R J M; Kenis, G; van den Beucken, T",Neurobiology of learning and memory,679,16

METHODS A total of 21 patients underwent LSBA between 2000 and 2010 at our institution. Four patients had bilateral Cushing's syndrome (CS), two had bilateral pheochromocytoma, and one had a bilateral metastatic tumor. Eleven patients had unilateral or bilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), associated with CS or subclinical CS. Three patients had unilateral APA with contralateral non-functioning adenoma. Partial adrenalectomy was performed first by using with four ports. After the excision of one gland, the contralateral gland was removed after repositioning of the patient. RESULTS LSBA was completed in all 21 patients without major complications. Mean operative time was 329.7 min and the estimated blood loss was 94.1 mL. Mean tumor size was 21.8 mm. Of the 16 patients receiving an adrenal-sparing procedure, nine of 11 discontinued glucocorticoid replacement after 2 years.

Two independent scoping reviews have been carried out and subsequently compared. The intersectional approach revealed how gender, race, and class have a multiplicative effect on the denial of choice in birth position as a form of obstetric violence. This phenomenon exacerbates the pre-existing health disparities that disproportionately affect women, indigenous and racialized groups, and people living in poverty. Culturally competent, multilevel, and multidisciplinary interventions, strengthening of health systems, and community participation are essential to combat discrimination and guarantee birth rights.

Action Observation Treatment is effective in the rehabilitation of several neurological diseases. In this pilot study, we used Action Observation Treatment in a telerehabilitation setting in children with Cerebral Palsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten children with Cerebral Palsy, aged 5-12 years, entered the study. They followed the Action Observation Treatment rehabilitation program at home with remote supervision by a child neurologist located at the hospital. Outcome measures were the scores at the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function Scale and the Assisting Hand Assessment. RESULTS Scores obtained after treatment and at a two months' follow-up significantly differed from baseline and overlapped those obtained in randomized controlled studies carried out in a conventional setting. CONCLUSIONS Action Observation Treatment is therefore a promising approach that can be used on a large scale in a telerehabilitation setting. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Tele-rehabilitation has the potential to enhance early intervention service provision for children with Cerebral Palsy. Action Observation Treatment has the potential to become a routine approach in a telerehabilitation setting.","Molinaro, Anna; Micheletti, Serena; Pagani, Federica; Garofalo, Gioacchino; Galli, Jessica; Rossi, Andrea; Fazzi, Elisa; Buccino, Giovanni",Disability and rehabilitation,679,1

Closed suction (CS) minimizes lung volume loss during suction, and therefore, volumes are presumed to recover more quickly postsuctioning. Conflicting evidence exists regarding this. We examined the effects of open suction (OS) and CS on lung volume loss during suctioning, and recovery of end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) up to 30 minutes postsuction. MATERIAL AND METHODS Randomized crossover study examining 20 patients postcardiac surgery. CS and OS were performed in random order, 30 minutes apart. Lung impedance was measured during suction, and end-expiratory lung impedance was measured at baseline and postsuctioning using electrical impedance tomography. Oximetry, partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio and compliance were collected. RESULTS Reductions in lung impedance during suctioning were less for CS than for OS (mean difference, -905 impedance units; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1234 to -587; P < .001). However, at all points postsuctioning, EELV recovered more slowly after CS than after OS. There were no statistically significant differences in the other respiratory parameters. CONCLUSIONS Closed suctioning minimized lung volume loss during suctioning but, counterintuitively, resulted in slower recovery of EELV postsuction compared with OS. Therefore, the use of CS cannot be assumed to be protective of lung volumes postsuctioning. Consideration should be given to restoring EELV after either suction method via a recruitment maneuver.","Corley, Amanda; Spooner, Amy J; Barnett, Adrian G; Caruana, Lawrence R; Hammond, Naomi E; Fraser, John F",Journal of critical care,679,1

While the lungs are the major site of infection, the brain is also infected in some patients. Brain infection may result in long-term neurological sequelae, but little is known about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in this organ. We previously showed that the brain was a major target organ for infection in mice that are transgenic for the SARS-CoV receptor (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Herein, we use these mice to show that virus enters the brain primarily via the olfactory bulb, and infection results in rapid, transneuronal spread to connected areas of the brain. This extensive neuronal infection is the main cause of death because intracranial inoculation with low doses of virus results in a uniformly lethal disease even though little infection is detected in the lungs. Death of the animal likely results from dysfunction and/or death of infected neurons, especially those located in cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla. Remarkably, the virus induces minimal cellular infiltration in the brain. Our results show that neurons are a highly susceptible target for SARS-CoV and that only the absence of the host cell receptor prevents severe murine brain disease.","Netland, Jason; Meyerholz, David K; Moore, Steven; Cassell, Martin; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,679,26

Patients' demographics, hernia characteristics, operative time, conversion rate, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and recurrence were measured. Five patients had unilateral and 2 had bilateral hernias. RESULTS The mean operative time was 67 minutes (range: 36 to 111 min). None of the patients required any conversion to conventional TAPP. No intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded and no recurrences have been recorded to the present with a median follow-up of 6 months (range: 2 to 8 mo). CONCLUSIONS Single port TAPP hernia repair is safe and feasible.

RECENT FINDINGS Despite increased use of noninvasive ventilation, a large proportion of COPD patients still require invasive mechanical ventilation. Intubated COPD patients are at increased risk for VAP compared with patients without COPD. VAP is associated with increased mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation in these patients. Specific risk factors for VAP in this population include prolonged duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, high incidence of microaspiration and bacterial colonization, and altered local and general host defense mechanisms. Skeletal and diaphragmatic muscle weakness resulting from malnutrition, inflammation, and systemic corticosteroids is the main cause for prolonged mechanical ventilation. Increased risk for microaspiration of contaminated secretions is related to gastro-esophageal reflux, and altered interaction between breathing and deglutition. Defective mucociliary clearance contributes to a high incidence of respiratory tract colonization in these patients. Further, increasing evidence suggests that COPD is associated with immunosuppression promoting pulmonary infection. SUMMARY COPD is a risk factor for VAP. Future studies should focus on specific preventive measures in this population.","Rouzé, Anahita; Cottereau, Aurélie; Nseir, Saad",Current opinion in critical care,679,27

Methods: Twenty-one patients with known metastatic disease were staged with both conventional bone scanning and PSMA ligand scintigraphy within a time frame of less than 10 d. Imaging included planar whole-body scanning and SPECT or SPECT/CT with 2 bed positions 3 h after injection of either 500-750 MBq of 99mTc-MIP-1427 or 600-750 MBq of 99mTc-MDP. Lesions were scored as typical tumor, equivocal (benign/malignant), or normal within a standard reporting schema divided into defined anatomic regions. Masked and consensus readings were performed with sequential unmasking: planar scans first, then SPECT/CT, the best evaluable comparator (including MRI), PET/CT, and follow-up examinations. Results: Eleven patients had PSMA-positive visceral metastases that were predictably not diagnosed with conventional bone scanning. However, SPECT/CT was required to distinguish between soft-tissue uptake and overlapping bone. Four patients had extensive 99mTc-MDP-negative bone marrow lesions. Seven patients had superscan characteristics on bone scans; in contrast, the extent of red marrow involvement was more evident on PSMA scans. Only 3 patients had equivalent results on bone scans and PSMA scans. In 16 patients, more suspect lesions were detected with PSMA scanning than with bone scanning. In 2 patients (10%), a PSMA-negative tumor phenotype was present. Conclusion: PSMA scanning provided a clear advantage over bone scanning by reducing the number of equivocal findings in most patients. SPECT/CT was pivotal for differentiating bone metastases from extraosseous tumor lesions.","Rathke, Hendrik; Afshar-Oromieh, Ali; Giesel, Frederik Lars; Kremer, Christophe; Flechsig, Paul; Haufe, Sabine; Mier, Walter; Holland-Letz, Tim; De Bucourt, Maximilian; Armor, Thomas; Babich, John W; Haberkorn, Uwe; Kratochwil, Clemens","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",679,26

These two viruses belong to two distinct species of the Alphacoronavirus genus within Coronaviridae and induce similar clinical signs and pathological lesions in newborn piglets, but they are presumed to be antigenically distinct. In the present study, two-way antigenic cross-reactivity examinations between the prototype PEDV CV777 strain, three distinct U.S. PEDV strains (the original highly virulent PC22A, S indel Iowa106, and S 197del PC177), and two representative U.S. TGEV strains (Miller and Purdue) were conducted by cell culture immunofluorescent (CCIF) and viral neutralization (VN) assays. None of the pig TGEV antisera neutralized PEDV and vice versa. One-way cross-reactions were observed by CCIF between TGEV Miller hyperimmune pig antisera and all PEDV strains. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies and Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant PEDV and TGEV nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and sequence analysis suggested at least one epitope on the N-terminal region of PEDV/TGEV N protein that contributed to this cross-reactivity. Biologically, PEDV strain CV777 induced greater cell fusion in Vero cells than did U.S. PEDV strains. Consistent with the reported genetic differences, the results of CCIF and VN assays also revealed higher antigenic variation between PEDV CV777 and U.S. strains. IMPORTANCE Evidence of antigenic cross-reactivity between porcine enteric coronaviruses, PEDV and TGEV, in CCIF assays supports the idea that these two species are evolutionarily related, but they are distinct species defined by VN assays. Identification of PEDV- or TGEV-specific antigenic regions allows the development of more specific immunoassays for each virus. Antigenic and biologic variations between the prototype and current PEDV strains could explain, at least partially, the recurrence of PEDV epidemics. Information on the conserved antigenicity among PEDV strains is important for the development of PEDV vaccines to protect swine from current highly virulent PEDV infections.","Lin, Chun-Ming; Gao, Xiang; Oka, Tomoichiro; Vlasova, Anastasia N; Esseili, Malak A; Wang, Qiuhong; Saif, Linda J",Journal of virology,679,19

This study assessed trends in doctorates awarded in Anatomy and related fields within the United States (US) since 1969 and evaluated modern graduate education in the anatomical sciences. Data were compiled from the National Science Foundation Survey of Earned Doctorates. The total number of doctorates in the anatomical sciences and number of doctorates by sex and race/ethnicity were plotted for trend analysis. The number of PhD anatomy training programs within US medical schools was also assessed. Curricula and major characteristics of all active programs were evaluated through website searches and program director interviews.

This study aimed to assess the psychological impact—anxiety, stress, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)—among doctors working in COVID-19 wards and the underlying triggers in a public hospital in Karachi. Methods: Pre- and post-survey methodologies were adopted. Post-graduate trainees working in COVID-19 isolation facilities from April till September 2020 were interviewed before starting their one-month rotation and after completing it. The psychological impact was assessed using two standard instruments—Depression Anxiety and Stress 21 (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Data were entered and analyzed through SPSS version 22.0. Results: For 100 doctors, the mean score for stress, anxiety, stress, and depression on DASS-21 and PTSD on IES-R significantly increased after the rotation (p < 0.01). The mean score of depression and IES-R was higher in younger (<28 years) doctors (p ≤ 0.05). Married doctors scored higher on anxiety and IES-R (p ≤ 0.05). Doctors who were not willfully performing their duties scored worse on all measures of DASS-21 and IES-R (p < 0.01). Doctors facing family resistance scored significantly higher on stress, anxiety, and IES-R (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Working in COVID-19 facilities is imparting a negative impact on the psychological health of doctors. Healthcare administration should be aware of this psychological distress and should introduce mental health aid at administrative levels to prevent a mental health epidemic among care providers. © 2021 Weston Medical Publishing.

One of the ways to combat this disease is the effective screening of infected patients. However, COVID-19 provides a similar pattern with diseases, such as pneumonia, and can misguide even very well-trained physicians. In this sense, a chest X-ray (CXR) is an effective alternative due to its low cost, accessibility, and quick response. Thus, inspired by research on the use of CXR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, we investigate classical machine learning methods to assist in this task. The main goal of this work is to present a robust, lightweight, and fast technique for the automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images. We extracted radiomic features from CXR images and trained classical machine learning models for two different classification schemes: i) COVID-19 pneumonia vs. Normal ii) COVID-19 vs. Normal vs. Viral pneumonia. Several evaluation metrics were used and comparison with many studies is presented. Our experimental results are equivalent to the state-of-the-art for both classification schemes.

We suspect that the pandemic has magnified the challenges that some high school teachers already experience, particularly when they are the sole chemistry teacher at their school. The pandemic has likely inhibited collegial interactions and access to professional development (PD). Our reflections from redesigning a face-to-face PD program to one that is remotely delivered provide recommendations that advance PD accessibility and interactivity to mitigate isolation and other longstanding challenges teachers may face. In this article, we discuss how the cognitive learning model informed emergent teaching practices that guided the transformation of the PD's implementation for 20 high school chemistry teachers. Our reflections on the PD's strengths, areas for improvement, and insights alongside participant feedback provide enduring guidelines for fellow teacher educators. Specifically, we forward the importance of conceptualizing theory-informed design principles first, and then modifying the delivery with appropriate tools and technologies. As PD facilitators, we also draw attention to the necessity for flexibility. Remaining open to adaptation during implementation is crucial to advance teacher learning and engagement. We hope our process for how and why our PD program was redesigned will inspire future teacher educators to explore new, postpandemic ways of maximizing high-quality PD experiences.","Wu, Meng-Yang M.; Magnone, KatieMarie Tasker Roy Yezierski Ellen J.",Journal of Chemical Education,679,28

New lipids will be required, but also better understanding LNP interactions with the biological environment. Herein, we model protein corona formation on PEG-ylated DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs and identify time-dependent maturation steps that critically unlock their cellular uptake and mRNA delivery. Uptake requires active serum proteins and precedes after a significant (∼2 hours) lag-time, which we show can be eliminated by pre-incubating LNPs for 3-4 hours in serum-containing media. This indicates an important role of protein corona maturation for the pharmacokinetic effects of these LNPs. We show, using single-nanoparticle imaging, NMR diffusometry, SANS, and proteomics, that the LNPs, upon serum exposure, undergo rapid PEG-shedding (∼30 minutes), followed by a slower rearrangement of the adsorbed protein layer. The PEG-shedding coincides in time with high surface abundance of Apolipoprotein A-II, whereas the LNPs preferentially bind Apolipoprotein E when their maximum uptake-competent state is reached. Finally, we show that pre-incubation of the LNPs enables rapid uptake and allows pulse-chase video-microscopy colocalization experiments with sufficiently short pulse durations to gain improved mechanistic understanding of how intracellular trafficking events determine delivery efficacy, emphasizing early endosomes as important delivery-mediating compartments.","Gallud, A.; Munson, M.

A historical analytical perspective is impractical due to the lack of reliable climatic data for the earlier Games and the evolution of a myriad of factors that impinge on competitive performance at elite level. Nevertheless, the endurance running events, particularly the marathon, are considered in detail with respect to exposure to environmental forces. Heat, humidity, air pollution, altitude and the geographical features of the race course are considered selectively and dealt with in order of chronology and global climatic zones. We focus on diverse climate zones and particular environmental conditions in order to scrutinize their likely influences on competitive performance, especially in the Olympic marathon races. Notwithstanding the limitations of a narrative approach, performances are related to particular weather data and mitigating influences. Travel difficulties are addressed where these affected a majority of competitors. Environmental stress was associated with the ill-timing and poor organization of the earlier Games. While many of these detrimental and injurious features have been alleviated since then, other environmental stress factors are less prone to mitigation and thus remain a sometimes severe challenge to endurance races. The unique environment conditions for outdoor endurance races in temperate climate zones tend to be highly variable and therefore difficult to predict.","Peiser, Benny; Reilly, Thomas",Journal of sports sciences,679,1

STZ's known carcinogenic properties, however, raise concerns about its suitability for long-term studies. We conducted a formal study of STZ's carcinogenic effects in long-term surviving diabetic Wistar-Furth rats. To determine if insulin therapy or islet transplantation exacerbated tumorigenesis, rats were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups: normal animals with no treatment (Group 1, n=12); normal animals that underwent peritoneal implantation of porcine islets encapsulated in a double layer of agarose to form islet macrobeads (normal + islets; group 2, n=12); STZ treatment followed by daily exogenous insulin (STZ + insulin; group 3, n=18) and STZ treatment followed by the intraperitoneal implantation of porcine islet macrobeads (STZ + islets; group 4, n=14). At 215 days post-STZ induction, no renal proliferative lesions were observed in animals that did not receive STZ (group 1 and group 2) whereas adenoma incidences of 57% for group 3 and 34% for group 4 were observed. By terminal necropsy at day 351, the incidence and severity of renal proliferative lesions increased with tubular carcinoma observed in 67% of group 3 and 60% of group 4 animals. We conclude that the STZ-induced diabetic rat model is not suitable for long-term studies because of progressive renal tumorigenesis.

Super-resolution microscopic analysis showed that BDV assembled vSPOTs as intranuclear cage-like structures with 59-180-nm pores. The viral nucleoprotein formed the exoskeletons of vSPOTs, whereas the other viral proteins appeared to be mainly localized within these structures. In addition, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy revealed that filamentous structures resembling viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) appeared to protrude from the outer surfaces of the vSPOTs.

However, culture is labor-intensive, takes several days to weeks for growth, and can be very insensitive for the detection of some of these organisms. Newer singleplex PCR diagnostic tests are sensitive and specific, but multiple assays would be needed to detect all of the common pathogens. Therefore, we developed the Pneumoplex assays, a multiplex PCR-enzyme hybridization assay (the standard assay) and a multiplex real-time assay to detect the most common atypical pathogens in a single test. Primer and probe sequences were designed from conserved regions of specific genes for each of these organisms. The limits of detection were as follows: for Bordetella pertussis, 2 CFU/ml; for Legionella pneumophila (serotypes 1 to 15) and Legionella micdadei, 9 and 80 CFU/ml, respectively; for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 5 CFU/ml; and for Chlamydia (Chlamydophila) pneumoniae, 0.01 50% tissue culture infective doses. Recombinant DNA controls for each of these organisms were constructed, and the number of copies for each DNA control was calculated. The Pneumoplex could detect each DNA control down to 10 copies/ml. The analytical specificity demonstrated no cross-reactivity between 23 common respiratory pathogens. One hundred twenty-five clinical bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples tested by the standard assay demonstrated that the Pneumoplex yielded a sensitivity and a specificity of 100 and 98.5%, respectively.

The purposes of this elective are to provide fourth year medical students with an opportunity to observe and study the structure and functions of a health care delivery system in a third world country, to provide medical service, and to have a cross-cultural experience. The emphasis in this elective is on public health, preventive medicine and primary care. There are high levels of student competition for this elective. However, interest in it has been affected by world events such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the recent outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Asia. Recent annual applications for this elective have been twenty-five and more out of a class of two hundred students. Annual acceptance rates vary considerably, ranging from as low as 27.2% in 1995-1996 to a high of 81.8% in 1987-1988. Careful screening, including an examination of academic records and personal interviews, has resulted in the selection of highly mature, adaptable, and dedicated students who overall have performed well at overseas sites. Student rated satisfaction levels with this elective are extremely high, with most rating it the best experience of their medical school years. Students undergo extensive preparation prior to going overseas. This includes individual health and safety issues, travel and lodging, and the nature of the host country culture, health care system, and assignment site. Our students are especially experienced in cross-cultural understanding because of the unusual diversity of the patients they treat in Brooklyn, and the ethnic diversity of local hospital staff and the medical school class. This Brooklyn experience in cross-cultural understanding has been cited by many participants as having been the best preparation for functioning in a foreign culture. In the late 1990s, we revised our procedures concerning health preparations so as to address the risk of HIV/AIDS and other blood borne diseases. In addition, we also adopted an Agreement and Release form containing 15 provisions requiring risk and responsibility assumption on the part of the student participants. The Alumni Fund of the College of Medicine has steadfastly supported this elective with both a philosophical commitment and financial grants to help defray travel costs. In 1998, Joshua H.

The intact patella increases the leverage and efficiency of the extensor mechanism and articulates with the femoral trochlea. Patellar fractures can lead to stiffness, extension weakness, and patellofemoral arthritis. Nonsurgical management is indicated for nondisplaced fractures with an intact extensor mechanism. Surgical fixation is recommended for fractures that either disrupt the extensor mechanism or demonstrate >2 to 3 mm step-off and >1 to 4 mm of displacement. Anatomic reduction and fixation with a tension-band technique is associated with the best outcomes; however, symptomatic hardware is a frequent complication. Open fractures are associated with more complications than closed fractures. These complications can be mitigated with timely débridement, irrigation, and internal fixation.","Melvin, J Stuart; Mehta, Samir",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,679,8

In a previous report, this proteinase was shown to undergo rapid degradation in vitro in reticulocyte lysate due to a posttranslational event involving ubiquitination of the protein. Several lines of evidence presented here indicate that the proteinase itself is stable. Translation of the IBV sequence from nucleotide 8864 to 9787 resulted in the synthesis of a 33 kDa protein, representing the full-length 3C-like proteinase. Pulse-chase and time-course experiments showed that this protein was stable in reticulocyte lysate for up to 2 hours. However, a 45 kDa protein encoded by the IBV sequence from nucleotide 8693 to 9911 underwent rapid degradation in reticulocyte lysate, but was stable in wheat germ extract, suggesting that an ATP-dependent protein degradation pathway may be involved in the turnover of the 45 kDa protein. To identify the IBV sequence responsible for the instability of this 45 kDa protein species, the region from nucleotide 8693 to 9787 was translated both in vitro and in vivo, leading to the synthesis of a stable 43 kDa protein. These results suggest that a destabilising signal may be located in the IBV sequences between the nucleotides 9787 and 9911. Meanwhile, protein aggregation was observed when the product encoded by the IBV sequence from nucleotide 9911 to 10,510 was boiled for 5 minutes before being analysed in SDS-PAGE; when the same product was treated at 37 degrees C for 15 minutes, however, protein aggregation was not detected. Deletion studies indicate that the presence of a hydrophobic domain downstream of the 3C-like proteinase-encoding region may be the cause for the aggregation of the product encoded by this region of ORF 1a.","Ng, L F; Liu, D X",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,679,19

In a previous report, we showed that mutations in the RNA encoding an immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitope within the surface glycoprotein (epitope S-510-518) were present in all persistently infected animals and that these mutations abrogated recognition by virus-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in direct ex vivo cytotoxicity assays. To obtain further evidence that these mutations were necessary for the development of clinical disease, the temporal course of their appearance was determined. Mutations in the epitope were identified by 10 to 12 days after inoculation, and in some mice, virus containing mutated epitope was the dominant species detected by 15 days. In addition, most mice that remain asymptomatic at 80 days after inoculation, a time after which clinical disease almost never develops, were infected with only wild-type virus. Finally, analysis of virus isolated from mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) revealed the presence only of wild-type epitope S-510-518. These results, by showing that mutations are not selected in SCID mice and occur at early times after inoculation in C57BL/6 mice, support the view that they result from immune pressure and contribute to virus persistence and demyelination in mice infected persistently with MHV-JHM.","Pewe, L; Xue, S; Perlman, S",Journal of virology,679,4

Methods The study period was limited to the first 6 months of the pandemic and aimed to explore the responses by public health authorities, media, general population, and law makers during the initial phase of pandemic. Results Social disparity, underfunded pandemic preparation, and the initial failure to act appropriately have resulted in the rapid spread of infection in both countries. In the United States, prevailing social inequalities and racism, inaccessible health care, higher rates of preexisting medical conditions and disputed political leadership have further deteriorated the situation and enhanced public suffering, particularly for the black and Indigenous communities. In Canada, its poorly regulated services of long-term care facilities, initial restriction of testing and lack of access to epidemiological data have helped spread the infection and increased casualties in vulnerable populations. Conclusion Analysis of the pandemic responses of the United States and Canada has revealed how existing social disparity, underfunded pandemic preparation, and the initial failure to act appropriately have resulted in the rapid spread of infection.","Combden, Shianne Forward Anita Sarkar Atanu",The International Journal of Health Planning and Management,679,21

Whether EVLWi and PVPI are different between non-COVID-19 ARDS and the ARDS due to COVID-19 has never been reported. We aimed at comparing EVLWi, PVPI, respiratory mechanics and hemodynamics in patients with COVID-19 ARDS vs. ARDS of other origin. METHODS: Between March and October 2020, in an observational study conducted in intensive care units from three university hospitals, 60 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution were compared to the 60 consecutive non-COVID-19 ARDS admitted immediately before the COVID-19 outbreak between December 2018 and February 2020. RESULTS: Driving pressure was similar between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS, at baseline as well as during the study period. Compared to patients without COVID-19, those with COVID-19 exhibited higher EVLWi, both at the baseline (17 (14-21) vs. 15 (11-19) mL/kg, respectively, p = 0.03) and at the time of its maximal value (24 (18-27) vs. 21 (15-24) mL/kg, respectively, p = 0.01). Similar results were observed for PVPI. In COVID-19 patients, the worst ratio between arterial oxygen partial pressure over oxygen inspired fraction was lower (81 (70-109) vs. 100 (80-124) mmHg, respectively, p = 0.02) and prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were more frequently used than in patients without COVID-19. COVID-19 patients had lower maximal lactate level and maximal norepinephrine dose than patients without COVID-19. Day-60 mortality was similar between groups (57% vs. 65%, respectively, p = 0.45). The maximal value of EVLWi and PVPI remained independently associated with outcome in the whole cohort. CONCLUSION: Compared to ARDS patients without COVID-19, patients with COVID-19 had similar lung mechanics, but higher EVLWi and PVPI values from the beginning of the disease. This was associated with worse oxygenation and with more requirement of prone positioning and ECMO. This is compatible with the specific lung inflammation and severe diffuse alveolar damage related to COVID-19. By contrast, patients with COVID-19 had fewer hemodynamic derangement. Eventually, mortality was similar between groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER AND DATE OF REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04337983).

To date, there are no effective treatments for progressive deficits or disease-modifying therapy for those patients. We report encouraging results for spastic paraparesis after spinal cord stimulation. METHODS: A 51-year-old woman suffering from progressive weakness and spasticity in lower limbs related to hereditary spastic paraplegia type 4 underwent spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and experienced also significant improvement in motor function. Maximum ballistic voluntary isometric contraction test, continuous passive motion test and gait analysis using a motion-capture system were performed in ON and OFF SCS conditions. Neurophysiologic assessment consisted of obtaining motor evoked potentials in both conditions. RESULTS: Presurgical Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS) score was 26. One month after effective SCS was initiated, SPRS went down to 15. At 12 months follow up, she experienced substantial improvement in motor function and in gait performance, with SPRS scores 23 (OFF) and down to 20 (ON). There was an increased isometric muscle strength (knee extension, OFF: 41 N m; ON: 71 N m), lower knee extension and flexion torque values in continuous passive motion test (decrease in spastic tone) and improvement in gait (for example, step length increase). CONCLUSION: Despite being a case study, our findings suggest innovative lines of research for the treatment of spastic paraplegia.","Pinto de Souza, Carolina; Coelho, Daniel Boari; Campos, Débora da Silva Fragoso; Dos Santos Ghilardi, Maria Gabriela; de Oliveira Vicente, Edrin Claro; González-Salazar, Carelis; Junior, Marcondes Cavalcante França; Barsottini, Orlando Graziani Povoas; Pedroso, José Luiz; Fonoff, Erich Talamoni",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,679,15

One of the challenges in overcoming the influx of COVID-19 patients is controlling patient-to-staff transmission. Measuring the specific extent of ICU caregiver exposure to the virus and identifying the associated risk factors are, therefore, critical issues. We prospectively studied SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the staff of a hospital in Lyon, France, several weeks after a first epidemic wave. Risk factors for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were identified using a questionnaire survey. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence was 9% (87/971 subjects). Greater exposure was associated with higher seroprevalence, with a rate of 3.2% [95% CI 1.1-5.2%] among non-healthcare staff, 11.3% [8.9-13.7%] among all healthcare staff, and 16.3% [12.3-20.2%] among healthcare staff in COVID-19 units. The seroprevalence was dramatically lower (3.7% [1.0-6.7%]) in the COVID-19 ICU. Risk factors for seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-confirmed household (odds ratio (OR), 3.7 [1.8-7.4]), working in a COVID-19 unit (OR, 3.5 [2.2-5.7], and contact with a confirmed COVID-19 coworker (OR, 1.9 [1.2-3.1]). Conversely, working in the COVID-19-ICU was negatively associated with seropositivity (OR, 0.33 [0.15-0.73]). CONCLUSIONS: In this hospital, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was higher among staff than in the general population. Seropositivity rates were particularly high for staff in contact with COVID-19 patients, especially those in the emergency department and in the COVID-19 unit, but were much lower in ICU staff.

Biomechanical factors in the fusion segment may influence spinal fusion rates. There are no reports on the relationship between intervertebral union and the absorption of autografts or vertebral endplates. Therefore, the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the risk factors of nonunion after PLIF and identify preventive measures. METHODS: The authors analyzed 138 patients who underwent 1-level PLIF between 2016 and 2018 (75 males, 63 females; mean age 67 years; minimum follow-up period 12 months). Lumbar CT images obtained soon after the surgery and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up were examined for the mean total occupancy rate of the autograft, presence of a translucent zone between the autograft and endplate (more than 50% of vertebral diameter), cage subsidence, and screw loosening. Complete intervertebral union was defined as the presence of both upper and lower complete fusion in the center cage regions on coronal and sagittal CT slices at 12 months postoperatively. Patients were classified into either union or nonunion groups. RESULTS: Complete union after PLIF was observed in 62 patients (45%), while nonunion was observed in 76 patients (55%). The mean total occupancy rate of the autograft immediately after the surgery was higher in the union group than in the nonunion group (59% vs 53%; p = 0.046). At 12 months postoperatively, the total occupancy rate of the autograft had decreased by 5.4% in the union group and by 11.9% in the nonunion group (p = 0.020). A translucent zone between the autograft and endplate immediately after the surgery was observed in 14 and 38 patients (23% and 50%) in the union and nonunion groups, respectively (p = 0.001). The nonunion group had a significantly higher proportion of cases with cage subsidence and screw loosening at 12 months postoperatively in comparison to the union group (p = 0.010 and p = 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A lower occupancy rate of the autograft and the presence of a translucent zone between the autograft and endplate immediately after the surgery were associated with nonunion at 12 months after PLIF. It may be important to achieve sufficient contact between the autograft and endplate intraoperatively for osseous union enhancement and to avoid excessive absorption of the autograft. The achievement of complete intervertebral union may decrease the incidence of cage subsidence or screw loosening.","Ushirozako, Hiroki; Hasegawa, Tomohiko; Ebata, Shigeto; Ohba, Tetsuro; Oba, Hiroki; Mukaiyama, Keijiro; Shimizu, Satoshi; Yamato, Yu; Ide, Koichiro; Shibata, Yosuke; Ojima, Toshiyuki; Takahashi, Jun; Haro, Hirotaka; Matsuyama, Yukihiro",J Neurosurg Spine,679,16

Some 50 years after Brehm introduced the paradigm, Chen and Risen (2010) published an influential critique arguing that what the paradigm measures is not necessarily a choice-induced preference change, but possibly an artifact of the choice revealing existing preferences. They showed that once the artifact is experimentally controlled for, there is either no or very little evidence for choice-induced preference change. Given the prominence of the paradigm, this critique meant that much of what we thought we knew about the psychological process of cognitive dissonance might not be true. Following the critique, research using the paradigm applied various corrections to overcome the artifact. The present research examined whether choice truly changes preferences, or rather merely reflects them. We conducted a meta-analysis on 43 studies (N = 2,191), all using an artifact-free free-choice paradigm. Using different meta-analytical methods, and conceptually different analyses, including a Bayesian one, we found an overall effect size of Cohen's d = 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.32, 0.49]. Furthermore, we found no evidence for publication bias as an alternative explanation for the choice-induced preference change effect. These results support the existence of true preference change created by choice.

These factors depend on the activities and facial features of the mask wearer so that the mask performance for real-world applications is difficult to predict. The present work shows how protection factor, a quantity often used to describe mask performance, can be estimated without involving human volunteers. By constraining these factors to known values, mask protection factors can be compared fairly and efficiently following a series of filtration efficiency measurements performed in the laboratory. Protection factors and mask emissions for exhalation and inhalation were evaluated for masks of seven types currently in use around the world and for a hypothetical mask with 99% efficiency on all particles. The performance of reusable masks made from cotton fabric was limited by the size of the native cotton fibers. Masks that utilized finer fibers, particularly electret fibers with relatively small diameters, showed excellent performance with moderate flow resistance.

In addition to the field of Business and Economics, we take into account the following disciplines: Through the lens of Computer Science and Information Systems, the information accessible to individuals is central, whereby the way information spreads in a society is strongly affected by the employed algorithms for information provision and by personalization. From the perspective of Linguistics, specific language signals in communication which emerge during pandemics have to be taken into account (e.g., emotion-related words, avoiding causal terms). Considering linguistic patterns in the context of infodemics appears to be highly relevant as they strongly affect how information is interpreted, fact-checked, made sense of by non-expert persons, and the way misinformation is automatically detected. From a Cognitive Psychology point of view, the focus is on how motives, intuition and affect influence the search and evaluation of information, and on how cognitive processes, the digital information environment and linguistic patterns together shape individuals' understanding of critical events, risk perception and behavior. The perspective of Business and Economics allows for integrating these perspectives into the wider context of economic systems (e.g., organizations or the society).","Leitner, Stephan; Gula, Bartosz; Jannach, Dietmar; Krieg-Holz, Ulrike; Wall, Friederike",,679,26

Approach: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online for understanding skin injuries among medical staff fighting COVID-19 in February 8-22, 2020. Participants voluntarily answered and submitted the questionnaire with cell phone. The questionnaire items included demographic data, grade of PPE and daily wearing time, skin injury types, anatomical sites, and preventive measures.

The study objective was to examine the published literature related to paramedicine and pandemics. Methods A rapid review of research derived from an existing broad database of literature generated between 2006 and 2019 was used. We conducted a targeted secondary search of this database to identify studies of pandemics in paramedicine contexts and included three levels of screening. We used content analysis to identify broad themes and subthemes, and provide summaries and descriptions of each. Results From 54,638 citations, our search identified 24 citations representing eight countries. The most common method of enquiry was cross-sectional survey (n=10). Five broad themes (and 15 subthemes) were identified: general planning and preparedness (impact to paramedic service operations, roles and responsibilities, communication centre preparedness, paramedic service preparedness, training); workforce (availability of personal protective equipment, safety of family, perception of risk, trust in the organisation); ethics (duty, resource allocation); (triage (needless exposure to infection, transmission of disease); and vaccination (vaccination information, organisational readiness). Conclusion The evidence base describes the importance of pandemic planning and preparedness for emergency medical services and integrating these activities into broader public health and healthcare system plans. Although this rapid review provides a foundation to support response plans and research, it is considered ‘just in time’ for the evolving pandemic, and further work understanding research in paramedicine and pandemics is recommended.","Cavanagh, Nicola; Tavares, Walter; Taplin, John; Hall, Claire; Weiss, Dale; Blanchard, Ian",Australas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 patients with HIV-infection were included in the study. The patients underwent immunological examination and the collection of biomaterial from the posterior pharyngeal wall for microbiological examination. After obtaining the results of the examinations, PCV13 was intramuscularly administered. 7 days after the introduction of the vaccine, an assessment of adverse events was carried out, after 3 months, microbiological and immunological examinations were repeated. RESULTS: Immediately after the administration of PCV13, 5% of patients felt pain during the administration. Local reactions were reported in 6 patients. One participant showed a rise in temperature to 38.3C over 2 days. Before vaccination, 16 strains of S. pneumoniae were seeded in patients. 3 months after the administration of PCV13, pneumococcus was isolated in 8 patients. 3 months after immunization, the median level of populations and subpopulations of lymphocytes became higher than the pre-vaccination. DISCUSSION: Our results show high risk of pneumococcal infections in HIV-positive patients. A tendency towards a decrease in the level of S. pneumoniae carriage was revealed 3 months after the administration of PCV13. The high level of enterobacteria carriage in HIV-positive patients is noteworthy. There is a pronounced positive effect from the use of PCV13 in HIV-positive patients on cellular factors of the immune system. CONCLUSION: The use of PCV13 is a safe and effective method for the prevention of S. pneumoniae infections.","Zhestkov, A V; Zolotov, M O; Lyamin, A V; Borisova, O V; Chernova, O E; Limareva, L V; Ismatullin, D D",Ter Arkh,679,20

The relative resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to antibody neutralization has been recently investigated. We report that another emergent variant from Brazil, P.1, is not only refractory to multiple neutralizing monoclonal antibodies but also more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma and vaccinee sera. The magnitude of resistance is greater for monoclonal antibodies than vaccinee sera and evident with both pseudovirus and authentic P.1 virus. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of a soluble prefusion-stabilized spike reveals that the P.1 trimer adopts exclusively a conformation in which one of the receptor-binding domains is in the ""up"" position, which is known to facilitate binding to entry receptor ACE2. The functional impact of P.1 mutations thus appears to arise from local changes instead of global conformational alterations.

The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the 4 endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 CCP donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies against CoV2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a 2-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-spike titer, but that suffer from low neutralizing activity. These results suggest that analysis of coronavirus antibody fine specificities may be useful for selecting desired therapeutics and understanding the complex immune responses elicited by CoV2 infection.","Morgenlander, William R; Henson, Stephanie N; Monaco, Daniel R; Chen, Athena; Littlefield, Kirsten; Bloch, Evan M; Fujimura, Eric; Ruczinski, Ingo; Crowley, Andrew R; Natarajan, Harini; Butler, Savannah E; Weiner, Joshua A; Li, Mamie Z; Bonny, Tania S; Benner, Sarah E; Balagopal, Ashwin; Sullivan, David; Shoham, Shmuel; Quinn, Thomas C; Eshleman, Susan H; Casadevall, Arturo; Redd, Andrew D; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Ackerman, Margaret E; Pekosz, Andrew; Elledge, Stephen J; Robinson, Matthew; Tobian, Aaron Ar; Larman, H Benjamin",J. clin. invest,679,26

Radiology educators have had to rapidly adapt to a new, virtual educational landscape. We describe our experience restructuring a Trauma and Emergency Radiology Elective to an online format and present survey data obtained from students who completed the course. METHODS: This elective is a 4-week course offered to third and fourth year medical students at a large Level 1 Trauma Center. Changes to the traditional rotation included assigning an increased number of self-study educational resources, independent review of unknown cases using a virtual workstation, and online interactive conferences. At the conclusion of each block, students were asked to complete post-course feedback surveys. RESULTS: Thirteen students enrolled in this online course; 92% submitted post-course surveys. Students strongly agreed that the course was clinically relevant, with accessible, engaging material (average score, 4.92/5), and 91.7% of students were very likely to recommend this rotation to others. Students reported improved post-course confidence in ordering and interpreting imaging studies. A majority (60%) of students who had previously taken an on-site course would have preferred a course that combined traditional and online learning elements. CONCLUSIONS: The success of our online rotation highlights the merits of self-directed learning and flipped-classroom techniques.

Located within the city limits at a depth of 10 km, the earthquake generated a peak ground acceleration of more than 0.2 g and a maximum spectral acceleration of about 0.6 g at 0.1 s in the historic downtown area. The situation was particularly challenging since the event occurred amid a partial Covid-19 lockdown at temperatures close to 0 °C, emphasizing the extensive and complex vulnerability of the local communities and individuals. 27 people were reported severely injured, one of which later died. The surprisingly high economic costs, needed to achieve a full reconstruction of damaged buildings and infrastructure in the affected area, are currently evaluated at more than 10B euros. Description of the organization of the emergency response in the first days and the observed damage to buildings is given with typical examples. The focus is on the performance of older masonry residential and cultural heritage buildings in the historic downtown, their inspection and evaluation of damage to structural and non-structural components. This information provides the basis for understanding of the negative impacts and clarifies the overall context identifying the enablers and barriers to the still ongoing recovery process. It also helps to increase the awareness of the seismic vulnerability of European cities with similar construction practices.

The objective of this study is to describe the impact of COVID on the delivery of treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) from the perspectives of service providers. METHODS: Between May and September 2020, 61 service providers from 16 SUD treatment sites in California participated in virtual focus groups that lasted about an hour. We recorded the discussions and transcribed them verbatim. Two qualitative analysts independently conducted content analysis to identify themes from the transcripts. RESULTS: At the beginning of the pandemic, service providers observed a slight decrease in patient admissions, followed by an uptick in patient flow due to increased mental health issues, alcohol use, and relapse. Many of the clinics adopted flexible service delivery modes, such as curbside dosing and extended take-home medication, to enable social distancing in clinic settings. Approximately half of the clinic encounters offered telemedicime, and a considerable proportion of patients preferred to use telephone-based services rather than video-based services. Internet instability and technical difficulties limited the use of telemedicine among their patients. CONCLUSION: COVID has been challenging for SUD treatment, but health care systems rapidly reacted with adjustments that may result in long-term changes in SUD service delivery. Telemedicine-based services have played a major role in ensuring uninterrupted patient care. Providers need organizational, technical, and logistical support to improve and sustain telemedicine services that increase access to quality care for their patients.","Lin, Chunqing; Clingan, Sarah E; Cousins, Sarah J; Valdez, Jonathan; Mooney, Larissa J; Hser, Yih-Ing",J Subst Abuse Treat,679,6

We report the design and implementation of a hospital-onset COVID-19 infection (HOCI) surveillance system for an acute healthcare setting to target prevention interventions. METHODS: The study took place in a large teaching hospital group in London, UK. All patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 4th March and 14th April 2020 were included. Utilising data routinely collected through electronic healthcare systems we developed a novel surveillance system for determining and reporting HOCI incidence and providing real-time network analysis. We provided daily reports on incidence and trends over time to support HOCI investigation, and generated geo-temporal reports using network analysis to interrogate admission pathways for common epidemiological links to infer transmission chains. By working with stakeholders the reports were co-designed for end users. RESULTS: Real-time surveillance reports revealed: changing rates of HOCI throughout the course of the COVID-19 epidemic; key wards fuelling probable transmission events; HOCIs over-represented in particular specialities managing high-risk patients; the importance of integrating analysis of individual prior pathways; and the value of co-design in producing data visualisation. Our surveillance system can effectively support national surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Through early analysis of the novel surveillance system we have provided a description of HOCI rates and trends over time using real-time shifting denominator data. We demonstrate the importance of including the analysis of patient pathways and networks in characterising risk of transmission and targeting infection control interventions.","Price, James Richard; Mookerjee, Siddharth; Dyakova, Eleonora; Myall, Ashleigh; Leung, Wendy; Weiße, Andrea Yeong; Shersing, Yeeshika; Brannigan, Eimear Therese; Galletly, Tracey; Muir, David; Randell, Paul; Davies, Frances; Bolt, Frances; Barahona, Mauricio; Otter, Jonathan Ashley; Holmes, Alison H",Clin. infect. dis,679,1

METHODS: COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital between February 25 and May 2, 2020, were retrospectively included according to the following criteria: (a) COVID-19 defined as severe based on the WHO interim guidance (i.e., clinical signs of pneumonia plus respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, and/or SpO2 < 90 % on room air); (b) chest radiograph in the acute setting; (c) post-discharge unenhanced chest CT; and (d) post-discharge comprehensive PFT. Imaging findings were retrospectively evaluated in consensus by two readers, and volume of abnormal lung was measured on CT using 3D Slicer software. Differences between demographics, comorbidities, acute radiographic findings, PFT, and post-discharge clinical and laboratory data of patients with normal and abnormal CT findings were assessed by Mann-Whitney or Fisher tests, and the compromised lung volume-PFT association by Pearson correlation after removing possible outliers. RESULTS: At a median of 105 days from symptom onset, 74/91 (81 %) patients had CT abnormalities. The most common CT pattern was combined ground-glass opacity and reticular pattern (46/74, 62 %) along with architectural distortion (68/74, 92 %) and bronchial dilatation (66/74, 89 %). Compromised lung volume had a median value of 15 % [11-23], was higher in dyspneic patients, and negatively correlated with the percentage of predicted DLCO, VA, and FVC values (r = -0.39, -0.5, and -0.42, respectively). These PFT parameters were significantly lower in patients with CT abnormalities. Impairment of DLCO and KCO was found in 12 (13 %) cases, possibly implying an underlying pulmonary vasculopathy in this subgroup of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most severe COVID-19 survivors still had physiologically relevant CT abnormalities about three months after the disease onset, with an impairment of diffusion capacity on PFT. A pulmonary vasculopathy was suggested in a minor proportion of patients.","Balbi, Maurizio; Conti, Caterina; Imeri, Gianluca; Caroli, Anna; Surace, Alessandra; Corsi, Andrea; Mercanzin, Elisa; Arrigoni, Alberto; Villa, Giulia; Di Marco, Fabiano; Bonaffini, Pietro Andrea; Sironi, Sandro",Eur J Radiol,679,15

We aimed to investigate the effect (if any) of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched, while references and preprint servers were explored, for relevant articles up to December 26, 2020, to identify studies which reported on mortality and/or morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing early versus late intubation. ""Early"" was defined as intubation within 24 h from intensive care unit (ICU) admission, while ""late"" as intubation at any time after 24 h of ICU admission. All-cause mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) were the primary outcomes of the meta-analysis. Pooled risk ratio (RR), pooled mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020222147). RESULTS: A total of 12 studies, involving 8944 critically ill patients with COVID-19, were included. There was no statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality between patients undergoing early versus late intubation (3981 deaths; 45.4% versus 39.1%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99-1.15, p = 0.08). This was also the case for duration of MV (1892 patients; MD - 0.58 days, 95% CI - 3.06 to 1.89 days, p = 0.65). In a sensitivity analysis using an alternate definition of early/late intubation, intubation without versus with a prior trial of high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive mechanical ventilation was still not associated with a statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality (1128 deaths; 48.9% versus 42.5%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99-1.25, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The synthesized evidence suggests that timing of intubation may have no effect on mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients with COVID-19. These results might justify a wait-and-see approach, which may lead to fewer intubations. Relevant guidelines may therefore need to be updated.","Papoutsi, Eleni; Giannakoulis, Vassilis G; Xourgia, Eleni; Routsi, Christina; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Siempos, Ilias I",Crit Care,679,29

As cut and paste, music mash-up, and other technological forms of exchange make copying the works of others simple, the idea of plagiarism is eroding, and perhaps will eventually even be discarded. The same may be true with privacy. As with plagiarism, it was not really until the eighteenth century that our modern idea of privacy was established.

METHODS: The names of US medical schools were obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges website (nâ¯=â¯145). Institutional, hospital, and heath encyclopedia websites associated with each schools' medical center were identified using Google. Readability of COVID-19 PEMs was calculated using three validated indices: (1) Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level, (2) Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, and (3) Gunning Frequency of Gobbledygook. Content was evaluated using a scoring matrix based on materials available on the Center for Disease Control website. The Patient Education Material Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT-P) was used to assess usability and actionability. RESULTS: A total of 141 (97%) PEMs met inclusion criteria and were analyzed for readability, content, and quality. The mean readability was above the recommended sixth grade reading level (P < .001). Content was variable across PEMs. The PEMAT-P scores reflected good understandability with a median score of 83% (IQR 75%-87%), while actionability was poor with a median score of 41% (IQR 40%-60%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite availability of web-based PEMs for COVID-19, the readability was significantly higher than the National Institute of Health and US Department of Health and Human Services recommended sixth grade reading level and actionability of PEMs was low. It is critical to provide readable PEMs on COVID-19 to effectively disseminate accurate information and facilitate patients' understanding of the virus, how it spreads, and how to protect themselves.","Kruse, Jessica; Toledo, Paloma; Belton, Tayler B; Testani, Erica J; Evans, Charlesnika T; Grobman, William A; Miller, Emily S; Lange, Elizabeth M S",Am. j. infect. control,679,4

These alterations may be presumed on the basis of the following two observations. Firstly, the virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 infection uses an important renin-angiotensin system (RAS) element - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - as a receptor protein for entry into target cells and, in consequence, disturbs the function of the main (circulating) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and of the local renin-angiotensin system localized in different tissues and organs. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 leads to the downregulation of this enzyme and, in the aftermath, to the excess of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Thus, in the later stage of COVID-19 infection, the beneficial effects of ACEI and ARB could be presumed. It is hypothesized that the local RAS dysregulation in the adipose tissue is the main cause of the negative role of obesity as a risk factor of severe outcome of the COVID-19 infection. Secondly, the outcome of COVID-19 strongly depends on the age of the patient. Age-related hormonal deficiencies, especially those of melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone, may contribute to morbidity/mortality in older people. The usefulness of melatonin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (the latter only in later phases of the infection) as adjuvant drugs is probable but needs thorough clinical trials.","Pawlikowski, Marek; Winczyk, Katarzyna",Endokrynol Pol,679,29

A majority of respondents (53%) reported wanting to see more resident life and culture content on SM. Of the existing PRS SM content, respondents were most interested in resident lifestyle, followed by clinical and program-specific content. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic amplified the importance of SM PRS residency selection. Resident lifestyle content was consistently indicated as more likely to make respondents gain interest in a program, rank a program higher, and as the most desired content. PRS programs will benefit from highlighting resident camaraderie, quality of life, hobbies, and lifestyle to attract applicants.","Duque, Sofia; Riccelli, Vincent; Mulqueen, Sydney; Zhang, Andrew Y",Aesthet. surg. j,679,4

METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study. Adult COVID-19 cases from four hospitals in Zhejiang were enrolled and clustered into three groups based on epidemiological history. First-generation patients had a travel history to Hubei within 14 days before disease onset; second-generation patients had a contact history with first-generation patients; third-generation patients had a contact history with second-generation patients. Demographic, clinical characteristics, clinical outcomes and duration of viral shedding were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients were enrolled, with 83, 44 and 44 patients in the first-, second-, and third-generation, respectively. Compared with the first and second generations, third-generation patients were older (61.3 vs. 48.3 and 44.0 years, p < 0.001) and had more coexisting conditions (56.8% vs. 36.1% and 27.3%, p 0.013). At 7 ± 1 days from illness onset, third-generation patients had lower lymphocyte (0.6 vs. 0.8 and 0.8 × 109/L, p 0.007), higher C-reactive protein (29.7 vs. 17.1 and 13.8 mg/L, p 0.018) and D-dimer (1066 vs. 412.5 and 549 µg/L, p 0.002) and more lesions involving the pulmonary lobes (lobes &#8805;5, 81.8% vs. 53.0% and 34.1%, p < 0.001).

Although SARSCoV-2 causes primarily respiratory problems, concurrent cardiac injury cannot be ignored since it may be an independent predictor for adverse outcomes. To resolve these issues, we aim to summarize the prevalence and its underlying mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: The main clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is pneumonia, cardiovascular complications have also been identified in the earliest reported cases from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Given the SARS-CoV-2 likely uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as its host receptor, ACE2-related signaling pathways may play a key role in mediating myocardial injury. SARS-CoV-2 infection related acute cardiac injury cannot be ignored, and its underlying mechanisms remain speculated. We would suggest that health professionals investigate cardiac function as part of the routine care.","Wang, Yueying; Roever, Leonardo; Tse, Gary; Liu, Tong",Curr Atheroscler Rep,679,14

The purpose of this study was to evaluate how COVID-19 has affected AAHKS industry partners and the surgeon-industry relationship, emphasizing education, resource allocation, and strategic direction for the second half of 2020. METHODS: AAHKS industry partners were contacted to participate in a blinded survey and optional interview with the AAHKS Industry Relations Committee. Based on the results, a group of AAHKS member surgeons with disparate practice types were asked to postulate on how the COVID-19 pandemic has and will affect their practice and relationship with Industry. RESULTS: AAHKS industry partner responses indicated decreased resource allocation for regional, ""other national,"" and AAHKS annual meetings (67%, 55%, and 30%, respectively). Web-based educational content was expected to increase in 2020 and will likely remain a point of emphasis in 2021 (100% and 70% of responders). For Q3/Q4 2020, a significant emphasis was placed on site of service/outpatient TJA and COVID-19-related safety measures (70% and 90% of responders), as well as increased availability of instrumentation and implants (40% and 60%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the orthopedic landscape for the foreseeable future. Survey responses by AAHKS industry partners demonstrate a continued commitment to surgeon education with an increasing shift to a web-based platform. Increased resource allocation for outpatient TJA and COVID-19-related safety measures were significant. Articulating optimal mechanisms to aid industry in supporting surgeons with different practice models to meet demand during the second half of fiscal year 2020 will be critical.","Warth, Lucian C; Noiseux, Nicolas O; Duncan, Stephen T; Daines, S Bradley; Mahoney, Craig R",J Arthroplasty,679,16

A questionnaire method was used to select 449 Chinese respondents on an online platform; the questionnaire includes a health consciousness scale, health life goal scale, perceived behavioral control scale, and the home-based exercise scale. A T-test was used to conduct differential analysis. The hierarchical regression analysis method was used to examine the relationship between health consciousness and home-based exercise, and the Hayes' SPSS PROCESS macro was used to test mediating effect. The results show that there are significant differences in home-based exercise with respect to gender, age, and marital status. Health consciousness has a significant positive effect on home-based exercise. Perceived behavioral control acts as the mediator between health consciousness and home-based exercise. Health consciousness can influence home-based exercise through health life goals and perceived behavioral control in turn. This paper takes a home-based exercise survey, and expands the theoretical research of home-based exercise. The findings suggest that people should pay attention to promoting the transformation of health consciousness into home-based exercise.

The overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also uses ACE2 as the cell receptor4. Structural analysis identified residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that are essential for ACE2 binding, the majority of which either are highly conserved or share similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly indicate convergent evolution between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs for improved binding to ACE2, although SARS-CoV-2 does not cluster within SARS and SARS-related coronaviruses1-3,5.

The results were scrutinized through triangulation and source triangulation techniques. The results show that students have the view that the arrival of COVID-19 has taught humans to behave friendly to the climate because with the presence of COVID-19, students are no longer at campus, lecturers and campus officers. This method is classified as an action to reduce glass emissions as a cause of global warming. In addition, energy and water are used very little and even at the beginning of the lockdown, these natural resources were not used, thereby educating people to save energy and water through the campus.

The contributions of this paper are two-fold: the effects of an experimented teaching strategy, i.e. multi-course project-based learning (MPL) approach, are presented followed with online assessment techniques investigation for senior level electrical engineering (EE) courses at Qatar University. The course project of the senior course was designed in such a way that it helps in simultaneously attaining the objectives of the senior and capstone courses, that the students were taking at the same time. It is known that the MPL approach enhances the critical thinking capacity of students which is also a major outcome of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The developed project ensures the fulfillment of a series of SLOs, that are concentrated on soft engineering and project management skills. The difficulties of adopting the MPL method for the senior level courses are in aligning the project towards fulfilling the learning outcomes of every individual course. The study also provides the students feedback on online assessment techniques incorporated with the MPL, due to online teaching during COVID-19 pandemic. In order to provide a benchmark and to highlight the obtained results, the innovative teaching approaches were compared to conventional methods taught on the same senior course in a previous semester. Based on the feedback from teachers and students from previously conducted case study it was believed that the MPL approach would support the students. With the statistical analysis (Chi-square, two-tailed T statistics and hypothesis testing using z-test) it can be concluded that the MPL and online assessment actually help to achieve better attainment of the SLOs, even during a pandemic situation.","Khandakar, Amith; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

It has also increased the suicide rate in vulnerable groups who cannot handle the social and psychological consequences of the pandemic and the measures in place to halt it. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compared the lethality of suicide attempts and the methods chosen between the three months before the COVID-19 pandemic and three months during curfew and lockdown in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This is a retrospective, causal-comparative study conducted at King Saud Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 62 suicide attempt cases between January 2020 and June 2020 were included in this study. The scale for assessment of the lethality of suicide attempts (SALSA) was used for comparison, and cross-tabulation was used for the data of suicide methods. RESULTS: There was a significant difference (P = 0.003) in the total SALSA score before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. The scores of lethality of suicide attempts were high during the lockdown. No significant difference was found in the suicide methods selected between the two time periods. However, the use of psychotropic medication overdose and self-immolation were prominent during the lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely associated with increased lethality of suicide attempts as well as an increased suicide rate. The development of appropriate mental health services is required.","Almaghrebi, Asma H",Current pediatric reviews (Online),679,20

DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, an online-based anonymous survey was conducted from April 2th to April 16th 2020. SETTING: The survey was conducted among 15.0000 of 18.000 orthopedic and trauma surgeons in Germany, both in private practices and hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: All members of the German Society of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (DGOU) and the Professional Association for Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (BVOU). were invited by e-mail to participate in the survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Out of 50 questions 42 were designed to enquire a certain dimension of the pandemic impact and contribute to one of six indices, namely ""Preparedness"", ""Resources"", ""Reduction"", ""Informedness"", ""Concern"", and ""Depletion"". Data was analyzed in multiple stepwise regression, aiming to identify those factors that independently influenced the indices. RESULTS: 858 orthopedic and trauma surgeons participated in the survey throughout Germany. In the multiple regression analysis, being employed at a hospital was identified as an independent positive predictor in the indices for ""Preparedness"", ""Resources"", and ""Informedness"" and an independent negative predictor regarding ""Depletion"". Self-employment was found to be an independent positive predictor of the financial index ""Depletion"". Female surgeons were identified as an independent variable for a higher level of ""Concern"". CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms a distinct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic and trauma surgery in Germany. The containment measures are largely considered appropriate despite severe financial constraints. A substantial lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) is reported. The multiple regression analysis shows that self-employed surgeons are more affected by this shortage as well as by the financial consequences than surgeons working in hospitals. WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic has a profound impact on orthopedic and trauma surgery as an unrelated specialty. Self-employed surgeons are affected especially by a shortage of PPE and financial consequences. HOW MIGHT IT IMPACT ON CLINICAL PRACTICE IN THE NEAR FUTURE: Political and financial support can now be applied more focused to subgroups in the field of orthopedics and trauma surgery with an increased demand for support. A special emphasis should be set on the support of self-employed surgeons which are a more affected by the shortage of PPE and financial consequences than surgeons working in hospitals.","Randau, Thomas M; Jaenisch, Max; Haffer, Henryk; Schömig, Friederike; Kasapovic, Adnan; Olejniczak, Katharina; Flechtenmacher, Johannes; Perka, Carsten; Wirtz, Dieter C; Pumberger, Matthias",PLoS One,679,26

Food emulsion gels have application value and prospects in food 3D printing due to their promising properties, including biodegradability, biocompatibility, as well as dual characteristics of emulsions and biopolymer gels. Food emulsion gels with appropriate mechanical properties, as a new type of food inks, expand the types and functions of the inks. However, food emulsion gels without adequate reinforced mechanical properties may suffer from defects in shape, texture, mouthfeel, and functionality during 3D printing and subsequent applications. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the strategies to improve the mechanical properties of food emulsion gels. According to the methods of characterizing the mechanical properties of emulsion gels, this article summarizes four strategies for improving the mechanical properties of emulsion gels through two ways: inside-out (reinforcement of interface and reinforcement of cross-linking) and outside-in (physical approaches and environmental regulations), as well as their basic mechanisms. The application status and future research trends of emulsion gels in food 3D printing are finally discussed.","Li, Xueqing; Fan, Liuping; Liu, Yuanfa; Li, Jinwei",Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,679,15

This review discusses the invaluable insight revealed from vaccine clinical trials in women who were vaccinated and inadvertently became pregnant during the trial period. It further explores a number of clinical avenues in their management and proposes a drug development strategy in line with clinical trials for vaccines and drug treatments for the drug development community. Little is known of the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the mother and the baby. Our hypothesis that COVID-19 predisposes pregnant women to pre-eclampsia or hypertensive disorders during pregnancy is supported by a clinical study, and this may also adversely impact a woman's cardiovascular disease risk later in life. It may also increase a woman's risk of pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancy. This is an ever-evolving landscape, and early knowledge for healthcare providers and drug innovators is offered to ensure benefits outweigh the risks.

We compared clinical characteristics, symptoms, and outcomes of adults presenting to hospital during the pandemic first wave, who tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Detailed patient data was obtained from a large, controlled, non-randomised trial of molecular point-of-care testing versus laboratory RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in adults presenting to a large UK hospital with suspected COVID-19. RESULTS: 1054 patients were included: 352 (33.4%) tested positive and 702 (66.6%) negative. 13.4% (47/352) COVID-19-positive patients had COPD versus 18.7% (131/702) of COVID-19-negative patients (difference=5.3% [95%CI -9.7% to -0.5%], pâ¯=â¯0.0297). 5.7% (20/352) of COVID-19-positive patients were smokers versus 16.5% (116/702) of negative patients (difference=-10.8% [-14.4% to -7.0%], pâ¯=â¯0.0001). 70.5% (248/352) of COVID-19-positive patients were White-British versus 85.5% (600/702) of negative patients (difference=-15.0% [-20.5% to -9.7%], p<0.0001). 20.9% (39/187) of COVID-19-positive patients were healthcare workers versus 5.2% (15/287) of negative patients (p<0.0001).

This study presents changes in CO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 based on their anomalies during the COVID-19 partial (Phase 2) and total (Phase 3) lockdowns in Mexico City (MCMA). To minimise the impact of the air pollutant long-term trends, pollutant anomalies were calculated using as baseline truncated Fourier series, fitted with data from 2016 to 2019, and then compared with those from the lockdown. Additionally, days with stagnant conditions and heavy rain were excluded to reduce the impact of extreme weather changes. Satellite observations for NO2 and CO were used to contrast the ground-based derived results. During the lockdown Phase 2, only NO2 exhibited significant decreases (p < 0.05) of between 10 and 23% due to reductions in motor vehicle emissions. By contrast, O3 increased (p < 0.05) between 16 and 40% at the same sites where NO2 decreased. During Phase 3, significant decreases (p < 0.05) were observed for NO2 (43%), PM10 (20%), and PM2.5 (32%) in response to the total lockdown. Although O3 concentrations were lower in Phase 3 than during Phase 2, those did not decrease (p < 0.05) from the baseline at any site despite the total lockdown. SO2 decreased only during Phase 3 in a near-road environment. Satellite observations confirmed that NO2 decreased and CO stabilised during the total lockdown. Air pollutant changes during the lockdown could be overestimated between 2 and 10-fold without accounting for the influences of meteorology and long-term trends in pollutant concentrations. Air quality improved significantly during the lockdown driven by reduced NO2 and PM2.5 emissions despite increases in O3, resulting in health benefits for the MCMA population. A health assessment conducted suggested that around 588 deaths related to air pollution exposure were averted during the lockdown. Our results show that to reduce O3 within the MCMA, policies must focus on reducing VOCs emissions from non-mobile sources. The measures implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns provide valuable information to reduce air pollution through a range of abatement strategies for emissions other than from motor vehicles.","Hernández-Paniagua, Iván Y; Valdez, S Ivvan; Almanza, Victor; Rivera-Cárdenas, Claudia; Grutter, Michel; Stremme, Wolfgang; García-Reynoso, Agustín; Ruiz-Suárez, Luis Gerardo",Front Public Health,679,19

The sudden shift to virtual meetings due to the COVID pandemic has been arguably the most dramatic change since inception of the MDT. No studies have evaluated the Head and Neck MDT since this change in working. Methods A preliminary questionnaire was designed and trialled based upon published guidance of MDT qualities and measurable outcomes as per published national guidelines. A questionnaire was then distributed to all Head and Neck MDTs in the UK. Results We obtained 97 individual responses, from 27 units. Our results indicate that most clinicians (70.1%) felt that the decision making was unchanged. Most (84.5%) respondents also felt that technology resources were satisfactory and that some aspects of communication (viewing of images and slides) were as good or improved (76.3%). However, there were notable deficiencies with remote working. In particular, a majority of respondents perceived worse engagement (43.9%), team working (69.1%) and training (47.7%) since moving to remote meetings. Conclusions Our study suggests a mixed opinion of virtual MDTs. Our results demonstrate that despite remote working, head and neck MDT participants feel they have largely been able to perform in most indicators. However, we should consider solutions to the perceived engagement, training, teamwork and communication deficiencies of remote working. This is the first study to evaluate virtual Head and Neck MDTs and is the largest study of virtual MDTs and remote working within healthcare.","Mohamedbhai, Hussein Fernando Sancia Ubhi Harmony Chana Simran Visavadia Bhavin",British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,679,27

Tens to hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per gene were identified using next generation sequencing. Associations with different phenotypes were assessed by chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. SNPs of one functional and one positional candidate (NCR1 and SLX4IP, respectively) and haplotypes of four genes (SNX5, NCR2, SLX4IP, NCR1) were associated with FCoV shedding at pcorected < 0.01. Highly significant associations were observed for extreme phenotypes (persistent/high-intensity shedders and non-shedders) suggesting that there are two major phenotypes associated with different genotypes, highly susceptible cats permanently shedding high amounts of viral particles and resistant non-shedders.","Bubenikova, Jana; Vrabelova, Jana; Stejskalova, Karla; Futas, Jan; Plasil, Martin; Cerna, Petra; Oppelt, Jan; Lobova, Dana; Molinkova, Dobromila; Horin, Petr",,679,26

Recently, microelectrode-dot-array (MEDA) biochips have been proposed to advance microfluidics technology. A MEDA biochip manipulates droplets of nano/picoliter volumes to automatically execute biochemical protocols. During bioassay execution, droplets are transported in parallel to achieve high-throughput outcomes. However, a major concern associated with the use of MEDA biochips is microelectrode degradation over time. Recent work has shown that formulating droplet transportation as a reinforcement-learning (RL) problem enables the training of policies to capture the underlying health conditions of microelectrodes and ensure reliable fluidic operations. However, the above RL-based approach suffers from two key limitations: 1) it cannot be used for concurrent transportation of multiple droplets;2) it requires the availability of CCD cameras for monitoring droplet movement. To overcome these problems, we present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) droplet-routing solution that can be used for various sizes of MEDA biochips with integrated sensors, and we demonstrate the reliable execution of a serial-dilution bioassay with the MARL droplet router on a fabricated MEDA biochip. To facilitate further research, we also present a simulation environment based on the PettingZoo Gym Interface for MARL-guided droplet-routing problems on MEDA biochips.","Liang, T.

Countries must stop OPV use to end all cases of poliomyelitis, including vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) and cases caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) coordinated global cessation of all type 2 OPV (OPV2) use in routine immunization in 2016 but did not successfully end the transmission of type 2 VDPVs (VDPV2s), and consequently continues to use type 2 OPV (OPV2) for outbreak response activities. Using an updated global poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model, we characterize outbreak response options for 2019-2029 related to responding to VDPV2 outbreaks with a genetically stabilized novel OPV (nOPV2) strain or with the currently licensed monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2). Given uncertainties about the properties of nOPV2, we model different assumptions that appear consistent with the evidence on nOPV2 to date. Using nOPV2 to respond to detected cases may reduce the expected VDPV and VAPP cases and the risk of needing to restart OPV2 use in routine immunization compared to mOPV2 use for outbreak response. The actual properties, availability, and use of nOPV2 will determine its effects on type 2 poliovirus transmission in populations. Even with optimal nOPV2 performance, countries and the GPEI would still likely need to restart OPV2 use in routine immunization in OPV-using countries if operational improvements in outbreak response to stop the transmission of cVDPV2s are not implemented effectively.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Pallansch, Mark A; Wilkinson, Amanda; Bandyopadhyay, Ananda S; Konopka-Anstadt, Jennifer L; Burns, Cara C; Oberste, M Steven; Wassilak, Steven G F; Badizadegan, Kamran; Thompson, Kimberly M",Risk anal,679,1

Although the mortality rate of COVID-19 is low, the high numbers of infected people and those with post-COVID-19 symptoms represent a real problem for the health system. A high number of patients with COVID-19 or people recovered from COVID-19 suffer from a dry cough and/or myalgia. Interestingly, an imbalance in bradykinin was observed in COVID-19 patients, which might be due to the accumulation of bradykinin as a result of a reduction in the degradation of bradykinin. This finding inspired the idea of possible similitude between the dry cough that is induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the COVID-19-induced dry cough. Both of these types of cough are mediated, at least partially, by bradykinin. They both manifested as a persistent dry cough that is not responded to traditional dry cough remedies. However, several drugs were previously investigated for the treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced dry cough. Here, we hypothesized that such treatment might be useful in COVID-19-induced dry cough and other bradykinin-related symptoms such as generalized pain and myalgia. In this article, evidence was presented to support the use of indomethacin as a potential treatment of COVID-19-induced dry cough. The choice of indomethacin was based on its ability to suppress the cyclooxygenase enzyme while also lowering the level of the inflammatory mediator bradykinin. Furthermore, indomethacin has been shown to be effective in treating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced dry cough. Moreover, indomethacin is a long-established, low-cost, effective, and readily available medication.","Alkotaji, Myasar; Al-Zidan, Radhwan N",Curr Pharmacol Rep,679,15

We illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates can be biased.MethodsWe used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates, we obtained the serial interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers.ResultsThe mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.78-6.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95% CrI: 3.01-4.91) for Tianjin. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95% CrI: 32-67) for Singapore and 62% (95% CrI: 50-76) for Tianjin. Reproduction number estimates based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information.ConclusionHigh estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, quarantine and other containment measures were already in place at the time of data collection, which may inflate the proportion of infections from pre-symptomatic individuals.","Ganyani, Tapiwa; Kremer, Cécile; Chen, Dongxuan; Torneri, Andrea; Faes, Christel; Wallinga, Jacco; Hens, Niel",Euro surveill,679,15

Pinpointing which genes and genomic regions are underlying phenotypic variability thus helps to understand the processes of acclimation and adaptation. We used Daphnia as a system to identify candidates playing a role in phenotypic variation related to a predation risk environment with a genome-wide association approach. Furthermore, a gene co-expression network analysis allowed identifying clusters of co-expressed genes which correlated to life history traits. To enhance the understanding of the functional roles of the transcripts, we identified orthologs and paralogs from related species and used ontologies to annotate the candidates of interest. Our study revealed that only one life history trait and two morphometric traits have a genetic association in the presence of predation risk (fish kairomones), while most genotype-phenotype associations were detected in a genotype-environment interaction analysis for reproduction-related phenotypic traits. The gene co-expression network analysis identified a total of 44 modules, of which one module correlated to another life history trait namely the 'total number of broods'. The combined use of gene co-expression network and transcriptome-wide association analysis allowed the identification of 131 candidate transcripts associated to life history traits in Daphnia galeata.

Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed. This is the second edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of all treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We planned to conduct aggregate data meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Our systematic review was based on PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines, and our eight-step procedure for better validation of clinical significance of meta-analysis results. We performed both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. According to the number of outcome comparisons, we adjusted our threshold for significance to p = 0.033. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We searched relevant databases and websites for published and unpublished trials until November 2, 2020. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial methodology. We included 82 randomized clinical trials enrolling a total of 40,249 participants. 81 out of 82 trials were at overall high risk of bias. Meta-analyses showed no evidence of a difference between corticosteroids versus control on all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.00; p = 0.05; I2 = 23.1%; eight trials; very low certainty), on serious adverse events (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; p = 0.04; I2 = 39.1%; eight trials; very low certainty), and on mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.33; p = 0.49; I2 = 55.3%; two trials; very low certainty). The fixed-effect meta-analyses showed indications of beneficial effects. Trial sequential analyses showed that the required information size for all three analyses was not reached. Meta-analysis (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; p = 0.31; I2 = 0%; four trials; moderate certainty) and trial sequential analysis (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could reject that remdesivir versus control reduced the risk of death by 20%. Meta-analysis (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.00; p = 0.05; I2 = 38.9%; four trials; very low certainty) and trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed no evidence of difference between remdesivir versus control on serious adverse events. Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed indications of a beneficial effect of remdesivir on serious adverse events. Meta-analysis (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.87; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%; two trials; very low certainty) showed evidence of a beneficial effect of intravenous immunoglobulin versus control on all-cause mortality, but trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result was severely underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Meta-analysis (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.14; p = 0.12; I2 = 77.4%; five trials; very low certainty) and trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed no evidence of a difference between tocilizumab versus control on serious adverse events. Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed indications of a beneficial effect of tocilizumab on serious adverse events. Meta-analysis (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%; three trials; very low certainty) showed evidence of a beneficial effect of tocilizumab versus control on mechanical ventilation, but trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result was severely underpowered to confirm of reject realistic intervention effects. Meta-analysis (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.69; p < 0.00; I2 = 0%; two trials; very low certainty) showed evidence of a beneficial effect of bromhexine versus standard care on non-serious adverse events, but trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result was severely underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could reject that hydroxychloroquine versus control reduced the risk of death and serious adverse events by 20%. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could reject that lopinavir-ritonavir versus control reduced the risk of death, serious adverse events, and mechanical ventilation by 20%. All remaining outcome comparisons showed that we did not have enough information to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Nine single trials showed statistically significant results on our outcomes, but were underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Due to lack of data, it was not relevant to perform network meta-analysis or possible to perform individual patient data meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence-based treatment for COVID-19 currently exists. Very low certainty evidence indicates that corticosteroids might reduce the risk of death, serious adverse events, and mechanical ventilation; that remdesivir might reduce the risk of serious adverse events; that intravenous immunoglobin might reduce the risk of death and serious adverse events; that tocilizumab might reduce the risk of serious adverse events and mechanical ventilation; and that bromhexine might reduce the risk of non-serious adverse events. More trials with low risks of bias and random errors are urgently needed. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of COVID-19.

We find that with clever strategies, one is able to achieve a 26-fold gain on an initial investment by betting on NBA underdogs during this time period.","Qureshi, Khizar; Zaman, Tauhid",,679,30

The purpose of this review is to highlight importance of primordial and primary prevention beginning early in the life course. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for primordial and primary prevention support importance of individual/clinical and population-based approaches to CVD prevention beginning early in life with goal of reducing the risk and burden of CVD. Substantial evidence supports the individual and societal benefits of prevention of CVD and promotion of optimal cardiovascular health beginning early in life and extending across the life course and the need for additional research to guide and inform practices and policies enabling optimal cardiovascular health for all.","Hayman, Laura L",Curr Cardiol Rep,679,1

However, the introduction of a new technology into an already complex system creates new challenges that have the potential to negatively impact patient and provider experience. We aimed to use a human factors approach (the science concerned with understanding the interactions between humans and other elements in a complex system) to identify where systemic vulnerabilities may exist throughout the patient/provider experience with telemedicine. Methods: A total of 23 patients scheduled for telemedicine consults were observed during visits with providers. A trained human factors observer documented disruptions to system efficiency (eg communication breakdowns, connectivity problems and interruptions) and invited patients and providers to take a survey investigating perceptions of telemedicine technology usability, satisfaction with the experience and opportunities to improve the process. Results: Visits lasted an average of 17 minutes, 20 seconds and each visit had an average of 6 disruptions. Inefficiencies were categorized into 13 categories consisting mainly of interruptions (21, 15.22%), Internet connectivity issues (21, 15.22%), nonoptimal device setup (19, 13.77%) and repeat communication (18, 13.04%). Provider satisfaction with the system was 3.72/5.00 and perceived usability was 63.15 (68 is considered acceptable). Patient satisfaction was 4.80/5.00 and perceived usability was 85. Conclusions: These findings highlight opportunities for a multifaceted intervention, including the development of an informational sheet/video for patients, a telemedicine ""best practices"" guideline for physicians, a standardized training process and checklist for front office staff and an in-service training for the entire care team.","Cohen, T.

However, the causality between these conditions remains to be determined. Methods This study sought to investigate the bidirectional causal relations of AD with COVID-19 using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Results We found that genetically predicted AD was significantly associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 3.329; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.139-9.725; P=0.028). It's interesting that genetically predicted severe COVID-19 was also significantly associated with higher risk of AD (OR, 1.004; 95% CI, 1.001-1.007; P=0.018). In addition, the two strong genetic variants associated with severe COVID-19 was associated with higher AD risk (OR, 1.018; 95% CI, 1.003-1.034; P=0.018). There is no evidence to support that genetically predicted AD was significantly associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, and vice versa. No obvious pleiotropy bias and heterogeneity were observed. Conclusion Overall, AD may causally affect severe COVID-19, and vice versa, performing bidirectional regulation through independent biological pathways.","Liu, D.; Zhang, X.; Cao, W.; Zhang, J.; Song, M.; Xing, W.; Wang, W.; Meng, Q.; Wang, Y.",,679,20

Examples include established viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of respiratory infection in infants and young children, and emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which reached near pandemic levels in 2003, or H1N1 (swine) influenza. Despite this prevalence, traditional methods of virus detection are typically labor intensive and require several days to successfully confirm infection. Recently, however, nanoparticle‐based detection strategies have been employed in an effort to develop detection assays that are both sensitive and expedient. Each of these platforms capitalizes on the unique properties of nanoparticles for the detection of respiratory viruses. In this article, several nanoparticle‐based scaffolds are discussed.Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been functionalized with virus specific antibodies or oligonucleotides. In each of these constructs, AuNPs act as both an easily conjugated scaffolding system for biological molecules and a powerful fluorescence quencher. AuNPs have also been immobilized and used as electrochemical transducers. They efficiently serve as a conducting interface of electrocatalyic activity making them a powerful tool in this application. Quantum dots (QDs) posses unique fluorescence properties that have also been explored for their application to virus detection when combined with direct antibody conjugation or streptavidin‐biotin binding systems. QDs have an advantage over many traditional fluorophores because their fluorescence properties can be finely tuned and they are resistant to photobleaching. The development of these nanoparticle‐based detection strategies holds the potential to be a powerful method to quickly and easily confirm respiratory virus infection.

We analyzed 6 independent groups of clonally related severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies from 5 individuals shortly after infection and later in convalescence to determine the impact of maturation over months. In addition to increased affinity and neutralization potency, antibody evolution changed the mutational pathways for the acquisition of viral resistance and restricted neutralization escape options. For some antibodies, maturation imposed a requirement for multiple substitutions to enable escape. For certain antibodies, affinity maturation enabled the neutralization of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and heterologous sarbecoviruses. Antibody-antigen structures revealed that these properties resulted from substitutions that allowed additional variability at the interface with the RBD. These findings suggest that increasing antibody diversity through prolonged or repeated antigen exposure may improve protection against diversifying SARS-CoV-2 populations, and perhaps against other pandemic threat coronaviruses.","Muecksch, Frauke; Weisblum, Yiska; Barnes, Christopher O.; Schmidt, Fabian; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Wang, Zijun; C.

Vaccines have been developed in unprecedented time and hesitancy towards vaccination among the general population is unclear. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies using large nationally representative samples (n[≥]1000) to examine the percentage of the population intending to vaccinate, unsure, or intending to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine when available. Generic inverse meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to pool estimates and examine time trends. PubMed, Scopus and pre-printer servers were searched from January-November, 2020. Registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020223132). Findings: Twenty-eight nationally representative samples (n = 58,656) from 13 countries indicate that as the pandemic has progressed, the percentage of people intending to vaccinate and refuse vaccination have been decreasing and increasing respectively. Pooled data from surveys conducted during June-October suggest that 60% (95% CI: 49% to 69%) intend to vaccinate and 20% (95% CI: 13% to 29%) intend to refuse vaccination, although intentions vary substantially between samples and countries (I2 > 90%). Being female, younger, of lower income or education level and belonging to an ethnic minority group were consistently associated with being less likely to intend to vaccinate. Findings were consistent across higher vs. lower quality studies. Interpretation: Intentions to be vaccinated when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available have been declining globally and there is an urgent need to address social inequalities in vaccine hesitancy and promote widespread uptake of vaccines as they become available.

Physical activities are worthwhile for health, well-being, improved fitness levels, lower mental pressure and tension levels. Nonetheless, during high-power and commanding workouts, there is a high likelihood that physical fitness is seriously influenced. Jarring motions and improper posture during workouts can lead to temporary or permanent disability. With the advent of technological advances, activity acknowledgment dependent on wearable sensors has pulled in countless studies. Still, a fully portable smart fitness suite is not industrialized, which is the central need of today’s time, especially in the Covid-19 pandemic. Considering the effectiveness of this issue, we proposed a fully portable smart fitness suite for the household to carry on their routine exercises without any physical gym trainer and gym environment. The proposed system considers two exercises, i.e., T-bar and bicep curl with the assistance of the virtual real-time android application, acting as a gym trainer overall. The proposed fitness suite is embedded with a gyroscope and EMG sensory modules for performing the above two exercises. It provided alerts on unhealthy, wrong posture movements over an android app and is guided to the best possible posture based on sensor values. The KNN classification model is used for prediction and guidance for the user while performing a particular exercise with the help of an android application-based virtual gym trainer through a text-to-speech module.

The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus that belongs to the family of Coronaviruses which are known to cause a wide spectrum of diseases both in humans and animals. One of the characteristic features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the high reproductive rate (R(0)) that results in high transmissibility of the virus among humans. Vaccines are the best option to prevent and control this disease. Though, the traditional intramuscular (IM) route of vaccine administration is one of the effective methods for induction of antibody response, a needle-free self-administrative intradermal (ID) immunization will be easier for SARS-CoV-2 infection containment, as vaccine administration method will limit human contacts. Here, we have assessed the humoral and cellular responses of a RBD-based peptide immunogen when administered intradermally in BALB/c mice and side-by-side compared with the intramuscular immunization route. The results demonstrate that ID vaccination is well tolerated and triggered a significant magnitude of humoral antibody responses as similar to IM vaccination. Additionally, the ID immunization resulted in higher production of IFN-γ and IL-2 suggesting superior cellular response as compared to IM route. Overall, our data indicates immunization through ID route provides a promising alternative approach for the development of self-administrative SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.","Yadav, Naveen; Vishwakarma, Preeti; Khatri, Ritika; Siddqui, Gazala; Awasthi, Amit; Ahmed, Shubbir; Samal, Sweety",Microbes Infect,679,1

In addition, M. pneumoniae can simultaneously or sequentially lead to damage in the nervous system and has been associated with a wide variety of other acute and chronic diseases. During the past 10 years, the proportion of LRTI in children and adults, associated with M. pneumoniae infection has ranged from 0 to more than 50%. This variation is due to the age and the geographic location of the population examined but also due to the diagnostic methods used. The true role of M. pneumoniae in RTIs remains a challenge given the many limitations and lack of standardization of the applied diagnostic tool in most cases, with resultant wide variations in data from different studies. Correct and rapid diagnosis and/or management of M. pneumoniae infections is, however, critical to initiate appropriate antibiotic treatment and is nowadays usually done by PCR and/or serology. Several recent reviews, have summarized current methods for the detection and identification of M. pneumoniae.
